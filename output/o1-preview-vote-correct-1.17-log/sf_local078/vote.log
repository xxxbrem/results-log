After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that the correct SQL script is:

```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reason:**

- The SQL script in `1result.sql` correctly identifies the top 10 and bottom 10 interest categories based on their highest composition values across all months.
- It retrieves the maximum composition value for each interest category and then selects the corresponding time (`month_year`) when this maximum occurred.
- The script joins the `INTEREST_METRICS` and `INTEREST_MAP` tables to obtain the interest names.
- It ensures that float values are rounded to 4 decimal places, as per the instruction.
- The final result displays the time in `MM-YYYY` format, the interest name, and the composition value, ordered appropriately.

Therefore, `1result.sql` is the correct SQL script that fulfills the requirements.
