After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **2result.sql** is the correct query. This SQL query accurately retrieves the titles, artist names, mediums, and original image URLs of objects satisfying all the specified conditions:

- The objects have 'Photograph' in their names.
- They belong to the 'Photographs' department.
- The artist is not 'Unknown'.
- The object end date is 1839 or earlier.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
