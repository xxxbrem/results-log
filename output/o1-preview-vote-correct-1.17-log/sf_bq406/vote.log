After reviewing and comparing the SQL queries and their corresponding results, the correct answer is:

```plain
2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Accuracy of Calculations:**
   - All three SQL queries aim to calculate the growth rates for various demographic groups from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce.
   - They all correctly select the data for the overall workforce for the years 2014 and 2024.
   - The growth rates are calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Growth Rate} = \frac{\text{Value in 2024} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}}
     \]
   - The calculations in **`2result.sql`** correctly implement this formula for all demographic groups.

2. **Presentation of Results:**
   - **`2result.sql`** presents the growth rates as percentages by multiplying the result by 100, making it more intuitive and easier to interpret.
   - The growth rates are consistently rounded to four decimal places, as specified.

3. **Clarity and Consistency:**
   - The demographic group names are clearly labeled, matching the requested groups.
   - The growth rates are presented in a straightforward manner, directly showing the percentage increase or decrease.

4. **SQL Query Structure:**
   - The query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to separately fetch data for the years 2014 and 2024, ensuring that only relevant data is used in the calculations.
   - It performs a CROSS JOIN between the 2014 and 2024 datasets, allowing for direct comparison between the two years.
   - Each demographic group's growth rate is calculated individually, enhancing readability and maintainability.

5. **Adherence to Requirements:**
   - **`2result.sql`** ensures that float values are rounded to four decimal places.
   - The results align with the data provided earlier, confirming the accuracy of the calculations.

**Comparison with Other SQL Queries:**

- **`0result.sql`** and **`1result.sql`** also perform similar calculations, but they present the growth rates as decimal fractions rather than percentages. While mathematically correct, percentages are generally more interpretable for growth rates.
- **`1result.sql`** labels some demographic groups differently (e.g., 'Asian' instead of 'Asians', 'Latinx' instead of 'Latinx people'), which might not fully match the requested group labels.
- **`2result.sql`** fully meets the requirement of presenting growth rates in percentages, with clear labeling and adherence to rounding specifications.

**Final Note:**

By choosing **`2result.sql`**, we ensure that the growth rates are presented in a clear, accurate, and interpretable manner, aligning with standard practices for reporting percentage changes over time.
