2025-01-18 00:38:22 - root - INFO - It looks like the error is occurring because the `"salespersonid"` column contains some empty strings (`''`) that cannot be converted to a number using `TO_NUMBER()`. The `TO_NUMBER()` function raises an error when it encounters a non-numeric value like an empty string.

From your earlier query results:

```
salespersonid
279
282
276
280
283
277
278
281
""
274
275
289
290
284
288
285
287
286
```

We can see that there is an empty string among the `salespersonid` values. To fix this issue, you need to exclude the rows where `"salespersonid"` is an empty string before attempting to convert it to a number.

Here's how you can modify your query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT TO_NUMBER("salespersonid") AS "salespersonid_number"
FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESORDERHEADER
WHERE "salespersonid" IS NOT NULL AND "salespersonid" <> ''
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`"salespersonid" <> ''`**: This condition excludes rows where `"salespersonid"` is an empty string.
- **`TO_NUMBER("salespersonid")`**: Safely converts the remaining non-empty, non-null `salespersonid` values to numbers.

Alternatively, if your database supports it, you can use the `TRY_TO_NUMBER()` function, which attempts to convert a string to a number and returns `NULL` if it fails, without raising an error:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT TRY_TO_NUMBER("salespersonid") AS "salespersonid_number"
FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESORDERHEADER
WHERE "salespersonid" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

However, since we know that empty strings are causing the issue, filtering them out as in the first query is a more direct solution.

---

**Moving Forward:**

Now that we can successfully convert `"salespersonid"` to a numeric type, we can proceed with matching it to `"BusinessEntityID"` from the `SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY` table.

To continue building toward the final solution, here are a few additional steps:

1. **Ensure Data Type Consistency:**

   Since `"salespersonid"` is originally a `VARCHAR` and `"BusinessEntityID"` is a `NUMBER`, converting `"salespersonid"` to a number allows us to join these tables.

2. **Extract Year from Dates:**

   We'll need to extract the year from the `"orderdate"` and `"QuotaDate"` columns to group the sales and quotas by year.

3. **Calculate Total Sales per Salesperson per Year:**

   Sum up the `"totaldue"` amounts from `SALESORDERHEADER`, grouped by salesperson ID and year.

4. **Retrieve Sales Quota per Salesperson per Year:**

   Get the `"SalesQuota"` amounts from `SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY`, grouped by salesperson ID and year.

5. **Calculate the Difference:**

   Join the two datasets on salesperson ID and year, and calculate the difference between total sales and sales quota.

---

**Example Steps:**

Here are some queries to help us gather the necessary data.

1. **Calculate Total Sales per Salesperson per Year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     TO_NUMBER("salespersonid") AS "salespersonid_number",
     SUBSTRING("orderdate", 1, 4) AS "order_year",
     SUM("totaldue") AS "total_sales"
   FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESORDERHEADER
   WHERE "salespersonid" IS NOT NULL AND "salespersonid" <> ''
   GROUP BY "salespersonid_number", "order_year"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Retrieve Sales Quota per Salesperson per Year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "BusinessEntityID",
     SUBSTRING("QuotaDate", 1, 4) AS "quota_year",
     SUM("SalesQuota") AS "sales_quota"
   FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY
   GROUP BY "BusinessEntityID", "quota_year"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Join the Data and Calculate the Difference:**

   Since you requested to avoid nested queries, we can plan to join these datasets in our final query to compute the difference for each salesperson per year.

---

Once we have these datasets, we can proceed to structure the final result in the desired format:

```csv
salesperson_id,year,total_sales,sales_quota,difference
id:int,year:int,total_sales:float,sales_quota:float,difference:float
```

Let me know if you need further assistance with any of these steps or if you'd like me to help craft the queries needed to compute the final result.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task, we need to identify the relevant tables, columns, and potential conditions that will help us calculate the difference between each salesperson's annual total sales and their annual sales quota.

---

### **Relevant Tables and Columns**

1. **`SALESORDERHEADER`**

   - **"`salespersonid`"**: Identifies the salesperson associated with each sales order. *Potential usage*: Link sales orders to salespersons.
   - **"`orderdate`"**: Date when the order was placed. *Potential usage*: Extract the year to group sales by year.
   - **"`totaldue`"**: The total amount due for the order. *Potential usage*: Sum up to calculate total sales per salesperson per year.

2. **`SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY`**

   - **"`BusinessEntityID`"**: Unique identifier for each salesperson. *Potential usage*: Match with `salespersonid` after appropriate casting.
   - **"`QuotaDate`"**: Date when the sales quota was set. *Potential usage*: Extract the year to group quotas by year.
   - **"`SalesQuota`"**: The sales quota amount for the salesperson. *Potential usage*: Compare against total sales to find the difference.

3. **`SALESPERSON`** *(Optional for additional information)*

   - **"`businessentityid`"**: Unique identifier for each salesperson.
   - **"`salesytd`"**: Year-to-date sales for the salesperson. *Potential usage*: Could be compared with calculated total sales.
   - **"`saleslastyear`"**: Sales amount from the previous year.

---

### **Potential Conditions**

- **Data Type Conversion**: Since "`salespersonid`" in `SALESORDERHEADER` is `VARCHAR` and "`BusinessEntityID`" in `SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY` is `NUMBER`, we may need to cast one to match the other.
- **Date Extraction**: Extract the year from date fields to group data annually.
- **Filtering Non-Null Values**: Ensure that we only consider records with non-null salesperson IDs and dates.
- **Joining Tables**: Plan to join `SALESORDERHEADER` and `SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY` on the salesperson ID.

---

### **SQL Queries to Understand the Data**

Below are 10 simple, independent SQL queries to explore the data and validate our approach.

1. **Get distinct salesperson IDs from `SALESORDERHEADER`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "salespersonid"
   FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESORDERHEADER
   WHERE "salespersonid" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Get distinct BusinessEntityIDs from `SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "BusinessEntityID"
   FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Attempt to cast `salespersonid` to NUMBER to match with `BusinessEntityID`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT TO_NUMBER("salespersonid") AS "salespersonid_number"
   FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESORDERHEADER
   WHERE "salespersonid" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Extract years from `orderdate` in `SALESORDERHEADER`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTRING("orderdate", 1, 4) AS "order_year"
   FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESORDERHEADER
   WHERE "orderdate" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Extract years from `QuotaDate` in `SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTRING("QuotaDate", 1, 4) AS "quota_year"
   FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY
   WHERE "QuotaDate" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List `BusinessEntityID` and corresponding `SalesQuota`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "BusinessEntityID", "SalesQuota"
   FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List `salespersonid`, `totaldue`, and `orderdate` from `SALESORDERHEADER`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "salespersonid", "totaldue", "orderdate"
   FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESORDERHEADER
   WHERE "salespersonid" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **View `salesytd` for each salesperson from `SALESPERSON`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "businessentityid", "salesytd"
   FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESPERSON
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Check distinct `QuotaDate` values to understand the quota periods:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "QuotaDate"
   FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Check `modifieddate` in `SALESORDERHEADER` to see if it aligns with `orderdate`:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "orderdate", "modifieddate"
    FROM ADVENTUREWORKS.ADVENTUREWORKS.SALESORDERHEADER
    WHERE "orderdate" IS NOT NULL AND "modifieddate" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help us:

- **Validate Data Types**: Ensure that we can match salesperson IDs across tables by casting if necessary.
- **Understand Date Formats**: Verify that dates can be used to extract years for grouping.
- **Assess Data Completeness**: Check for any NULL values that may affect our calculations.
- **Plan for Joins and Aggregations**: Understand how to join the tables and what aggregations will be needed.

With this understanding, we can proceed to compute the annual total sales per salesperson, compare it with their annual sales quota, and calculate the difference for each year.Query:

Task: How did each salesperson's annual total sales compare to their annual sales quota? Provide the difference between their total sales and the quota for each year, organized by salesperson and year.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine how each salesperson's annual total sales compare to their annual sales quota, we calculate the difference between their total sales and their sales quota for each year. The result is organized by salesperson and year as shown below.

```csv
salesperson_id,year,total_sales,sales_quota,difference
id:int,year:int,total_sales:float,sales_quota:float,difference:float
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ADVENTUREWORKS': {'ADVENTUREWORKS': ['COUNTRYREGIONCURRENCY', 'CURRENCYRATE', 'PRODUCT', 'PRODUCTCATEGORY', 'PRODUCTDESCRIPTION', 'PRODUCTMODELPRODUCTDESCRIPTIONCULTURE', 'PRODUCTREVIEW', 'PRODUCTSUBCATEGORY', 'SALESORDERDETAIL', 'SALESORDERHEADER', 'SALESPERSON', 'SALESPERSONQUOTAHISTORY', 'SALESTERRITORY']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
