After carefully reviewing the SQL queries and their corresponding results provided in `0result.sql`, `1result.sql`, and `2result.sql`, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL script that best addresses the task requirements.

---

### **Reasoning:**

1. **Higher and More Plausible Application Counts:**
   - In `2result.csv`, the top assignee **"LELY NV C VAN DER"** has a total of **13 applications**, which is considerably higher than the counts in the other results.
   - The counts in `0result.csv` and `1result.csv` are significantly lower (maximum of 5 applications), which seems less plausible for top assignees in a patent class.

2. **Accurate Identification of Peak Year and Country Code:**
   - The peak year with the most applications and the corresponding application counts in `2result.csv` are higher and more realistic.
     - For example, "LELY NV C VAN DER" has **6 applications** in the year **1987**.
   - The country code with the most applications during that year is provided, aligning with the task requirements.

3. **Comprehensive and Correct SQL Logic:**
   - The SQL script in `2result.sql` accurately:
     - Filters patents in class **A01B3** by correctly using `LIKE 'A01B3%'` in the CPC code.
     - Counts total applications per assignee.
     - Determines the year with the most applications for each assignee.
     - Identifies the country code with the most applications during the peak year.
   - The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and proper grouping and ordering enhances readability and correctness.

4. **Consistency with Task Requirements:**
   - The query in `2result.sql` directly addresses all five pieces of information requested:
     - **Assignee Name**
     - **Total Number of Applications**
     - **Year with Most Applications**
     - **Applications in That Year**
     - **Country Code with Most Applications During That Year**

5. **Data Integrity and Reliability:**
   - The results in `2result.csv` reflect a more reliable analysis, likely due to better handling of the data (e.g., properly parsing dates, handling duplicates, and counting distinct applications).

6. **Float Values Consideration:**
   - Although the instruction mentions rounding float values to four decimal places, all relevant numeric values in the results are integers (counts of applications and years). Therefore, this consideration does not affect the outcome.

### **Conclusion:**

Based on the above reasoning, the SQL script that provides the correct and most comprehensive answer is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
