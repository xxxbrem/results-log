Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **F1.F1.RESULTS**
  - `"driver_id"`: Identifies the driver in each race result; used to link to the `DRIVERS` table to get the driver's full name.
  - `"constructor_id"`: Identifies the constructor associated with each driver in a race; used to link to the `CONSTRUCTORS` table to get the constructor's name.
  - `"race_id"`: Used to link to the `RACES` table to obtain the year of the race.
  - `"points"`: The number of points scored by the driver in a specific race.

- **F1.F1.RACES**
  - `"race_id"`: Unique identifier for each race; used to join with the `RESULTS` table.
  - `"year"`: The year in which the race took place; needed to group points by year.

- **F1.F1.DRIVERS**
  - `"driver_id"`: Used to link to the `RESULTS` table; identifies the driver.
  - `"full_name"`: The full name of the driver; required for the final output.

- **F1.F1.CONSTRUCTORS**
  - `"constructor_id"`: Used to link to the `RESULTS` table; identifies the constructor.
  - `"name"`: The name of the constructor; required for the final output.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Points need to be aggregated (`SUM("points")`) for each driver and constructor per year.
- Data should be grouped by `"year"` and `"driver_id"` or `"constructor_id"`.
- Joins between tables will be on `"driver_id"`, `"constructor_id"`, and `"race_id"` to gather all necessary information.

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **Retrieve all distinct years from the RACES table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM F1.F1.RACES
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **List all drivers with their full names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "full_name"
   FROM F1.F1.DRIVERS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **List all constructors with their names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", "name"
   FROM F1.F1.CONSTRUCTORS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Get all race IDs with their corresponding years:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "year"
   FROM F1.F1.RACES
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Retrieve points scored by each driver in each race:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "race_id", "points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Retrieve points scored by each constructor in each race:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", "race_id", "points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Calculate total points for each driver across all races:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "driver_id"
   ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Calculate total points for each constructor across all races:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "constructor_id"
   ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Join RESULTS and RACES tables to get race year for each result:**
   ```sql
   SELECT RES."race_id", R."year", RES."driver_id", RES."points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS RES
   JOIN F1.F1.RACES R ON RES."race_id" = R."race_id"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **List all driver standings to understand accumulated points:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "driver_standings_id", "driver_id", "race_id", "points"
    FROM F1.F1.DRIVER_STANDINGS
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **List all constructor standings to understand accumulated points:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "constructor_standings_id", "constructor_id", "race_id", "points"
    FROM F1.F1.CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS
    LIMIT 1000;

    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

    ```

17. **Retrieve the list of all races along with their names and years:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "race_id", "year", "name"
    FROM F1.F1.RACES
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

18. **Get the points for each driver per year by joining RESULTS and RACES:**
    ```sql
    SELECT R."year", RES."driver_id", RES."points"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS RES
    JOIN F1.F1.RACES R ON RES."race_id" = R."race_id"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

19. **Get the points for each constructor per year by joining RESULTS and RACES:**
    ```sql
    SELECT R."year", RES."constructor_id", RES."points"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS RES
    JOIN F1.F1.RACES R ON RES."race_id" = R."race_id"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

20. **List all drivers with their nationalities:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "driver_id", "full_name", "nationality"
    FROM F1.F1.DRIVERS
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries provide insights into the structure and content of the relevant tables and columns necessary to determine which driver and constructor scored the most points each year. By examining the results of these queries, we can better understand how to aggregate and join the data to fulfill the task requirements.Query:

Task: For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the driver and constructor who scored the most points in each year, we aggregate the total points from the "RESULTS" table for each driver and constructor per year. We join this data with the "RACES" table to obtain the year information. By summing up the points for each driver and constructor and selecting the highest scorers for each year, we get the desired results.

```csv
year,driver_full_name,driver_points,constructor_name,constructor_points
year:int,full_name:string,points:float,name:string,points:float
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 02:17:01 - root - INFO - To determine the driver and constructor who scored the most points in each year, we aggregate the total points from the "RESULTS" table for each driver and constructor per year. We join this data with the "RACES" table to obtain the year information. By summing up the points for each driver and constructor and selecting the highest scorers for each year, we get the desired results.
