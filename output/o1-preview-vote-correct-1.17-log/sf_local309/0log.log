The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure, let's first consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task:

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`RACES` Table**
   - `"race_id"`: Used to join with the `RESULTS` table.
   - `"year"`: To get the year of each race.

2. **`RESULTS` Table**
   - `"race_id"`: Used to join with the `RACES` table to get the year.
   - `"driver_id"`: Identifies the driver in each race.
   - `"constructor_id"`: Identifies the constructor in each race.
   - `"points"`: Points scored by the driver and constructor in each race.

3. **`DRIVERS` Table**
   - `"driver_id"`: Used to join with the `RESULTS` table.
   - `"full_name"`: To get the full name of each driver.

4. **`CONSTRUCTORS` Table**
   - `"constructor_id"`: Used to join with the `RESULTS` table.
   - `"name"`: To get the name of each constructor.

**Potential Usage of Columns and Conditions:**

- **`"RACES"."year"`**: To group the results by year.
- **`"RESULTS"."points"`**: To calculate the total points scored.
- **Join Conditions**:
  - `"RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"`: To associate each result with its race year.
  - `"RESULTS"."driver_id" = "DRIVERS"."driver_id"`: To get driver details.
  - `"RESULTS"."constructor_id" = "CONSTRUCTORS"."constructor_id"`: To get constructor details.
- **Grouping and Aggregation**:
  - Group by `"year"` and `"driver_id"` to sum points per driver per year.
  - Group by `"year"` and `"constructor_id"` to sum points per constructor per year.
- **Conditions**:
  - Include only records where `"points"` is not null.
  - Use `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to identify the top scorer per year.

Now, here are at least 10 simple, short, non-nested SQL queries to understand the values in related columns:

1. **Retrieve a list of all race years:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM F1.F1.RACES
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Get all driver IDs and their full names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "full_name"
   FROM F1.F1.DRIVERS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Get all constructor IDs and their names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", "name"
   FROM F1.F1.CONSTRUCTORS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **List all results with driver IDs, constructor IDs, and points:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "result_id", "race_id", "driver_id", "constructor_id", "points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   WHERE "points" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Get race IDs and their corresponding years:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "year"
   FROM F1.F1.RACES
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Find all results for a specific year (e.g., 2020):**

   ```sql
   SELECT r."result_id", r."race_id", r."driver_id", r."constructor_id", r."points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS r
   JOIN F1.F1.RACES ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
   WHERE ra."year" = 2020
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Retrieve total points scored by each driver across all races:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   WHERE "points" IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY "driver_id"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Retrieve total points scored by each constructor across all races:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   WHERE "points" IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY "constructor_id"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **List all drivers who participated in races in a specific year (e.g., 2019):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT r."driver_id"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS r
   JOIN F1.F1.RACES ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
   WHERE ra."year" = 2019
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Get the sum of points for each driver in a specific year (e.g., 2018):**

    ```sql
    SELECT r."driver_id", SUM(r."points") AS "yearly_points"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS r
    JOIN F1.F1.RACES ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
    WHERE ra."year" = 2018 AND r."points" IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY r."driver_id"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Get the sum of points for each constructor in a specific year (e.g., 2017):**

    ```sql
    SELECT r."constructor_id", SUM(r."points") AS "yearly_points"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS r
    JOIN F1.F1.RACES ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
    WHERE ra."year" = 2017 AND r."points" IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY r."constructor_id"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **List all races and the number of drivers who scored points in each race:**

    ```sql
    SELECT r."race_id", COUNT(DISTINCT r."driver_id") AS "drivers_scored"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS r
    WHERE r."points" > 0
    GROUP BY r."race_id"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Find drivers who have scored more than 100 points in total:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
    WHERE "points" IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY "driver_id"
    HAVING SUM("points") > 100
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Get the list of constructors along with the total number of races they participated in:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "constructor_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "race_id") AS "races_participated"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
    GROUP BY "constructor_id"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Retrieve the maximum points scored by any driver in a single race:**

    ```sql
    SELECT MAX("points") AS "max_points_in_race"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
    WHERE "points" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

16. **List all driver standings with their race IDs and points:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "driver_standings_id", "race_id", "driver_id", "points"

Task: For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the driver and constructor who scored the most points for each year, we need to aggregate the total points scored by each driver and constructor per year and identify the ones with the highest totals. Below is the data presented in CSV format:

```csv
year,driver_full_name,constructor_name
year:int,driver_full_name:str,constructor_name:str
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
