Among the three SQL scripts, the correct one is `0result.sql`.

**Reason:**

- **Use of Correct Table and Date Parsing:**
  - `0result.sql` uses the `CLEANED_WEEKLY_SALES` table, which has properly formatted dates in the `"week_date_formatted"` column.
  - It correctly parses `"week_date_formatted"` into date format using `TO_DATE("week_date_formatted", 'YYYY-MM-DD')`.

- **Accurate Definition of Periods:**
  - The script defines the **"Before"** period as the four weeks leading up to **June 15**:
    - From **May 18** to **June 14** (inclusive).
    - This captures exactly four weeks before June 15.
  - The **"After"** period is defined as the four weeks following **June 15**:
    - From **June 15** to **July 12** (inclusive).
    - This captures exactly four weeks after June 15.

- **Consistent with the Requirement:**
  - The periods in `0result.sql` align precisely with the task's requirement to compare sales between the four weeks before and after June 15 for each year.
  - By using date ranges relative to **June 15**, rather than hardcoding specific weeks or dates, the script ensures accuracy and adaptability across different years.

- **Accurate Calculations:**
  - The script aggregates sales within the defined periods and calculates the percentage change using the correct formula:
    - `((After_Sales - Before_Sales) / Before_Sales) * 100`
  - The results (`0result.csv`) show percentage changes that are consistent with the data and expectations.

**Comparison with Other Scripts:**

- **`1result.sql`:**
  - Uses the `WEEKLY_SALES` table, which has date parsing challenges due to inconsistent date formats.
  - Hardcodes specific `"week_date"` values for each year, which may lead to inaccuracies if weeks do not align perfectly around June 15.
  - The hardcoded dates might not accurately reflect the four weeks before and after June 15.

- **`2result.sql`:**
  - Also uses the `CLEANED_WEEKLY_SALES` table but defines periods that omit the week containing June 15.
    - The "Before" period ends on **June 11**, and the "After" period starts on **June 18**, skipping the week of **June 12-18**.
  - This results in missing data for the week that may include June 15, leading to potential inaccuracies.

By accurately defining the periods and using reliable date parsing, `0result.sql` provides the most precise analysis aligned with the task's requirements.
