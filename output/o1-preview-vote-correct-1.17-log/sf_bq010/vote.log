After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Case-Insensitive Matching:**
   - The second query uses the `LOWER` function to perform case-insensitive matching of the product name when identifying customers who purchased 'YouTube Men’s Vintage Henley'. This ensures that all variations in capitalization are accounted for.
     ```sql
     WHERE LOWER("Product_Name") = 'youtube men''s vintage henley'
     ```
   - The first query uses a case-sensitive comparison:
     ```sql
     WHERE p.value:"v2ProductName"::STRING = 'YouTube Men''s Vintage Henley'
     ```
     This might miss records where the product name has different capitalization, leading to incomplete results.

2. **Robust Handling of Product Quantity:**
   - The second query uses `TRY_TO_NUMBER` to safely convert the product quantity to a number, and `COALESCE` to default to 1 if the quantity is NULL or cannot be converted:
     ```sql
     COALESCE(TRY_TO_NUMBER(p.value:"productQuantity"::STRING), 1) AS "Product_Quantity"
     ```
   - The first query uses `COALESCE` with `p.value:"productQuantity"::INTEGER`, which may cause errors if the value cannot be cast to an integer:
     ```sql
     COALESCE(p.value:"productQuantity"::INTEGER, 1) AS quantity_sold
     ```
     The second query's approach is more robust and less likely to result in errors.

3. **Consistent Use of Data Types:**
   - The second query consistently uses `NUMBER` data types when dealing with `action_type` and ensures proper casting:
     ```sql
     WHERE h.value:"eCommerceAction":"action_type"::NUMBER = 6
     ```
   - The first query uses `::INTEGER`, which is acceptable, but the second query's explicit casting provides clarity.

**Conclusion:**

Due to its case-insensitive matching and more robust handling of product quantities, **`2result.sql`** is the correct and more reliable query to determine the top-selling product among customers who bought 'YouTube Men’s Vintage Henley' in July 2017, excluding the product itself.

```plain
2result.sql
```

*Note: Since the quantities are integers, rounding float values to 4 decimal places is not applicable in this context.*
