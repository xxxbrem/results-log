After comparing the provided SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query is `1result.sql`. Here's the reasoning for this choice:

### Comparison of SQL Queries:

1. **`0result.sql`**:
   - **Approach**: Calculates the total number of participants and the number of participants using quinapril and related medications.
   - **Method**:
     - Dynamically retrieves the concept ID for quinapril by querying the `CONCEPT` table using the RxCUI code `'35208'` and `vocabulary_id` `'RxNorm'`.
     - Identifies all descendant concept IDs related to quinapril from the `CONCEPT_ANCESTOR` table.
     - Counts distinct participants who have drug exposures matching these concept IDs.
   - **Strengths**: Dynamically obtains the quinapril concept ID, ensuring accuracy even if the concept ID changes.

2. **`1result.sql`**:
   - **Approach**: Similar to `0result.sql`, but uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for better readability and organization.
   - **Method**:
     - **`total_participants` CTE**: Counts the total number of participants.
     - **`quinapril_concept_id` CTE**: Dynamically retrieves the concept ID for quinapril.
     - **`quinapril_related_concept_ids` CTE**: Finds all descendant concept IDs related to quinapril.
     - **`participants_using_quinapril` CTE**: Identifies participants using quinapril or related medications.
     - Calculates the percentage of participants not using quinapril or related medications, ensuring that float values are rounded to four decimal places.
   - **Strengths**:
     - Uses CTEs for clarity and modularity.
     - Dynamically retrieves the quinapril concept ID.
     - Avoids hard-coded values, making the query adaptable to data changes.
     - Ensures accurate calculation and rounding of the float value to four decimal places.

3. **`2result.sql`**:
   - **Approach**: Calculates the desired percentage but uses a hard-coded concept ID for quinapril.
   - **Method**:
     - Directly uses the concept ID `1331235` for quinapril without querying the `CONCEPT` table.
     - Follows similar steps to count participants and calculate the percentage.
   - **Weaknesses**:
     - Relies on a hard-coded concept ID, which may not be consistent across different datasets or if the data changes.
     - Less dynamic and potentially less reliable than queries that derive the concept ID.

### Reason for Choosing `1result.sql`:

- **Dynamic Retrieval of Concept ID**: By fetching the concept ID of quinapril dynamically, `1result.sql` ensures that the query remains accurate even if concept IDs change or differ between datasets.
- **Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The query is well-organized using CTEs, enhancing readability and maintainability. This structure makes it easier to understand and modify individual parts of the query if needed.
- **Avoids Hard-Coded Values**: Does not rely on hard-coded concept IDs, making it more adaptable and less prone to errors due to changes in the underlying data.
- **Accurate Calculation with Proper Rounding**: The final percentage is calculated with attention to data types and is rounded to four decimal places as per the requirement.
- **Consistency in Results**: The result matches the expected percentage (`90.1207%`), confirming the correctness of the query.

### Conclusion:

The SQL query in `1result.sql` is the most appropriate and correct choice because it dynamically retrieves necessary data, is well-structured, avoids hard-coded values, and complies with the requirement to round float values to four decimal places.
