**Reasoning:**

After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the most accurate and appropriate query to answer the question: 

**"How many debt indicators for Russia have a value of 0, excluding NULL values?"**

Here's why:

1. **Counts `DISTINCT "indicator_code"`:**

   - Using `"indicator_code"` ensures that the count is based on unique debt indicators. Indicator codes are unique identifiers, whereas `"indicator_name"` might have duplicates or slight variations in naming.
   - This provides a precise count of debt indicators.

2. **Filters on `"country_name" = 'Russian Federation'`:**

   - Using the full country name ensures clarity and reduces any ambiguity that might arise from country codes. It also aligns with the dataset's standard naming conventions.

3. **Explicitly Excludes `NULL` Values:**

   - Although filtering with `"value" = 0` inherently excludes `NULL` values (since `NULL` is not equal to zero), the inclusion of `"value" IS NOT NULL` explicitly communicates the intent to exclude `NULL` values.
   - This makes the query more readable and maintainable, clearly indicating that only debt indicators with non-`NULL` zero values are considered.

4. **Matches the Question's Requirements:**

   - The query directly answers how many debt indicators have a value of zero for Russia, excluding `NULL` values.
   - It accurately counts the distinct number of such indicators.

**Summary:**

- **`1result.sql`** is the correct and most precise query.
- It ensures an accurate count by using unique indicator codes.
- It explicitly excludes `NULL` values, as per the question's requirement.
- The result of **12 debt indicators** with a value of zero for Russia aligns with the data provided.
