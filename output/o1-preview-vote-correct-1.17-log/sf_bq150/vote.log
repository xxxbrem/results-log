After comparing the three SQL queries, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer. This query correctly:

- **Joins expression data and mutation data on `case_barcode`**: This ensures that mutations are accurately associated with the corresponding patient cases, which is important because a patient (`case_barcode`) may have multiple samples, but mutations are specific to the patient.
- **Handles mutation types appropriately**: It uses `COALESCE` to assign 'No_Mutation' to cases without TP53 mutations, which is essential for comparing expression levels between mutated and non-mutated groups.
- **Calculates the necessary statistics correctly**: The query computes the grand mean, group means, sum of squares between groups (SSB), sum of squares within groups (SSW), mean squares, and the F-statistic accurately.

Float values are rounded to four decimal places as requested.
