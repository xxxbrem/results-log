After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

1. **Explicit Date Conversion:**
   - **`1result.sql`** uses `TO_TIMESTAMP` with a specified format `'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3'` to accurately parse the `payment_date` string into a timestamp. This ensures that all dates are correctly interpreted, which is crucial for precise time difference calculations.
   - In contrast, **`2result.sql`** uses `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ` without specifying a format, relying on default date parsing, which might not handle all date formats correctly.

2. **Precise Time Difference Calculation:**
   - **`1result.sql`** calculates the time difference between each payment and the initial purchase using `DATEDIFF('second', ...)`, which directly computes the difference in seconds, aligning with the requirement to base the 7- and 30-day periods on exact hours, minutes, and seconds.
   - **`2result.sql`** compares timestamps by adding seconds to the initial purchase date, which is an acceptable method but not as direct as computing the time difference.

3. **Robustness and Clarity:**
   - **`1result.sql`** provides a clear and methodical approach by defining intermediate Common Table Expressions (CTEs), making the query easier to read and maintain.
   - Specifying the date format enhances the robustness of the query, reducing the risk of errors due to date format inconsistencies.

4. **Results Match Requirements:**
   - Both queries produce the same numerical results, but **`1result.sql`** ensures that float values are rounded to four decimal places and concatenates a '%' symbol as required.
   - The results in **`1result.csv`** accurately reflect the average total lifetime sales and the average percentages of sales occurring in the first 7 and 30 days.

**Conclusion:**

**`1result.sql`** correctly addresses the task by precisely calculating the required metrics with attention to date parsing and time difference calculations, satisfying all given requirements.
