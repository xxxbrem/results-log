Both SQL queries are functionally equivalent and produce the same results for the task. They both:

- Select the file extension using `REGEXP_SUBSTR` and convert it to lowercase.
- Filter files to those with a directory depth greater than 10.
- Filter files to those with extensions `.py`, `.c`, `.ipynb`, `.java`, or `.js`.
- Group the results by the file extension and count the number of files for each.

**Comparison of the SQL Queries:**

**SQL 1:**

```sql
SELECT
    LOWER(REGEXP_SUBSTR("path", '\\.[^\\.]+$')) AS "extension",
    COUNT(*) AS "file_count"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES
WHERE (LENGTH("path") - LENGTH(REPLACE("path", '/', ''))) > 10
  AND LOWER(REGEXP_SUBSTR("path", '\\.[^\\.]+$')) IN ('.py', '.c', '.ipynb', '.java', '.js')
GROUP BY "extension"
ORDER BY "file_count" DESC NULLS LAST;
```

- **Order of Conditions:** The directory depth condition is checked first, followed by the file extension condition.
- **Column Alias:** The file extension column is aliased as `"extension"`.

**SQL 2:**

```sql
SELECT
    LOWER(REGEXP_SUBSTR("path", '\\.[^\\.]+$')) AS "file_type",
    COUNT(*) AS "file_count"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES
WHERE LOWER(REGEXP_SUBSTR("path", '\\.[^\\.]+$')) IN ('.py', '.c', '.ipynb', '.java', '.js')
  AND (LENGTH("path") - LENGTH(REPLACE("path", '/', ''))) > 10
GROUP BY "file_type"
ORDER BY "file_count" DESC NULLS LAST;
```

- **Order of Conditions:** The file extension condition is checked first, followed by the directory depth condition.
- **Column Alias:** The file extension column is aliased as `"file_type"`.

**Reason for Choosing SQL 2:**

- **Clarity in Filtering:** SQL 2 filters by file extension first, directly targeting the file types of interest as per the task's requirements.
- **Descriptive Alias:** The alias `"file_type"` may be more descriptive in the context of the task.
- **Readability:** The order of conditions and naming may enhance the readability and align with the logical flow of first selecting the file types, then applying the directory depth condition.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**
