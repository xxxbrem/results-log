After reviewing and comparing the provided SQL queries and their results, **I have determined that `1result.sql` is the best choice as the correct answer**.

**Reasoning:**

- **Explicit Country Mapping:** `1result.sql` utilizes a `country_mapping` Common Table Expression (CTE) to explicitly map the country names between the COVID-19 data (`"country_region"`) and the World Bank population data (`"country_name"`). This makes the query more transparent, readable, and maintainable.

- **Accurate Data Alignment:** By explicitly mapping country names, the query ensures that data from both datasets is accurately aligned, preventing potential mismatches due to naming differences (e.g., `'US'` vs. `'United States'`, `'Iran'` vs. `'Iran, Islamic Rep.'`).

- **Correct Calculation:** The query correctly calculates the number of cases per 100,000 people by dividing the total confirmed cases by the population and multiplying by 100,000. It also rounds the float values to four decimal places as per the requirement.

- **Readable Structure:** The use of CTEs (`country_mapping`, `covid_data`, `population_data`) organizes the query into logical sections, enhancing readability and making it easier to understand and modify if needed.

**Therefore, the SQL query in `1result.sql` provides the most accurate, clear, and maintainable approach to answering the given task.**
