The correct SQL query is:

```plain
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

Both `0result.sql` and `2result.sql` contain the same SQL query and produce identical results (`0result.csv` and `2result.csv` respectively). The SQL query in `0result.sql` correctly addresses the task requirements:

- **Date Range:** The query selects records where `"DATE_VALID_STD"` is between `'2023-01-15'` and `'2023-01-21'`, which corresponds to the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year (2023). This is accurate because:
  - The first full week of 2023 is Sunday, January 1 to Saturday, January 7.
  - The second full week is Sunday, January 8 to Saturday, January 14.
  - The week ending after the first two full weeks is Sunday, January 15 to Saturday, January 21.

- **Country Filter:** The query filters for records where `"COUNTRY" = 'US'`, ensuring that only U.S. postal codes are included.

- **Snowfall Amount:** The query selects records where `"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6.0`, capturing days with snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches.

- **Selected Columns:** The query retrieves `"POSTAL_CODE"`, `"DATE_VALID_STD"`, and rounds `"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"` to 4 decimal places as requested. The rounding is performed using `ROUND("TOT_SNOWFALL_IN", 4) AS "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"`.

Therefore, `0result.sql` is the correct SQL file because it meets all the specified requirements and provides the correct data in the desired format.
