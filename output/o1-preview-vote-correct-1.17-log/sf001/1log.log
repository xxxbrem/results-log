Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table**: `GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY`

  - **"DATE_VALID_STD"**: Used to filter records within the specific date range (week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year).
  - **"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"**: Total snowfall in inches on a given date; used to identify days with snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches.
  - **"POSTAL_CODE"**: U.S. postal codes; used to identify the location of the snowfall.
  - **"COUNTRY"**: Used to ensure only U.S. postal codes are considered (e.g., `"COUNTRY" = 'USA'`).

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- **Date Range Condition**: `"DATE_VALID_STD"` between `'2023-01-15'` and `'2023-01-21'` (the week ending after the first two full weeks of 2023).
- **Snowfall Amount Condition**: `"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6.0` (snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches).
- **Country Filter**: `"COUNTRY" = 'USA'` (to include only U.S. postal codes).

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve Distinct Dates Within the Target Week**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "DATE_VALID_STD"
   FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
   WHERE "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
   LIMIT 1000;

2. **List Postal Codes with Snowfall Greater Than 6 Inches**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "POSTAL_CODE"
   FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
   WHERE "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6.0
     AND "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
     AND "COUNTRY" = 'USA'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Retrieve Dates and Snowfall Amounts Over 6 Inches**

   ```sql
   SELECT "DATE_VALID_STD", "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"
   FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
   WHERE "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6.0
     AND "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
     AND "COUNTRY" = 'USA'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Get the Maximum Snowfall Amount During the Target Week**

   ```sql
   SELECT MAX("TOT_SNOWFALL_IN") AS "MAX_SNOWFALL_IN"
   FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
   WHERE "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
     AND "COUNTRY" = 'USA'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Count Records with Null Snowfall Amounts**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "NULL_SNOWFALL_COUNT"
   FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
   WHERE "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" IS NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List All Countries Represented in the Data for the Target Week**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "COUNTRY"
   FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
   WHERE "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
   LIMIT 1000;

These queries are designed to explore the relevant data and understand the values within the columns associated with the task. They help identify:

- The dates available within the specified week.
- The U.S. postal codes with significant snowfall.
- The distribution and magnitude of snowfall amounts.
- Any potential data quality issues, such as null values.
- The presence of non-U.S. data within the dataset.

By analyzing the output of these queries, we can gain a clearer understanding of the dataset and prepare to construct the final query needed to fulfill the task requirements.Query:

Task: Assuming today is April 1, 2024, I would like to know the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
postal_code,date,tot_snowfall_in
postal_code1,2023-01-16,float > 6.0
postal_code2,2023-01-18,float > 6.0
postal_code3,2023-01-20,float > 6.0
```

**Explanation:**

The table above lists U.S. postal codes with daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches during the week of **January 15 to January 21, 2023** (the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year). Each row represents a record where:

- **postal_code**: A string representing the U.S. postal code.
- **date**: A date between 2023-01-15 and 2023-01-21.
- **tot_snowfall_in**: The total snowfall in inches on that date, which is a float value greater than 6.0 inches.

Values are placeholders indicating the data types and conditions specified in the task..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI': {'STANDARD_TILE': ['CLIMATOLOGY_DAY', 'FORECAST_DAY', 'HISTORY_DAY']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
