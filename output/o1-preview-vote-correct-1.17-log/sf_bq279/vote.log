Both SQL queries aim to calculate the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for the years 2013 and 2014 by joining the trips and stations tables.

**Comparison of the SQL Queries:**

---

**1result.sql**:

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."start_time" / 1e6)) AS "year",
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s."status" = 'active' THEN t."start_station_id" END) AS "number_active",
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s."status" = 'closed' THEN t."start_station_id" END) AS "number_closed"
FROM
    AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t
JOIN
    AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s
    ON t."start_station_id" = s."station_id"
WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."start_time" / 1e6)) IN (2013, 2014)
GROUP BY
    "year"
ORDER BY
    "year";
```

- **Approach**: Directly joins the `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` and `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` tables.
- **Counts**: Uses `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` on `t."start_station_id"` based on the station's status.
- **Result**:

  ```
  year,number_active,number_closed
  2013,10,1
  2014,38,9
  ```

---

**2result.sql**:

```sql
SELECT
    year,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s."status" = 'active' THEN s."station_id" END) AS number_active,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s."status" = 'closed' THEN s."station_id" END) AS number_closed
FROM (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."start_time" / 1e6)) AS year,
        t."start_station_id" AS station_id
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."start_time" / 1e6)) IN (2013, 2014)
) AS trips_by_year
JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s
    ON trips_by_year.station_id = s."station_id"
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;
```

- **Approach**: Creates a subquery (`trips_by_year`) to extract the year and station ID before joining.
- **Counts**: Uses `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` on `s."station_id"` based on the station's status.
- **Result**:

  ```
  year,number_active,number_closed
  2013,10,1
  2014,38,9
  ```

**Reason for Choosing the Correct SQL:**

Both SQL queries produce the same correct results. However, **`1result.sql`** is the preferred choice because:

- **Simplicity**: It directly joins the trips and stations tables without unnecessary subqueries, making it more straightforward and easier to understand.
- **Efficiency**: Eliminating the subquery can lead to better query performance due to reduced complexity.
- **Clarity**: Counting directly on `t."start_station_id"` aligns with the goal of finding the number of stations based on trip data.

**Output:**

```plain
1result.sql
