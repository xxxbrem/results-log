2025-01-16 18:22:09 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering indicates that the values in the `"modified_date"` column are not directly compatible with the `TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ` function as used in your query. Specifically, the error message:

```
252005: Failed to convert current row, cause: year 52173925 is out of range
```

suggests that the numeric value represents a timestamp that's either too large or not in the expected format for direct conversion. Let's address this step by step.

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Incorrect Timestamp Format:** The `"modified_date"` column contains numeric values that represent timestamps. However, these timestamps may not be in the expected unit (e.g., they might be in microseconds instead of milliseconds or seconds).

2. **Data Corruption:** There may be corrupted or invalid data in the `"modified_date"` column that's causing the timestamp conversion to fail.

---

### **Solutions**

#### **1. Determining the Correct Timestamp Unit**

First, let's inspect the range of values in the `"modified_date"` column to understand what they represent.

```sql
SELECT MIN("modified_date") AS min_date, MAX("modified_date") AS max_date
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS;
```

**Possible Outcomes:**

- **If the values are too large:** They might be in **microseconds**.
- **If the values are reasonable when divided by 1,000 or 1,000,000:** They might be in **milliseconds** or **microseconds**, respectively.

#### **2. Adjusting the Timestamp Conversion**

Based on the values observed, adjust the conversion accordingly.

**If the values are in milliseconds:**

```sql
SELECT "station_id", "status", "modified_date", 
       TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date" / 1000) AS "modified_timestamp"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
LIMIT 1000;
```

**If the values are in microseconds:**

```sql
SELECT "station_id", "status", "modified_date", 
       TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date" / 1000000) AS "modified_timestamp"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
LIMIT 1000;
```

#### **3. Using TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ to Handle Invalid Values**

To avoid errors due to invalid data, use `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ`, which returns `NULL` when the conversion fails instead of throwing an error.

```sql
SELECT "station_id", "status", "modified_date", 
       TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date" / 1000) AS "modified_timestamp"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
WHERE TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date" / 1000) IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **Proceeding to Answer the Original Task**

Now that we can correctly convert `"modified_date"` to timestamps, we can compute the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year, 2013 and 2014.

**Assumptions:**

- The `"modified_date"` indicates when the station's status was last updated.
- The latest status may not reflect the station's status in previous years. However, since we have the modification date, we can infer the status during the years of interest.

---

### **SQL Query to Compute the Counts**

```sql
WITH station_statuses AS (
  SELECT "station_id", "status",
         EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date" / 1000)) AS "modified_year"
  FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
  WHERE TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date" / 1000) IS NOT NULL
),
years AS (
  SELECT 2013 AS "year" UNION SELECT 2014
),
all_statuses AS (
  SELECT s."station_id", s."status", y."year"
  FROM station_statuses s
  CROSS JOIN years y
  WHERE s."modified_year" <= y."year"
)
SELECT
  "year",
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN "status" = 'active' THEN "station_id" END) AS "number_active_stations",
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN "status" = 'closed' THEN "station_id" END) AS "number_closed_stations"
FROM all_statuses
GROUP BY "year"
ORDER BY "year";
```

**Explanation:**

- **`station_statuses`:** Extracts the station IDs, their status, and the year the status was modified.
- **`years`:** Defines the years we're interested in (2013 and 2014).
- **`all_statuses`:** For each station, associates it with the years from its modification year onward, assuming the status remains the same until changed.
- **Final Select:** Groups by year and counts the number of active and closed stations.

---

### **Final Answer**

Assuming we have executed the above query and obtained the counts, here is the final answer in CSV format:

```csv
year,number_active_stations,number_closed_stations
2013,num:int,num:int
2014,num:int,num:int
```

- Replace `num:int` with the actual integer counts obtained from the query.

---

### **Additional Notes**

- **Data Limitations:** If the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table does not have historical records for status changes (i.e., it only stores the latest status), we might not be able to accurately determine the status of stations for past years using this table alone.
  
- **Alternative Approach Using Trip Data:**

  Since bike stations are used in trips, we can infer active stations based on trip records for each year.

  ```sql
  SELECT "year",
         COUNT(DISTINCT "station_id") AS "number_active_stations"
  FROM (
    SELECT
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000)) AS "year",
      "start_station_id" AS "station_id"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
    WHERE TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000) IS NOT NULL
      AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000)) IN (2013, 2014)
    UNION
    SELECT
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000)) AS "year",
      "end_station_id" AS "station_id"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
    WHERE TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000) IS NOT NULL
      AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000)) IN (2013, 2014)
  ) AS active_stations
GROUP BY "year"
ORDER BY "year";
  ```

  - This query counts the number of distinct stations that were used in trips during 2013 and 2014, which can be considered as active stations for those years.
  - Note that this approach does not provide information about closed stations.

---

### **Conclusion**

By adjusting the timestamp conversion and using the data available, we can compute the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014.

---

**Final Answer:**

```csv
year,number_active_stations,number_closed_stations
2013,num:int,num:int
2014,num:int,num:int
```

- **`year`:** The year (2013 or 2014).
- **`number_active_stations`:** The count of distinct stations with status 'active' for that year.
- **`number_closed_stations`:** The count of distinct stations with status 'closed' for that year.
- **`num:int`:** Represents integer values to be filled in with actual counts from the query results.

**Note:** As we don't have the actual data, we've used placeholders (`num:int`) for the counts. The provided SQL queries will help you retrieve the exact numbers from your database.

2025-01-16 18:23:23 - root - INFO - The error message you've encountered:

```
001065 (22023): 01b9c14e-0004-7c54-0001-11c300e7a142: SQL compilation error:
Function TRY_CAST cannot be used with arguments of types NUMBER(38,6) and TIMESTAMP_LTZ(6)
```

indicates a data type mismatch when attempting to convert the `"modified_date"` column to a timestamp using the `TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ` function. Specifically, the `"modified_date"` column is of type `NUMBER(38,6)`, which means it has six decimal places (scale of 6), and the function is expecting a compatible data type for conversion.

### **Understanding the Issue**

- **Data Type of "modified_date":** `NUMBER(38,6)` indicates that the values can have up to 38 digits in total, with 6 digits after the decimal point.
  
- **Expected Data Type for TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ:** The `TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ` function expects an integer or a string representing a timestamp. When provided with a numeric value, it's typically in **seconds** (or **milliseconds**) since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

### **Steps to Resolve the Error**

#### **1. Inspect the Values in "modified_date"**

First, it's important to understand what kind of values are stored in the `"modified_date"` column. Let's retrieve some sample values:

```sql
SELECT "modified_date"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
LIMIT 10;
```

**Possible Outcomes:**

- **Outcome A:** Values are large numbers with decimal places (e.g., `1625432100.123456`).
- **Outcome B:** Values resemble date formats (e.g., `20210101.000000`).
- **Outcome C:** Values are not in a recognizable date or timestamp format.

#### **2. Determine the Correct Conversion Method**

Based on the sample values, we can choose an appropriate method to convert `"modified_date"` to a timestamp.

**Scenario A:** If `"modified_date"` represents a Unix timestamp in **seconds with fractional seconds**, we can convert it directly.

**Scenario B:** If `"modified_date"` represents a Unix timestamp in **milliseconds**, we need to divide by `1000`.

**Scenario C:** If `"modified_date"` is in a **date format** like `YYYYMMDD`, we need to convert it accordingly.

#### **3. Adjust the SQL Query**

##### **Option 1: For Unix Timestamps in Seconds with Fractional Seconds**

If the values are seconds since the epoch with fractional seconds:

```sql
SELECT
  "station_id",
  "status",
  "modified_date",
  TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(CAST("modified_date" AS NUMBER(38,0))) AS "modified_timestamp"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
LIMIT 10;
```

**Explanation:**

- `CAST("modified_date" AS NUMBER(38,0))` converts the decimal number to an integer by truncating the decimal part.
- `TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ` then converts the integer (seconds since epoch) to a timestamp.

##### **Option 2: For Unix Timestamps in Milliseconds**

If the values are milliseconds since the epoch with decimal places:

```sql
SELECT
  "station_id",
  "status",
  "modified_date",
  TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date" / 1000) AS "modified_timestamp"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
LIMIT 10;
```

**Explanation:**

- Dividing by `1000` converts milliseconds to seconds.
- No need to cast to integer, as `TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ` can handle numeric values with fractional seconds.

##### **Option 3: Using TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ to Handle Errors**

If there are invalid or unexpected values:

```sql
SELECT
  "station_id",
  "status",
  "modified_date",
  TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date") AS "modified_timestamp"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
LIMIT 10;
```

**Explanation:**

- `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ` attempts the conversion and returns `NULL` if it fails, preventing errors from halting the query.

##### **Option 4: For Dates in YYYYMMDD Format**

If the values resemble dates like `20210101.000000`:

```sql
SELECT
  "station_id",
  "status",
  "modified_date",
  TO_DATE(TO_CHAR(CAST("modified_date" AS NUMBER(38,0))), 'YYYYMMDD') AS "modified_date_formatted"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
LIMIT 10;
```

**Explanation:**

- `CAST("modified_date" AS NUMBER(38,0))` removes the decimal places.
- `TO_CHAR` converts the number to a string.
- `TO_DATE` interprets the string as a date in `YYYYMMDD` format.

#### **4. Handling NUMBER(38,6) Type**

Since the error mentions `NUMBER(38,6)`, it's important to handle the decimal scale correctly.

If casting directly to `NUMBER(38,0)` causes issues, you can use `FLOOR` or `ROUND` functions:

```sql
SELECT
  "station_id",
  "status",
  "modified_date",
  TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(FLOOR("modified_date")) AS "modified_timestamp"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
LIMIT 10;
```

Or, if retaining the fractional seconds is important:

```sql
SELECT
  "station_id",
  "status",
  "modified_date",
  TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date") AS "modified_timestamp"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
LIMIT 10;
```

**Note:** If this still results in an error, it's possible that `TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ` cannot handle `NUMBER(38,6)` directly. In that case, converting to `FLOAT` might help:

```sql
SELECT
  "station_id",
  "status",
  "modified_date",
  TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(CAST("modified_date" AS FLOAT)) AS "modified_timestamp"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
LIMIT 10;
```

#### **5. Verify the Results**

After adjusting the query, verify that the `modified_timestamp` values make sense and correspond to realistic dates (e.g., years around 2010-2020).

### **Proceeding with the Original Task**

With the corrected conversion, we can now extract the year from the `"modified_timestamp"` and proceed to calculate the number of active and closed stations for 2013 and 2014.

#### **Final SQL Query**

```sql
WITH station_statuses AS (
  SELECT
    "station_id",
    "status",
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(CAST("modified_date" AS NUMBER(38,0)))) AS "modified_year"
  FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
  WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(CAST("modified_date" AS NUMBER(38,0))) IS NOT NULL
),
status_changes AS (
  SELECT
    "station_id",
    "status",
    "modified_year",
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "station_id" ORDER BY "modified_year" DESC) AS rn
  FROM station_statuses
),
latest_status AS (
  SELECT
    "station_id",
    "status",
    "modified_year"
  FROM status_changes
  WHERE rn = 1
)
SELECT
  y."year",
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ls."status" = 'active' THEN ls."station_id" END) AS "number_active_stations",
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ls."status" = 'closed' THEN ls."station_id" END) AS "number_closed_stations"
FROM (
  SELECT 2013 AS "year"
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2014 AS "year"
) y
LEFT JOIN latest_status ls ON ls."modified_year" <= y."year"
GROUP BY y."year"
ORDER BY y."year";
```

**Explanation:**

- **`station_statuses`:** Converts the `"modified_date"` to a year and selects stations with a valid timestamp.
- **`status_changes`:** Assigns a row number to each status change per station, ordering by the most recent year.
- **`latest_status`:** Extracts the latest status for each station.
- **Final Query:** Counts the active and closed stations for each year, considering stations modified up to that year.

**Note:** This assumes that the station's status remains the same until it's modified again.

### **Final Answer**

As we don't have actual data, we'll present the expected format:

```csv
year,number_active_stations,number_closed_stations
2013,num:int,num:int
2014,num:int,num:int
```

- **`year`:** The year (2013 or 2014).
- **`number_active_stations`:** The number of distinct stations with status 'active' up to and including that year.
- **`number_closed_stations`:** The number of distinct stations with status 'closed' up to and including that year.
- **`num:int`:** Represents integer values to be filled in with actual counts from the query results.

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Data Accuracy:** If the `"modified_date"` values are incorrect or inconsistent, the results may not accurately reflect the station statuses for those years.
- **Station History:** If stations have multiple status changes, ensure that the query captures the latest status for each station as of each year.

### **Summary**

To resolve the error:

- Inspect the `"modified_date"` values to determine their format.
- Adjust the data type conversion accordingly, possibly casting to `NUMBER(38,0)` or `FLOAT`.
- Use `TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ` with the appropriately cast value.
- Proceed with extracting the year and aggregating the counts as per the original task.

---

**Final Answer in CSV Format:**

```csv
year,number_active_stations,number_closed_stations
2013,num:int,num:int
2014,num:int,num:int
```

This table provides the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each of the years 2013 and 2014. The values `num:int` are placeholders for the actual integer counts that would result from executing the corrected SQL query.

This table shows the total number of distinct active and closed bike share stations based on the available data. Due to limitations with the date fields in the dataset, we're unable to provide the counts specifically for each year 2013 and 2014. The `status` column represents the station status ('active' or 'closed'), and `number_of_stations` indicates the count of distinct stations for each status.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we need to identify the relevant tables, columns, and potential conditions to extract this information.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS`
   - **"station_id"**: Used to uniquely identify each bike share station. Potential usage: To count distinct stations.
   - **"status"**: Indicates the status of the station, such as 'active' or 'closed'. Potential usage: To categorize stations based on their status.
   - **"modified_date"**: A numeric timestamp likely representing when the station's status was last modified. Potential usage: To determine the year when a station's status changed.

2. **Table:** `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS`
   - **"start_station_id"** and **"end_station_id"**: Identify stations involved in trips. Potential usage: To infer active stations based on their usage in trips.
   - **"start_time"**: A numeric timestamp of when the trip started. Potential usage: To filter trips by year and indirectly determine active stations during those years.

**Potential Conditions:**

- **Filtering by Year:** Use `EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("timestamp_column"))` to filter records for 2013 and 2014.
- **Status Check:** Filter stations where `"status"` is 'active' or 'closed'.
- **Station Activity:** Identify stations involved in trips during specific years to infer activity.

**Sample SQL Queries to Explore Data:**

1. **List distinct station statuses:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "status"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Get sample of station modified dates and convert to timestamps:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status", "modified_date", TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date") AS "modified_timestamp"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **List distinct years from station modified dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date")) AS "modified_year"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS;
   ```

4. **Count stations modified in each year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date")) AS "modified_year", COUNT(*) AS "station_count"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   GROUP BY EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date"))
   ORDER BY "modified_year";
   ```

5. **List stations with status and modified year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status", EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date")) AS "modified_year"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Find stations with status 'active' modified before 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status", TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date") AS "modified_timestamp"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE "status" = 'active' AND TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date") < TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ('2013-01-01')
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List distinct start years from trip start times:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time")) AS "start_year"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS;
   ```

8. **List stations used in trips in 2013 (start stations):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "start_station_id"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
   WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time")) = 2013;
   ```

9. **List stations used in trips in 2014 (end stations):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "end_station_id"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
   WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time")) = 2014;
   ```

10. **Find all stations active based on trips data for 2013 and 2014:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "station_id"
    FROM (
      SELECT "start_station_id" AS "station_id"
      FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
      WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time")) BETWEEN 2013 AND 2014
      UNION
      SELECT "end_station_id" AS "station_id"
      FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
      WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time")) BETWEEN 2013 AND 2014
    )
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Count of trips per station in 2013:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "start_station_id", COUNT(*) AS "trip_count"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
    WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time")) = 2013
    GROUP BY "start_station_id"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Stations with status 'closed' modified in 2014:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "station_id", TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date") AS "modified_timestamp"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
    WHERE "status" = 'closed' AND EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date")) = 2014
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help explore the data related to bike share stations' statuses, modification dates, and activity during trips in 2013 and 2014. By analyzing the results of these queries, we can gain insights into which stations were active or closed during those years.

Task: Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
year,number_active_stations,number_closed_stations
2013,num:int,num:int
2014,num:int,num:int
```

This table provides the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year, 2013 and 2014. The `number_active_stations` and `number_closed_stations` columns represent the counts of stations with statuses 'active' and 'closed' respectively for each year. The `num:int` indicates that these values are integers..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'AUSTIN': {'AUSTIN_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'AUSTIN_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATIONS', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'AUSTIN_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'AUSTIN_INCIDENTS': ['INCIDENTS_2008', 'INCIDENTS_2009', 'INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2011', 'INCIDENTS_2016'], 'AUSTIN_WASTE': ['WASTE_AND_DIVERSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
