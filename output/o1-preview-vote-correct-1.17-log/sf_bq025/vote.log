After reviewing and comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct query for the following reasons:

1. **Proper Use of Country Codes for Joining:**
   - The query in `1result.sql` uses `"country_code"` along with `"country_name"` to join the subqueries. This ensures accurate matching between the total population under 20 and the total midyear population for each country.
   - Using `"country_code"` minimizes the risk of discrepancies due to variations or inconsistencies in `"country_name"` entries.

2. **Correct Calculation of Population Under 20:**
   - The subquery `total_population_under_20` accurately sums the populations of individuals under 20 years old for each country.
   - It groups the data by `"country_code"` and `"country_name"`, ensuring that each country's data is aggregated correctly.

3. **Accurate Retrieval of Total Midyear Population:**
   - The subquery `total_midyear_population` retrieves the total midyear population for each country in 2020.
   - Filtering for `"year" = 2020` ensures that the populations are from the correct year.

4. **Proper Handling of Potential Division by Zero:**
   - The use of `NULLIF(tmp.total_midyear_population, 0)` prevents division by zero errors in cases where the total midyear population might be zero.

5. **Rounding to Four Decimal Places:**
   - The `ROUND` function is used to round the percentage calculations to four decimal places, as required.

6. **Clear and Logical Structure:**
   - The query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for better readability and organization.
   - It accurately orders the results by the highest percentage of the population under 20 years old.

Considering these points, the SQL query in `1result.sql` correctly addresses the task and produces the accurate results shown in `1result.csv`.
