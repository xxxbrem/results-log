After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I recommend using `0result.sql` as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Consistency with Schema Conventions:** `0result.sql` consistently uses double quotes around table and column names, matching the naming conventions specified in the database schema.
- **Clarity in Aliases:** The aliases (`VD`, `S`, `VD2`, `S2`) in `0result.sql` are used clearly and consistently, improving the readability of the query.
- **Compliance with Instructions:** Both queries calculate the required statistics and round float values to 4 decimal places as instructed. However, `0result.sql` aligns more closely with the formatting and style of the initial queries provided.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
