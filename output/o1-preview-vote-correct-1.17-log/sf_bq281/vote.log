After comparing the SQL queries and their results, query `2result.sql` is the correct one. Here's why:

- **Exact Match on Subscriber Type**: The task specifies subscribers with **'Student Membership'**. Query `2result.sql` filters using `"subscriber_type" = 'Student Membership'`, ensuring only rides by subscribers with exactly that type are included. The other queries (`0result.sql` and `1result.sql`) use a broader condition like `LOWER("subscriber_type") LIKE '%student membership%'`, which would also include 'U.T. Student Membership' or other similar subscriber types, deviating from the task's requirement.

- **Case-Sensitive Filtering for Stations**: The station names in the dataset are capitalized consistently. Query `2result.sql` uses case-sensitive conditions:
  - `"start_station_name" NOT LIKE '%Mobile Station%'`
  - `"end_station_name" NOT LIKE '%Repair Shop%'`
  This accurately excludes the specified stations. The other queries convert station names to lowercase, which is unnecessary given the consistent capitalization and may introduce unnecessary overhead.

- **Direct Match on Bike Type**: Query `2result.sql` uses `"bike_type" = 'electric'`, matching the task's requirement precisely.

- **Result Matches Task Expectation**: The result of 201 rides on `2023-10-13` aligns with the highest number of rides taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' on electric bikes lasting more than 10 minutes and excluding the specified stations.

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** correctly answers the task by precisely applying the required filters and providing the accurate result.
