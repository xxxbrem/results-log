2025-01-16 18:44:48 - root - INFO - It appears that the function `FROM_TIMESTAMP` is not recognized in your SQL environment. Instead, you can use `TO_TIMESTAMP` to convert epoch time (in seconds) to a timestamp. Additionally, ensure that the values in your conditions match the data. For instance, based on the previous data, the `"bike_type"` values are `'classic'` and `'electric'` (all lowercase), and the `"subscriber_type"` might include `'Student Membership'`, `'U.T. Student Membership'`, and `'Semester Membership'`.

**Here is the corrected SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("start_time" / 1000000)) AS date, COUNT(*) AS number_of_rides
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
WHERE
  "subscriber_type" IN ('Student Membership', 'U.T. Student Membership', 'Semester Membership')
  AND "bike_type" = 'electric'
  AND "duration_minutes" > 10
  AND "start_station_name" NOT LIKE '%Mobile Station%'
  AND "start_station_name" NOT LIKE '%Repair Shop%'
  AND "end_station_name" NOT LIKE '%Mobile Station%'
  AND "end_station_name" NOT LIKE '%Repair Shop%'
GROUP BY DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("start_time" / 1000000))
ORDER BY number_of_rides DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query selects the date with the highest number of electric bike rides longer than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership', excluding rides that start or end at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'.

**Result in CSV format:**

```csv
date,number_of_rides
date: date,num: int ≥ 0
```

- **`date`**: The date with the highest number of qualifying rides.
- **`number_of_rides`**: The highest number of rides on that day.

**Brief Explanation:**

- **Conditions Applied:**
  - **Subscriber Type**: Filtered for subscribers with 'Student Membership', 'U.T. Student Membership', or 'Semester Membership'.
  - **Bike Type**: Selected only 'electric' bikes.
  - **Duration**: Only included rides lasting more than 10 minutes.
  - **Station Names**: Excluded rides starting or ending at stations containing 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'.
- **Date Conversion**: Converted the epoch time in `"start_time"` (given in microseconds) to a date using `TO_TIMESTAMP("start_time" / 1000000)`.
- **Aggregation**: Counted the number of rides per day and ordered the results to find the day with the highest count.

**Note:** Ensure that all string comparisons (e.g., `'electric'`, `'Student Membership'`) match the exact casing and spelling found in your data for accurate results.

Task: What is the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop', is:

```csv
date,number_of_rides
date: date,num: int ≥ 0
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'AUSTIN': {'AUSTIN_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'AUSTIN_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATIONS', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'AUSTIN_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'AUSTIN_INCIDENTS': ['INCIDENTS_2008', 'INCIDENTS_2009', 'INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2011', 'INCIDENTS_2016'], 'AUSTIN_WASTE': ['WASTE_AND_DIVERSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-16 18:48:02 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop', is:

```csv
date,number_of_rides
date: date,num: int ≥ 0
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
