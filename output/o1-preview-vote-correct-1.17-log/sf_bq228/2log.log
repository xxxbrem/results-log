Based on the task, the relevant table is `LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA`.

**Relevant columns and their potential usage:**

- **"borough"**: Used to filter records for the borough of Barking and Dagenham.
- **"major_category"**: Used to identify and group incidents by major crime categories.
- **"value"**: Represents the number of incidents, used to aggregate incidents in each category.
- **"year"**: May be used to filter or group data by specific years.
- **"month"**: May be used to filter or group data by specific months.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham'`: To filter records for the specified borough.
- `GROUP BY "major_category"`: To group incidents by major crime categories.

Here are 10 simple SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

1. **Retrieve all unique borough names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "borough" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Retrieve all unique major crime categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "major_category" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Retrieve all unique minor crime categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "minor_category" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Retrieve all years available in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Retrieve all months available in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "month" FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Retrieve total number of incidents per borough:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "borough", SUM("value") AS "total_incidents"
   FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
   GROUP BY "borough"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Retrieve total number of incidents per major crime category:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "major_category", SUM("value") AS "total_incidents"
   FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
   GROUP BY "major_category"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Retrieve total number of incidents per major crime category in Barking and Dagenham:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "major_category", SUM("value") AS "total_incidents"
   FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
   WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham'
   GROUP BY "major_category"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Retrieve incident data for Barking and Dagenham:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
   WHERE "borough" = 'Barking and Dagenham'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Retrieve total number of incidents per year in Barking and Dagenham:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "year", SUM("value") AS "total_incidents"
    FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA

Task: Please provide a list of the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category are as follows:

```csv
major_category,incident_count
category:str,num:int
category:str,num:int
category:str,num:int
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LONDON': {'LONDON_CRIME': ['CRIME_BY_LSOA'], 'LONDON_FIRE_BRIGADE': ['FIRE_BRIGADE_SERVICE_CALLS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
