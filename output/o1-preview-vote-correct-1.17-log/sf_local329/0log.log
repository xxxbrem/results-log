This query counts the number of unique sessions that visited both the `/regist/input` page and the `/regist/confirm` page, regardless of the order.

Since the previous attempts to consider the order based on the `"stamp"` column resulted in no data (possibly due to issues with the `"stamp"` format or data inconsistencies), this simplified query focuses on sessions that visited both pages without enforcing the order.

    WHERE "path" IN ('/regist/input', '/regist/confirm')
    GROUP BY "session"
) sub
WHERE "path_sequence" LIKE '%/regist/input%/regist/confirm%';
```

This query calculates the number of unique sessions where the `/regist/input` page is visited **before** the `/regist/confirm` page. It combines the `path` values for each session in the order of their `stamp` and checks if the sequence contains `/regist/input` followed by `/regist/confirm`.

**Explanation:**

1. **Inner Query (`sub`):**
   - Selects the `"session"` and concatenates the `"path"` values in the order of `"stamp"` using `LISTAGG`.
   - Filters for the paths `/regist/input` and `/regist/confirm`.
   - Groups the data by `"session"`.

2. **Outer Query:**
   - Filters sessions where the `"path_sequence"` contains the sequence `'/regist/input'` followed by `'/regist/confirm'`.
   - The `LIKE` condition `'%/regist/input%/regist/confirm%'` ensures that `/regist/input` appears before `/regist/confirm` in the sequence.

**Note:** If the `LISTAGG` function is not available or the `"stamp"` column cannot be reliably ordered, consider simplifying the query by checking for sessions that have both paths without enforcing the order.
