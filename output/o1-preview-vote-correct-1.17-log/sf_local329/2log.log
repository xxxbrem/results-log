2025-01-18 02:20:47 - root - INFO - Based on the data provided, there is **1 unique session** that visited the `/regist/input` page and then the `/regist/confirm` page, in that order.

```csv
unique_sessions
1
```

**Explanation:**

- From the query results, we identified sessions that visited each page:
  - Sessions that visited `/regist/input`:
    - `647219c7`
    - `46b4c72c`
  - Sessions that visited `/regist/confirm`:
    - `9b5f320f`
    - `46b4c72c`
- The session `46b4c72c` is the only one that visited both pages.
- By analyzing the sequence of actions within session `46b4c72c`, we confirm that `/regist/input` was visited before `/regist/confirm`.

Therefore, there is **1** unique session that meets the criteria.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

To address the task of finding the number of unique sessions that visited the `/regist/input` page followed by the `/regist/confirm` page in that order, we'll consider the following tables and columns:

1. **`LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG`**

   - **Column Name:** `"session"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Identifies unique user sessions; essential for grouping actions performed within the same session.
   - **Column Name:** `"path"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Contains the URL paths accessed by users. We can filter this column to find records where the path is `/regist/input` or `/regist/confirm`.
   - **Column Name:** `"stamp"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Timestamp of the action; allows us to order the actions within a session to determine the sequence of page visits.
   - **Column Name:** `"action"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Describes the type of action performed; may provide additional context but is secondary for this task.
   - **Conditions That May Be Used:**
     - Filtering records where `"path"` is `/regist/input` or `/regist/confirm`.
     - Ordering actions within each `"session"` by `"stamp"` to determine the sequence.
     - Identifying sessions where `/regist/input` occurs before `/regist/confirm`.

2. **`LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG`**

   - **Column Name:** `"session"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Same as above for identifying unique sessions.
   - **Column Name:** `"path"`
     - **Potential Usage:** May also contain URL paths accessed by users.
   - **Column Name:** `"stamp"`
     - **Potential Usage:** For ordering actions chronologically.
   - **Conditions That May Be Used:**
     - Similar filtering and ordering as with `FORM_LOG`.

However, based on the structure provided, `FORM_LOG` appears to be the most relevant table because it explicitly logs form-related actions and contains the `"path"` column.

**Simple SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

To understand the values in the related columns and validate our approach, here are 10 simple, short, non-nested SQL queries:

1. **Retrieve distinct paths to see available pages:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "path"
   FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **View distinct actions to understand action types:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "action"
   FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Get the count of entries per path to see page visit frequencies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "path", COUNT(*) AS path_count
   FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
   GROUP BY "path"
   ORDER BY path_count DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Find sessions that visited `/regist/input`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "session"
   FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
   WHERE "path" = '/regist/input'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Find sessions that visited `/regist/confirm`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "session"
   FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
   WHERE "path" = '/regist/confirm'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Explore sessions that visited pages under `/regist/`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "session"
   FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
   WHERE "path" LIKE '/regist/%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List all actions for a specific session (replace with actual session ID):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "path", "stamp"
   FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
   WHERE "session" = 'example_session_id'
   ORDER BY "stamp" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Check the timestamps to understand the format and ordering:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "stamp"
   FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
   ORDER BY "stamp" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Count how many times each session appears (i.e., number of actions per session):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", COUNT(*) AS action_count
   FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
   GROUP BY "session"
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Retrieve sessions with both `/regist/input` and `/regist/confirm`:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "session"
    FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
    WHERE "path" IN ('/regist/input', '/regist/confirm')
    GROUP BY "session"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "path") = 2
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

    *Note:* The above query identifies sessions that visited both pages, regardless of order.

11. **List the sequence of pages visited in sessions containing `/regist/` paths:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", "path", "stamp"
    FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
    WHERE "path" LIKE '/regist/%'
    ORDER BY "session", "stamp" ASC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Find the most common actions performed on `/regist/input`:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "action", COUNT(*) AS action_count
    FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
    WHERE "path" = '/regist/input'
    GROUP BY "action"
    ORDER BY action_count DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Identify sessions where `/regist/input` page was visited multiple times:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", COUNT(*) AS visit_count
    FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
    WHERE "path" = '/regist/input'
    GROUP BY "session"
    HAVING visit_count > 1
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Check if there are any status codes indicating form submission success or failure:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "status"
    FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Find sessions where `/regist/confirm` was the last page visited:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", MAX("stamp") AS last_stamp
    FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
    GROUP BY "session"
    HAVING MAX("path") = '/regist/confirm'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help us understand the data structure, the values within the relevant columns, and how we might use them to solve the task at hand.

Task: How many unique sessions visited the /regist/input page and then the /regist/confirm page, in that order?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of unique sessions that visited the `/regist/input` page followed by the `/regist/confirm` page in that order, we present the following table:

```csv
unique_sessions
num:int > 0
```

This table indicates the count (`num`) of unique sessions where users navigated from the `/regist/input` page to the `/regist/confirm` page sequentially..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LOG': {'LOG': ['ACCESS_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_IP', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE', 'ACTIVITY_LOG', 'APP1_MST_USERS', 'APP2_MST_USERS', 'DUP_ACTION_LOG', 'FORM_ERROR_LOG', 'FORM_LOG', 'INVALID_ACTION_LOG', 'MST_CATEGORIES', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20161201', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20170101', 'MST_USERS', 'MST_USERS_WITH_CARD_NUMBER', 'PRODUCT_SALES', 'PURCHASE_LOG', 'READ_LOG']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive and negative signs.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of unique sessions that visited the `/regist/input` page followed by the `/regist/confirm` page in that order, we present the following table:

```csv
unique_sessions
num:int > 0
```

This table indicates the count (`num`) of unique sessions where users navigated from the `/regist/input` page to the `/regist/confirm` page sequentially. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

This table indicates the count (`1`) of unique sessions where users navigated from the `/regist/input` page to the `/regist/confirm` page sequentially.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "session") AS unique_sessions
FROM (
    SELECT "session",
        MIN(CASE WHEN "path" = '/regist/input' THEN TO_TIMESTAMP("stamp") END) AS input_stamp,
        MIN(CASE WHEN "path" = '/regist/confirm' THEN TO_TIMESTAMP("stamp") END) AS confirm_stamp
    FROM LOG.LOG.FORM_LOG
    GROUP BY "session"
) AS sub
WHERE input_stamp IS NOT NULL AND confirm_stamp IS NOT NULL AND input_stamp < confirm_stamp;
