   - **"order_id"**: Identifies each customer order; used to link orders with delivery and cancellation status.
   - **"pizza_id"**: Indicates which pizza was ordered; used to determine the pizza type and base price.
   - **"extras"**: Contains extra toppings added to the pizza; each extra topping adds $1 to the price.
   - **"exclusions"**: Contains toppings excluded from the pizza; not directly affecting the price.
   - **"order_time"**: Time when the order was placed; could be used for time-based analysis.

2. **PIZZA_NAMES**
   - **"pizza_id"**: Links to the pizzas ordered; used to identify the pizza type.
   - **"pizza_name"**: The name of the pizza (e.g., 'Meat Lovers', 'Vegetarian'); necessary for determining the base price.

3. **PIZZA_RUNNER_ORDERS**
   - **"order_id"**: Links to customer orders; used to determine if an order was delivered or canceled.
   - **"cancellation"**: Indicates if the order was canceled; we need to exclude canceled orders from the total income calculation.
   - **"pickup_time"**: Time when the runner picked up the order; may be useful for delivery analysis.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Exclude canceled orders**: Only include orders where "cancellation" is `NULL`.
- **Select specific pizzas**: Focus on orders where "pizza_name" is 'Meat Lovers' or 'Vegetarian'.
- **Calculate extra toppings**: Parse the "extras" column to count the number of extra toppings per order.

**Note:**

- **[meat_lovers_pizza_id]** and **[vegetarian_pizza_id]** are placeholders for the actual `pizza_id` values corresponding to 'Meat Lovers' and 'Vegetarian' pizzas, which can be obtained from queries 2 and 3.
- Queries are designed to explore the data in relevant columns and understand the relationships between orders, pizzas, and cancellations.
- The `LENGTH("extras") - LENGTH(REPLACE("extras", ',', '')) + 1` calculation in queries 12 and 20 counts the number of commas in the "extras" string to determine the number of extra toppings.

These queries will help in understanding the values in the relevant columns and shape the data needed to calculate the total income from 'Meat Lovers' and 'Vegetarian' pizzas, including extra toppings and excluding canceled orders.Query:

Task: Calculate the total income from Meat Lovers pizzas priced at $12 and Vegetarian pizzas at $10. Include any extra toppings charged at $1 each. Ensure that canceled orders are filtered out. How much money has Pizza Runner earned in total?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
total_income
amount: float
```

To calculate the total income, we sum the revenue from Meat Lovers pizzas priced at $12 each and Vegetarian pizzas priced at $10 each, including $1 for each extra topping. Canceled orders are excluded from this calculation..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'MODERN_DATA': {'MODERN_DATA': ['COMPANIES_DATES', 'COMPANIES_FUNDING', 'COMPANIES_INDUSTRIES', 'INCOME_TREES', 'PIZZA_CLEAN_CUSTOMER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_CLEAN_RUNNER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_CUSTOMER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_GET_EXCLUSIONS', 'PIZZA_GET_EXTRAS', 'PIZZA_NAMES', 'PIZZA_RECIPES', 'PIZZA_RUNNERS', 'PIZZA_RUNNER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_TOPPINGS', 'STATISTICS', 'TREES', 'WORD_LIST']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-17 23:44:21 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Calculate the total income from Meat Lovers pizzas priced at $12 and Vegetarian pizzas at $10. Include any extra toppings charged at $1 each. Ensure that canceled orders are filtered out. How much money has Pizza Runner earned in total?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
total_income
amount: float
```

To calculate the total income, we sum the revenue from Meat Lovers pizzas priced at $12 each and Vegetarian pizzas priced at $10 each, including $1 for each extra topping. Canceled orders are excluded from this calculation. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-17 23:44:54 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Calculate the total income from Meat Lovers pizzas priced at $12 and Vegetarian pizzas at $10. Include any extra toppings charged at $1 each. Ensure that canceled orders are filtered out. How much money has Pizza Runner earned in total?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
total_income
amount: float
```

To calculate the total income, we sum the revenue from Meat Lovers pizzas priced at $12 each and Vegetarian pizzas priced at $10 each, including $1 for each extra topping. Canceled orders are excluded from this calculation. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Usage of ST_INTERSECTS: ST_INTERSECTS(geometry1, ST_GEOGFROMWKB(geometry2)) This function checks if the two geometries intersect. The first argument, geometry1, is compared with the second argument, geometry2, which is converted from its WKB (Well-Known Binary) representation to a geography type using ST_GEOGFROMWKB. If the two geometries share any portion of space, the function returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE. Usage of ST_CONTAINS: ST_CONTAINS(r1.geometry, r2.geometry) This function checks if the geometry r1.geometry completely contains the geometry r2.geometry. It returns TRUE if all points of r2.geometry are within r1.geometry and FALSE otherwise. This is useful for spatial containment queries, such as verifying whether one region is entirely within another. ARRAY_INTERSECTION(nodes1, nodes2): This function computes the intersection of the two arrays, returning a new array containing only the elements that are present in both nodes1 and nodes2. ARRAY_SIZE(...): This function then determines the size (or number of elements) in the resulting array from the intersection.
