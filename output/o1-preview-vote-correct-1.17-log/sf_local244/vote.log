After comparing the three SQL queries, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer for the following reasons:

- **Clarity and Efficiency**: The query in `0result.sql` succinctly calculates the necessary boundaries for categorizing tracks into 'Short', 'Medium', and 'Long' using the `WITH boundaries` CTE. This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

- **Accurate Categorization**: It correctly computes the midpoints between minimum, average, and maximum durations to define the categories, ensuring that the tracks are classified appropriately based on their durations.

- **Proper Aggregation**: The query efficiently aggregates the minimum and maximum durations and total revenue for each category, fulfilling the requirement of outputting these statistics per category.

Therefore, the SQL query in `0result.sql` best addresses the task.
