The correct SQL query is:

```plain
2result.sql
```

**Reason:**

Both SQL queries aim to answer the task by retrieving the sizes of DICOM image files with the specified conditions. However, **`2result.sql`** is more precise and aligns better with SQL best practices for the following reasons:

1. **Use of Aliases:**
   - In **`2result.sql`**, table aliases (e.g., `t`) are consistently used throughout the query. This enhances readability and ensures that column references are unambiguous, especially when dealing with complex queries or joins.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     t."Modality" IN ('SEG', 'RTSTRUCT')
     ```
   - In contrast, **`1result.sql`** does not use aliases, which could lead to confusion in more complex queries.

2. **Concise Syntax:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses the `IN` operator for modality filtering:
     ```sql
     t."Modality" IN ('SEG', 'RTSTRUCT')
     ```
     This is more concise and scalable than using multiple `OR` conditions.
   - **`1result.sql`** uses:
     ```sql
     ("Modality" = 'SEG' OR "Modality" = 'RTSTRUCT')
     ```
     which is functionally correct but less concise.

3. **String Concatenation:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses the `CONCAT` function to construct the viewer URL:
     ```sql
     CONCAT('https://viewer.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/viewer/', t."StudyInstanceUID") AS "viewer_url"
     ```
     This is standard and clear across different SQL dialects.
   - **`1result.sql`** uses the `||` operator for string concatenation:
     ```sql
     'https://viewer.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/viewer/' || "StudyInstanceUID" AS "viewer_url"
     ```
     While this may work in some SQL dialects, it is less universally accepted and could lead to compatibility issues.

4. **Consistent Formatting and Clarity:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses indentation and spacing that enhance readability, which is important for maintaining and understanding SQL code.
   - It also clearly labels the size column as `"TotalSizeKB"`, which conveys that it represents the total size in kilobytes.

5. **Functionality:**
   - Both queries perform the intended calculations and filtering, but **`2result.sql`** does so with clearer syntax and better practices.

6. **Compliance with Instructions:**
   - The float values are rounded to 4 decimal places in both queries using the `ROUND` function:
     ```sql
     ROUND(SUM(t."instance_size") / 1024, 4) AS "TotalSizeKB"
     ```
   - This ensures numerical values meet the specified precision.

**Conclusion:**

While both queries achieve the desired outcome, **`2result.sql`** is preferred due to its enhanced readability, adherence to SQL best practices, and clearer syntax. It is more maintainable and less prone to errors in diverse SQL environments.
