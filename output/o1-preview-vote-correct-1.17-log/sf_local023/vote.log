Upon reviewing the provided SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **1result.sql** is the correct and most appropriate answer.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Calculation of Total Runs:**
  - The query correctly calculates the total runs scored by each player (`TotalRuns` CTE) by joining the `BATSMAN_SCORED` table with `BALL_BY_BALL` and filtering for season 5 matches via the `MATCH` table.

- **Correct Determination of Matches Played:**
  - It accurately counts the number of matches each player participated in (`MatchesPlayed` CTE) by joining `PLAYER_MATCH` with `MATCH` for season 5.

- **Proper Handling of Dismissals:**
  - The query calculates the number of times each player was dismissed (`Dismissals` CTE) and uses a `COALESCE` function to handle players who were never dismissed, preventing division by zero errors.

- **Calculation of Averages:**
  - It computes both the average runs per match and the batting average with appropriate rounding to four decimal places.
  - The use of a `CASE` statement ensures that batting averages are correctly handled when a player hasn't been dismissed.

- **Efficient and Readable Structure:**
  - The query is structured with clear CTEs (Common Table Expressions), improving readability and maintainability.
  - The logical flow of computing total runs, matches played, dismissals, and then calculating averages is well-organized.

- **Consistent and Expected Results:**
  - The output matches the expected results for the top 5 players with the highest average runs per match in season 5, along with their batting averages.
