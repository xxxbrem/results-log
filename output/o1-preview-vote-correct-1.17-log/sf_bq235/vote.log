After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that `0result.sql` is the correct query to identify the healthcare provider with the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014.

**Reason:** 

- **Query Structure:** `0result.sql` correctly uses a full outer join to combine inpatient and outpatient average payments for each provider based on the `"provider_id"`. It handles cases where a provider might only appear in one of the datasets by using `NVL` to treat missing values as `0`.
  
- **Grouping and Aggregation:** It groups by `"provider_id"` and uses `MAX("provider_name")` to ensure that each provider is listed once, even if there are variations in the provider names across records.

- **Data Accuracy:** The query calculates the combined average cost by summing the average inpatient and outpatient payments for each provider, which accurately reflects the total average cost incurred by each provider.

**Rounded Values:** The combined average costs are rounded to 4 decimal places using the `ROUND` function, as specified.

**Result:** According to the query, **Unity Medical and Surgical Hospital** (provider_id **150177**) incurs the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014, with a combined average cost of **141636.0000**.
