After analyzing the provided SQL scripts and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL script that addresses the task accurately. Here's the reasoning:

**Comparison of the SQL Scripts:**

1. **`0result.sql`**

   - **Approach:**
     - Calculates the total picked quantity per product.
     - Determines the number of inventory batches used based on FIFO.
     - Computes the average units picked by dividing the total picked quantity by the number of batches used.
   - **Issue:**
     - Dividing the total picked quantity by the number of batches used doesn't accurately represent the average units picked per picking instance.
     - The average should be based on the actual quantities picked in each instance, not the number of batches.

2. **`1result.sql`**

   - **Approach:**
     - Directly calculates the average quantity picked per picking line from the `PICKING_LINE` table.
     - Does not consider the FIFO method or inventory batches.
   - **Issue:**
     - Ignores the FIFO aspect of the task.
     - While it provides the average per picking line, it doesn't account for how the FIFO method affects the quantities picked from different inventory batches.

3. **`2result.sql`**

   - **Approach:**
     - Calculates the total picked quantity per product.
     - Retrieves inventory batches ordered by purchase date (FIFO).
     - Determines the amount picked from each batch using FIFO logic.
     - Calculates the average quantity picked by averaging the amounts picked from each batch.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Accurately implements the FIFO method to determine how much was picked from each batch.
     - The average is based on the quantities picked per batch, considering the FIFO allocation.
     - Aligns with the task requirement to use the FIFO method in calculating the average units picked.

**Reasoning:**

- **`2result.sql`** correctly applies the FIFO principle by allocating the picked quantities from the oldest inventory batches first.
- It provides an average that reflects the actual quantities picked from each batch, which is essential when considering FIFO.
- The results match the expected averages when FIFO is appropriately applied.

**Conclusion:**

```plain
2result.sql
```
