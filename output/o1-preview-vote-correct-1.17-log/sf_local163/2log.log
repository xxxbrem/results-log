**Relevant Table and Columns:**

- **Table:** `UNIVERSITY_FACULTY`

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `"FacRank"`: Used to identify the rank of each faculty member (e.g., Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor) and to group faculty members by rank.

- `"FacSalary"`: Used to calculate the average salary for each rank and to find faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average within their respective ranks.

- `"FacFirstName"`: Used to retrieve faculty members' first names.

- `"FacLastName"`: Used to retrieve faculty members' last names.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Grouping by `"FacRank"` to compute average salaries per rank.
- Calculating the absolute difference between each faculty member's salary and the average salary of their rank.
- Ordering results to find the faculty members with salaries closest to the average.
- Filtering out any records where `"FacSalary"` might be `NULL` or zero to ensure accurate calculations.

---

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **Retrieve all distinct faculty ranks:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "FacRank"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY;
   ```

2. **Count the total number of faculty members:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "TotalFaculty"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY;
   ```

3. **Count faculty members in each rank:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", COUNT(*) AS "FacultyCount"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   GROUP BY "FacRank";
   ```

4. **Get a list of faculty members with their salaries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   ORDER BY "FacSalary" DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Find the minimum and maximum salaries among all faculty members:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("FacSalary") AS "MinimumSalary", MAX("FacSalary") AS "MaximumSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY;
   ```

6. **Calculate the average salary for each rank:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   GROUP BY "FacRank";
   ```

7. **Identify faculty members without salary information:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   WHERE "FacSalary" IS NULL;
   ```

8. **List faculty members earning below a certain salary threshold:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   WHERE "FacSalary" < 50000;
   ```

9. **Count faculty members in each department:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacDept", COUNT(*) AS "FacultyCount"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   GROUP BY "FacDept";
   ```

10. **Retrieve hire dates of faculty members to understand tenure distribution:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "FacHireDate"
    FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
    ORDER BY "FacHireDate" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **List the salaries of faculty members along with their ranks and departments:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacDept", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
    FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Find average salaries per department:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "FacDept", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
    FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
    GROUP BY "FacDept";
    ```

13. **Retrieve faculty members supervised by a specific supervisor:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacSupervisor"
    FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
    WHERE "FacSupervisor" = 101;  -- Replace 101 with a valid supervisor ID
    ```

14. **Identify faculty members hired after a certain date:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacHireDate"
    FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
    WHERE "FacHireDate" > '2010-01-01';
    ```

15. **Find the distribution of faculty members across cities:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "FacCity", COUNT(*) AS "FacultyCount"
    FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
    GROUP BY "FacCity";
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution and characteristics of faculty members in terms of rank, salary, department, hire date, and other attributes. They provide insights necessary to approach the task of finding faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary within their respective ranks.Query:

Task: Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the university faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks, we analyzed the salaries within each rank and identified the faculty member with the minimal deviation from the average salary in that rank.

```csv
Rank,FirstName,LastName,Salary
Assistant Professor,FirstName1,LastName1,Salary:float closest to average for Assistant Professor
Associate Professor,FirstName2,LastName2,Salary:float closest to average for Associate Professor
Professor,FirstName3,LastName3,Salary:float closest to average for Professor
```

*Note:* The `Salary` values represent the salary amounts closest to the average salary for each respective rank..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': {'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': ['HARDWARE_DIM_CUSTOMER', 'HARDWARE_DIM_PRODUCT', 'HARDWARE_FACT_GROSS_PRICE', 'HARDWARE_FACT_MANUFACTURING_COST', 'HARDWARE_FACT_PRE_INVOICE_DEDUCTIONS', 'HARDWARE_FACT_SALES_MONTHLY', 'SALARYDATASET', 'STAFFHOURS', 'UNIVERSITY_COURSE', 'UNIVERSITY_ENROLLMENT', 'UNIVERSITY_FACULTY', 'UNIVERSITY_OFFERING', 'UNIVERSITY_STUDENT', 'WEB_ACCOUNTS', 'WEB_EVENTS', 'WEB_ORDERS', 'WEB_REGION', 'WEB_SALES_REPS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
