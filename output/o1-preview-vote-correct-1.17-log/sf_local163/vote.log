After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is **`1result.sql`**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Handling Ties Appropriately:**
   - **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`)** uses the `RANK()` window function, which assigns the same rank to faculty members with equal salary differences from the average. This means it correctly includes all faculty members whose salaries are equally close to the average for their rank.
   - **Candidates 0 and 2** use `ROW_NUMBER()`, which assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within a partition. This can exclude records in the case of ties because only one row per rank is assigned a row number of 1, even if multiple faculty members have the same minimal salary difference.

2. **Inclusion of All Closest Faculty Members:**
   - **Candidate 1** includes both **LEONARD FIBON** and **JULIA MILLS** for the rank of Associate Professor because both have a salary difference of **$2,500** from the average salary of their rank. This is accurate and aligns with the requirement to find all faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average.
   - **Candidates 0 and 2** only include one of these faculty members due to the use of `ROW_NUMBER()`, which does not account for ties in the same way as `RANK()` does.

3. **Correct Salary Rounding:**
   - **Candidate 1** correctly rounds the salary values to 4 decimal places using the `ROUND` function, ensuring consistency with the requirement.

**Therefore, `1result.sql` is the correct SQL query as it accurately identifies all faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks, including cases where multiple members are equally close.**
