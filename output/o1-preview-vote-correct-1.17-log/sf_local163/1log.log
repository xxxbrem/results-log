Begin Exploring Related Columns
Consider the relevant table, columns, and their potential usage:

**Table**: `UNIVERSITY_FACULTY`

- `"FacRank"`: Used to group faculty members by rank and calculate the average salary for each rank.
- `"FacSalary"`: Used to compare each faculty member's salary with the average salary of their respective rank.
- `"FacFirstName"`: Used to retrieve the first names of faculty members.
- `"FacLastName"`: Used to retrieve the last names of faculty members.

**Conditions that may be used**:

- Grouping faculty members by `"FacRank"`.
- Calculating the average salary per `"FacRank"`.
- Finding faculty members whose `"FacSalary"` is closest to the average salary of their `"FacRank"`.

Here are 10 simple, short, non-nested SQL queries to understand the values in related columns:

```sql
-- 1. Get all distinct faculty ranks
SELECT DISTINCT "FacRank"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY;

-- 2. Retrieve all faculty first names
SELECT DISTINCT "FacFirstName"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY;

-- 3. Retrieve all faculty last names
SELECT DISTINCT "FacLastName"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY;

-- 4. Retrieve all faculty salaries
SELECT DISTINCT "FacSalary"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY;

-- 5. Get a list of faculty members with their ranks and salaries
SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY;

-- 6. Get the average salary for each rank
SELECT "FacRank", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
GROUP BY "FacRank";

-- 7. Get the minimum and maximum salaries for each rank
SELECT "FacRank", MIN("FacSalary") AS "MinSalary", MAX("FacSalary") AS "MaxSalary"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
GROUP BY "FacRank";

-- 8. Count the number of faculty members in each rank
SELECT "FacRank", COUNT(*) AS "FacultyCount"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
GROUP BY "FacRank";

-- 9. Find faculty members with salaries above the average salary for their rank
SELECT f."FacFirstName", f."FacLastName", f."FacRank", f."FacSalary"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY f
JOIN (
    SELECT "FacRank", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
    FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
    GROUP BY "FacRank"
) avg_salaries ON f."FacRank" = avg_salaries."FacRank"
WHERE f."FacSalary" > avg_salaries."AverageSalary";

-- 10. List faculty members ordered by salary within each rank
SELECT "FacRank", "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacSalary"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
ORDER BY "FacRank", "FacSalary" ASC;
```

These queries help in understanding the values and distributions of the relevant columns, which is essential for solving the task.Query:
-- 1. Get all distinct faculty ranks
SELECT DISTINCT "FacRank"

Task: Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the university faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks, we first calculate the average salary for each rank. Then, we identify the faculty member(s) within each rank whose salary deviates the least from the average salary of that rank.

```csv
Rank,FirstName,LastName,Salary
rank1:str,first_name1:str,last_name1:str,salary1:float closest to avg(rank1)
rank2:str,first_name2:str,last_name2:str,salary2:float closest to avg(rank2)
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': {'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': ['HARDWARE_DIM_CUSTOMER', 'HARDWARE_DIM_PRODUCT', 'HARDWARE_FACT_GROSS_PRICE', 'HARDWARE_FACT_MANUFACTURING_COST', 'HARDWARE_FACT_PRE_INVOICE_DEDUCTIONS', 'HARDWARE_FACT_SALES_MONTHLY', 'SALARYDATASET', 'STAFFHOURS', 'UNIVERSITY_COURSE', 'UNIVERSITY_ENROLLMENT', 'UNIVERSITY_FACULTY', 'UNIVERSITY_OFFERING', 'UNIVERSITY_STUDENT', 'WEB_ACCOUNTS', 'WEB_EVENTS', 'WEB_ORDERS', 'WEB_REGION', 'WEB_SALES_REPS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
