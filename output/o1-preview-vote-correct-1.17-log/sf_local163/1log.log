This SQL query selects the faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks. It does the following:

- Calculates the average salary (`avg_salary`) for each rank (`"FacRank"`) using a window function.
- Computes the absolute difference (`salary_diff`) between each faculty member's salary and the average salary for their rank.
- Assigns a row number (`rn`) starting from 1 based on the smallest `salary_diff` within each rank.
- Selects the faculty member(s) where `rn = 1` for each rank, which means their salary is closest to the average.

**Note:** This query assumes that ranks are represented as `'ASST'`, `'ASSC'`, and `'PROF'` in the `"FacRank"` column, as per the data provided.

```

**Explanation:**

I apologize for the earlier error. The SQL compilation error occurred because we cannot nest window functions inside other expressions, like `ABS()`, when used within another window function (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER() OVER...`). To resolve this, we need to compute the average salaries separately and ensure that window functions are not nested.

Here's what the corrected query does:

1. **Compute the Average Salary per Rank:**
   - The subquery aliased as `a` calculates the average salary (`avg_salary`) for each faculty rank (`"FacRank"`).
   - This is done using a simple `GROUP BY` clause.

2. **Join Average Salaries Back to Faculty Data:**
   - We join the average salaries back to the faculty table `f` on the `FacRank` column.
   - This allows us to have both the individual faculty salaries and the average salary for their rank in the same row.

3. **Calculate Salary Difference and Assign Row Numbers:**
   - We compute the absolute difference (`salary_diff`) between each faculty member's salary and the average salary for their rank.
   - We then use the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to assign a row number (`rn`) within each rank partition, ordering by the salary difference in ascending order.

4. **Select the Faculty Member Closest to the Average Salary per Rank:**
   - In the outer query, we filter where `rn = 1` to select the faculty member(s) whose salary is closest to the average for their rank.
   - This gives us one faculty member per rank.

**Note:**

- All column names are enclosed in double quotations as per the database requirements.
- The query avoids nesting window functions by calculating the average salaries separately and using joins rather than nesting window functions inside expressions.
- The query only uses standard SQL constructs and does not include any Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with `WITH` clauses, in accordance with your instructions.

Please run this corrected query, and it should provide the desired results without any SQL compilation errors.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
Consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task.

**Relevant Table:**
- `EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**
- `"FacRank"`: Faculty rank. Used to group faculty members by rank to calculate average salaries.
- `"FacFirstName"`: Faculty first name. Used to display the first name of faculty members.
- `"FacLastName"`: Faculty last name. Used to display the last name of faculty members.
- `"FacSalary"`: Faculty salary. Used to calculate average salaries per rank and to find faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average for their rank.

**Conditions that may be used:**
- Exclude entries with null or zero salaries: `WHERE "FacSalary" IS NOT NULL AND "FacSalary" > 0`
- Filter by specific faculty rank: `WHERE "FacRank" = 'Assistant Professor'`
- Exclude entries with null ranks: `WHERE "FacRank" IS NOT NULL`

Below are at least 10 simple, short, non-nested SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

```sql
-- 1. Retrieve all distinct faculty ranks
SELECT DISTINCT "FacRank"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY;

-- 2. Retrieve all faculty first names and last names
SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
LIMIT 1000;

-- 3. Retrieve all distinct faculty salaries
SELECT DISTINCT "FacSalary"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
WHERE "FacSalary" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;

-- 4. Retrieve faculty members with non-null salaries
SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacSalary"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
WHERE "FacSalary" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;

-- 5. Retrieve faculty members of rank 'Assistant Professor'
SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
WHERE "FacRank" = 'Assistant Professor'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 6. Retrieve faculty members of rank 'Associate Professor'
SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
WHERE "FacRank" = 'Associate Professor'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 7. Retrieve faculty members of rank 'Professor'
SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
WHERE "FacRank" = 'Professor'
LIMIT 1000;

-- 8. Retrieve faculty members with salaries greater than a certain amount
SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacSalary"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
WHERE "FacSalary" > 50000
LIMIT 1000;

-- 9. Retrieve all distinct faculty departments
SELECT DISTINCT "FacDept"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY;

-- 10. Retrieve faculty members along with their hire dates
SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacHireDate"
FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
LIMIT 1000;
```

Each of these queries helps to understand the data in the `UNIVERSITY_FACULTY` table:

- Queries 1 and 9 identify the different ranks and departments available.
- Queries 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 retrieve faculty member names and their salaries under various conditions.
- Query 3 provides an overview of the range of salaries.
- Query 10 shows the hire dates of faculty members, which might be useful for further analysis.

Task: Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
FacRank,FacFirstName,FacLastName,FacSalary
Assistant Professor,FirstName1,LastName1,salary:float (closest to average for Assistant Professors)
Associate Professor,FirstName2,LastName2,salary:float (closest to average for Associate Professors)
Professor,FirstName3,LastName3,salary:float (closest to average for Professors)
```

This table lists the faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks. For each rank—Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor—we provide the faculty member's rank, first name, last name, and salary..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': {'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': ['HARDWARE_DIM_CUSTOMER', 'HARDWARE_DIM_PRODUCT', 'HARDWARE_FACT_GROSS_PRICE', 'HARDWARE_FACT_MANUFACTURING_COST', 'HARDWARE_FACT_PRE_INVOICE_DEDUCTIONS', 'HARDWARE_FACT_SALES_MONTHLY', 'SALARYDATASET', 'STAFFHOURS', 'UNIVERSITY_COURSE', 'UNIVERSITY_ENROLLMENT', 'UNIVERSITY_FACULTY', 'UNIVERSITY_OFFERING', 'UNIVERSITY_STUDENT', 'WEB_ACCOUNTS', 'WEB_EVENTS', 'WEB_ORDERS', 'WEB_REGION', 'WEB_SALES_REPS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 00:53:38 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
FacRank,FacFirstName,FacLastName,FacSalary
Assistant Professor,FirstName1,LastName1,salary:float (closest to average for Assistant Professors)
Associate Professor,FirstName2,LastName2,salary:float (closest to average for Associate Professors)
Professor,FirstName3,LastName3,salary:float (closest to average for Professors)
```

This table lists the faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks. For each rank—Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor—we provide the faculty member's rank, first name, last name, and salary. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
