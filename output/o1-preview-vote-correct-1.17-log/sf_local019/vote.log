After comparing the two SQL queries provided, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct choice. Here's the reasoning:

### Comparison and Reasoning:

1. **Duration Parsing:**

   - **`0result.sql`:**
     - Uses `LIKE` to check the format of the `"duration"` column (`'%:%:%'` for HH:MM:SS and `'%:%'` for MM:SS).
     - Parses the duration using `SPLIT_PART` and casts parts to `FLOAT`.
     - Applies `ROUND` to the computed total seconds, even though durations in seconds are integers.

   - **`2result.sql`:**
     - Counts the number of colons in the `"duration"` string to determine its format. This method is more precise and less error-prone.
     - Uses `TRY_TO_NUMBER` to safely convert split parts to numbers, handling any potential non-numeric values without causing errors.
     - Does not apply unnecessary rounding to integer duration values.

2. **Error Handling and Robustness:**

   - **`0result.sql`:**
     - Might fail or produce incorrect results if the `"duration"` field contains unexpected formats or non-numeric values.
     - Does not handle cases where the duration format doesn't match the expected patterns.

   - **`2result.sql`:**
     - Checks the exact number of colons to determine the format, ensuring accurate parsing.
     - Uses `TRY_TO_NUMBER`, which returns `NULL` for non-numeric values instead of causing an error.
     - Filters out any matches where the duration could not be parsed correctly by excluding `NULL` durations in the final selection.

3. **Float Rounding:**

   - **`0result.sql`:**
     - Applies `ROUND` to the total seconds but does not affect the result since durations in seconds are whole numbers.
     - The use of `FLOAT` and `ROUND` is unnecessary and could introduce confusion regarding the precision of duration values.

   - **`2result.sql`:**
     - Treats durations as integers since time in seconds is naturally an integer value.
     - Avoids unnecessary rounding, keeping the data accurate.

4. **Consistency and Clarity:**

   - **`2result.sql`** offers clearer logic by handling different duration formats systematically.
   - The code is more maintainable and understandable, making it better suited for accurate data retrieval.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above points, **`2result.sql`** is more robust, handles potential data issues better, and ensures accurate results. It correctly processes the duration fields and safely computes the shortest match duration.

### Output:

```plain
2result.sql
```
