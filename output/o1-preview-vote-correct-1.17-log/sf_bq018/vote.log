After comparing both SQL queries, we can conclude that **`0result.sql`** is the correct query for calculating the day with the highest COVID-19 confirmed case growth rate in the United States during March and April.

**Reasoning:**

- **Growth Rate Calculation:**
  - In **`0result.sql`**, the growth rate is calculated using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Growth Rate} = \frac{\text{Current Cumulative Confirmed} - \text{Previous Cumulative Confirmed}}{\text{Previous Cumulative Confirmed}}
    \]
    This represents the percentage change in total confirmed cases from the previous day, which is the standard method for calculating growth rates.
  - In **`2result.sql`**, the growth rate is calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Growth Rate} = \frac{\text{New Confirmed}}{\text{Previous Cumulative Confirmed}}
    \]
    While this also measures the change relative to previous cumulative cases, it directly uses `"new_confirmed"` values, which may be subject to anomalies or data inconsistencies.

- **Data Reliability:**
  - Using `"cumulative_confirmed"` provides a more reliable measure since cumulative data tends to smooth out day-to-day reporting variances and discrepancies.
  - `"new_confirmed"` can sometimes contain negative values or anomalies due to data corrections, which can distort growth rate calculations.

- **Consistency with Standard Metrics:**
  - The formula used in **`0result.sql`** aligns with standard epidemiological metrics for growth rates.
  - It ensures that the growth rate reflects the relative increase in total cases, which is crucial for identifying the day with the highest rate of new infections relative to the existing number of cases.

- **Final Output:**
  - Both queries output the same date (`03-09`), but **`0result.sql`** provides a more accurate and reliable calculation based on cumulative data.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
0result.sql
