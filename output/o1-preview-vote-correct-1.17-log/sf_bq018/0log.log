Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"COVID19_OPEN_DATA"` in database `"COVID19_OPEN_DATA"`, schema `"COVID19_OPEN_DATA"`.

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `"date"`: Used to filter data for March and April; identifies the specific day of data recording.
- `"new_confirmed"`: Represents the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases on a given date; essential for calculating the daily growth rate.
- `"cumulative_confirmed"`: Total confirmed cases up to a specific date; may be used to calculate growth trends.
- `"country_name"`: Used to filter data specifically for the United States.
- `"country_code"`: Country abbreviation; may assist in ensuring accurate country-specific data.
- `"aggregation_level"`: Indicates the geographical aggregation level of the data (e.g., country, state, county); used to select data at the country level.
- `"location_key"`: Unique identifier for each location; may be used to group or aggregate data.
- `"subregion1_name"`: Name of states within the United States; could be used if state-level data is needed.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `"country_name" = 'United States'`: To filter records for the United States.
- `"date" BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2020-04-30'`: To select dates in March and April.
- `"aggregation_level" = 0`: Assuming 0 represents country-level data aggregation.
- `"new_confirmed" IS NOT NULL`: To exclude records without new case data.

Task: Which day in March and April had the highest COVID-19 confirmed case growth rate in the United States? The format is MM-DD.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Date
MM-DD
```

The date in March or April with the highest COVID-19 confirmed case growth rate in the United States is represented as `MM-DD`, following the specified format. Without specific data, we use a placeholder to indicate the date..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'COVID19_OPEN_DATA': {'COVID19_OPEN_DATA': ['COMPATIBILITY_VIEW', 'COVID19_OPEN_DATA']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

The format is MM-DD., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Date
MM-DD
```

The date in March or April with the highest COVID-19 confirmed case growth rate in the United States is represented as `MM-DD`, following the specified format. Without specific data, we use a placeholder to indicate the date. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
