After comparing both SQL queries, the **second SQL query** (`2result.sql`) is the correct one. This is because it uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` to properly extract the `"confidence"` values from the `"cropHintsAnnotation"` JSON data in the `VISION_API_DATA` table. This approach ensures that the JSON array is correctly parsed and the `"confidence"` values are accurately compared to the threshold of `0.5`. The first SQL query may not reliably extract the confidence values due to potential issues with directly accessing nested JSON elements without flattening.
