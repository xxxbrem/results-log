**Comparison of the SQL Queries and Results:**

**Candidate 0 (0result.sql):**

- **SQL Query:**
  - Does not round the `net_migration` values.
  - Orders the results by the original `net_migration` values.

- **Result:**
  - Displays `net_migration` values with their original precision.

**Candidate 1 (1result.sql):**

- **SQL Query:**
  - Rounds the `net_migration` values to 4 decimal places using `ROUND("bdgr"."net_migration", 4) AS "net_migration_rate"`.
  - Orders the results by the rounded `net_migration_rate`.

- **Result:**
  - Displays `net_migration` values rounded to 4 decimal places.
  - Ordering is based on the rounded values.

**Candidate 2 (2result.sql):**

- **SQL Query:**
  - Rounds the `net_migration` values to 4 decimal places for display using `ROUND(bdgr."net_migration", 4) AS "net_migration_rate"`.
  - Orders the results by the original `net_migration` values (unrounded).

- **Result:**
  - Displays `net_migration` values rounded to 4 decimal places.
  - Ordering is based on the original, unrounded values.

**Reasoning:**

- The requirement specifies that the float values should be rounded to 4 decimal places **for display purposes**.
- However, when ordering the results, it's important to use the original `net_migration` values to maintain accurate sorting.
- Rounding before ordering (as in Candidate 1) could potentially alter the order if there are very close values that differ beyond the fourth decimal place.
- Candidate 2 effectively rounds the `net_migration` values for display while ordering by the accurate, unrounded values.

**Conclusion:**

Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`) is the correct SQL query because it fulfills the requirement to:

- Round the float values to 4 decimal places for display.
- Order the results based on the original `net_migration` values to ensure accurate sorting.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
