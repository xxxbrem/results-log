After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct choice.

**Reason:**

- **Data Representation:**
  - In the `FHFA_MORTGAGE_PERFORMANCE_TIMESERIES` table, the `"VALUE"` column stores percentages as decimal fractions. For example, 1% is represented as `0.01`.
  
- **First SQL (`1result.sql`):**
  - The query sums the `"VALUE"` without converting it to percentage form.
  - The resulting cumulative percentages are in decimal form (e.g., `0.013` for 1.3%).
  - This may not be immediately clear to users interpreting the results.

- **Second SQL (`2result.sql`):**
  - The query multiplies the sum of `"VALUE"` by 100 to convert decimal fractions to percentages.
  - The results are more readable and correctly represent the cumulative percentages (e.g., `1.3` for 1.3%).
  - Rounding is applied to four decimal places as specified.

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** provides the cumulative percentages in the correct format, making it the appropriate choice.
