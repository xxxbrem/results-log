Upon comparing the two SQL queries and their corresponding results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Handling of Zip Codes without Bank Locations:**
  - In `1result.sql`, the query uses a **`LEFT JOIN`** when joining the overlap ratios with the bank locations per zip code. It employs **`COALESCE`** to replace `NULL` values with `0` for zip codes that do not have any bank locations. This ensures that all zip codes are considered in the calculation, including those without bank locations, which is important for an accurate assessment of bank location concentration per block group.
  - In contrast, `0result.sql` uses an **`INNER JOIN`**, which excludes any zip codes that do not have bank locations. This could potentially skew the results by ignoring zip codes overlapping with block groups but lacking bank locations, leading to an overestimation of the concentration in zip codes with bank locations.

- **Robustness and Accuracy:**
  - The use of `COALESCE` and `LEFT JOIN` in `1result.sql` makes the calculation more robust by accounting for all possible scenarios, including zip codes without bank locations. This approach avoids omitting any relevant data and provides a more accurate representation of bank location distribution across block groups.
  - `0result.sql` may produce slightly higher values due to excluding certain zip codes, which can affect the overall calculation and result in less accurate conclusions.

- **Final Results:**
  - Both queries identify **zip code `80111`** as having the highest concentration of bank locations per block group, with `1result.sql` yielding a value of **28.9417** and `0result.sql` yielding **29.0022**.
  - The minimal difference in the results highlights the importance of proper data handling. `1result.sql` provides a slightly lower and more precise value due to its inclusive approach.

- **Float Precision:**
  - Both results are rounded to four decimal places as requested, ensuring consistency and adherence to the specification.

**Conclusion:**

Given the above considerations, **`1result.sql`** is preferred for its comprehensive data handling and more accurate calculation of bank locations per block group.
