After comparing both SQL queries, **`1result.sql`** is the correct one. This query uses the `LIKE` operator with `%rain%` and `%clear%` to include all atmospheric conditions that contain the words "rain" or "clear" in their names (e.g., "Rain," "Freezing Rain or Drizzle"). This ensures that all relevant accidents under rainy and clear conditions are counted. The second query only matches exact atmospheric condition names, which may exclude some pertinent data.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
