```plain
2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

The correct SQL query is **`2result.sql`** because it accurately identifies pseudo users who were active in the last **7 days but inactive in the last 2 days** as of January 7, 2021, based on the specified requirements.

**Explanation:**

- **Active Users (Last 7 Days excluding Last 2 Days):**

  In `2result.sql`, the `active_users` CTE (Common Table Expression) selects distinct `USER_PSEUDO_ID`s from events dated **January 1 to January 5, 2021**:

  ```sql
  WITH active_users AS (
      SELECT DISTINCT t."USER_PSEUDO_ID"
      FROM (
          SELECT * FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210101"
          UNION ALL
          SELECT * FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210102"
          UNION ALL
          SELECT * FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210103"
          UNION ALL
          SELECT * FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210104"
          UNION ALL
          SELECT * FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210105"
      ) t,
      LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."EVENT_PARAMS") AS flattened_params
      WHERE flattened_params.value:"key"::STRING = 'engagement_time_msec'
  ),
  ```

  This correctly targets users who were active **before** the last 2 days.

- **Inactive Users (Last 2 Days):**

  The `inactive_users` CTE selects distinct `USER_PSEUDO_ID`s from events dated **January 6 and January 7, 2021**:

  ```sql
  inactive_users AS (
      SELECT DISTINCT t."USER_PSEUDO_ID"
      FROM (
          SELECT * FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210106"
          UNION ALL
          SELECT * FROM "GA4"."GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE"."EVENTS_20210107"
      ) t,
      LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."EVENT_PARAMS") AS flattened_params
      WHERE flattened_params.value:"key"::STRING = 'engagement_time_msec'
  )
  ```

- **Final Result:**

  The final query counts the number of pseudo users who are in `active_users` but **not** in `inactive_users`:

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudo_user_count
  FROM active_users
  WHERE "USER_PSEUDO_ID" NOT IN (SELECT "USER_PSEUDO_ID" FROM inactive_users);
  ```

  This yields the number of users who were active in the last 7 days **excluding** the last 2 days and were inactive during the last 2 days.

**Why the other SQL queries are not correct:**

- **`0result.sql` and `1result.sql` include data from January 1 to January 7** in their definitions of active users:

  ```sql
  -- From 0result.sql
  WITH active_users_last_7_days AS (
      SELECT DISTINCT t."USER_PSEUDO_ID"
      FROM (
          SELECT * FROM GA4.GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE."EVENTS_20210101"
          UNION ALL
          ...
          SELECT * FROM GA4.GA4_OBFUSCATED_SAMPLE_ECOMMERCE."EVENTS_20210107"
      ) t,
      ...
  ),
  ```

  Including the last 2 days (January 6 and 7) in the `active_users_last_7_days` CTE means that users who were active during the last 2 days are not properly excluded in the final count. This does not align with the requirement to find users who were **inactive** in the last 2 days.

**Summary:**

- **`2result.sql`** correctly defines the active users and inactive users based on the specified date ranges, ensuring accurate results.

- The consistent result of **12,212 pseudo users** in `2result.sql` reflects the correct calculation according to the requirements.

- Float values are not applicable here as we are dealing with integer counts; however, any floating-point calculations would be rounded to 4 decimal places as per the instruction.

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that fulfills the task requirements.
