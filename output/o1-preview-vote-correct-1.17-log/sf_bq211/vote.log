After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, it's clear that all three queries are functionally equivalent and produce the same result. The only minor difference is the use of an alias `p` in `1result.sql`, which doesn't affect the outcome.

All three queries correctly count the number of patents that:

- Are granted between 2010 and 2023 (`"grant_date" BETWEEN 20100101 AND 20231231`),
- Have the country code 'CN' (`"country_code" = 'CN'`),
- Belong to families with more than one distinct application (`"family_id" IN (SELECT "family_id" FROM ... HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "application_number") > 1)`).

Each query returns a `number_of_patents` equal to **161**, which is the correct count based on the specified conditions.

**Reason for choosing `0result.sql`:**

- It is straightforward and without unnecessary aliases or modifications.
- It clearly and concisely represents the required logic.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plain
0result.sql
```
