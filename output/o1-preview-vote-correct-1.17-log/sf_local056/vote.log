After reviewing the provided SQL scripts and their results, the correct SQL script is `0result.sql`. Here's the reasoning:

- **Calculation of Average Monthly Change**:
  - Both `0result.sql` and `2result.sql` calculate the average of the absolute values of monthly changes in payment amounts using `AVG(ABS("monthly_change"))`. This method appropriately accounts for fluctuations in both increases and decreases in payments.
  - `1result.sql`, on the other hand, calculates the average of the raw monthly changes without taking the absolute value (`AVG("amount_change")`). This approach can result in positive and negative changes canceling each other out, potentially underestimating the true average fluctuation.

- **Consistency in Results**:
  - Both `0result.sql` and `2result.sql` identify **STEPHEN QUALLS** (customer_id **332**) as the customer with the highest average monthly change in payment amounts.
  - `1result.sql` identifies a different customer (**HECTOR POINDEXTER**, customer_id **487**), likely due to not using the absolute values of changes, which affects the accuracy of the result.

- **Float Rounding**:
  - In `0result.sql`, float values are rounded to four decimal places using the `ROUND` function as per the instruction: `ROUND(AVG(ABS("monthly_change")), 4)`.
  - This ensures that the average monthly change is precise and formatted correctly.

Given these points, `0result.sql` is the correct SQL script that accurately computes the customer with the highest average monthly change in payment amounts.
