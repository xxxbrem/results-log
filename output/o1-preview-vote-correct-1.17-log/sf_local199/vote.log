After carefully comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct and more reliable SQL query for the given task.

```plain
2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Date Parsing Accuracy:**
   - **`2result.sql`** explicitly parses the `"rental_date"` field by extracting the first 19 characters to match the format `'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'`. It uses the `SUBSTRING` function to remove the milliseconds (`.FFF`) part, ensuring that the date string matches the specified format in `TO_TIMESTAMP`.
     ```sql
     TO_TIMESTAMP(SUBSTRING(r."rental_date", 1, 19), 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS')
     ```
   - **`1result.sql`** uses `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ` on `"rental_date"` without specifying the format or handling the milliseconds, which might lead to inconsistencies or errors if the function does not correctly interpret the milliseconds part.

2. **Robustness and Compatibility:**
   - **`2result.sql`** is more robust as it explicitly handles the date format, making it less dependent on database-specific implementations or default date parsing behaviors.
   - By specifying the date format, **`2result.sql`** ensures compatibility across different database systems that might interpret date strings differently.

3. **Handling of NULL Values:**
   - **`2result.sql`** includes a `WHERE` clause to check for `NULL` values after parsing the timestamp, which adds an extra layer of data validation.
     ```sql
     WHERE
         TO_TIMESTAMP(SUBSTRING(r."rental_date", 1, 19), 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') IS NOT NULL
     ```
   - **`1result.sql`** does not perform this check, which could result in inaccurate results if there are any invalid dates.

4. **Clarity and Maintainability:**
   - The explicit format parsing in **`2result.sql`** makes the query clearer and easier to understand for someone maintaining the code, as it clearly documents how the date is being interpreted.

**Conclusion:**

While both queries produce the same results with the provided data, **`2result.sql`** is preferred due to its explicit handling of the date format, making it more reliable and maintainable. It ensures that the date parsing is accurate by matching the exact format of the `"rental_date"` field, which includes handling potential milliseconds in the data.

**Note:** There are no float values involved in the results of this query, so rounding to 4 decimal places is not applicable in this context.
