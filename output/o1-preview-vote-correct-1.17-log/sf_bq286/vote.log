After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I conclude that all three SQL queries correctly identify **'Bentley'** as the most popular female baby name in Wyoming for the year 2021, based on the proportion of female babies given that name compared to the total number of female babies given the same name across all states.

All three SQL queries perform the same calculations:
- They compute the total number of female babies for each name in Wyoming in 2021.
- They compute the total number of female babies for each name across the USA in 2021.
- They calculate the proportion by dividing the Wyoming count by the national count for each name.
- They order the results by the highest proportion and limit the output to the top result.

However, the first SQL (`0result.sql`) is written in a concise and straightforward manner, making it easier to read and understand. It uses subqueries and joins efficiently without additional complexity.

Therefore, I choose the first SQL query as the correct answer.

```plain
0result.sql
