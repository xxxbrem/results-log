**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Database**: `USA_NAMES`
- **Schema**: `USA_NAMES`
- **Table**: `USA_1910_CURRENT`

  This table is relevant as it likely contains data up to the most current year.

---

**Columns in `USA_1910_CURRENT`:**

1. **`"state"`**
   - **Potential Usage**: To identify and filter records by state (e.g., Wyoming).
2. **`"gender"`**
   - **Potential Usage**: To filter records by gender (e.g., female babies).
3. **`"year"`**
   - **Potential Usage**: To filter records by a specific year (e.g., 2021).
4. **`"name"`**
   - **Potential Usage**: To select and group by baby names.
5. **`"number"`**
   - **Potential Usage**: To access the count of babies given a particular name.

---

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Filter by State**: `"state" = 'State_Code_For_Wyoming'`
- **Filter by Gender**: `"gender" = 'F'` (assuming 'F' denotes female)
- **Filter by Year**: `"year" = 2021`

---

**Notes:**

- Replace `'State_Code_For_Wyoming'` with the actual state code for Wyoming as it appears in the `"state"` column. You can find this by running the second query to list all unique states.
- Ensure that the gender representation (e.g., `'F'` for female) matches the actual data in the `"gender"` column. You can confirm this with the third query.
- The `LIMIT 1000` clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned for performance considerations.
- All column names are enclosed in double quotations as per the instructions.
- The queries avoid nested structures and are independent of each other.
- These queries are designed to provide insights into the data structure, values, and distributions within the relevant columns, which can help in formulating the final analysis.

---

By executing these queries, you can gain an understanding of the data and verify assumptions about state codes, gender representations, available years, and the distribution of names. This information is crucial for accurately performing the analysis required for your task.Query:

Task: Can you tell me the name of the most popular female baby in Wyoming for the year 2021, based on the proportion of female babies given that name compared to the total number of female babies given the same name across all states?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the proportion of female babies given a specific name in Wyoming compared to the total number of female babies given that name across all states in 2021, the most popular female baby name in Wyoming is:

```csv
name,proportion
name:str,proportion:float between 0 and 1
```

This indicates that the name with the highest proportion of occurrences in Wyoming relative to its total occurrences nationwide is the most popular by this measure..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'USA_NAMES': {'USA_NAMES': ['USA_1910_2013', 'USA_1910_CURRENT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-16 19:26:17 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you tell me the name of the most popular female baby in Wyoming for the year 2021, based on the proportion of female babies given that name compared to the total number of female babies given the same name across all states?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Based on the proportion of female babies given a specific name in Wyoming compared to the total number of female babies given that name across all states in 2021, the most popular female baby name in Wyoming is:

```csv
name,proportion
name:str,proportion:float between 0 and 1
```

This indicates that the name with the highest proportion of occurrences in Wyoming relative to its total occurrences nationwide is the most popular by this measure. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
