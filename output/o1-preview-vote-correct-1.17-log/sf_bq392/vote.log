After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct query.

**Reason:**

- **Aggregation:** `2result.sql` calculates the **average temperature per date** by grouping the data using `GROUP BY "year", "mo", "da"`. This ensures that if there are multiple records for a single day, the average temperature is accurately computed.
  
- **Accuracy:** In datasets where multiple temperature readings might exist for the same day, aggregating ensures we consider all available data. Even though our preliminary queries suggest no multiple records per day in October 2009 for station `723758`, it's good practice to account for such possibilities for data accuracy.
  
- **Data Integrity:** `1result.sql` does not perform any aggregation and simply selects individual records. If duplicate records exist for a day, it might return a single record without reflecting the true average temperature for that date.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plain
2result.sql
```
