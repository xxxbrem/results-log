After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that `1result.sql` is the correct and most suitable answer for the following reasons:

1. **Adherence to Requirements**: The query in `1result.sql` adheres to the specified requirements by:
   - Enclosing all column names and aliases in double quotations.
   - Avoiding the use of `WITH` clauses (CTEs), as per the instruction to have each query be independent.
   - Using clear and consistent formatting, which improves readability.

2. **Correctness and Consistency**:
   - It correctly calculates the total number of wins for each team by summing home and away wins.
   - The query joins the aggregated results with the `TEAM` table to retrieve the team names.
   - The results match the expected output, listing the top 10 teams with the most wins across the league.

3. **Results Handling**:
   - Although the instruction mentions rounding float values to four decimal places, the `total_wins` in this context are integer counts. Therefore, rounding is not applicable, and the query appropriately returns integer values.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
