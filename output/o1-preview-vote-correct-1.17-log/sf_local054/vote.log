After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, here's the analysis:

---

### **0result.sql**

```sql
SELECT "CUSTOMERS"."FirstName", ROUND(SUM("INVOICE_ITEMS"."UnitPrice" * "INVOICE_ITEMS"."Quantity"), 4) AS "AmountSpent"
FROM "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."INVOICE_ITEMS"
JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."TRACKS" ON "INVOICE_ITEMS"."TrackId" = "TRACKS"."TrackId"
JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."ALBUMS" ON "TRACKS"."AlbumId" = "ALBUMS"."AlbumId"
JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."ARTISTS" ON "ALBUMS"."ArtistId" = "ARTISTS"."ArtistId"
JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."INVOICES" ON "INVOICE_ITEMS"."InvoiceId" = "INVOICES"."InvoiceId"
JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."CUSTOMERS" ON "INVOICES"."CustomerId" = "CUSTOMERS"."CustomerId"
WHERE "ARTISTS"."ArtistId" = 90
GROUP BY "CUSTOMERS"."CustomerId", "CUSTOMERS"."FirstName"
HAVING SUM("INVOICE_ITEMS"."UnitPrice" * "INVOICE_ITEMS"."Quantity") < 1;
```

- **Artist Selection**: This query selects customers who purchased tracks from the artist with `ArtistId = 90`.
- **Limitation**: It assumes that the best-selling artist has `ArtistId = 90`.
- **Result**:

  ```
  FirstName,AmountSpent
  Stanisław,0.99
  Ladislav,0.99
  Eduardo,0.99
  Hugh,0.99
  Edward,0.99
  ```

### **1result.sql**

```sql
SELECT c."FirstName",
       ROUND(SUM(ii."UnitPrice" * ii."Quantity"), 4) AS "AmountSpent"
FROM "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."CUSTOMERS" c
JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."INVOICES" inv ON c."CustomerId" = inv."CustomerId"
JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."INVOICE_ITEMS" ii ON inv."InvoiceId" = ii."InvoiceId"
JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."TRACKS" t ON ii."TrackId" = t."TrackId"
JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."ALBUMS" alb ON t."AlbumId" = alb."AlbumId"
JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."ARTISTS" ar ON alb."ArtistId" = ar."ArtistId"
WHERE ar."Name" = 'Iron Maiden'
GROUP BY c."CustomerId", c."FirstName"
HAVING SUM(ii."UnitPrice" * ii."Quantity") < 1.00
ORDER BY c."FirstName";
```

- **Artist Selection**: This query selects customers who purchased tracks from the artist named `'Iron Maiden'`.
- **Limitation**: It assumes that `'Iron Maiden'` is the best-selling artist.
- **Result**:

  ```
  FirstName,AmountSpent
  Eduardo,0.99
  Edward,0.99
  Hugh,0.99
  Ladislav,0.99
  Stanisław,0.99
  ```

### **2result.sql**

```sql
WITH BestSellingArtist AS (
    SELECT
        A."ArtistId",
        A."Name",
        SUM(II."Quantity") AS TotalTracksSold
    FROM
        "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."INVOICE_ITEMS" II
        JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."TRACKS" T ON II."TrackId" = T."TrackId"
        JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."ALBUMS" AL ON T."AlbumId" = AL."AlbumId"
        JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."ARTISTS" A ON AL."ArtistId" = A."ArtistId"
    GROUP BY
        A."ArtistId",
        A."Name"
    ORDER BY
        TotalTracksSold DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT
    C."FirstName",
    ROUND(SUM(II."UnitPrice" * II."Quantity"), 4) AS "Amount"
FROM
    "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."CUSTOMERS" C
    JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."INVOICES" I ON C."CustomerId" = I."CustomerId"
    JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."INVOICE_ITEMS" II ON I."InvoiceId" = II."InvoiceId"
    JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."TRACKS" T ON II."TrackId" = T."TrackId"
    JOIN "CHINOOK"."CHINOOK"."ALBUMS" AL ON T."AlbumId" = AL."AlbumId"
    JOIN BestSellingArtist BSA ON AL."ArtistId" = BSA."ArtistId"
GROUP BY
    C."CustomerId",
    C."FirstName"
HAVING
    SUM(II."UnitPrice" * II."Quantity") < 1.0000;
```

- **Artist Selection**: This query dynamically identifies the best-selling artist based on total tracks sold.
- **Advantage**: It ensures accuracy even if the best-selling artist changes in the data.
- **Result**:

  ```
  FirstName,Amount
  Stanisław,0.99
  Ladislav,0.99
  Eduardo,0.99
  Edward,0.99
  Hugh,0.99
  ```

### **Conclusion**

- **Queries 0 and 1** hard-code the artist as `ArtistId = 90` or `Name = 'Iron Maiden'`, assuming that this artist is the best-selling one. While the results are correct based on the current data, these queries won't adapt if the best-selling artist changes.
- **Query 2** dynamically calculates the best-selling artist by summing the total tracks sold per artist and selecting the one with the highest sales. It then finds customers who spent less than $1 on that artist's tracks.

### **Correct Answer**

Given that the task is to find customers who spent less than $1 on tracks by the **best-selling artist**, it's essential to dynamically determine who that artist is.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plain
2result.sql
```

This query ensures that:

- The best-selling artist is accurately identified based on the data.
- The customers who spent less than $1 on that artist are correctly retrieved.
- It satisfies the requirement even if the data changes in the future.
