Based on the comparison of the SQL scripts and their correctness in calculating the Z-scores for the daily counts of 'PUBLIC INTOXICATION' incidents in Austin for the year 2016, the **`1result.sql`** script is the correct choice.

**Reason:**

1. **Date Filtering:** The script correctly filters the data to include only incidents from the year 2016 by specifying:

   ```sql
   WHERE "date" BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2016-12-31'
   ```

2. **Accurate Standard Deviation Calculation:** It uses the **sample standard deviation** function `STDDEV_SAMP()` which is appropriate when dealing with a sample of data (even though we have all incidents from 2016, treating them as a sample is statistically prudent):

   ```sql
   STDDEV_SAMP(incident_count) OVER ()
   ```

3. **Z-Score Calculation:** The Z-scores are calculated using window functions, which efficiently compute the mean and standard deviation over the entire dataset without the need for additional joins or cross joins:

   ```sql
   (incident_count - AVG(incident_count) OVER ())
   ----------------------------------------------
   NULLIF(STDDEV_SAMP(incident_count) OVER (), 0)
   ```

4. **Rounding Float Values:** The script ensures that the Z-score values are rounded to 4 decimal places as per the requirement:

   ```sql
   ROUND(..., 4) AS z_score
   ```

5. **Selecting the Second Highest Z-Score:** By ordering the results in descending order of Z-score and using `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1`, it retrieves the date with the second highest Z-score:

   ```sql
   ORDER BY z_score DESC NULLS LAST
   LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
   ```

6. **Conciseness and Readability:** The script is concise and uses nested subqueries, making it easier to read and understand without compromising on correctness.

Given these points, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script that accurately computes the desired result.

```plain
1result.sql
