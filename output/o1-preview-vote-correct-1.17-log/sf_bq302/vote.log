```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice for the following reasons:

1. **Case Insensitivity:** The first SQL uses `LOWER("tags")` to perform a case-insensitive match when checking if a question is tagged with 'python'. This ensures that any variations in case (e.g., 'Python', 'PYTHON') are accounted for, providing a more accurate count.

   ```sql
   SUM(CASE WHEN '|' || LOWER("tags") || '|' LIKE '%|python|%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
   ```

2. **Proper Handling of Month Names:** The first SQL produces correct month abbreviations (e.g., 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar') by using:

   ```sql
   TO_CHAR(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("creation_date" / 1e6), 'Mon') AS "Month"
   ```

   In contrast, the second SQL results in incorrect month names like 'Janth', 'Febth', 'Marth', indicating a formatting issue.

3. **Formatting of Month Numbers:** The first SQL uses:

   ```sql
   TO_CHAR(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("creation_date" / 1e6)), '00') AS "Month_num"
   ```

   This correctly formats the month numbers with leading zeros (e.g., '01', '02', '03').

4. **Consistent and Accurate Results:** The proportions calculated in `1result.sql` are consistent and accurate, matching closely with those in `2result.sql`, but with correct formatting. Any minor differences are due to rounding at the fourth decimal place.

5. **Simplicity and Clarity:** The first SQL is straightforward and avoids unnecessary conditions. By ensuring that the tags are converted to lowercase, it eliminates the need for additional null or empty string checks, assuming that all questions have tags (as indicated by the queries showing all entries have non-null tags).

**Therefore, `1result.sql` is preferred for its accuracy, proper formatting, and comprehensive handling of data.**
