After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct query to determine the date before 2022 with the highest total transaction amount in the Zilliqa blockchain data. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Filtering Criteria:**
   - **`2result.sql`** filters transactions that are:
     - **Before 2022:** `WHERE "block_timestamp" < 1640995200000000`
     - **Accepted and Successful:** `AND "success" = TRUE AND "accepted" = TRUE`
     - **Positive Amounts:** `AND "amount" > 0`
   - This ensures that only valid and meaningful transactions are included in the calculation.

2. **Rounding of Values:**
   - The query specifically rounds the total transaction amount to **4 decimal places** using `ROUND(SUM("amount"), 4) AS "total_amount"`, as per the requirement.

3. **Consistency with Results:**
   - Both **`1result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** return the same date (`2020-11-06`) and total amount (`55548901182319524666.0000`), but **`2result.sql`** includes the rounding to 4 decimal places.
   - **`0result.sql`** returns a different date with a significantly higher total amount, but it does not filter out unsuccessful or unaccepted transactions, which might include invalid or anomalous data.

4. **Data Validity:**
   - By including only accepted and successful transactions with positive amounts, **`2result.sql`** provides a trustworthy and accurate result.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
