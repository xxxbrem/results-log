After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer for the following reasons:

1. **Data Integrity Checks:**
   - **`2result.sql`** includes `IS NOT NULL` conditions for both `"team_id"` and goals in the subqueries:
     ```sql
     WHERE "home_team_api_id" IS NOT NULL AND "home_team_goal" IS NOT NULL
     ```
     This ensures that any potential `NULL` values in the team IDs or goals are excluded from the calculations, leading to accurate results.

2. **Standard SQL Functions:**
   - It uses the **`PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)`** function, which is part of the SQL standard for calculating percentiles and medians over ordered sets.
   - In contrast, **`1result.sql`** uses **`MEDIAN`** as an aggregate function, which may not be supported in all SQL dialects.

3. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - The query is structured clearly, making it easy to understand each step of the computation process.
   - It explicitly handles potential `NULL` values, enhancing its robustness.

4. **Consistent Results:**
   - All three queries produce the same result—**`48.000`**—for the median of the highest season goals per team, but **`2result.sql`** does so with better data validation.

5. **Float Precision Handling:**
   - While the other queries may not handle float precision explicitly, **`2result.sql`** ensures accurate calculation by properly considering data types and potential anomalies.

Therefore, the correct SQL to use is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
