After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculation of Median GDP:**
   - Both queries aim to calculate the median GDP (constant 2015 US$) for each region and identify the region with the highest median GDP.
   - **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`)** uses the `MEDIAN` function to calculate the median GDP per region.
   - **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`)** uses the `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY id."value")` function, which is a standard SQL method to compute the median. This method is widely supported and considered standard practice for calculating medians in SQL.

2. **Year Selection:**
   - **Candidate 0** selects the maximum year dynamically using a subquery:
     ```sql
     AND id."year" = (
       SELECT MAX("year")
       FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."INDICATORS_DATA"
       WHERE "indicator_code" = 'NY.GDP.MKTP.KD'
     )
     ```
   - **Candidate 1** explicitly uses the year `2020`:
     ```sql
     AND id."year" = 2020
     ```
   - Both methods are acceptable. However, using the explicit year `2020` ensures clarity, especially if `2020` is the most recent year with complete data.

3. **Rounding of Values:**
   - **Candidate 1** includes the `ROUND` function to round the median GDP values to 4 decimal places:
     ```sql
     ROUND(
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY id."value"), 4
     ) AS "median_gdp_constant_2015_usd"
     ```
   - This aligns with the requirement to **ensure that float values are rounded to 4 decimal places**.

4. **Handling of NULL Values:**
   - Both queries filter out `NULL` values in GDP and ensure regions are not `NULL`.
   - **Candidate 0** adds `AND cs."region" != ''` to exclude empty strings, which may not be necessary if `NULL` handling is sufficient.

5. **Ordering and Limiting Results:**
   - Both queries order the results in descending order of median GDP and limit the output to the top region.

6. **Result Consistency and Compliance:**
   - Both queries produce the same result, identifying **North America** as the region with the highest median GDP (constant 2015 US$) value.
   - **Candidate 1** better complies with the specific instruction to round values to 4 decimal places.

**Conclusion:**

- **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`)** is the correct SQL query because it:
  - Uses a standard method for calculating the median.
  - Rounds the median GDP values to 4 decimal places as per the requirement.
  - Explicitly uses the most recent year (`2020`) for clarity.
  - Matches the desired output format and instructions.
