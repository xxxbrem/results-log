2025-01-18 03:22:46 - root - INFO - It appears that the error is due to an incorrect table reference in your SQL query. Based on the database schema provided earlier, the table `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` is located under the schema `CYBERSYN` and may require the full path including the additional `CYBERSYN`. Also, ensure that the `"VARIABLE"` you're filtering on matches one of the available values.

Please try the following corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "DATE", "TICKER", "VALUE"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
WHERE "TICKER" = 'TSLA' 
  AND "VARIABLE" = 'post-market_close'
  AND "DATE" >= '2024-01-01' 
  AND "DATE" <= '2024-06-30'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Table Reference Correction:** The table is likely located at `FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` (note the double `CYBERSYN`), as per the schema details.

- **Variable Value Adjustment:** Since the available `"VARIABLE"` values are `'all-day_high'`, `'all-day_low'`, `'post-market_close'`, `'pre-market_open'`, and `'nasdaq_volume'`, and you're interested in closing prices after the market closes, `'post-market_close'` is the appropriate value to filter on.

- **Date Range:** The date range remains the same, fetching records from January 1 to June 30, 2024.

Let me know if this resolves the issue or if you need further assistance.

2025-01-18 03:25:43 - root - INFO - It seems the error occurs because the table `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` may not be correctly referenced in your SQL query, or the `"VARIABLE"` value `'Close'` might not exist in the data.

Based on the schema information and previous findings:

1. **Table Path Correction:**

   The correct table path is likely:

   ```
   FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
   ```

   Note the double `CYBERSYN` in the schema path.

2. **Variable Value Correction:**

   From earlier results, the available `"VARIABLE"` values are:

   - `'all-day_high'`
   - `'all-day_low'`
   - `'post-market_close'`
   - `'pre-market_open'`
   - `'nasdaq_volume'`

   Since you're interested in closing prices, you should use `'post-market_close'` instead of `'Close'`.

**Adjusted SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "TICKER", COUNT(*)
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
WHERE "VARIABLE" = 'post-market_close' 
  AND "DATE" BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-06-30'
GROUP BY "TICKER"
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Table Reference:** Updated to include the correct schema path with the additional `CYBERSYN`.

- **Variable Value:** Changed `"VARIABLE" = 'Close'` to `"VARIABLE" = 'post-market_close'`, which matches one of the valid values.

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Adjusted Query:** Try executing the adjusted query to see if it resolves the error.

- **Verify Table Existence and Access:** Ensure that you have access to the `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` table within the `FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN` schema.

- **Check for Typos:** Double-check for any typos in the table name, schema, or column names.

**Additional Suggestion:**

If you still encounter the error, you can test a simple query to verify that the table exists and you have access:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
LIMIT 1;
```

This will retrieve a single row from the table and confirm whether the table is accessible.

**Let me know** if you need further assistance or if you're still encountering issues.

2025-01-18 03:28:37 - root - INFO - It appears that the error occurs because the table `COMPANY_INDEX` might not be correctly referenced in your SQL query. Based on the database structure provided earlier, the table might be located under an additional `CYBERSYN` schema. Please try the following corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "PRIMARY_TICKER", "COMPANY_NAME"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.COMPANY_INDEX
WHERE "COMPANY_NAME" LIKE '%Apple%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Schema Correction:** The table `COMPANY_INDEX` is likely located under the schema `CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN` within the `FINANCE__ECONOMICS` database. By adding the additional `CYBERSYN` to the schema path, we ensure the query points to the correct location.

- **Adjusted Table Reference:** The full path to the table becomes `FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.COMPANY_INDEX`.

**Additional Suggestions:**

- **Verify Table Existence:**
  To confirm that the table exists in the specified schema, you can run:

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN;
  ```

- **Check Permissions:**
  Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the `COMPANY_INDEX` table within the `FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN` schema.

- **Case Sensitivity:**
  SQL identifiers can be case-sensitive depending on the database configuration. Make sure that the database, schema, table, and column names are correctly cased in your query.

- **Test a Simple Query:**
  To confirm connectivity and access, try fetching a limited number of records without any filters:

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.COMPANY_INDEX
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

**Let me know** if this correction resolves the issue or if you need further assistance troubleshooting the error.

```

**Explanation:**

The table above presents the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies—META, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, and NVDA—from January 1 to June 30, 2024. The 'Percentage_Change' represents the calculated percentage difference between the post-market close prices on these two dates for each company.

The percentage change is computed using the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Price on June 30, 2024} - \text{Price on January 1, 2024}}{\text{Price on January 1, 2024}} \right) \times 100 \]

Since specific price values are not provided, the 'Percentage_Change' values are represented as placeholders (`num:float`).

description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

Task: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Ticker,Percentage_Change
META,num:float
GOOGL,num:float
AMZN,num:float
MSFT,num:float
AAPL,num:float
TSLA,num:float
NVDA,num:float
```

**Explanation:**

The table above provides the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies—META, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, and NVDA—from January 1 to June 30, 2024. Since actual data for this period is not available, the 'Percentage_Change' values are represented as placeholders (`num:float`)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 03:33:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Ticker,Percentage_Change
META,num:float
GOOGL,num:float
AMZN,num:float
MSFT,num:float
AAPL,num:float
TSLA,num:float
NVDA,num:float
```

**Explanation:**

The table above provides the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies—META, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, and NVDA—from January 1 to June 30, 2024. Since actual data for this period is not available, the 'Percentage_Change' values are represented as placeholders (`num:float`). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
