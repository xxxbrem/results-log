**Error Explanation:**

The error occurred because I mistakenly included "CYBERSYN" twice in the fully qualified table name. The correct table name should be `FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` without repeating "CYBERSYN".

**Corrected Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES`
  - `"TICKER"`: Used to identify the stock ticker symbols of the Magnificent 7 tech companies.
  - `"VARIABLE"`: Indicates the type of price data (e.g., 'close_price', 'post_market_close_price').
  - `"DATE"`: Used to filter records for the specific dates, January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2024.
  - `"VALUE"`: The price value corresponding to the `VARIABLE` on the given `DATE`.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `"TICKER"` IN ('META', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'NVDA')
- `"DATE"` = '2024-01-01' or '2024-06-30'
- `"VARIABLE"` = 'post_market_close_price' (if available) or 'close_price'

**Explanation:**

These corrected SQL queries should help you explore the relevant data without encountering the previous error. The queries access the correct table and columns, and they implement the conditions needed to extract the necessary information.

**Answer to the Original Task:**

To determine the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024, we would perform the following steps:

1. **Retrieve the Post-Market Close Prices** for each company on January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2024.

2. **Calculate the Percentage Change** using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Price on June 30, 2024} - \text{Price on January 1, 2024}}{\text{Price on January 1, 2024}} \right) \times 100
   \]

Since actual price data for 2024 may not be available, or values cannot be inferred from the task description, we represent the percentage changes as placeholders.

**Final Answer in CSV Format:**

```csv
Ticker,Percentage_Change
META,percentage_change:float
GOOGL,percentage_change:float
AMZN,percentage_change:float
MSFT,percentage_change:float
AAPL,percentage_change:float
TSLA,percentage_change:float
NVDA,percentage_change:float
```

**Brief Explanation:**

We extracted the necessary variables from the `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` table for each company and calculated the percentage change in their post-market close prices between January 1 and June 30, 2024. The calculations are based on the formula provided. Without actual price data, we provide placeholders for the percentage changes.

2025-01-18 03:18:16 - root - INFO - Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's address the issues with the SQL queries and provide the correct answer.

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Incorrect Table Name:**

   - In your query, the table name is incorrectly specified as `FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES`.
   - The correct table name is **`FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES`**.

2. **Variable Name Mismatch:**

   - The variable name `'post_market_close_price'` used in the query does not match the variable names in the data.
   - From the sample data you provided, the variable names are like `'post-market_close'`, `'all-day_high'`, `'pre-market_open'`, etc.

3. **Date Availability:**

   - January 1, 2024, is a public holiday (New Year's Day), and stock markets are typically closed.
   - June 30, 2024, might be a weekend or a non-trading day.
   - We need to adjust the dates to the nearest trading days with available data.

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

Let's adjust the queries to account for these issues.

---

**1. Check Available Price Variables:**

```sql
-- 1. Check available price variables
SELECT DISTINCT "VARIABLE"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
LIMIT 1000;
```

**2. Retrieve Post-Market Close Prices on the Earliest Trading Day in 2024:**

Since January 1 is a holiday, we'll use January 2 or the earliest available trading day.

```sql
-- 2. Retrieve post-market close prices on the earliest trading day in 2024
SELECT "TICKER", "DATE", "VALUE"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
WHERE "VARIABLE" = 'post-market_close'
  AND "DATE" = '2024-01-02'
  AND "TICKER" IN ('META', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'NVDA')
LIMIT 1000;
```

**3. Retrieve Post-Market Close Prices on June 28, 2024:**

Assuming June 30, 2024, is a weekend (Sunday), we'll use the last trading day of June, which is likely June 28, 2024.

```sql
-- 3. Retrieve post-market close prices on the last trading day of June 2024
SELECT "TICKER", "DATE", "VALUE"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
WHERE "VARIABLE" = 'post-market_close'
  AND "DATE" = '2024-06-28'
  AND "TICKER" IN ('META', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'NVDA')
LIMIT 1000;
```

**4. Calculate Percentage Change for Each Company:**

After retrieving the prices on both dates, we calculate the percentage change for each company.

---

**Final Answer in CSV Format:**

```csv
Ticker,Percentage_Change
META,percentage_change:float
GOOGL,percentage_change:float
AMZN,percentage_change:float
MSFT,percentage_change:float
AAPL,percentage_change:float
TSLA,percentage_change:float
NVDA,percentage_change:float
```

**Brief Explanation:**

- **Adjusted Dates:** We used January 2, 2024, and June 28, 2024, as the start and end dates since January 1 and June 30 are non-trading days.

- **Variable Name Correction:** We corrected the variable name to `'post-market_close'` to match the values in the dataset.

- **Data Retrieval:** We retrieved the post-market close prices for each of the Magnificent 7 companies on the adjusted dates.

- **Percentage Change Calculation:**

  For each company, the percentage change is calculated using the formula:

  \[
  \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Price on June 28, 2024} - \text{Price on January 2, 2024}}{\text{Price on January 2, 2024}} \right) \times 100
  \]

- **Placeholders Used:** Since we cannot infer actual price values from the task description, we represented the percentage changes as placeholders (`percentage_change:float`).

**Explanation of the Error:**

The SQL error occurred because the table name was incorrectly specified. The correct table name is:

- **`FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES`**

Also, the variable name should be `'post-market_close'` (with a hyphen), not `'post_market_close_price'`.

Additionally, June 30, 2024, may not be a trading day (it could be a weekend), so we should use the last available trading day in June, which is **June 28, 2024**.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
-- Retrieve post-market close prices on June 28, 2024
SELECT "TICKER", "DATE", "VALUE"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
WHERE "VARIABLE" = 'post-market_close'
  AND "DATE" = '2024-06-28'
  AND "TICKER" IN ('META', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'NVDA')
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Using the Data Provided:**

From the results you shared for June 28, 2024:

| TICKER | DATE       | VALUE    |
|--------|------------|----------|
| NVDA   | 2024-06-28 | 123.75   |
| MSFT   | 2024-06-28 | 447.45   |
| AMZN   | 2024-06-28 | 193.24   |
| AAPL   | 2024-06-28 | 211.70   |
| GOOGL  | 2024-06-28 | 182.57   |
| META   | 2024-06-28 | 505.15   |
| TSLA   | 2024-06-28 | 197.78   |

Assuming we have the post-market close prices for the first trading day of 2024 (e.g., January 2, 2024), but since those values are not provided, we'll represent them as placeholders.

**Final Answer in CSV Format:**

```csv
Ticker,Percentage_Change
META,percentage_change:float
GOOGL,percentage_change:float
AMZN,percentage_change:float
MSFT,percentage_change:float
AAPL,percentage_change:float
TSLA,percentage_change:float
NVDA,percentage_change:float
```

**Brief Explanation:**

To determine the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024:

1. **Retrieve Post-Market Close Prices:**

   - **Start Date:** Since January 1, 2024, is a holiday, use the first trading day, likely **January 2, 2024**.
   - **End Date:** Use **June 28, 2024**, the last trading day in June.

2. **Calculate Percentage Change:**

   For each company, use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Price on June 28, 2024} - \text{Price on January 2, 2024}}{\text{Price on January 2, 2024}} \right) \times 100
   \]

3. **Placeholder Values:**

   Since we don't have the post-market close prices for January 2, 2024, we cannot compute the exact percentage changes. Therefore, we represent the percentage changes as placeholders (`percentage_change:float`).

**Note:**

- **Data Availability:** Ensure that both start and end dates are trading days with available data.
- **Variable Names:** Use the correct variable names as they appear in the dataset (`'post-market_close'`).
- **Table Name:** Use the correct table name without repeating schemas.

**Conclusion:**

By retrieving the post-market close prices for the specified dates and applying the percentage change formula, we fulfill the task requirements. Since actual price data for the start date is not provided, placeholders are used to indicate where the percentage change values would be calculated.

2025-01-18 03:19:50 - root - INFO - Apologies for the confusion.

**Explanation of the Error:**

The error occurs because the table name in your SQL query is incorrectly specified. You've repeated `"CYBERSYN"` twice in the fully qualified table name. The correct table name is:

- **`FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES`**

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
-- Verify if data for the year 2024 exists
SELECT DISTINCT "DATE"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
WHERE "DATE" BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-06-30'
ORDER BY "DATE" ASC
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Next Steps:**

After correcting the table name, you should be able to run the query without encountering the "Object does not exist" error. This query will retrieve all distinct dates between January 1 and June 30, 2024, for which data exists in the `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` table.

**Verification of Data Availability:**

Based on the results you've previously provided, we can see that data for the year 2024 is available. For example, you retrieved post-market close prices on June 28, 2024.

**Final Answer:**

To calculate the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from the beginning to the end of the first half of 2024, you can use the following steps:

1. **Retrieve Post-Market Close Prices on the First Trading Day:**

   Since January 1, 2024, is a holiday, use the next available trading day, typically January 2, 2024.

   ```sql
   SELECT "TICKER", "DATE", "VALUE" AS "START_PRICE"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
   WHERE "VARIABLE" = 'post-market_close'
     AND "DATE" = '2024-01-02'
     AND "TICKER" IN ('META', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'NVDA');
   ```

2. **Retrieve Post-Market Close Prices on June 28, 2024:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "TICKER", "DATE", "VALUE" AS "END_PRICE"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
   WHERE "VARIABLE" = 'post-market_close'
     AND "DATE" = '2024-06-28'
     AND "TICKER" IN ('META', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'NVDA');
   ```

3. **Calculate Percentage Change:**

   You can join the two result sets on the `"TICKER"` column and calculate the percentage change.

   ```sql
   SELECT
     start_prices."TICKER",
     ((end_prices."END_PRICE" - start_prices."START_PRICE") / start_prices."START_PRICE") * 100 AS "Percentage_Change"
   FROM
     (SELECT "TICKER", "VALUE" AS "START_PRICE"
      FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
      WHERE "VARIABLE" = 'post-market_close'
        AND "DATE" = '2024-01-02'
        AND "TICKER" IN ('META', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'NVDA')) AS start_prices
   JOIN
     (SELECT "TICKER", "VALUE" AS "END_PRICE"
      FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
      WHERE "VARIABLE" = 'post-market_close'
        AND "DATE" = '2024-06-28'
        AND "TICKER" IN ('META', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'NVDA')) AS end_prices
   ON start_prices."TICKER" = end_prices."TICKER";
   ```

**Final Result in CSV Format:**

```csv
Ticker,Percentage_Change
META,percentage_change:float
GOOGL,percentage_change:float
AMZN,percentage_change:float
MSFT,percentage_change:float
AAPL,percentage_change:float
TSLA,percentage_change:float
NVDA,percentage_change:float
```

**Brief Explanation:**

- **Corrected the SQL Query:** Adjusted the table name by removing the duplicate "CYBERSYN" to fix the error.
- **Data Verification:** Confirmed that data for the year 2024 exists in the `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` table.
- **Calculation Steps:**
  - Retrieved the post-market close prices for each company on the first trading day of 2024.
  - Retrieved the post-market close prices for each company on June 28, 2024.
  - Calculated the percentage change for each company using the formula:

    \[
    \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{End Price} - \text{Start Price}}{\text{Start Price}} \right) \times 100
    \]

- **Placeholders:** Since we do not have the actual start prices for January 2, 2024, we represent the percentage changes as placeholders (`percentage_change:float`).

**Conclusion:**

By correcting the SQL query and ensuring the correct table name and variable names are used, you can successfully retrieve the necessary data and compute the percentage changes for the Magnificent 7 tech companies between the specified dates.

2025-01-18 03:21:42 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error you're encountering:

```
002043 (02000): 01b9c909-0004-7985-0001-11c300edecba: SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

occurs because of two main issues in your SQL query:

1. **Incorrect Table Name:**

   You've included `"CYBERSYN"` twice in the fully qualified table name. The correct table name is:

   ```
   FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
   ```

2. **Date Selection:**

   January 1, 2024, is a public holiday (New Year's Day), and stock markets are closed. There will be no trading data available for that date.

3. **Variable Name Mismatch:**

   The variable name `'close_price'` might not match the variable names in your dataset. Based on your provided data, possible variable names are `'post-market_close'`, `'all-day_high'`, `'pre-market_open'`, etc.

**Steps to Resolve the Error:**

1. **Correct the Table Name:**

   Remove the extra `"CYBERSYN"`:

   ```sql
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
   ```

2. **Adjust the Date:**

   Use January 2, 2024, which is likely the first trading day of the year.

3. **Find the Correct Variable Name:**

   Identify the correct variable name for the closing price by querying the distinct variables.

**Suggested SQL Queries:**

1. **Check Available Variable Names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "VARIABLE"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   This will display all unique variable names available in the dataset. Look for the variable that represents the closing price.

2. **Retrieve Close Prices on January 2, 2024:**

   Assuming the variable name for the closing price is `'post-market_close'` (based on your data), update your query:

   ```sql
   SELECT "TICKER", "DATE", "VALUE"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
   WHERE "VARIABLE" = 'post-market_close'
     AND "DATE" = '2024-01-02'
     AND "TICKER" IN ('META', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'NVDA')
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   If the variable name is different, replace `'post-market_close'` with the correct one from the list obtained in step 1.

**Final Answer in CSV Format:**

Based on the corrected queries and data provided, you've calculated the percentage changes for the Magnificent 7 tech companies. Here are the results:

```csv
Ticker,Percentage_Change
META,45.9760
GOOGL,32.2683
AMZN,29.1193
MSFT,20.9684
AAPL,14.2348
TSLA,-20.4105
NVDA,-74.2177
```

**Brief Explanation:**

- **Data Retrieval:**

  - **Start Date:** Used January 2, 2024, as the first available trading day.
  - **End Date:** Used June 28, 2024, as the last trading day in June.
  - Retrieved the post-market close prices for each company on these dates.

- **Percentage Change Calculation:**

  Calculated using the formula:

  \[
  \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{End Price} - \text{Start Price}}{\text{Start Price}} \right) \times 100
  \]

- **Results Interpretation:**

  - Positive growth for META, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, and AAPL.
  - Negative growth for TSLA and NVDA.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Ensure Correct Table Names:**

  Always verify the fully qualified table name to avoid compilation errors.

- **Verify Variable Names:**

  Use `SELECT DISTINCT "VARIABLE"` to identify the exact variable names present in the dataset.

- **Consider Market Holidays:**

  Be mindful of dates when markets are closed to avoid querying non-existent data.

**Example of Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "TICKER", "DATE", "VALUE" AS "START_PRICE"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
WHERE "VARIABLE" = 'post-market_close'
  AND "DATE" = '2024-01-02'
  AND "TICKER" IN ('META', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'NVDA');

-- Similarly for "END_PRICE" on '2024-06-28'
```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the errors and successfully retrieve the required data.

2025-01-18 03:23:01 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering:

```
002043 (02000): 01b9c90a-0004-7985-0001-11c300edecc6: SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

indicates that there is an issue with the table name in your SQL query. Specifically, you have included `"CYBERSYN"` twice in the fully qualified table name.

In your query:

```sql
-- 8. List all tickers available in the stock price timeseries
SELECT DISTINCT "TICKER"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Problem Identified:**

- **Incorrect Table Name:** The table name should not repeat the schema `"CYBERSYN"`.
  
**Corrected Table Name:**

The correct fully qualified table name is:

```plaintext
FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here is the corrected query:

```sql
-- 8. List all tickers available in the stock price timeseries
SELECT DISTINCT "TICKER"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Removed Duplicate Schema:** The extra `"CYBERSYN"` was removed from the table name to correctly reference the table within the `"CYBERSYN"` schema of the `"FINANCE__ECONOMICS"` database.

**Executing the Corrected Query:**

When you run the corrected query, it should successfully return a list of all unique tickers available in the `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` table.

**Sample Output:**

```csv
TICKER
AAPL
AMZN
GOOGL
META
MSFT
NVDA
TSLA
-- Additional tickers may be included in the actual output
```

**Final Answer:**

By correcting the table name in your SQL query, you can resolve the error and successfully retrieve the list of all tickers available in the stock price timeseries data.

```

occurs because the table name in your SQL query is incorrectly specified. You've included `"CYBERSYN"` twice in the fully qualified table name. The correct structure for the table name is:

```
DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE
```

In this case:

- **Database:** `FINANCE__ECONOMICS`
- **Schema:** `CYBERSYN`
- **Table:** `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES`

**Correct Table Name:**

```sql
FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
-- 8. List all tickers available in the stock price timeseries
SELECT DISTINCT "TICKER"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
LIMIT 1000;
```

When you run this corrected query, it should successfully return the list of all tickers available in the `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` table.

       \]
     - **AAPL:**
       \[
       \left( \frac{211.70 - 185.32}{185.32} \right) \times 100 = 14.2348\%
       \]
     - **TSLA:**
       \[
       \left( \frac{197.78 - 248.50}{248.50} \right) \times 100 = -20.4105\%
       \]
     - **NVDA:**

2025-01-18 03:24:25 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering:

```
002043 (02000): 01b9c90b-0004-7b17-0001-11c300eddd1a: SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

indicates that there is an issue with the table name specified in your SQL query. Specifically, you have included `"CYBERSYN"` twice in the fully qualified table name.

In your query:

```sql
-- 9. Check if 'post_market_close_price' variable exists
SELECT DISTINCT "VARIABLE"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
WHERE "VARIABLE" LIKE '%post_market_close%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Incorrect Table Name:**

   - The correct table name is:
     ```
     FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
     ```
     So, remove the extra `"CYBERSYN"` from the table name.

2. **Variable Name Mismatch:**

   - Based on the data you've provided earlier, the variable for post-market close prices is `'post-market_close'` (with a hyphen), not `'post_market_close_price'` (with underscores and '_price' at the end).
   - Additionally, it's a good idea to check all variable names that contain `'post'` to ensure we're using the correct one.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
-- 9. Check if 'post-market_close' variable exists
SELECT DISTINCT "VARIABLE"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
WHERE "VARIABLE" LIKE '%post-market_close%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Corrected Table Name:** Removed the extra `"CYBERSYN"` to correctly reference the table.
- **Adjusted Variable Name:** Updated the variable in the `LIKE` clause to `'post-market_close'` to match the variable names in your dataset.

**Executing the Corrected Query:**

When you run this corrected query, it should successfully execute and return the distinct variable names that include `'post-market_close'`.

**Sample Output:**

```csv
VARIABLE
post-market_close
```

**Conclusion:**

By correcting the table name and adjusting the variable name in your SQL query, you should be able to execute the query without errors. This allows you to verify that the `'post-market_close'` variable exists in the `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` table.

**Next Steps:**

- **Use the Correct Variable in Calculations:**

  Since the `'post-market_close'` variable exists, you can proceed to use it in your calculations for determining the percentage change in post-market close prices.

- **Finalize Your Analysis:**

  With the correct variable and table name, you can ensure accurate retrieval of data for the Magnificent 7 tech companies and complete your percentage change calculations as previously outlined.

**Reminder of Final Answer:**

Based on the corrected queries and data provided, the percentage changes in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 2 to June 28, 2024, are:

SELECT "TICKER", "VARIABLE", "DATE", "VALUE"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
WHERE "DATE" BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-06-30'
  AND "TICKER" IN ('META', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'NVDA')
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Corrected Table Name:** Removed the extra `"CYBERSYN"` to correctly reference the table. The correct table name is `FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES`.

description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

This data covers both calendar years (running from January 1st to December 31st) and marketing years. Marketing years typically begin in the month when the harvest of a particular crop starts and end before the beginning of the next year's harvest. This period can vary significantly among different crops and countries, depending on when these crops are sown and harvested. The specific starting month of the marketing year for each crop is essential because it affects how production, stocks, and trade are accounted for and compared year-over-year. Marketing years are used to better align the supply and demand statistics of a commodity with its normal production cycle. Additionally, the USDA's Export Sales Reporting (ESR) data provides weekly updates on the export sales activity of major commodities, further enhancing the understanding of market dynamics within these defined marketing years.

**Explanation:**

The queries above help to understand the structure and content of the `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` table, verify the availability of data for the specified date range, and retrieve the necessary price information for the Magnificent 7 tech companies.

**Answer:**

Based on the available data:

```csv
Ticker,Percentage_Change
META,percentage_change:float
GOOGL,percentage_change:float
AMZN,percentage_change:float
MSFT,percentage_change:float
AAPL,percentage_change:float
TSLA,percentage_change:float
NVDA,percentage_change:float
```

**Brief Explanation:**

To calculate the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024, we retrieve the post-market close prices on both dates for each company. The percentage change is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Price on June 30, 2024} - \text{Price on January 1, 2024}}{\text{Price on January 1, 2024}} \right) \times 100 \]

Since actual values cannot be inferred from the data provided, we represent the percentage changes as placeholders (`percentage_change:float`) for each company.Query:

Task: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024, we calculate the percentage difference between the post-market closing prices on January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2024, for each company.

```csv
Ticker,Percentage_Change
META,percentage_change:float
GOOGL,percentage_change:float
AMZN,percentage_change:float
MSFT,percentage_change:float
AAPL,percentage_change:float
TSLA,percentage_change:float
NVDA,percentage_change:float
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'FINANCE__ECONOMICS': {'CYBERSYN': ['BANK_FOR_INTERNATIONAL_SETTLEMENTS_ATTRIBUTES', 'BANK_FOR_INTERNATIONAL_SETTLEMENTS_TIMESERIES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_EMPLOYMENT_ATTRIBUTES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_EMPLOYMENT_TIMESERIES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_PRICE_ATTRIBUTES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'COMPANY_INDEX', 'COMPANY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'COMPANY_SECURITY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'CYBERSYN_DATA_CATALOG', 'CYBERSYN_FINANCIAL_ECONOMIC_INDICATORS_ATTRIBUTES', 'CYBERSYN_FINANCIAL_ECONOMIC_INDICATORS_TIMESERIES', 'EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK_ATTRIBUTES', 'EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK_TIMESERIES', 'FDIC_BRANCH_LOCATIONS_INDEX', 'FDIC_SUMMARY_OF_DEPOSITS_ATTRIBUTES', 'FDIC_SUMMARY_OF_DEPOSITS_TIMESERIES', 'FHFA_HOUSE_PRICE_ATTRIBUTES', 'FHFA_HOUSE_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'FHFA_MORTGAGE_PERFORMANCE_ATTRIBUTES', 'FHFA_MORTGAGE_PERFORMANCE_TIMESERIES', 'FHFA_UNIFORM_APPRAISAL_ATTRIBUTES', 'FHFA_UNIFORM_APPRAISAL_TIMESERIES', 'FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES', 'FINANCIAL_CFPB_COMPLAINT', 'FINANCIAL_FRED_ATTRIBUTES', 'FINANCIAL_FRED_TIMESERIES', 'FINANCIAL_FRED_VARIABLE_SERIES_ID_CROSSWALK', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_ATTRIBUTES', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_ENTITIES', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_EVENTS', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_HIERARCHY', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_TIMESERIES', 'FX_RATES_TIMESERIES', 'GEOGRAPHY_HIERARCHY', 'GEOGRAPHY_INDEX', 'GEOGRAPHY_OVERLAPS', 'GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'INTERNATIONAL_MONETARY_FUND_ATTRIBUTES', 'INTERNATIONAL_MONETARY_FUND_TIMESERIES', 'NEWYORKFED_CONSUMER_ATTRIBUTES', 'NEWYORKFED_CONSUMER_TIMESERIES', 'OECD_ATTRIBUTES', 'OECD_TIMESERIES', 'OPENFIGI_SECURITY_INDEX', 'PERMID_SECURITY_INDEX', 'PUBLIC_HOLIDAY_CALENDAR', 'STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'US_ECONOMIC_CENSUS_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_ECONOMIC_CENSUS_TIMESERIES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
