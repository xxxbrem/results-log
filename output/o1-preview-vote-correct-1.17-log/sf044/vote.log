After reviewing the three SQL queries and their corresponding results, we can determine which query most accurately answers the question:

**"What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?"**

### Comparison of the SQL Queries:

#### **Option 0: 0result.sql**

- **Approach**: Directly selects post-market close prices on specific dates: `'2024-01-02'` and `'2024-06-28'`.
- **Assumption**: Assumes that these specific dates have trading data available for all tickers.
- **Potential Issue**: If any of the specified dates are non-trading days (e.g., weekends or holidays), the query may return incomplete or no data for some tickers.

#### **Option 1: 1result.sql**

- **Approach**:
  - Determines the earliest (`MIN("DATE")`) and latest (`MAX("DATE")`) available trading dates within the specified range (`'2024-01-01'` to `'2024-06-30'`) for each ticker.
  - Retrieves the post-market close prices on these dates for each ticker.
  - Calculates the percentage change between these two prices.
- **Advantage**: Ensures that the first and last available trading days within the specified date range are used for each ticker, providing the most accurate and comprehensive comparison.

#### **Option 2: 2result.sql**

- **Approach**:
  - Similar to Option 1 but uses subqueries to find the earliest (`MIN("DATE")`) and latest (`MAX("DATE")`) trading dates for each ticker within the date range.
  - Retrieves the corresponding post-market close prices and calculates the percentage change.
- **Difference**: While functionally similar to Option 1, this query may be less efficient due to the use of correlated subqueries for each ticker.

### Reason for Choosing **1result.sql**:

- **Completeness**: By dynamically determining the available trading dates for each ticker within the specified range, Option 1 ensures that all data is captured even if some dates are missing due to holidays or weekends.
- **Efficiency**: Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and joins, the query is more readable and potentially more efficient than the correlated subqueries in Option 2.
- **Accuracy**: It accurately reflects the percentage change over the entire date range, providing a fair comparison among the companies.

### Conclusion:

**Option 1 (1result.sql) is the correct SQL query** as it robustly calculates the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from the first to the last available trading day within the specified period.
