"tpm: TPM 2.0 baseline support

TPM 2.0 devices are separated by adding a field 'flags' to struct
tpm_chip and defining a flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 for tagging them.

This patch adds the following internal functions:

- tpm2_get_random()
- tpm2_get_tpm_pt()
- tpm2_pcr_extend()
- tpm2_pcr_read()
- tpm2_startup()

Additionally, the following exported functions are implemented for
implementing TPM 2.0 device drivers:

- tpm2_do_selftest()
- tpm2_calc_ordinal_durations()
- tpm2_gen_interrupt()

The existing functions that are exported for the use for existing
subsystems have been changed to check the flags field in struct
tpm_chip and use appropriate TPM 2.0 counterpart if
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is est.

The code for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration() and tpm2_startup() were
originally written by Will Arthur.

"tpm: device class for tpm

Added own device class for TPM. Uses MISC_MAJOR:TPM_MINOR for the
first character device in order to retain backwards compatibility.
Added tpm_dev_release() back attached to the character device.

I've been running this code now for a while on my laptop (Lenovo
T430S) TrouSerS works perfectly without modifications. I don't
believe it breaks anything significantly.

The sysfs attributes that have been placed under the wrong place
and are against sysfs-rules.txt should be probably left to
stagnate under platform device directory and start defining
new sysfs attributes to the char device directory.

Guidelines for future TPM sysfs attributes should be probably
along the lines of

- Single flat set of mandatory sysfs attributes. For example,
  current PPI interface is way way too rich when you only want
  to use it to clear and activate the TPM.

- Define sysfs attribute if and only if there's no way to get
  the value from ring-3. No attributes for TPM properties. It's
  just unnecessary maintenance hurdle that we don't want.

"vTPM: fix memory allocation flag for rtce buffer at kernel boot

At ibm vtpm initialzation, tpm_ibmvtpm_probe() registers its interrupt
handler, ibmvtpm_interrupt, which calls ibmvtpm_crq_process to allocate
memory for rtce buffer.  The current code uses 'GFP_KERNEL' as the
type of kernel memory allocation, which resulted a warning at
kernel/lockdep.c.  This patch uses 'GFP_ATOMIC' instead so that the
allocation is high-priority and does not sleep.

"tpm: TPM 2.0 baseline support

TPM 2.0 devices are separated by adding a field 'flags' to struct
tpm_chip and defining a flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 for tagging them.

This patch adds the following internal functions:

- tpm2_get_random()
- tpm2_get_tpm_pt()
- tpm2_pcr_extend()
- tpm2_pcr_read()
- tpm2_startup()

Additionally, the following exported functions are implemented for
implementing TPM 2.0 device drivers:

- tpm2_do_selftest()
- tpm2_calc_ordinal_durations()
- tpm2_gen_interrupt()

The existing functions that are exported for the use for existing
subsystems have been changed to check the flags field in struct
tpm_chip and use appropriate TPM 2.0 counterpart if
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is est.

The code for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration() and tpm2_startup() were
originally written by Will Arthur.

"tpm: device class for tpm

Added own device class for TPM. Uses MISC_MAJOR:TPM_MINOR for the
first character device in order to retain backwards compatibility.
Added tpm_dev_release() back attached to the character device.

I've been running this code now for a while on my laptop (Lenovo
T430S) TrouSerS works perfectly without modifications. I don't
believe it breaks anything significantly.

The sysfs attributes that have been placed under the wrong place
and are against sysfs-rules.txt should be probably left to
stagnate under platform device directory and start defining
new sysfs attributes to the char device directory.

Guidelines for future TPM sysfs attributes should be probably
along the lines of

- Single flat set of mandatory sysfs attributes. For example,
  current PPI interface is way way too rich when you only want
  to use it to clear and activate the TPM.

- Define sysfs attribute if and only if there's no way to get
  the value from ring-3. No attributes for TPM properties. It's
  just unnecessary maintenance hurdle that we don't want.

"vTPM: fix memory allocation flag for rtce buffer at kernel boot

At ibm vtpm initialzation, tpm_ibmvtpm_probe() registers its interrupt
handler, ibmvtpm_interrupt, which calls ibmvtpm_crq_process to allocate
memory for rtce buffer.  The current code uses 'GFP_KERNEL' as the
type of kernel memory allocation, which resulted a warning at
kernel/lockdep.c.  This patch uses 'GFP_ATOMIC' instead so that the

torvalds/linux,"tpm: TPM 2.0 baseline support

TPM 2.0 devices are separated by adding a field 'flags' to struct
tpm_chip and defining a flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 for tagging them.

This patch adds the following internal functions:

- tpm2_get_random()
- tpm2_get_tpm_pt()
- tpm2_pcr_extend()
- tpm2_pcr_read()
- tpm2_startup()

Additionally, the following exported functions are implemented for
implementing TPM 2.0 device drivers:

- tpm2_do_selftest()
- tpm2_calc_ordinal_durations()
- tpm2_gen_interrupt()

The existing functions that are exported for the use for existing
subsystems have been changed to check the flags field in struct
tpm_chip and use appropriate TPM 2.0 counterpart if
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is est.

The code for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration() and tpm2_startup() were
originally written by Will Arthur.

torvalds/linux,"tpm: device class for tpm

Added own device class for TPM. Uses MISC_MAJOR:TPM_MINOR for the
first character device in order to retain backwards compatibility.
Added tpm_dev_release() back attached to the character device.

I've been running this code now for a while on my laptop (Lenovo
T430S) TrouSerS works perfectly without modifications. I don't
believe it breaks anything significantly.

The sysfs attributes that have been placed under the wrong place
and are against sysfs-rules.txt should be probably left to
stagnate under platform device directory and start defining
new sysfs attributes to the char device directory.

Guidelines for future TPM sysfs attributes should be probably
along the lines of

- Single flat set of mandatory sysfs attributes. For example,
  current PPI interface is way way too rich when you only want
  to use it to clear and activate the TPM.

- Define sysfs attribute if and only if there's no way to get
  the value from ring-3. No attributes for TPM properties. It's
  just unnecessary maintenance hurdle that we don't want.

torvalds/linux,"vTPM: fix memory allocation flag for rtce buffer at kernel boot

At ibm vtpm initialzation, tpm_ibmvtpm_probe() registers its interrupt
handler, ibmvtpm_interrupt, which calls ibmvtpm_crq_process to allocate
memory for rtce buffer.  The current code uses 'GFP_KERNEL' as the
type of kernel memory allocation, which resulted a warning at
kernel/lockdep.c.  This patch uses 'GFP_ATOMIC' instead so that the
allocation is high-priority and does not sleep.

"fix irq flags in rtc-ds1511

The file in drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1551.c uses ""int"" for flags.  This can cause
hard to find bugs on some architectures.  This patch converts the flags to use
""long"" instead.

This bug was discovered by doing an allyesconfig make on the -rt kernel where
checks are done to ensure all flags are of size sizeof(long).

"Fix lockup related to stop_machine being stuck in __do_softirq.

The stop machine logic can lock up if all but one of the migration
threads make it through the disable-irq step and the one remaining
thread gets stuck in __do_softirq.  The reason __do_softirq can hang is
that it has a bail-out based on jiffies timeout, but in the lockup case,
jiffies itself is not incremented.

To work around this, re-add the max_restart counter in __do_irq and stop
processing irqs after 10 restarts.

Thanks to Tejun Heo and Rusty Russell and others for helping me track
this down.

This was introduced in 3.9 by commit c10d73671ad3 (""softirq: reduce
latencies"").

It may be worth looking into ath9k to see if it has issues with its irq
handler at a later date.

The hang stack traces look something like this:

"twl4030-gpio: remove __devexit markings from remove func

The gpio_twl4030_probe() function calls gpio_twl4030_remove(), and the
former has __devinit, so the latter cannot use __devexit.  Otherwise we
hit the section mismatch warning:

WARNING: drivers/gpio/built-in.o(.devinit.text+0x71a): Section mismatch
	in reference from the function _gpio_twl4030_probe() to the function
	.devexit.text:_gpio_twl4030_remove()
The function __devinit _gpio_twl4030_probe() references a function
	__devexit _gpio_twl4030_remove().
This is often seen when error handling in the init function uses
	functionality in the exit path.
The fix is often to remove the __devexit annotation of
	_gpio_twl4030_remove() so it may be used outside an exit section.

"AUDIT: Allow login in non-init namespaces

It its possible to configure your PAM stack to refuse login if audit
messages (about the login) were unable to be sent.  This is common in
many distros and thus normal configuration of many containers.  The PAM
modules determine if audit is enabled/disabled in the kernel based on
the return value from sending an audit message on the netlink socket.
If userspace gets back ECONNREFUSED it believes audit is disabled in the
kernel.  If it gets any other error else it refuses to let the login
proceed.

Just about ever since the introduction of namespaces the kernel audit
subsystem has returned EPERM if the task sending a message was not in
the init user or pid namespace.  So many forms of containers have never
worked if audit was enabled in the kernel.

BUT if the container was not in net_init then the kernel network code
would send ECONNREFUSED (instead of the audit code sending EPERM).  Thus
by pure accident/dumb luck/bug if an admin configured the PAM stack to
reject all logins that didn't talk to audit, but then ran the login
untility in the non-init_net namespace, it would work!! Clearly this was
a bug, but it is a bug some people expected.

With the introduction of network namespace support in 3.14-rc1 the two
bugs stopped cancelling each other out.  Now, containers in the
non-init_net namespace refused to let users log in (just like PAM was
configfured!) Obviously some people were not happy that what used to let
users log in, now didn't!

This fix is kinda hacky.  We return ECONNREFUSED for all non-init
relevant namespaces.  That means that not only will the old broken
non-init_net setups continue to work, now the broken non-init_pid or
non-init_user setups will 'work'.  They don't really work, since audit
isn't logging things.  But it's what most users want.

In 3.15 we should have patches to support not only the non-init_net
(3.14) namespace but also the non-init_pid and non-init_user namespace.
So all will be right in the world.  This just opens the doors wide open
on 3.14 and hopefully makes users happy, if not the audit system...

"mm: use __SetPageSwapBacked and dont ClearPageSwapBacked

v3.16 commit 07a427884348 (""mm: shmem: avoid atomic operation during
shmem_getpage_gfp"") rightly replaced one instance of SetPageSwapBacked
by __SetPageSwapBacked, pointing out that the newly allocated page is
not yet visible to other users (except speculative get_page_unless_zero-
ers, who may not update page flags before their further checks).

That was part of a series in which Mel was focused on tmpfs profiles:
but almost all SetPageSwapBacked uses can be so optimized, with the same
justification.

"tpm: TPM 2.0 baseline support

TPM 2.0 devices are separated by adding a field 'flags' to struct
tpm_chip and defining a flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 for tagging them.

This patch adds the following internal functions:

- tpm2_get_random()
- tpm2_get_tpm_pt()
- tpm2_pcr_extend()
- tpm2_pcr_read()
- tpm2_startup()

Additionally, the following exported functions are implemented for
implementing TPM 2.0 device drivers:

- tpm2_do_selftest()
- tpm2_calc_ordinal_durations()
- tpm2_gen_interrupt()

The existing functions that are exported for the use for existing
subsystems have been changed to check the flags field in struct
tpm_chip and use appropriate TPM 2.0 counterpart if
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is est.

The code for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration() and tpm2_startup() were
originally written by Will Arthur.

"tpm: device class for tpm

Added own device class for TPM. Uses MISC_MAJOR:TPM_MINOR for the
first character device in order to retain backwards compatibility.
Added tpm_dev_release() back attached to the character device.

I've been running this code now for a while on my laptop (Lenovo
T430S) TrouSerS works perfectly without modifications. I don't
believe it breaks anything significantly.

The sysfs attributes that have been placed under the wrong place
and are against sysfs-rules.txt should be probably left to
stagnate under platform device directory and start defining
new sysfs attributes to the char device directory.

Guidelines for future TPM sysfs attributes should be probably
along the lines of

- Single flat set of mandatory sysfs attributes. For example,
  current PPI interface is way way too rich when you only want
  to use it to clear and activate the TPM.

- Define sysfs attribute if and only if there's no way to get
  the value from ring-3. No attributes for TPM properties. It's
  just unnecessary maintenance hurdle that we don't want.

"vTPM: fix memory allocation flag for rtce buffer at kernel boot

At ibm vtpm initialzation, tpm_ibmvtpm_probe() registers its interrupt
handler, ibmvtpm_interrupt, which calls ibmvtpm_crq_process to allocate
memory for rtce buffer.  The current code uses 'GFP_KERNEL' as the
type of kernel memory allocation, which resulted a warning at
kernel/lockdep.c.  This patch uses 'GFP_ATOMIC' instead so that the
allocation is high-priority and does not sleep.

torvalds/linux,"tpm: TPM 2.0 baseline support

TPM 2.0 devices are separated by adding a field 'flags' to struct
tpm_chip and defining a flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 for tagging them.

This patch adds the following internal functions:

- tpm2_get_random()
- tpm2_get_tpm_pt()
- tpm2_pcr_extend()
- tpm2_pcr_read()
- tpm2_startup()

Additionally, the following exported functions are implemented for
implementing TPM 2.0 device drivers:

- tpm2_do_selftest()
- tpm2_calc_ordinal_durations()
- tpm2_gen_interrupt()

The existing functions that are exported for the use for existing
subsystems have been changed to check the flags field in struct
tpm_chip and use appropriate TPM 2.0 counterpart if
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is est.

The code for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration() and tpm2_startup() were
originally written by Will Arthur.

torvalds/linux,"tpm: device class for tpm

Added own device class for TPM. Uses MISC_MAJOR:TPM_MINOR for the
first character device in order to retain backwards compatibility.
Added tpm_dev_release() back attached to the character device.

I've been running this code now for a while on my laptop (Lenovo
T430S) TrouSerS works perfectly without modifications. I don't
believe it breaks anything significantly.

The sysfs attributes that have been placed under the wrong place
and are against sysfs-rules.txt should be probably left to
stagnate under platform device directory and start defining
new sysfs attributes to the char device directory.

Guidelines for future TPM sysfs attributes should be probably
along the lines of

- Single flat set of mandatory sysfs attributes. For example,
  current PPI interface is way way too rich when you only want
  to use it to clear and activate the TPM.

- Define sysfs attribute if and only if there's no way to get
  the value from ring-3. No attributes for TPM properties. It's
  just unnecessary maintenance hurdle that we don't want.

torvalds/linux,"vTPM: fix memory allocation flag for rtce buffer at kernel boot

At ibm vtpm initialzation, tpm_ibmvtpm_probe() registers its interrupt
handler, ibmvtpm_interrupt, which calls ibmvtpm_crq_process to allocate
memory for rtce buffer.  The current code uses 'GFP_KERNEL' as the
type of kernel memory allocation, which resulted a warning at
kernel/lockdep.c.  This patch uses 'GFP_ATOMIC' instead so that the
allocation is high-priority and does not sleep.

"fix irq flags in rtc-ds1511

The file in drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1551.c uses ""int"" for flags.  This can cause
hard to find bugs on some architectures.  This patch converts the flags to use
""long"" instead.

This bug was discovered by doing an allyesconfig make on the -rt kernel where

"Fix lockup related to stop_machine being stuck in __do_softirq.

The stop machine logic can lock up if all but one of the migration
threads make it through the disable-irq step and the one remaining
thread gets stuck in __do_softirq.  The reason __do_softirq can hang is
that it has a bail-out based on jiffies timeout, but in the lockup case,
jiffies itself is not incremented.

To work around this, re-add the max_restart counter in __do_irq and stop
processing irqs after 10 restarts.

Thanks to Tejun Heo and Rusty Russell and others for helping me track
this down.

This was introduced in 3.9 by commit c10d73671ad3 (""softirq: reduce
latencies"").

It may be worth looking into ath9k to see if it has issues with its irq
handler at a later date.

The hang stack traces look something like this:

"twl4030-gpio: remove __devexit markings from remove func

The gpio_twl4030_probe() function calls gpio_twl4030_remove(), and the
former has __devinit, so the latter cannot use __devexit.  Otherwise we
hit the section mismatch warning:

WARNING: drivers/gpio/built-in.o(.devinit.text+0x71a): Section mismatch
	in reference from the function _gpio_twl4030_probe() to the function
	.devexit.text:_gpio_twl4030_remove()
The function __devinit _gpio_twl4030_probe() references a function
	__devexit _gpio_twl4030_remove().
This is often seen when error handling in the init function uses
	functionality in the exit path.
The fix is often to remove the __devexit annotation of
	_gpio_twl4030_remove() so it may be used outside an exit section.

"AUDIT: Allow login in non-init namespaces

It its possible to configure your PAM stack to refuse login if audit
messages (about the login) were unable to be sent.  This is common in
many distros and thus normal configuration of many containers.  The PAM
modules determine if audit is enabled/disabled in the kernel based on
the return value from sending an audit message on the netlink socket.
If userspace gets back ECONNREFUSED it believes audit is disabled in the
kernel.  If it gets any other error else it refuses to let the login
proceed.

Just about ever since the introduction of namespaces the kernel audit
subsystem has returned EPERM if the task sending a message was not in
the init user or pid namespace.  So many forms of containers have never
worked if audit was enabled in the kernel.

BUT if the container was not in net_init then the kernel network code
would send ECONNREFUSED (instead of the audit code sending EPERM).  Thus
by pure accident/dumb luck/bug if an admin configured the PAM stack to
reject all logins that didn't talk to audit, but then ran the login
untility in the non-init_net namespace, it would work!! Clearly this was
a bug, but it is a bug some people expected.

With the introduction of network namespace support in 3.14-rc1 the two
bugs stopped cancelling each other out.  Now, containers in the
non-init_net namespace refused to let users log in (just like PAM was
configfured!) Obviously some people were not happy that what used to let
users log in, now didn't!

This fix is kinda hacky.  We return ECONNREFUSED for all non-init
relevant namespaces.  That means that not only will the old broken
non-init_net setups continue to work, now the broken non-init_pid or
non-init_user setups will 'work'.  They don't really work, since audit
isn't logging things.  But it's what most users want.

In 3.15 we should have patches to support not only the non-init_net
(3.14) namespace but also the non-init_pid and non-init_user namespace.
So all will be right in the world.  This just opens the doors wide open
on 3.14 and hopefully makes users happy, if not the audit system...

"mm: use __SetPageSwapBacked and dont ClearPageSwapBacked

v3.16 commit 07a427884348 (""mm: shmem: avoid atomic operation during
shmem_getpage_gfp"") rightly replaced one instance of SetPageSwapBacked
by __SetPageSwapBacked, pointing out that the newly allocated page is
not yet visible to other users (except speculative get_page_unless_zero-
ers, who may not update page flags before their further checks).

That was part of a series in which Mel was focused on tmpfs profiles:
but almost all SetPageSwapBacked uses can be so optimized, with the same
justification.

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GITHUB_REPOS': {'GITHUB_REPOS': ['LANGUAGES', 'LICENSES', 'SAMPLE_COMMITS', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS', 'SAMPLE_FILES', 'SAMPLE_REPOS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-16 18:15:46 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many commit messages are there in repositories that use the 'Shell' programming language and 'apache-2.0' license, where the length of the commit message is more than 5 characters but less than 10,000 characters, and the messages do not start with the word 'merge', 'update' or 'test'?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find the total number of commit messages that meet the specified criteria, we count the commit messages from repositories that:

- Use the 'Shell' programming language.
- Have the 'apache-2.0' license.
- Have commit messages with a length greater than 5 characters and less than 10,000 characters.
- Have commit messages that do not start with the words 'merge', 'update', or 'test' (case-insensitive).

The total number of commit messages satisfying these conditions is:

```csv
total_commit_messages
num:int
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
Current snswer: 
TOTAL_COMMIT_MESSAGES
