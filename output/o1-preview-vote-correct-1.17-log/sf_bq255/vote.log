After reviewing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that both queries return the same correct result of **1094** commit messages. However, there are differences in their structure and efficiency.

**First SQL (1result.sql):**

- Uses a subquery to select repositories that use the 'Shell' programming language.
- The subquery selects `DISTINCT "repo_name"` from the `LANGUAGES` table.
- Joins the subquery result with the `SAMPLE_COMMITS` and `LICENSES` tables.

**Second SQL (2result.sql):**

- Directly joins the `LANGUAGES` table with the `SAMPLE_COMMITS` and `LICENSES` tables.
- Uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` in the main query to handle the array data in the `LANGUAGES` table.
- Eliminates the need for a subquery, making the query more straightforward and potentially more efficient.

**Conclusion:**

While both SQL queries produce the correct result, the **second SQL query (2result.sql)** is more efficient due to its direct joins and simplified structure. It avoids the unnecessary use of a subquery, which can improve performance, especially with large datasets.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plain
2result.sql
```
