After comparing the SQL scripts and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL to calculate the total distance traveled by each bike.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Distance Calculation:** The SQL in `2result.sql` uses standard spatial functions to compute distances:
  - `ST_MAKEPOINT(longitude, latitude)` creates a geometric point from longitude and latitude.
  - `TO_GEOGRAPHY()` converts the geometric point into a geography data type suitable for distance calculations on Earth's surface.
  - `ST_DISTANCE(geog1, geog2)` calculates the shortest distance between two geography points, accounting for the Earth's curvature.
- **Handling of Units:** The `ST_DISTANCE` function returns distances in meters when used with geography types. The total distance is summed in meters, which is appropriate for accurate distance measurement.
- **Rounding Values:** The query includes `ROUND(..., 4)` to ensure that float values are rounded to four decimal places, as required.
- **Data Integrity:** The `WHERE` clause filters out any trips where station coordinates might be missing (`NULL` values), ensuring only valid data is used in calculations.
- **Standard Functions Used:** All functions used in `2result.sql` are standard SQL spatial functions supported by most SQL databases with spatial capabilities.

**Issues with Other SQL Scripts:**

- **`0result.sql`:** While it attempts to compute distances using `ST_DISTANCE`, it constructs geography points using string concatenation and Well-Known Text (WKT) representation. This method can be error-prone, especially if longitude and latitude values are not properly formatted or if there are any `NULL` values.
- **`1result.sql`:** It uses a `HAVERSINE` function, which is not a standard SQL function. Unless a user-defined function named `HAVERSINE` is created in the database, this query would result in an error.

**Conclusion:**

`2result.sql` provides a robust, accurate, and standard approach to calculating the total distance traveled by each bike, making it the correct choice.
