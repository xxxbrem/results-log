The correct SQL query is `2result.sql`.

**Reasoning:**

Both SQL queries aim to calculate the number of times each product was viewed, added to the cart, left in the cart without purchase, and actually purchased, while excluding events with `page_id` in (1, 2, 12, 13).

However, `2result.sql` provides a more accurate calculation because it takes into account the sequence of events within each user session (`visit_id`) and ensures that only "Add to Cart" events that occurred **before** a "Purchase" event are considered as leading to a purchase. This is achieved by:

- **Joining on `visit_id` and `cookie_id`**: Ensures that events are matched within the same user session.
- **Using `sequence_number` comparison**: Only counts "Add to Cart" events where the `sequence_number` is less than the `sequence_number` of the corresponding "Purchase" event, meaning the product was added to the cart **before** purchasing.
  
`0result.sql`, on the other hand, only joins on `visit_id` when associating "Add to Cart" events with purchases, without considering the event sequence within the session. This might lead to inaccuracies if multiple purchases or cart additions occur in a single session.

By correctly accounting for the event sequence, `2result.sql` ensures that the "number_left_in_cart_without_purchase" accurately reflects items added to the cart but not purchased in the same session.
