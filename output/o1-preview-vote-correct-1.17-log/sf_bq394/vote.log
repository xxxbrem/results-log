1result.sql
```

The correct SQL query is **`1result.sql`** because it adheres to the specified requirements:

- **No Use of `WITH` Clauses or Nested Queries**: The query avoids using any Common Table Expressions (`WITH` clauses) or nested subqueries. All calculations are performed directly within the main query.
- **Correct Calculation of Differences**: It computes the sum of absolute differences between the average temperatures for each combination of temperature types, exactly as intended.
- **Compliance with Instructions**: The query ensures that all temperature columns are not null, filters data between 2010 and 2014, and presents the results with floats rounded to four decimal places.

**Explanation of the Query:**

- **Combining Data**: It uses `UNION ALL` to combine data from the tables `ICOADS_CORE_2010` to `ICOADS_CORE_2014`.
- **Filtering Conditions**:
  - `"year"` between 2010 and 2014.
  - All temperature columns (`"air_temperature"`, `"wetbulb_temperature"`, `"dewpoint_temperature"`, `"sea_surface_temp"`) are not null.
- **Grouping and Aggregation**:
  - Groups data by `"year"` and `"month"`.
  - Calculates the average temperatures for each group.
- **Calculating Sum of Differences**:
  - Computes the absolute differences between each pair of average temperatures.
  - Sums these differences and rounds them to four decimal places.
- **Ordering and Limiting Results**:
  - Orders the results by the smallest sum of differences.
  - Limits the output to the top three records.

**Results Obtained:**

The query yields the following top three months with the smallest sum of absolute differences:

```
year,month,sum_of_differences
2013,6,12.6285
2013,7,12.6308
2012,7,12.8841
```

These results align with the task's objective, presenting the year and month in numerical format, along with the calculated sum of differences rounded to four decimal places.
