These queries help in understanding the structure and content of the relevant columns in the `CRIME_BY_LSOA` table:

- Queries 1 and 2 retrieve the distinct values of years and minor crime categories present in the data.
- Queries 3, 4, and 5 calculate total crimes per year and per minor category, identifying the top categories in 2008.
- Queries 6 and 7 provide insights into crime trends over the years and across categories.
- Queries 8 and 9 explore the distribution of crimes over different months in 2008.
- Query 10 lists all the boroughs included in the dataset, which could be useful for further geographical analysis.

Task: Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To provide the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row, the table below presents the data in CSV format. The percentages are rounded to two decimal places, and placeholder names and types are used since actual values cannot be inferred from the task description.

```csv
Year,Minor_Category_1_Name,Percentage_Share_1,Minor_Category_2_Name,Percentage_Share_2,Minor_Category_3_Name,Percentage_Share_3,Minor_Category_4_Name,Percentage_Share_4,Minor_Category_5_Name,Percentage_Share_5
year:int,minor_category:str,percentage:float,minor_category:str,percentage:float,minor_category:str,percentage:float,minor_category:str,percentage:float,minor_category:str,percentage:float
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: The year of the data (e.g., 2008, 2009), represented as an integer.
- **Minor_Category\_N\_Name**: Placeholder names for the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008, represented as strings.
- **Percentage\_Share\_N**: The percentage share of each minor category in London's total crimes for that year, rounded to two decimal places, represented as a float between 0.00 and 100.00.

Each row corresponds to a year, and the columns provide the percentage shares of the fixed top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 for that year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LONDON': {'LONDON_CRIME': ['CRIME_BY_LSOA'], 'LONDON_FIRE_BRIGADE': ['FIRE_BRIGADE_SERVICE_CALLS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-16 17:36:32 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row, the table below presents the data in CSV format. The percentages are rounded to two decimal places, and placeholder names and types are used since actual values cannot be inferred from the task description.

```csv
Year,Minor_Category_1_Name,Percentage_Share_1,Minor_Category_2_Name,Percentage_Share_2,Minor_Category_3_Name,Percentage_Share_3,Minor_Category_4_Name,Percentage_Share_4,Minor_Category_5_Name,Percentage_Share_5
year:int,minor_category:str,percentage:float,minor_category:str,percentage:float,minor_category:str,percentage:float,minor_category:str,percentage:float,minor_category:str,percentage:float
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: The year of the data (e.g., 2008, 2009), represented as an integer.
- **Minor_Category\_N\_Name**: Placeholder names for the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008, represented as strings.
- **Percentage\_Share\_N**: The percentage share of each minor category in London's total crimes for that year, rounded to two decimal places, represented as a float between 0.00 and 100.00.

Each row corresponds to a year, and the columns provide the percentage shares of the fixed top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 for that year. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
