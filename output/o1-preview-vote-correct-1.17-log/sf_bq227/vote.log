After comparing the SQL scripts and their results, I choose `2result.sql` as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Correct Calculation:** `2result.sql` accurately calculates the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes for each subsequent year.
- **Rounded to Four Decimal Places:** The percentages are rounded to **four decimal places** as per the instruction to ensure float values are rounded accordingly.
- **One Row per Year:** The output displays **each year in one row**, aligning with the requirement that each year's data should be presented in a single row.
- **Clear and Efficient SQL Structure:** The SQL uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize the calculations, making the query clear and efficient.
