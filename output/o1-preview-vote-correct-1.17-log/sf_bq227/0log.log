Task: Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To provide the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, we first identify these top categories based on the number of crimes in 2008. Then, for each subsequent year, we calculate the percentage that each of these categories contributes to the total crimes for that year. The percentages are rounded to two decimal places, and each year is displayed in one row.

```csv
Year,Minor_Category_1_Name,Minor_Category_1_Percentage,Minor_Category_2_Name,Minor_Category_2_Percentage,Minor_Category_3_Name,Minor_Category_3_Percentage,Minor_Category_4_Name,Minor_Category_4_Percentage,Minor_Category_5_Name,Minor_Category_5_Percentage
year:int,category_name:str,percentage:float,category_name:str,percentage:float,category_name:str,percentage:float,category_name:str,percentage:float,category_name:str,percentage:float
```

**Notes:**

- **Year**: The specific year (e.g., 2008, 2009, etc.).
- **Minor_Category_X_Name**: The name of the Xth top minor crime category from 2008.
- **Minor_Category_X_Percentage**: The percentage of total crimes in that year attributed to the Xth minor category, rounded to two decimal places.

*Example potential values:*

```csv
Year,Minor_Category_1_Name,Minor_Category_1_Percentage,Minor_Category_2_Name,Minor_Category_2_Percentage,Minor_Category_3_Name,Minor_Category_3_Percentage,Minor_Category_4_Name,Minor_Category_4_Percentage,Minor_Category_5_Name,Minor_Category_5_Percentage
2008,"Category A",12.34,"Category B",10.56,"Category C",9.87,"Category D",8.76,"Category E",7.65
2009,"Category A",11.22,"Category B",9.44,"Category C",8.33,"Category D",7.11,"Category E",6.00
...
```

**Explanation:**

- The **Minor_Category_X_Name** columns list the names of the top 5 minor crime categories identified in 2008.
- The **Minor_Category_X_Percentage** columns show each category's share of total crimes for the given year.
- This format allows for easy comparison of how these top categories' contributions to total crime have changed over the years..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LONDON': {'LONDON_CRIME': ['CRIME_BY_LSOA'], 'LONDON_FIRE_BRIGADE': ['FIRE_BRIGADE_SERVICE_CALLS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-16 17:36:58 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, we first identify these top categories based on the number of crimes in 2008. Then, for each subsequent year, we calculate the percentage that each of these categories contributes to the total crimes for that year. The percentages are rounded to two decimal places, and each year is displayed in one row.

```csv
Year,Minor_Category_1_Name,Minor_Category_1_Percentage,Minor_Category_2_Name,Minor_Category_2_Percentage,Minor_Category_3_Name,Minor_Category_3_Percentage,Minor_Category_4_Name,Minor_Category_4_Percentage,Minor_Category_5_Name,Minor_Category_5_Percentage
year:int,category_name:str,percentage:float,category_name:str,percentage:float,category_name:str,percentage:float,category_name:str,percentage:float,category_name:str,percentage:float
```

**Notes:**

- **Year**: The specific year (e.g., 2008, 2009, etc.).
- **Minor_Category_X_Name**: The name of the Xth top minor crime category from 2008.
- **Minor_Category_X_Percentage**: The percentage of total crimes in that year attributed to the Xth minor category, rounded to two decimal places.

*Example potential values:*

```csv
Year,Minor_Category_1_Name,Minor_Category_1_Percentage,Minor_Category_2_Name,Minor_Category_2_Percentage,Minor_Category_3_Name,Minor_Category_3_Percentage,Minor_Category_4_Name,Minor_Category_4_Percentage,Minor_Category_5_Name,Minor_Category_5_Percentage
2008,"Category A",12.34,"Category B",10.56,"Category C",9.87,"Category D",8.76,"Category E",7.65
2009,"Category A",11.22,"Category B",9.44,"Category C",8.33,"Category D",7.11,"Category E",6.00
...
```

**Explanation:**

- The **Minor_Category_X_Name** columns list the names of the top 5 minor crime categories identified in 2008.
- The **Minor_Category_X_Percentage** columns show each category's share of total crimes for the given year.
- This format allows for easy comparison of how these top categories' contributions to total crime have changed over the years. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
