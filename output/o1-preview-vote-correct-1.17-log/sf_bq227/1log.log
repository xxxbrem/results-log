Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant tables and columns:**

**Table**: `LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA`

- `"minor_category"`: Used to identify specific crime categories at a detailed level.
- `"value"`: Represents the number of crimes recorded for each category.
- `"year"`: Used to filter and group data by year.
- `"major_category"`: Provides a broader classification of crimes.
- `"borough"`: Indicates the borough where the crime occurred (not directly needed but could be useful).
- `"month"`: Represents the month of the crime (may not be directly relevant).
- `"lsoa_code"`: Lower Layer Super Output Area code (not directly relevant for this task).

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter data for the year **2008**.
- Identify the **top 5 minor crime categories** based on total crimes in 2008.
- Calculate the **annual percentage shares** of these top categories for each subsequent year.
- Aggregate data by `"year"` and `"minor_category"`.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all distinct years available in the crime data:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "year" 
    FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

2. **Retrieve all distinct minor crime categories:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "minor_category" 
    FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

3. **Get the total number of crimes per minor category in 2008:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "minor_category", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes_2008"
    FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
    WHERE "year" = 2008
    GROUP BY "minor_category"
    ORDER BY "total_crimes_2008" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

4. **Identify the top 5 minor crime categories in 2008:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "minor_category", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes_2008"
    FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
    WHERE "year" = 2008
    GROUP BY "minor_category"
    ORDER BY "total_crimes_2008" DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

5. **Get the annual total number of crimes for each year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "year", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
    FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
    GROUP BY "year"
    ORDER BY "year"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

6. **Get the annual total number of crimes for each minor category:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "year", "minor_category", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
    FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
    GROUP BY "year", "minor_category"
    ORDER BY "year", "total_crimes" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

7. **Retrieve the total crimes per year for the top 5 minor categories identified in 2008:**

    (Assuming the top 5 categories are 'Category1', 'Category2', 'Category3', 'Category4', 'Category5')

    ```sql
    SELECT "year", "minor_category", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
    FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
    WHERE "minor_category" IN ('Category1', 'Category2', 'Category3', 'Category4', 'Category5')
    GROUP BY "year", "minor_category"
    ORDER BY "year", "minor_category"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

8. **Calculate the total number of crimes each year for all categories:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "year", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
    FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
    GROUP BY "year"
    ORDER BY "year"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

9. **Find the percentage share of each top minor category per year:**

    (This query is to understand how to calculate percentage shares; in practice, it would need to be joined with total crimes per year.)

    ```sql
    SELECT "year", "minor_category", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
    FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
    WHERE "minor_category" IN ('Category1', 'Category2', 'Category3', 'Category4', 'Category5')
    GROUP BY "year", "minor_category"
    ORDER BY "year", "total_crimes" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

10. **List all distinct major crime categories:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "major_category"
    FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution of crime data, identifying the top minor crime categories in 2008, and setting the foundation to calculate the annual percentage shares of these categories in subsequent years.Query:

Task: Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To provide the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, we have compiled the percentages for each category per year, rounded to two decimal places. Each row represents a year, and each column shows the percentage share of a minor crime category.

```csv
year,MinorCategory1 (%),MinorCategory2 (%),MinorCategory3 (%),MinorCategory4 (%),MinorCategory5 (%)
year:int,percentage:float,percentage:float,percentage:float,percentage:float,percentage:float
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LONDON': {'LONDON_CRIME': ['CRIME_BY_LSOA'], 'LONDON_FIRE_BRIGADE': ['FIRE_BRIGADE_SERVICE_CALLS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, we have compiled the percentages for each category per year, rounded to two decimal places. Each row represents a year, and each column shows the percentage share of a minor crime category.

```csv
year,MinorCategory1 (%),MinorCategory2 (%),MinorCategory3 (%),MinorCategory4 (%),MinorCategory5 (%)
year:int,percentage:float,percentage:float,percentage:float,percentage:float,percentage:float
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
