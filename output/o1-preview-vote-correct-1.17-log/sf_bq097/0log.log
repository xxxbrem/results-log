**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS`
  - **"Year"**: Used to filter records for the years 2012 and 2017.
  - **"GeoName"**: Contains geographic region names; used to identify regions in Massachusetts (ends with 'MA').
  - **"Earnings_per_job_avg"**: Represents the average earnings per job; used to calculate the increase between years.
  - **"GeoFIPS"**: Geographic FIPS code; may be useful for identifying regions uniquely.

**Conditions to be Used:**

- **Year Condition**: `"Year" = DATE '2012-01-01'` or `"Year" = DATE '2017-01-01'` to select data for the specific years.
- **Geographic Region Condition**: `"GeoName" LIKE '%MA'` to select regions in Massachusetts.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Get distinct years available in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Year"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS;
   ```

2. **Get distinct geographic region names in Massachusetts:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "GeoName"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "GeoName" LIKE '%MA';
   ```

3. **Get average earnings per job for Massachusetts regions in 2012:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "GeoName", "Earnings_per_job_avg"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "Year" = DATE '2012-01-01' AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA';
   ```

4. **Get average earnings per job for Massachusetts regions in 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "GeoName", "Earnings_per_job_avg"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "Year" = DATE '2017-01-01' AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA';
   ```

5. **List all GeoFIPS codes for regions in Massachusetts:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "GeoFIPS"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "GeoName" LIKE '%MA';
   ```

6. **Count the number of records per year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Year", COUNT(*)
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   GROUP BY "Year";
   ```

7. **Check for null values in "Earnings_per_job_avg":**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "Earnings_per_job_avg" IS NULL;
   ```

8. **Get the minimum and maximum "Earnings_per_job_avg" for 2012:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("Earnings_per_job_avg") AS "Min_Earnings_2012",
          MAX("Earnings_per_job_avg") AS "Max_Earnings_2012"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "Year" = DATE '2012-01-01';
   ```

9. **Get the minimum and maximum "Earnings_per_job_avg" for 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("Earnings_per_job_avg") AS "Min_Earnings_2017",
          MAX("Earnings_per_job_avg") AS "Max_Earnings_2017"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "Year" = DATE '2017-01-01';
   ```

10. **Retrieve the average "Earnings_per_job_avg" across all regions for 2012:**

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG("Earnings_per_job_avg") AS "Average_Earnings_2012"
    FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
    WHERE "Year" = DATE '2012-01-01';
    ```

11. **Retrieve the average "Earnings_per_job_avg" across all regions for 2017:**

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG("Earnings_per_job_avg") AS "Average_Earnings_2017"
    FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
    WHERE "Year" = DATE '2017-01-01';
    ```

12. **Get the list of all regions and their average earnings per job in 2012 and 2017 (limited to 1000 rows):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Year", "GeoName", "Earnings_per_job_avg"
    FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
    WHERE "Year" IN (DATE '2012-01-01', DATE '2017-01-01')
    ORDER BY "GeoName", "Year"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the data related to the average earnings per job for different regions in Massachusetts for the years 2012 and 2017, which is essential for calculating the increase over the years.Query:

Task: What is the increasing amount of the average earnings per job between the years 2012 and 2017 for each geographic region in Massachusetts (indicated by "MA" at the end of GeoName)?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
GeoName,Earnings_Per_Job_Increase_2012_to_2017
geo_name_str,earnings_increase: float ≥ 0
```

**Explanation:**

This table displays the increase in average earnings per job between the years 2012 and 2017 for each geographic region in Massachusetts (indicated by "MA" at the end of `GeoName`). The `Earnings_Per_Job_Increase_2012_to_2017` column represents the non-negative difference in average earnings per job over the specified period for each region..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.

2025-01-16 14:07:50 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the increasing amount of the average earnings per job between the years 2012 and 2017 for each geographic region in Massachusetts (indicated by "MA" at the end of GeoName)?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
GeoName,Earnings_Per_Job_Increase_2012_to_2017
geo_name_str,earnings_increase: float ≥ 0
```

**Explanation:**

This table displays the increase in average earnings per job between the years 2012 and 2017 for each geographic region in Massachusetts (indicated by "MA" at the end of `GeoName`). The `Earnings_Per_Job_Increase_2012_to_2017` column represents the non-negative difference in average earnings per job over the specified period for each region. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
