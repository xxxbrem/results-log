After comparing both SQL queries, I recommend using `2result.sql` as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

1. **Precise Filtering of Massachusetts Regions:**
   - The query in `2result.sql` uses `LIKE '% MA'` in the `WHERE` clause to filter `GeoName` values that end with `' MA'`, ensuring only regions in Massachusetts are selected. This is more precise and avoids including any regions that might end with `'MA'` but are not in Massachusetts.

2. **Formatting Float Values to Four Decimal Places:**
   - The `2result.sql` query casts the difference in earnings to `NUMBER(18,4)`, which rounds the float values to four decimal places as required. This ensures that the output meets the formatting specification.

3. **Data Type Consistency:**
   - The dates in `2result.sql` are compared as strings (e.g., `'2012-01-01'`), which may be consistent with how the `"Year"` column is stored in the database. This avoids potential issues with data type mismatches that might arise when using the `DATE` keyword.

Therefore, `2result.sql` accurately computes the increase in average earnings per job between 2012 and 2017 for each geographic region in Massachusetts, with the float values correctly rounded.
