Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS`

- **Columns:**
  - `"country_code"`: Used to filter patents from the United States (`'US'`).
  - `"kind_code"`: Used to filter patents with kind code `'B2'`.
  - `"grant_date"`: Used to filter patents granted between 2008 and 2018.
  - `"claims_localized"`: VARIANT type containing the patent claims; we need to check if claims contain the word `'claim'`.

**Conditions to be Used:**

- Filter where `"country_code"` = `'US'`.
- Filter where `"kind_code"` = `'B2'`.
- Filter where `"grant_date"` is between `20080101` and `20181231` (assuming the date format is `YYYYMMDD`).
- Search within `"claims_localized"` for claims that do **not** include the word `'claim'`.

**Exploratory SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct country codes to confirm available countries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Retrieve distinct kind codes to understand patent document types:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "kind_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Sample grant dates to understand the date format:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "grant_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "grant_date" IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY "grant_date" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Convert grant dates to a readable date format to verify the date range:**

   ```sql
   SELECT TRY_TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "grant_date_parsed"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "grant_date" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Find the earliest and latest grant dates to confirm data coverage:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     MIN(TRY_TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD')) AS "earliest_grant_date",
     MAX(TRY_TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD')) AS "latest_grant_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "grant_date" IS NOT NULL;
   ```

6. **Retrieve a sample of `claims_localized` to understand its structure:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "publication_number",
     "claims_localized"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2'
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

7. **Flatten `claims_localized` to extract individual claim texts:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     t."publication_number",
     f.value:"text"::STRING AS "claim_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
   WHERE t."country_code" = 'US' AND t."kind_code" = 'B2'
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

8. **Check if claims contain the word 'claim' to see how it's represented:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     t."publication_number",
     f.value:"text"::STRING AS "claim_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
   WHERE
     t."country_code" = 'US' AND
     t."kind_code" = 'B2' AND
     f.value:"text"::STRING ILIKE '%claim%'
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

9. **Retrieve patents granted between 2008 and 2018 to verify date filtering:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "publication_number",
     TRY_TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "grant_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE
     "country_code" = 'US' AND
     "kind_code" = 'B2' AND
     TRY_TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

10. **Count the total number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS "total_us_b2_patents"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE
      "country_code" = 'US' AND
      "kind_code" = 'B2' AND
      TRY_TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2018-12-31';
    ```

By exploring these queries, we gain an understanding of the data structure, date formats, and how to access the claim texts within the `claims_localized` VARIANT column.

**Note:** In the above queries, we used `TRY_TO_DATE` to safely convert the `grant_date` integer into a date format, assuming it follows the `YYYYMMDD` pattern.Query:

Task: How many US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 contain claims that do not include the word 'claim'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 that contain claims that do not include the word 'claim', we need to query the `PUBLICATIONS` table in the `PATENTS` database. We select patents where the `country_code` is 'US', the `kind_code` is 'B2', the `grant_date` is between 2008 and 2018, and the `claims_localized` does not include the word 'claim'.

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-16 16:46:04 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 contain claims that do not include the word 'claim'?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 that contain claims that do not include the word 'claim', we need to query the `PUBLICATIONS` table in the `PATENTS` database. We select patents where the `country_code` is 'US', the `kind_code` is 'B2', the `grant_date` is between 2008 and 2018, and the `claims_localized` does not include the word 'claim'.

```csv
number_of_patents
num:int
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
Current snswer: 
number_of_patents

Current sql:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "number_of_patents"
FROM (
    SELECT t."publication_number"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
         LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
    WHERE
        t."country_code" = 'US' AND
        t."kind_code" = 'B2' AND
        TRY_TO_DATE(t."grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
    GROUP BY t."publication_number"
    HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN f.value:"text"::STRING ILIKE '%claim%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
) AS sub;

Here is the SQL query:

    SELECT t."publication_number"

    GROUP BY t."publication_number"
    HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN f.value:"text"::STRING ILIKE '%claim%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
) AS sub;
```

Result:
