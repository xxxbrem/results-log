{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS`

  - `"country_code"`: Used to filter patents from the United States.
  
  - `"kind_code"`: Used to filter patents with kind code 'B2'.
  
  - `"grant_date"`: Used to select patents granted between 2008 and 2018.
  
  - `"claims_localized"`: Contains the claims text in a VARIANT (possibly JSON) format; used to check if claims include the word 'claim'.
  
  - `"publication_number"`: Identifies individual patents.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter by country code: `"country_code" = 'US'`

- Filter by kind code: `"kind_code" = 'B2'`

- Filter by grant date between 2008 and 2018:
  - `"grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231` (assuming `grant_date` format is `YYYYMMDD`)

- Identify claims that do not include the word 'claim':
  - Check if `"claims_localized"` does **not** contain the word 'claim' (requires text extraction from VARIANT format)

---

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **Retrieve distinct country codes to verify available countries:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Retrieve distinct kind codes to understand patent types:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "kind_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Find the range of grant dates available:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("grant_date") AS "Earliest_Grant_Date", MAX("grant_date") AS "Latest_Grant_Date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS;
   ```

4. **Check for records with missing grant dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Null_Grant_Dates"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "grant_date" IS NULL;
   ```

5. **List publication numbers and grant dates for US B2 patents:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "grant_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Preview claims_localized data for US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "claims_localized"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Extract claims text from claims_localized VARIANT field:**
   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", t."claims_localized"::STRING AS "claims_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
   WHERE t."country_code" = 'US' AND t."kind_code" = 'B2' AND t."grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Flatten the claims_localized array to examine individual claims:**
   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", f.value::STRING AS "claim_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
   WHERE t."country_code" = 'US' AND t."kind_code" = 'B2'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Extract specific fields from claims_localized if it's a JSON object:**
   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", f.value:"text"::STRING AS "claim_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
   WHERE t."country_code" = 'US' AND t."kind_code" = 'B2'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Identify patents with no claims_localized data:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "publication_number", "grant_date"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "claims_localized" IS NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Retrieve titles of US B2 patents to understand their topics:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "publication_number", "title_localized"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Check the format and content of the grant_date field:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "grant_date"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Explore a sample of the claims_localized field for parsing structure:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "claims_localized"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "claims_localized" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **List patents and their filing dates for additional date context:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "publication_number", "filing_date"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Attempt to extract claim numbers from claims_localized if available:**
    ```sql
    SELECT t."publication_number", f.value:"number"::INT AS "claim_number", f.value:"text"::STRING AS "claim_text"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
    WHERE t."country_code" = 'US' AND t."kind_code" = 'B2'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

**Note:** These queries are intended to explore the data structure and content within the relevant columns, particularly focusing on the `claims_localized` field, which is critical for determining whether the claims contain the word 'claim'. The use of `LATERAL FLATTEN` assumes that `claims_localized` is an array or nested JSON structure that needs to be unpacked for analysis.Query:

Task: How many US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 contain claims that do not include the word 'claim'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 that contain claims that do not include the word 'claim', we consider the following conditions applied to the `PUBLICATIONS` table:

- **Country Code** is `'US'`.
- **Kind Code** is `'B2'`.
- **Grant Date** is between `2008` and `2018`.
- **Claims** (from `claims_localized` field) do not contain the word `'claim'`.

The result is:

```csv
number_of_patents
num:int
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
