2025-01-17 19:32:22 - root - INFO - I apologize for the confusion. The error message indicates that the column `"indicator_code"` does not exist in the table `"WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."SERIES_SUMMARY"`.

**Explanation:**

Upon reviewing the table structure of `"SERIES_SUMMARY"`, the correct column names are:

- `"series_code"`
- `"indicator_name"`
- `"topic"`
- ...

There is no column named `"indicator_code"` in this table. Instead, the corresponding column is `"series_code"`.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Please try the following query, replacing `"indicator_code"` with `"series_code"`:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "series_code", "indicator_name"
FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."SERIES_SUMMARY"
WHERE "indicator_name" ILIKE '%Crude birth rate%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **SELECT DISTINCT "series_code", "indicator_name":** Retrieves the unique combinations of series codes and indicator names.
- **FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."SERIES_SUMMARY":** Specifies the table to query.
- **WHERE "indicator_name" ILIKE '%Crude birth rate%':** Filters the indicators to those where the name contains 'Crude birth rate', case-insensitive.
- **LIMIT 1000;** Limits the result set to 1000 rows (though in this case, there should be only a few matching records).

**Next Steps:**

After running the corrected query, you should obtain the `series_code` associated with the 'Crude birth rate' indicator. This `series_code` can then be used to fetch the relevant data from the `"INDICATORS_DATA"` table, which uses `"indicator_code"` as the column name.

**Example of Fetching Data Using the Correct `indicator_code`:**

First, retrieve the `series_code` for 'Crude birth rate' (e.g., suppose it's `'SP.DYN.CBRT.IN'`).

Then, use the `series_code` as `indicator_code` in the `"INDICATORS_DATA"` table:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "indicator_code", "indicator_name"
FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."INDICATORS_DATA"
WHERE "indicator_code" = 'SP.DYN.CBRT.IN'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:** The `"INDICATORS_DATA"` table uses `"indicator_code"` as the column name, while the `"SERIES_SUMMARY"` table uses `"series_code"`. This distinction is important when joining or referencing these tables.

**Final Query to Fetch 'Crude birth rate' Data:**

Once you have the correct `indicator_code`, you can proceed with the queries to fetch and analyze the data for high-income countries during the 1980s.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or clarification on any of the steps.

,"Fragile and conflict-affected situations aggregate. 

Countries are distinguished based on the nature and severity of issues they face. The classification uses the following categories:

- Countries with high levels of institutional and social fragility, identified based on publicly available indicators that measure the quality of policy and institutions and manifestations of fragility.
- Countries affected by violent conflict, identified based on a threshold number of conflict-related deaths relative to the population. This category includes two sub-categories based on the intensity of violence: countries in high-intensity conflict and countries in medium-intensity conflict.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `"WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."COUNTRY_SUMMARY"`
   - `"country_code"`: To identify and join countries.
   - `"short_name"`: To get the country name.
   - `"region"`: To determine the region of each country.
   - `"income_group"`: To filter for high-income countries.

2. **Table:** `"WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."SERIES_SUMMARY"`
   - `"indicator_code"`: To identify the code for 'Crude birth rate'.
   - `"indicator_name"`: To locate the 'Crude birth rate' indicator.

3. **Table:** `"WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."INDICATORS_DATA"`
   - `"country_code"`: To link indicator data to countries.
   - `"indicator_code"`: To filter for 'Crude birth rate' data.
   - `"year"`: To filter data for the 1980s (1980-1989).
   - `"value"`: The value of the indicator (crude birth rate).

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter countries where `"income_group"` = 'High income'.
- Filter `"year"` between 1980 and 1989.
- Identify `"indicator_code"` corresponding to 'Crude birth rate'.
- Match `"indicator_name"` using pattern matching (e.g., `ILIKE '%Crude birth rate%'`).

Task: Which high-income country had the highest average crude birth rate respectively in each region, and what are their corresponding average birth rate, during the 1980s?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine which high-income country had the highest average crude birth rate in each region during the 1980s, we calculate the average crude birth rate for each high-income country within each region over the years 1980 to 1989. The results are as follows:

```csv
region,country_name,average_birth_rate
region_name1,country_name1,float
region_name2,country_name2,float
region_name3,country_name3,float
```

- **region**: The name of the region.
- **country_name**: The name of the high-income country with the highest average crude birth rate in that region during the 1980s.
- **average_birth_rate**: The corresponding average crude birth rate (float value)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'WORLD_BANK': {'WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION': ['POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY'], 'WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_DEBT', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_EDUCATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_EDUCATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY'], 'WORLD_BANK_WDI': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'FOOTNOTES', 'INDICATORS_DATA', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIME']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
