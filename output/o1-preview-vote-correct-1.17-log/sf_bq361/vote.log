After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Cohort Selection:** `2result.sql` correctly identifies users whose **first purchase** occurred in **January 2020** by filtering users where the minimum `"created_at"` timestamp falls between **January 1, 2020** and **February 1, 2020**. It uses UNIX timestamps in microseconds for accurate date comparisons.

- **Subsequent Purchases:** It then finds all subsequent purchases made by these users from **February 1, 2020** to **December 31, 2020**.

- **Proportion Calculation:** The SQL calculates the proportion of users who returned in each subsequent month by dividing the number of unique users who made a purchase in that month by the total number of users in the January cohort. This aligns precisely with the task requirements.

- **Correct Formatting and Rounding:** The month numbers and names are correctly formatted (e.g., "2, Feb-2020") in the results. Float values for proportions are rounded to **four decimal places**, as specified.

- **Consistent Results:** The results in `2result.csv` are consistent and plausible, showing non-zero proportions for each month, indicating that some users from the January cohort returned in subsequent months.

- **Comparison with Other SQLs:**
  - **`0result.sql`** produces similar results but has formatting issues with month names (e.g., "Febth", "Marth"), suggesting an error in the `TO_CHAR` function format string.
  - **`1result.sql`** filters orders based on specific statuses (`'Complete'`, `'Processing'`, `'Shipped'`), which was not specified in the task. Additionally, it shows a zero proportion for February, which seems inconsistent with expectations.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plain
2result.sql
