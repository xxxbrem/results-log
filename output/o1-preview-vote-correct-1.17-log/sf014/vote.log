```plain
0result.sql
```

The SQL named `0result.sql` is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Filtering for New York ZIP Codes:** The first SQL (`0result.sql`) correctly filters the ZIP codes to include only those within New York State by joining with the `LU_GeographyExpanded` table and filtering where `"PreferredStateAbbrev" = 'NY'`. This ensures that only New York ZIP codes are considered.

- **Commuter Metrics:** Both SQL queries correctly use the `MetricID`s `'B08303_012E'` and `'B08303_013E'`, which correspond to commute times of '60 to 89 minutes' and '90 or more minutes', effectively capturing commuters traveling over one hour.

- **Calculating State Benchmarks:** The first SQL accurately calculates the state benchmark and state population for New York State using a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `StateTotals`.

- **Result Consistency:** Both SQL queries produce the same result (`ZipCode` 11236 with a total of 18,945.09 commuters), but only the first SQL ensures that the data is filtered correctly for New York State ZIP codes.

- **Data Integrity:** By filtering the data appropriately, the first SQL (`0result.sql`) provides accurate and reliable results aligned with the task's requirements.

**Conclusion:**

The SQL in `0result.sql` is the appropriate query because it correctly filters for New York State ZIP codes, ensuring the accuracy of the results as per the task's specifications.
