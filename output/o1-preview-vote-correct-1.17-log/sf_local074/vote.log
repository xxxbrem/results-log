- **Includes months with no account activity** by generating a complete list of months and performing a cross join with all customers, ensuring every customer-month combination is represented.
- **Shows monthly changes and monthly cumulative bank account balances** by computing the monthly transaction sums and using a window function to calculate the running total for each customer.
- **Rounds float values to 4 decimal places** as specified.
