After comparing the two SQL queries, I have determined that both `0result.sql` and `1result.sql` correctly retrieve the names of strikers who scored no less than 100 runs in a match but whose team lost the game. Both queries join the necessary tables, calculate the total runs per striker per match, and filter based on the conditions provided.

However, `1result.sql` employs a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `batsman_runs`, which enhances the readability and modularity of the SQL query. Using a CTE allows for a cleaner structure, making the query easier to understand and maintain, especially for complex queries.

Therefore, I choose `1result.sql` as the correct answer because it follows best practices in SQL for clarity and maintainability.
