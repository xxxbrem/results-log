To address the task **"What percentage of trees in the Bronx have a health status of Good?"**, we need to examine the `TREES` table in the `MODERN_DATA` database and `MODERN_DATA` schema.

---

**Relevant Table:**
- `MODERN_DATA.MODERN_DATA.TREES`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `"boroname"`: Used to filter trees located in specific boroughs (e.g., 'Bronx').
- `"health"`: Represents the health status of each tree (e.g., 'Good', 'Fair', 'Poor'); used to identify trees with a health status of 'Good'.
- `"tree_id"`: Unique identifier for each tree; useful for counting trees.
- `"status"`: Indicates the status of the tree (e.g., 'Alive', 'Dead', 'Stump'); can provide additional context.
- `"spc_common"`: Common species name; may help in understanding species distribution.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- `"boroname" = 'Bronx'`: To select records for trees located in the Bronx.
- `"health" = 'Good'`: To select records where trees have a health status of 'Good'.

Task: What percentage of trees in the Bronx have a health status of Good?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the percentage of trees in the Bronx that have a health status of "Good," we divide the number of trees with a "Good" health status by the total number of trees in the Bronx and then multiply by 100.

```csv
Percentage
xx.xx
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'MODERN_DATA': {'MODERN_DATA': ['COMPANIES_DATES', 'COMPANIES_FUNDING', 'COMPANIES_INDUSTRIES', 'INCOME_TREES', 'PIZZA_CLEAN_CUSTOMER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_CLEAN_RUNNER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_CUSTOMER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_GET_EXCLUSIONS', 'PIZZA_GET_EXTRAS', 'PIZZA_NAMES', 'PIZZA_RECIPES', 'PIZZA_RUNNERS', 'PIZZA_RUNNER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_TOPPINGS', 'STATISTICS', 'TREES', 'WORD_LIST']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-17 23:17:18 - root - INFO - To determine the percentage of trees in the Bronx that have a health status of "Good," we divide the number of trees with a "Good" health status by the total number of trees in the Bronx and then multiply by 100. The following SQL query calculates this percentage:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(
    (COUNT(CASE WHEN "health" = 'Good' THEN 1 END) * 100.0) / COUNT(*),
    2
) AS "Percentage"
FROM MODERN_DATA.MODERN_DATA.TREES
WHERE "boroname" = 'Bronx';
```

This query counts the number of trees in the Bronx with a "Good" health status and divides it by the total number of trees in the Bronx. The result is multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage and rounded to two decimal places.

2025-01-17 23:17:20 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What percentage of trees in the Bronx have a health status of Good?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the percentage of trees in the Bronx that have a health status of "Good," we divide the number of trees with a "Good" health status by the total number of trees in the Bronx and then multiply by 100.

```csv
Percentage
xx.xx
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
