Among the provided SQL queries, **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:** This query uses fully qualified table and schema names enclosed in double quotes, which ensures that the SQL interpreter correctly identifies the database, schema, and table, especially if they contain special characters or are case-sensitive. Using fully qualified names helps prevent errors and enhances the clarity and portability of the query.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
