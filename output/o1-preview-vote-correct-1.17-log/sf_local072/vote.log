After comparing the two SQL scripts, **`0result.sql`** is the correct one.

**Reason:**

- **Dynamic Country Identification:** The script `0result.sql` dynamically identifies the country with data inserted on exactly nine different days in January 2022. It does this without hardcoding the country code, ensuring the query is accurate and adaptable to the data.

  ```sql
  SELECT "country_code_2"
  FROM "CITY_LEGISLATION"."CITY_LEGISLATION"."CITIES"
  WHERE "insert_date" LIKE '2022-01-%'
  GROUP BY "country_code_2"
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "insert_date") = 9
  ```

- **Robustness and Generalization:** By not assuming the country code, `0result.sql` remains correct even if the underlying data changes or if multiple countries meet the criteria. This makes the script more robust and in line with best practices.

- **Alignment with Task Requirements:** The task specifies to **identify** the country based on the data conditions. `0result.sql` fulfills this by computing the required country, whereas `1result.sql` assumes the country is `'ir'`:

  ```sql
  SELECT 'ir' AS "country_code_2"
  ```

- **Accurate Calculation of Proportion:** Both scripts calculate the proportion correctly and round the float values to four decimal places, but `0result.sql` ensures that the calculation is based on dynamically determined data.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
