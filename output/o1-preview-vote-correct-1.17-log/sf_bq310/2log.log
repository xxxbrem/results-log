2025-01-16 20:32:05 - root - INFO - To determine the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow, focusing on tags such as `'android-layout'`, `'android-activity'`, `'android-intent'`, etc., we can present the answer in the following format:

```csv
title
"How to [perform a specific task] with [Android component]"
```

**Explanation:**

- **Title**: Represents the question title that starts with "How to" and relates to Android development.
- Since the exact content cannot be inferred from the task description, we use placeholders like `[perform a specific task]` and `[Android component]` to indicate the type of content that would be present.
- This aligns with the requirement to fill the table according to the task description and use metanames for values that cannot be inferred.

title
"How to close/hide the Android soft keyboard programmatically?"
```

**Explanation:**

- The title represents the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow.
- It addresses a common issue developers face when working with Android's soft keyboard.
- This result is based on querying the `POSTS_QUESTIONS` table for questions tagged with `'android'` and containing "how" in the title, then selecting the one with the highest view count.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.POSTS_QUESTIONS`

    - `"title"`: Contains the title of each question.
        - **Potential usage**: To find questions that include the word "how" in the title.
    - `"tags"`: Contains the tags associated with each question.
        - **Potential usage**: To filter questions related to Android development by looking for tags like `'android-layout'`, `'android-activity'`, `'android-intent'`, etc.
    - `"view_count"`: Number of times the question has been viewed.
        - **Potential usage**: To identify the most viewed questions.
    - `"id"`: Unique identifier for each question.
        - **Potential usage**: To reference specific questions.
    - `"score"`: The score of the question based on votes.
        - **Potential usage**: To assess the popularity of questions.
    - `"creation_date"`: Timestamp when the question was created.
        - **Potential usage**: To analyze questions over a time period.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `"title" ILIKE '%how%'`:
    - To find questions where the title contains the word "how", case-insensitive.
- `"tags" LIKE '%<android-layout>%'"`:
    - To find questions tagged with `'android-layout'`.
- `"tags" LIKE '%<tag_name>%'"`:
    - Replace `<tag_name>` with other Android-related tags like `'android-activity'`, `'android-intent'`, etc.
- Combining conditions with `AND` and `OR`:
    - To filter questions that meet multiple criteria, such as containing "how" in the title and being tagged with specific Android tags.

    OR "tags" LIKE '%<android-view>%'
    OR "tags" LIKE '%<android-fragment>%'
    OR "tags" LIKE '%<android-adapter>%')
LIMIT 1000;
```

These queries are designed to help understand the data in the relevant columns and how they can be used to address the task:

- **Queries 1 & 2**: Provide a general understanding of the data in the `"title"` and `"tags"` columns.
- **Query 3**: Shows how to filter questions whose titles contain the word "how".
- **Queries 4 & 7**: Demonstrate how to find questions tagged with specific Android tags.
- **Queries 5 & 8**: Combine conditions to find questions that both contain "how" in the title and are tagged with Android-related tags.
- **Query 6**: Retrieves view counts to understand the distribution of views among questions containing "how".
- **Query 9**: Retrieves titles and view counts for questions tagged with Android tags.
- **Query 10**: Expands the search to include multiple Android-related tags and combines it with the "how" keyword in the title.

**Note:** All column names are enclosed in double quotations as per the requirement, and each query is independent and limited to retrieving relevant data to understand the values in the columns.Query:

Task: What is the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow, across specified tags such as 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', and others

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow, we focus on questions that:

- Contain the word "how" in the title.
- Are tagged with Android development tags such as `'android-layout'`, `'android-activity'`, `'android-intent'`, etc.

Based on these criteria, the title of the most viewed question is:

```csv
title
"How to [perform a specific action] in Android using [specific tag]"
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKOVERFLOW': {'STACKOVERFLOW': ['BADGES', 'COMMENTS', 'POSTS_ANSWERS', 'POSTS_MODERATOR_NOMINATION', 'POSTS_ORPHANED_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_PRIVILEGE_WIKI', 'POSTS_QUESTIONS', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI_EXCERPT', 'POSTS_WIKI_PLACEHOLDER', 'POST_HISTORY', 'POST_LINKS', 'STACKOVERFLOW_POSTS', 'TAGS', 'USERS', 'VOTES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-16 20:34:29 - root - INFO - To determine the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow, we need to adjust the SQL query to account for the actual format of the `"tags"` column.

**Explanation:**

- The `"tags"` column contains tags separated by the pipe character `|` without angle brackets.
- We can use the `SPLIT` function to split the tags into an array.
- Use the `= ANY()` clause to check if any of the specified Android tags are present in the tags array.
- Ensure that we order the results with `NULLS LAST` to handle any `NULL` values in the `"view_count"` column.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "title", "view_count"
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.POSTS_QUESTIONS
WHERE "title" ILIKE '%how%'
  AND (
    'android' = ANY(SPLIT("tags", '|'))
    OR 'android-layout' = ANY(SPLIT("tags", '|'))
    OR 'android-activity' = ANY(SPLIT("tags", '|'))
    OR 'android-intent' = ANY(SPLIT("tags", '|'))
    OR 'android-view' = ANY(SPLIT("tags", '|'))
    OR 'android-fragment' = ANY(SPLIT("tags", '|'))
    OR 'android-adapter' = ANY(SPLIT("tags", '|'))
  )
ORDER BY "view_count" DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 1;
```

This query selects the title and view count of the most viewed question that:

- Contains the word "how" in the title (`"title" ILIKE '%how%'`).
- Is tagged with one of the specified Android-related tags.
- Orders the results by the highest `"view_count"`, excluding any `NULL` values (`ORDER BY "view_count" DESC NULLS LAST`).
- Limits the result to the top entry (`LIMIT 1`).

**Note:** All column names are enclosed in double quotations as per the requirement, and the query adheres to the Snowflake SQL dialect.
