After comparing both SQL scripts, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct script to use for calculating the chi-squared statistic for the association between KRAS and TP53 mutations in PAAD patients. Here's the reasoning:

### Reasons:

1. **Accurate Handling of the "Do_not_use" Field:**
   - In **`2result.sql`**, the script filters out patients where `"Do_not_use"` equals `'TRUE'`. This aligns with the actual values present in the `MERGED_SAMPLE_QUALITY_ANNOTATIONS` table, where the `"Do_not_use"` field contains `'True'` and `'False'`.
   - In **`1result.sql`**, the script filters out patients where `"Do_not_use"` equals `'Yes'`. Given the values in the data, this may not accurately exclude all low-quality samples, potentially including patients that should be excluded.

2. **Consistent Data Filtering:**
   - **`2result.sql`** ensures that only high-quality patient data is included by correctly interpreting the `"Do_not_use"` flags, leading to more reliable results.
   - **`1result.sql`** might include patients with `"Do_not_use"` marked as `'True'` because it only excludes those with `'Yes'`, which could affect the integrity of the analysis.

3. **Appropriate Chi-Squared Calculation:**
   - The chi-squared statistic calculation in **`2result.sql`** is correctly applied for a 2x2 contingency table, using the formula:
     \[
     \chi^2 = \frac{(ad - bc)^2 \cdot n}{(a + b)(c + d)(a + c)(b + d)}
     \]
     This method is suitable and commonly used for 2x2 tables.
   - While **`1result.sql`** also computes the chi-squared statistic, the potential inclusion of incorrect patient data due to improper filtering may compromise its validity.

### Conclusion:

Given the accurate data filtering and appropriate computation method, **`2result.sql`** is the correct script to use for this analysis.
