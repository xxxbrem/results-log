After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **2result.sql** is the correct SQL query.

**Reasoning:**

- **Handling Missing Data:** `2result.sql` uses `LEFT JOIN`s when joining the `RATINGS` table. This ensures that all directors are included in the analysis, even if some of their movies do not have associated ratings. It also uses `COALESCE` to handle `NULL` values, replacing them with default values (e.g., zero for sums).

- **Accurate Calculation of Average Inter-Movie Duration:** It calculates the average inter-movie duration by computing the differences between the release years of a director's movies using window functions (`LAG`), which is more precise than simply subtracting the minimum year from the maximum year divided by the number of intervals.

- **Adherence to Task Requirements:** The query aligns closely with the task's requirements by carefully aggregating and calculating all needed metrics while considering potential data inconsistencies.

- **Robustness:** `2result.sql` is more robust in handling cases where data might be missing or incomplete, ensuring that the final output is accurate and comprehensive.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:
