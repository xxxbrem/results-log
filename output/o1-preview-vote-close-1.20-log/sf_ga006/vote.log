Based on the comparison of the three SQL scripts and their adherence to the task requirements, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script. Here's why:

- **Session Identification:**
  - `1result.sql` extracts the session ID from the `EVENT_PARAMS` column by looking for the `ga_session_id` key. This is the appropriate way to identify sessions in GA4 data, as `ga_session_id` uniquely identifies user sessions.
  - `0result.sql` uses `EVENT_BUNDLE_SEQUENCE_ID` as the session ID. However, this field increments with each event bundle and may not reliably represent a unique session ID.
  - `2result.sql` uses `EVENT_DATE` as the session ID, which can be inaccurate because a user might have multiple sessions in a single day. Grouping by date can incorrectly merge separate sessions.

- **Correct Identification of Users with Multiple Sessions:**
  - `1result.sql` correctly identifies users who have multiple distinct `ga_session_id` values, ensuring that only users with multiple purchase sessions are included.
  - `0result.sql` may incorrectly identify sessions due to the potential unreliability of `EVENT_BUNDLE_SEQUENCE_ID`.
  - `2result.sql` may miss users with multiple sessions on the same day because it groups sessions by date.

- **Accurate Calculation of Average Purchase Value:**
  - `1result.sql` accurately calculates the average purchase value per session by grouping purchases by `User_ID` and `Session_ID` (extracted from `ga_session_id`).
  - The other scripts may group events incorrectly due to unreliable session identification.

Therefore, the correct SQL script that fulfills the task requirement is:

1result.sql
