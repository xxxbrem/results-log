**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **ORDERLINES**
  - `"order_id"`: To identify the specific order (423).
  - `"product_id"`: To know which products are ordered.
  - `"qty"`: Quantity ordered for each product.

- **ORDERS**
  - `"id"`: Order ID.
  - Used to filter the required order.

- **INVENTORY**
  - `"product_id"`: To match products in the order.
  - `"location_id"`: To find where the product is stored.
  - `"qty"`: Quantity available at each location.
  - `"purchase_id"`: To link to purchase dates.

- **LOCATIONS**
  - `"id"`: Location ID.
  - `"warehouse"`: To filter inventory in warehouse 1.
  - `"aisle"`: To get aisle information.
  - `"position"`: To get position within the aisle.

- **PURCHASES**
  - `"id"`: Purchase ID (linked to `"purchase_id"` in INVENTORY).
  - `"purchased"`: Date of purchase (to prioritize earlier dates).

**Conditions Used:**

- Filter order lines for `"order_id" = 423`.
- Match inventory `"product_id"` with products in the order.
- Filter locations where `"warehouse" = 1`.
- Join INVENTORY and LOCATIONS on `"location_id" = "id"`.
- Join INVENTORY and PURCHASES on `"purchase_id" = "id"`.
- Prioritize inventory by earlier `"purchased"` dates and smaller `"qty"`.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve order lines for order 423:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "order_id", "product_id", "qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES"
   WHERE "order_id" = 423
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List products and quantities needed for order 423:**

   ```sql
   SELECT ol."product_id", p."name", ol."qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" ol
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" p ON ol."product_id" = p."id"
   WHERE ol."order_id" = 423
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get available inventory for products in order 423 in warehouse 1:**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", i."location_id", i."qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" ol ON i."product_id" = ol."product_id"
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."LOCATIONS" l ON i."location_id" = l."id"
   WHERE ol."order_id" = 423 AND l."warehouse" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve aisle and position for inventory locations in warehouse 1:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT i."product_id", l."aisle", l."position", i."qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" ol ON i."product_id" = ol."product_id"
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."LOCATIONS" l ON i."location_id" = l."id"
   WHERE ol."order_id" = 423 AND l."warehouse" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Fetch purchase dates for inventory items:**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", i."qty", pchs."purchased"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pchs ON i."purchase_id" = pchs."id"
   WHERE i."product_id" IN (
     SELECT "product_id" FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" WHERE "order_id" = 423
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Get full inventory details for order 423 in warehouse 1:**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", l."aisle", l."position", i."qty", pchs."purchased"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."LOCATIONS" l ON i."location_id" = l."id"
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pchs ON i."purchase_id" = pchs."id"
   WHERE i."product_id" IN (
     SELECT "product_id" FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" WHERE "order_id" = 423
   )
   AND l."warehouse" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate total quantity needed for each product in order 423:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty_needed"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES"
   WHERE "order_id" = 423
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Determine total available quantity in warehouse 1 for ordered products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", SUM(i."qty") AS "total_qty_available"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."LOCATIONS" l ON i."location_id" = l."id"
   WHERE i."product_id" IN (

   )
   AND l."warehouse" = 1
   GROUP BY i."product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find earliest purchase dates for inventory items of ordered products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", pchs."purchased", i."qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pchs ON i."purchase_id" = pchs."id"
   WHERE i."product_id" IN (
     SELECT "product_id" FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" WHERE "order_id" = 423
   )
   ORDER BY pchs."purchased" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve inventory details ordered by purchase date and quantity:**

    ```sql
    SELECT i."product_id", l."aisle", l."position", i."qty", pchs."purchased"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."LOCATIONS" l ON i."location_id" = l."id"

12. **Show inventory quantities less than or equal to required quantities:**

    ```sql
    SELECT i."product_id", i."qty", ol."qty" AS "order_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" ol ON i."product_id" = ol."product_id"
    WHERE ol."order_id" = 423
    AND i."qty" <= ol."qty"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Identify inventory locations with earliest purchase dates and smallest quantities:**

    ```sql
    SELECT i."product_id", l."aisle", l."position", i."qty", pchs."purchased"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."LOCATIONS" l ON i."location_id" = l."id"
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pchs ON i."purchase_id" = pchs."id"
    WHERE l."warehouse" = 1
    AND i."product_id" IN (
      SELECT "product_id" FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" WHERE "order_id" = 423
    )
    ORDER BY pchs."purchased" ASC, i."qty" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Retrieve inventory details including purchase cost:**

    ```sql
    SELECT i."product_id", i."qty", pchs."purchased", pchs."cost"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pchs ON i."purchase_id" = pchs."id"
    WHERE i."product_id" IN (
      SELECT "product_id" FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" WHERE "order_id" = 423
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Compare ordered quantities with available inventory per product:**

    ```sql
    SELECT ol."product_id", ol."qty" AS "ordered_qty", SUM(i."qty") AS "available_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" ol
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i ON ol."product_id" = i."product_id"
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."LOCATIONS" l ON i."location_id" = l."id"
    WHERE ol."order_id" = 423 AND l."warehouse" = 1
    GROUP BY ol."product_id", ol."qty"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Which product ID, aisle, and position should be selected to pick the highest quantity for order 423, ensuring the picked quantity does not exceed the available inventory in warehouse 1, and calculate the quantity to be picked while prioritizing locations with earlier dates and smaller quantities?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
product_id,aisle,position,qty_to_pick
product_id1:int,aisle1:str,position1:int,qty_to_pick1:float
product_id2:int,aisle2:str,position2:int,qty_to_pick2:float
...
```

To fulfill order **423**, select the **product ID**, **aisle**, and **position** from inventory in **warehouse 1**, ensuring the picked quantity does not exceed the available inventory. Calculate the quantity to pick (**qty_to_pick**) while prioritizing locations with earlier purchase dates and smaller quantities..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-21 17:35:26 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which product ID, aisle, and position should be selected to pick the highest quantity for order 423, ensuring the picked quantity does not exceed the available inventory in warehouse 1, and calculate the quantity to be picked while prioritizing locations with earlier dates and smaller quantities?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
product_id,aisle,position,qty_to_pick
product_id1:int,aisle1:str,position1:int,qty_to_pick1:float
product_id2:int,aisle2:str,position2:int,qty_to_pick2:float
...
```

To fulfill order **423**, select the **product ID**, **aisle**, and **position** from inventory in **warehouse 1**, ensuring the picked quantity does not exceed the available inventory. Calculate the quantity to pick (**qty_to_pick**) while prioritizing locations with earlier purchase dates and smaller quantities. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
