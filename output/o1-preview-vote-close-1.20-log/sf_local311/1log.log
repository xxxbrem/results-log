2025-01-22 23:13:05 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering occurs because the alias `"ra"` is not available in the outer `SELECT` statement. The alias `"ra"` (for the `"RACES"` table) is only defined within the subqueries and is not accessible in the outer scope.

To fix this error, you should reference the `"year"` column from the subquery alias `"cs"` instead of `"ra"`. Here's the corrected and updated SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
  c."name" AS "Constructor",
  cs."year" AS "Year",
  cs."team_points",
  bdp."driver_points",
  (cs."team_points" + bdp."driver_points") AS "combined_points"
FROM (
  SELECT cs."constructor_id", ra."year", SUM(cs."points") AS "team_points"
  FROM "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS" cs
  JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ra ON cs."race_id" = ra."race_id"
  GROUP BY cs."constructor_id", ra."year"
) cs
JOIN (
  SELECT sub."constructor_id", sub."year", sub."driver_id", sub."driver_points"
  FROM (
    SELECT r."constructor_id", ra."year", r."driver_id", SUM(r."points") AS "driver_points",
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY r."constructor_id", ra."year" ORDER BY SUM(r."points") DESC) AS "rank"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" r
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
    GROUP BY r."constructor_id", r."driver_id", ra."year"
  ) sub
  WHERE sub."rank" = 1
) bdp ON cs."constructor_id" = bdp."constructor_id" AND cs."year" = bdp."year"
JOIN "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTORS" c ON cs."constructor_id" = c."constructor_id"
ORDER BY (cs."team_points" + bdp."driver_points") DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Fixed the Error:** Changed `ra."year"` to `cs."year"` in the outer `SELECT` statement because `ra` is not available in that scope. The alias `cs` (from the subquery) includes the `"year"` column.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    c."name" AS "Constructor",
    cs."year" AS "Year",
    ...
  ```
  
- **Added Combined Points:** Calculated the combined points by adding the team's total points (`cs."team_points"`) and the best driver's points (`bdp."driver_points"`).
  
  ```sql
  (cs."team_points" + bdp."driver_points") AS "combined_points"
  ```
  
- **Ordered Results:** Modified the `ORDER BY` clause to sort by the `combined_points` in descending order to find the top 3 constructors.
  
  ```sql
  ORDER BY (cs."team_points" + bdp."driver_points") DESC
  LIMIT 3;
  ```

**Result:**

The query will return the constructors with the top 3 combined points from their best driver and team, along with the years they achieved them.

```csv
Constructor,Year,team_points,driver_points,combined_points
constructor_name1:str,year1:int,team_points1:float,driver_points1:float,combined_points1:float
constructor_name2:str,year2:int,team_points2:float,driver_points2:float,combined_points2:float
constructor_name3:str,year3:int,team_points3:float,driver_points3:float,combined_points3:float
```

**Explanation of the Logic:**

- **First Subquery (`cs`):** Calculates the total team points for each constructor per year by summing up the points from the `"CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS"` table.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT cs."constructor_id", ra."year", SUM(cs."points") AS "team_points"
  FROM "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS" cs
  JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ra ON cs."race_id" = ra."race_id"
  GROUP BY cs."constructor_id", ra."year"
  ```
  
- **Second Subquery (`bdp`):** Identifies the best driver per constructor per year by calculating the total points per driver and ranking them. Only the driver with rank 1 (highest points) is selected.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT sub."constructor_id", sub."year", sub."driver_id", sub."driver_points"
  FROM (
    SELECT r."constructor_id", ra."year", r."driver_id", SUM(r."points") AS "driver_points",
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY r."constructor_id", ra."year" ORDER BY SUM(r."points") DESC) AS "rank"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" r
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
    GROUP BY r."constructor_id", r."driver_id", ra."year"
  ) sub
  WHERE sub."rank" = 1
  ```
  
- **Main Query:** Joins the team points and best driver points on constructor ID and year, calculates the combined points, and retrieves the constructor names.

**Note:** Make sure that the `"year"` column is correctly referenced from the subquery alias in the outer `SELECT` statement, and that all aliases are correctly used in their respective scopes.

**Final Output Format:**

```csv
Constructor,Year,Combined_Points
constructor_name1:str,year1:int,combined_points1:float
constructor_name2:str,year2:int,combined_points2:float
constructor_name3:str,year3:int,combined_points3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

This output lists the constructors with the top 3 highest combined points from their best driver and team, along with the years in which they achieved them.

Task: Which constructors had the top 3 combined points from their best driver and team, and in which years did they achieve them?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Constructor,Year,Combined_Points
constructor_name1:str,year1:int,combined_points1:float
constructor_name2:str,year2:int,combined_points2:float
constructor_name3:str,year3:int,combined_points3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

We calculated the combined points by adding the total points of each constructor's best driver to the team's total points for that year. The table lists the constructors with the top 3 combined points and the years in which they achieved them..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-22 23:14:29 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which constructors had the top 3 combined points from their best driver and team, and in which years did they achieve them?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Constructor,Year,Combined_Points
constructor_name1:str,year1:int,combined_points1:float
constructor_name2:str,year2:int,combined_points2:float
constructor_name3:str,year3:int,combined_points3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

We calculated the combined points by adding the total points of each constructor's best driver to the team's total points for that year. The table lists the constructors with the top 3 combined points and the years in which they achieved them. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
