WHERE LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%atopic dermatitis%';
```

2. **Retrieve Participants with Specified Conditions and Their Codes:**
```sql

   OR LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%psoriasis%'
   OR LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%vitiligo%'
GROUP BY Condition;
```

4. **Retrieve Participants with Acne and Their Condition Start Dates:**
```sql
SELECT c.person_id, c.condition_start_date, con.concept_name AS condition_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.condition_occurrence` AS c

   OR LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%psoriasis%'
   OR LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%vitiligo%'
GROUP BY con.concept_name
ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

7. **Retrieve Participants Without Any of the Specified Conditions:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p.person_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.person` AS p
WHERE p.person_id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT c.person_id

  JOIN `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.concept` AS con
    ON c.condition_concept_id = con.concept_id
  WHERE LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%acne%'
     OR LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%atopic dermatitis%'
     OR LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%psoriasis%'
     OR LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%vitiligo%'
)
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Correction Applied:** Instead of filtering on `condition_source_value`, which might not contain the ICD-10-CM codes or relevant values, we are now filtering on `concept_name`, which contains the condition names.
- **Using `LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%condition%'`:** This ensures that the search is case-insensitive and matches any concept names containing the specified condition keywords.
- **Joining with the `concept` Table:** By joining the `condition_occurrence` table with the `concept` table on `condition_concept_id`, we can access the `concept_name` and other relevant fields.

These corrected SQL queries should help you retrieve the desired data without errors.

Regarding the error message you received:
```
Input sql:
E
The error information is:
400 Syntax error: Unexpected identifier "E" at [1:1]
```
It appears that the input SQL was just the letter `E`, which is not a valid SQL statement. Please ensure you are inputting the full and correct SQL query when executing it.

         OR LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%vitiligo%'
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Explanation:**

- **Correction Applied:** We switched from filtering on `condition_source_value` or specific codes to filtering on `LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%condition%'`, which searches for the condition names in a case-insensitive manner.
- **Consistent Pattern:** All queries now consistently use `JOIN` with the `concept` table and filter based on `concept_name`.
- **Avoiding Errors:** The previous errors likely resulted from using codes not present in the dataset or filtering on fields that didn't contain the expected values. By using `concept_name`, we ensure that we're searching within the data available.
- **Limiting Results:** We use `LIMIT 100` where appropriate to limit the output for testing and verification purposes.

**Note:** When running these queries, ensure that:

- The `concept_name` values in the `concept` table indeed contain the condition names you're searching for.
- The dataset you're querying contains the necessary records. If the dataset is synthetic or anonymized, some conditions might not be present.

**Regarding the Error Messages:**

The error messages you've encountered, such as:

```
Input sql:
x
The error information is:
400 Syntax error: Unexpected identifier "x" at [1:1]
```

Indicate that the SQL input was invalid (e.g., just the letter 'x'). Make sure when running the queries to copy and paste the entire SQL query provided, and not just a fragment or unintended character.

**Example of Correct Usage:**

To count the number of participants with psoriasis, you should run the full query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.person_id) AS psoriasis_participants
FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.condition_occurrence` AS c
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.concept` AS con
  ON c.condition_concept_id = con.concept_id
WHERE LOWER(con.concept_name) LIKE '%psoriasis%';
```

**Expected Results:**

You should receive a result similar to:

```
psoriasis_participants
[Number of participants with psoriasis]
```

Adjusting for your dataset, replace `[Number of participants with psoriasis]` with the actual count returned.

**Final Note:**

If you continue to receive errors, please ensure:

- You're connected to the correct dataset.
- You're copying the entire SQL query without extra characters or omissions.
- There are no syntax errors introduced during copying or editing.

Let me know if you need further assistance or if there are specific errors in any of the provided queries.

By executing these queries, we can gather the necessary data to calculate the percentage of participants diagnosed with each condition, including their subcategories, based on the specified ICD-10-CM codes.

**Note:** Since actual data access and values are not available, the exact percentages cannot be provided here. However, using the counts obtained from the queries above and the total number of participants, you can calculate the percentages as follows:

Percentage of participants with a condition = (Number of participants with the condition / Total number of participants) * 100

Task: Could you provide the percentage of participants for standard acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and vitiligo defined by the International Classification of Diseases 10-CM(ICD-10-CM), including their subcategories? The ICD-10 codes are: Acne (L70), Atopic dermatitis (L20), Psoriasis (L40), and Vitiligo (L80). 

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the percentage of participants diagnosed with acne (L70), atopic dermatitis (L20), psoriasis (L40), and vitiligo (L80), including their subcategories as defined by ICD-10-CM codes, we would perform the following steps using SQL queries on the `cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop` dataset:

1. **Calculate the total number of unique participants**:
   - Query the `person` table to count the distinct `person_id`s.
   
2. **Identify participants with each condition**:
   - Query the `condition_occurrence` table.
   - Filter the `condition_source_value` column for codes that start with the specified ICD-10 codes to include all subcategories (e.g., 'L70%', 'L20%', 'L40%', 'L80%').
   - Retrieve the distinct `person_id`s associated with each condition.

3. **Calculate the number of participants for each condition**:
   - Count the number of unique `person_id`s identified for each condition group.

4. **Compute the percentage for each condition**:
   - Divide the number of participants with each condition by the total number of participants.
   - Multiply the result by 100 to obtain the percentage.

Since we do not have the actual data values, we cannot provide the exact percentages. However, the final results would be presented in the following format:

```csv
Condition,Percentage_of_participants
Acne,percentage:0<=float<=100
Atopic dermatitis,percentage:0<=float<=100
Psoriasis,percentage:0<=float<=100
Vitiligo,percentage:0<=float<=100
```

This table represents the percentage of participants diagnosed with each condition, including all their subcategories, based on the specified ICD-10-CM codes..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['hcpcs', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd10_procedures_2019', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['home_health_agencies_2013', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'hospital_general_info', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['care_site', 'concept', 'concept_ancestor', 'concept_class', 'concept_relationship', 'condition_era', 'condition_occurrence', 'cost', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'domain', 'dose_era', 'drug_era', 'drug_exposure', 'drug_strength', 'location', 'observation', 'observation_period', 'payer_plan_period', 'person', 'procedure_occurrence', 'provider', 'relationship', 'vocabulary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

   - Query the `condition_occurrence` table.
   - Filter the `condition_source_value` column for codes that start with the specified ICD-10 codes to include all subcategories (e.g., 'L70%', 'L20%', 'L40%', 'L80%').
   - Retrieve the distinct `person_id`s associated with each condition.

3. **Calculate the number of participants for each condition**:
   - Count the number of unique `person_id`s identified for each condition group.

4. **Compute the percentage for each condition**:
   - Divide the number of participants with each condition by the total number of participants.
   - Multiply the result by 100 to obtain the percentage.

Since we do not have the actual data values, we cannot provide the exact percentages. However, the final results would be presented in the following format:

```csv
Condition,Percentage_of_participants
Acne,percentage:0<=float<=100
Atopic dermatitis,percentage:0<=float<=100
Psoriasis,percentage:0<=float<=100
Vitiligo,percentage:0<=float<=100
```

This table represents the percentage of participants diagnosed with each condition, including all their subcategories, based on the specified ICD-10-CM codes.
