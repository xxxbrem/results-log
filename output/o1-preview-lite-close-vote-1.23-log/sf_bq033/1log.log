```

**Explanation:**

- **LATERAL FLATTEN:** The `abstract_localized` field is a VARIANT (JSON array). We use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to explode the array elements so we can access each abstract's "text" field.
  
- **Handling Empty Values:** By joining with `LATERAL FLATTEN`, records with a null or empty `abstract_localized` field will be skipped since there are no elements to flatten. This ensures we only consider records where the abstract exists.

- **Filtering Abstract Text:** We check if the "text" field of each abstract contains the phrase 'internet of things' using the `ILIKE '%internet of things%'` condition for case-insensitive matching.

- **Filing Date Validity:** We exclude records where `"filing_date"` is `0` or invalid. This is important because some records have a filing date of `0` or missing, as seen in your sample data.

- **Date Range:** We convert `"filing_date"` to a date format and extract the year using `YEAR(TO_DATE(...))`, filtering for years between 2008 and 2022 inclusive.

- **Grouping:** We group the results by both "Year" and "Month" to get the count of publications filed each month.

- **Ordering:** The results are ordered chronologically by "Year" and "Month".

**Note:** This query will return the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') filed each month from 2008 to 2022. It handles empty or null `abstract_localized` fields by only considering records where the abstract exists and contains the specified phrase.

  AND YEAR(TRY_TO_DATE(t."filing_date"::STRING, 'YYYYMMDD')) BETWEEN 2008 AND 2022
GROUP BY "Year", "Month"
ORDER BY "Year", "Month";
```

**Explanation:**

- **Handling Empty Columns:** To address empty or null values in the `abstract_localized` field, we added the condition `t."abstract_localized" IS NOT NULL` and `ARRAY_SIZE(t."abstract_localized") > 0` to ensure that the array contains at least one element.

- **Accessing Abstract Text Without LATERAL FLATTEN:** Instead of using `LATERAL FLATTEN`, we directly access the first element of the `abstract_localized` array using `t."abstract_localized"[0]`. This simplifies the query and avoids issues with empty arrays.

- **Using TRY_TO_DATE:** We use `TRY_TO_DATE` instead of `TO_DATE` to safely handle invalid or empty `filing_date` values. If the date conversion fails, `TRY_TO_DATE` returns `NULL`, and such records are excluded by the `IS NOT NULL` condition.

- **Date Range and Country Filter:** We filter the records for U.S. publications filed between 2008 and 2022 using the conditions:
  - `t."country_code" = 'US'`
  - `YEAR(TRY_TO_DATE(t."filing_date"::STRING, 'YYYYMMDD')) BETWEEN 2008 AND 2022`

- **Case-Insensitive Search for 'internet of things':** The condition `t."abstract_localized"[0]:"text"::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'` searches for the phrase in the abstract text, ensuring case-insensitive matching.

- **Grouping and Ordering:** We group the results by "Year" and "Month" to get the count of publications per month and order them chronologically.

**Note:** This corrected query accounts for empty or null values in the `abstract_localized` and `filing_date` fields, ensuring accurate results without errors due to missing data.

US-11250481-B2,Blockchain-based resource value evaluation methods and apparatus,"A method for dynamically evaluating a resource value is described. Data encoding one or more parameters related to the resource value is accessed, where the one or more parameters are monitored by a plurality of sensors that form an Internet of Things (IoT) and then released by the IoT of the plurality of sensors on a blockchain network. At least one parameter from the data is compared with a predetermined threshold value or a predetermined threshold range. In response to determining that the at least one parameter has exceeded the predetermined threshold value or the predetermined threshold range, a calculation of the resource value is triggered according to evaluation logic described by a smart contract released on the blockchain network in association with the one or more parameters being monitored, such that a consensus is reached on the blockchain network regarding the resource value that has been calculated."
US-9444515-B2,Short-range zigbee compatible receiver with near-threshold digital baseband,"An 8.1 nJ/bit 2.4 GHz receiver with integrated digital baseband supporting Q-QPSK DSSS modulation compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard is presented that targets short-range, Internet of Things applications (IoTs). The sensitivity of a wireless communication receiver in general trades with power consumption. This receiver exploits this tradeoff to achieve a total power consumption of 2.02 mW including ADCs and digital baseband processing, at a sensitivity of −52.5 dBm at 250 Kbps. The energy-efficiency of the radio frequency (RF) front-end alone is nearly two times better than the prior art. The receiver was fabricated in 65 nm CMOS with an area of 0.86 mm 2 ."
US-11194613-B2,Methods and devices for virtualizing a device management client in a multi-access server separate from a device,"An exemplary client virtualization system implemented by a multi-access server receives a service request from an Internet of Things (“IoT”) device that is separate from and communicatively coupled to the multi-access server. In response to the service request, the client virtualization system instantiates a virtualized device management client configured to serve the IoT device and that is hosted on the multi-access server. The client virtualization system receives a device management message that is for the IoT device and that is from a centralized device management server. The client virtualization system then delivers the device management message to the IoT device. Corresponding methods and systems are also disclosed."
US-2020244539-A1,Modularized control system to enable iot wireless network control and sensing of other devices,"Internet of Things (IoT) system and method of interfacing arbitrary non-network connected devices to wireless computer networks. The invention provides a configurable wireless communications module, in either fixed or removable formats, with wireless (e.g. WiFi) network connectivity. The invention uses at least one internal processor, which is configured to operate as a sandbox or virtual machine manner to isolate the code used to operate the arbitrary non-network connected device from the code used to operate the communications module."
US-2018102918-A1,Distributed multi-band wireless networking system,"Disclosed is a way to expand the range of Internet of Things devices in a home, office, or structure to the range of a local WiFi network. This is accomplished by generating a network bridge for the devices using machine-to-machine protocols to communicate using the WiFi network backhaul channel. Transmissions in machine-to-machine protocol are tunneled through WiFi communications and extracted by the closest access point. Access points include radios for both WiFi and machine-to-machine protocols."

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"country_code"**: Used to filter publications from the United States.  
  *Condition:* `WHERE "country_code" = 'US'`

- **"abstract_localized"**: Contains the abstract text in a VARIANT (JSON) format. We need to extract the "text" field to search for the phrase 'internet of things'.  
  *Condition:* `WHERE "abstract_text" ILIKE '%internet of things%'`

- **"filing_date"**: Used to determine the filing date of the publications. We can extract the year and month to group the counts per month from 2008 to 2022.  
  *Condition:* `WHERE "filing_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20221231`

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter by U.S. publications: `"country_code" = 'US'`
- Search for abstracts containing 'internet of things' in the "abstract_localized" field.
- Include publications filed between January 2008 and December 2022.
- Extract year and month from "filing_date" for aggregation.
- Handle VARIANT type in "abstract_localized" to access the "text" field.

US-11250481-B2,Blockchain-based resource value evaluation methods and apparatus,"A method for dynamically evaluating a resource value is described. Data encoding one or more parameters related to the resource value is accessed, where the one or more parameters are monitored by a plurality of sensors that form an Internet of Things (IoT) and then released by the IoT of the plurality of sensors on a blockchain network. At least one parameter from the data is compared with a predetermined threshold value or a predetermined threshold range. In response to determining that the at least one parameter has exceeded the predetermined threshold value or the predetermined threshold range, a calculation of the resource value is triggered according to evaluation logic described by a smart contract released on the blockchain network in association with the one or more parameters being monitored, such that a consensus is reached on the blockchain network regarding the resource value that has been calculated."

The sensitivity of a wireless communication receiver in general trades with power consumption. This receiver exploits this tradeoff to achieve a total power consumption of 2.02 mW including ADCs and digital baseband processing, at a sensitivity of −52.5 dBm at 250 Kbps. The energy-efficiency of the radio frequency (RF) front-end alone is nearly two times better than the prior art. The receiver was fabricated in 65 nm CMOS with an area of 0.86 mm 2 ."

In response to the service request, the client virtualization system instantiates a virtualized device management client configured to serve the IoT device and that is hosted on the multi-access server. The client virtualization system receives a device management message that is for the IoT device and that is from a centralized device management server. The client virtualization system then delivers the device management message to the IoT device. Corresponding methods and systems are also disclosed."

Task: How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase "internet of things") filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings, the data would be structured as follows:

```csv
Year,Month,Num_Publications
2008,1,num_publications:int
2008,2,num_publications:int
...
2022,12,num_publications:int
```

*Note: `Num_Publications` represents the count of publications filed in each respective month and year.*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 23:25:04 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase "internet of things") filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings, the data would be structured as follows:

```csv
Year,Month,Num_Publications
2008,1,num_publications:int
2008,2,num_publications:int
...
2022,12,num_publications:int
```

*Note: `Num_Publications` represents the count of publications filed in each respective month and year.* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
