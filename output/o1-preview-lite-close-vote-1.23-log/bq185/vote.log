After comparing the two SQL queries, I conclude that `1result.sql` is the correct one. This query properly adjusts the `pickup_datetime` to the 'America/New_York' timezone when filtering the date range using:

```sql
DATE(t.pickup_datetime, 'America/New_York') BETWEEN '2016-02-01' AND '2016-02-07'
```

This ensures that the trips are accurately captured within the specified dates in New York local time. The first query (`0result.sql`) does not account for the timezone difference and might include trips outside the intended date range.
