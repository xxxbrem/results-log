After comparing the SQL queries, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL for calculating the average page views per buyer and total page views among those buyers for each day in November 2020.

**Reasoning:**

- **Inclusion of All Buyers:** The goal is to compute the average page views per buyer, including buyers who may not have any page views recorded. It's important to include all buyers to get an accurate average.

- **Use of LEFT JOIN in `0result.sql`:** This query uses a `LEFT JOIN` between the `purchases` and `page_views` CTEs in the `buyer_page_views` CTE:

  ```sql
  buyer_page_views AS (
    SELECT
      p.event_date,
      p.user_pseudo_id,
      IFNULL(pv.page_view_count, 0) AS page_views
    FROM purchases p
    LEFT JOIN page_views pv
      ON p.event_date = pv.event_date AND p.user_pseudo_id = pv.user_pseudo_id
  )
  ```

  This ensures that all buyers from the `purchases` table are included in the result, even if they have zero page views. The `IFNULL` function assigns a value of zero to `page_views` for buyers with no page views.

- **Excluding Buyers with Zero Page Views in `1result.sql`:** In contrast, `1result.sql` uses an `INNER JOIN`:

  ```sql
  JOIN buyers b ON e.user_pseudo_id = b.user_pseudo_id AND e.event_date = b.event_date
  ```

  An `INNER JOIN` excludes buyers who have no page views because there is no matching record in the `events` table with `event_name = 'page_view'`. This results in an incorrect average since not all buyers are considered.

- **Methodology in `2result.sql`:** While `2result.sql` attempts to include all buyers using a `LEFT JOIN` and `COUNTIF`, it introduces complexity and potential inefficiency:

  ```sql
  COUNTIF(e.event_name = 'page_view') AS page_view_count
  ```

  This counts the number of events per buyer where `event_name` is `'page_view'`. However, it's more straightforward and efficient to filter for `'page_view'` events beforehand, as done in `0result.sql`.

**Conclusion:**

`0result.sql` correctly calculates the average page views per buyer and total page views among buyers for each day, including all buyers regardless of whether they had page views. It uses appropriate SQL constructs to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the results.
