## ST_CONTAINS

Returns TRUE if a GEOGRAPHY or GEOMETRY object is completely inside another object of the same type.
More strictly, object g1 contains object g2 if and only if no points of g2 lie in the exterior of g1, and at least one point of the interior of B lies in the interior of A. There are certain subtleties in this definition that are not immediately obvious. For more details on what “contains” means, see the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM).
Although ST_COVERS and ST_CONTAINS might seem similar, the two functions have subtle differences. For details on the differences between “covers” and “contains”, see the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM).

Note This function does not support using a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection as input values.

Tip You can use the search optimization service to improve the performance of queries that call this function.
For details, see Search Optimization Service.

See also:ST_WITHIN , ST_COVERS , ST_COVEREDBY


## Syntax

ST_CONTAINS( <geography_expression_1> , <geography_expression_2> )

ST_CONTAINS( <geometry_expression_1> , <geometry_expression_2> )


## Arguments


geography_expression_1A GEOGRAPHY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geography_expression_2A GEOGRAPHY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geometry_expression_1A GEOMETRY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geometry_expression_2A GEOMETRY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.


## Returns

BOOLEAN.

## Usage notes


For GEOMETRY objects, the function reports an error if the two input GEOMETRY objects have different SRIDs.


## Examples


## GEOGRAPHY examples

This shows a simple use of the ST_CONTAINS function:

create table geospatial_table_01 (g1 GEOGRAPHY, g2 GEOGRAPHY);
insert into geospatial_table_01 (g1, g2) values 
    ('POLYGON((0 0, 3 0, 3 3, 0 3, 0 0))', 'POLYGON((1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2, 1 1))');

Copy SELECT ST_CONTAINS(g1, g2) 
    FROM geospatial_table_01;
+---------------------+
| ST_CONTAINS(G1, G2) |
|---------------------|
| True                |
+---------------------+



## GEOMETRY examples

The query below shows several examples of using ST_CONTAINS. Note how ST_CONTAINS determines that:

The Polygon contains itself.
The Polygon does not contain the LineString that is on its border.
SELECT ST_CONTAINS(poly, poly_inside),
      ST_CONTAINS(poly, poly),
      ST_CONTAINS(poly, line_on_boundary),
      ST_CONTAINS(poly, line_inside)
  FROM (SELECT
    TO_GEOMETRY('POLYGON((-2 0, 0 2, 2 0, -2 0))') AS poly,
    TO_GEOMETRY('POLYGON((-1 0, 0 1, 1 0, -1 0))') AS poly_inside,
    TO_GEOMETRY('LINESTRING(-1 1, 0 2, 1 1)') AS line_on_boundary,
    TO_GEOMETRY('LINESTRING(-2 0, 0 0, 0 1)') AS line_inside);

+--------------------------------+------------------------+------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| ST_CONTAINS(POLY, POLY_INSIDE) | ST_CONTAINS(POLY,POLY) | ST_CONTAINS(POLY,LINE_ON_BOUNDARY) | ST_CONTAINS(POLY,LINE_INSIDE) |
|--------------------------------+------------------------+------------------------------------+-------------------------------|
| True                           | True                   | False                              | True                          |

Task: What were the top 5 busiest pickup times and locations (by ZIP code) for yellow taxi rides in New York City on January 1, 2015? Additionally, provide detailed metrics for each of these top 5 records, including the count of rides, hourly, daily, and weekly lagged counts, as well as 14-day and 21-day average and standard deviation of ride counts.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The table below shows the top 5 busiest pickup times and locations (by ZIP code) for yellow taxi rides in New York City on January 1, 2015, along with detailed metrics for each of these top 5 records.

```csv
pickup_time,zip_code,ride_count,hourly_lagged_counts,daily_lagged_counts,weekly_lagged_counts,14_day_avg_ride_counts,14_day_stddev_ride_counts,21_day_avg_ride_counts,21_day_stddev_ride_counts

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'geo_us_boundaries': ['adjacent_counties', 'adjacent_states', 'cbsa', 'cnecta', 'coastline', 'congress_district_115', 'congress_district_116', 'counties', 'csa', 'metropolitan_divisions', 'national_outline', 'nws_forecast_regions', 'railways', 'states', 'urban_areas', 'zip_codes'], 'new_york': ['311_service_requests', 'citibike_stations', 'citibike_trips', 'nypd_mv_collisions', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2015', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2016', 'tlc_green_trips_2013', 'tlc_green_trips_2014', 'tlc_green_trips_2015', 'tlc_green_trips_2016', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2009', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2010', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2011', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2012', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2013', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2014', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2015', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2016', 'tree_census_1995', 'tree_census_2005', 'tree_census_2015', 'tree_species']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
