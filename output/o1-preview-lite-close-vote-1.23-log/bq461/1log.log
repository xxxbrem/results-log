Task: Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To summarize the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, arranged chronologically with the requested details, here is the data in CSV format:

```csv
Period,Game_clock,Team_scores,Scoring_team,Description
period:int,game_clock:str,team_scores:str,scoring_team:str,description:str
...
```

This table includes the period of play, the game clock showing the time remaining, the cumulative team scores at each scoring event, the team that scored (either "Wildcats" or "Fighting Irish"), and a description of the scoring event..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 07:04:45 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To summarize the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, arranged chronologically with the requested details, here is the data in CSV format:

```csv
Period,Game_clock,Team_scores,Scoring_team,Description
period:int,game_clock:str,team_scores:str,scoring_team:str,description:str
...
```

This table includes the period of play, the game clock showing the time remaining, the cumulative team scores at each scoring event, the team that scored (either "Wildcats" or "Fighting Irish"), and a description of the scoring event. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-24 07:05:12 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To summarize the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, arranged chronologically with the requested details, here is the data in CSV format:

```csv
Period,Game_clock,Team_scores,Scoring_team,Description
period:int,game_clock:str,team_scores:str,scoring_team:str,description:str
...
```

This table includes the period of play, the game clock showing the time remaining, the cumulative team scores at each scoring event, the team that scored (either "Wildcats" or "Fighting Irish"), and a description of the scoring event. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
