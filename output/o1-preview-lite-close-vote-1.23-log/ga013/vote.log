After reviewing the SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have determined that **2result.sql** is the correct SQL that fulfills the task.

**Reasoning:**

- **2result.sql** accurately retrieves all the pages visited by user `1402138.5184246691` on January 2, 2021.
- It extracts the page names (`page_title`) and correctly classifies them as 'PDP' or 'PLP' where necessary.
- The SQL logic in **2result.sql** effectively uses URL segmentation to determine the page type based on the specified criteria.
- The results in `2result.csv` show that 'Google Metallic Notebook Set' is correctly classified as 'PDP', aligning with the task requirements.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plaintext
2result.sql
```
