After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **1result.sql** is the correct SQL query. This query accurately identifies the top-performing traffic source by concatenating `trafficSource.source` and `trafficSource.medium`, which ensures the uniqueness of the traffic source and medium combination. It then correctly calculates the maximum monthly, weekly, and daily product revenues generated by this top-performing traffic source during the first half of 2017.
