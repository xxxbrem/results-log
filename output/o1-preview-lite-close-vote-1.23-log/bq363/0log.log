The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'chicago_crime': ['crime'], 'chicago_taxi_trips': ['taxi_trips']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Table:**
- `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `trip_seconds`: Used to calculate the trip duration in seconds.
- `fare`: Used to determine the fare for each trip.
- `trip_total`: Total cost of the trip including fare, tips, tolls, and extras.
- `trip_start_timestamp`: Start time of the trip (rounded to the nearest 15 minutes).
- `trip_end_timestamp`: End time of the trip (rounded to the nearest 15 minutes).

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- `trip_seconds` IS NOT NULL and greater than zero.
- Rounded trip duration in minutes (`ROUND(trip_seconds / 60)`) between **1 and 50** inclusive.
- Exclude trips with NULL or zero fare values.
- Ensure `fare` is not NULL for accurate average fare calculations.

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **Retrieve Sample of Trip Durations and Fares:**
   ```sql
   SELECT trip_seconds, fare
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds IS NOT NULL AND fare IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get Distinct Rounded Trip Durations Between 1 and 50 Minutes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count Trips for Each Rounded Duration Minute Between 1 and 50 Minutes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
   GROUP BY duration_minutes
   ORDER BY duration_minutes
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve Sample of Fares and Total Trip Costs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT fare, trip_total
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE fare IS NOT NULL AND trip_total IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get Distinct Fare Amounts for Trips Between 1 and 50 Minutes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT fare
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
     AND fare IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List Trips with Fare and Rounded Duration in Minutes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT fare, trip_seconds, ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
     AND fare IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate Average Fare for Each Rounded Duration Minute:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes, AVG(fare) AS average_fare
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
     AND fare IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY duration_minutes
   ORDER BY duration_minutes
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find Number of Trips per Taxi Company for Trips Between 1 and 50 Minutes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT company, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
   GROUP BY company
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List Distinct Payment Types Used in Trips Between 1 and 50 Minutes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT payment_type
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve Sample Trips with Fare, Tips, Total Cost, and Duration:**
    ```sql
    SELECT fare, tips, trip_total, trip_seconds, ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS duration_minutes
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE trip_seconds > 0
      AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
      AND fare IS NOT NULL
      AND trip_total IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: For taxi trips with a duration rounded to the nearest minute, and between 1 and 50 minutes, if the trip durations are divided into 10 quantiles, what are the total number of trips and the average fare for each quantile?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Duration_Range_Minutes,Total_Trips,Average_Fare
quantile_range1:str,total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float
quantile_range2:str,total_trips2:int,average_fare2:float
quantile_range3:str,total_trips3:int,average_fare3:float
quantile_range4:str,total_trips4:int,average_fare4:float
quantile_range5:str,total_trips5:int,average_fare5:float
quantile_range6:str,total_trips6:int,average_fare6:float
quantile_range7:str,total_trips7:int,average_fare7:float
quantile_range8:str,total_trips8:int,average_fare8:float
quantile_range9:str,total_trips9:int,average_fare9:float
quantile_range10:str,total_trips10:int,average_fare10:float
```

In the table above, **Duration_Range_Minutes** represents the range of trip durations for each of the 10 quantiles between 1 and 50 minutes (rounded to the nearest minute). **Total_Trips** is the total number of trips within each quantile, and **Average_Fare** is the average fare for trips in each quantile..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'chicago_crime': ['crime'], 'chicago_taxi_trips': ['taxi_trips']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 05:28:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For taxi trips with a duration rounded to the nearest minute, and between 1 and 50 minutes, if the trip durations are divided into 10 quantiles, what are the total number of trips and the average fare for each quantile?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Duration_Range_Minutes,Total_Trips,Average_Fare
quantile_range1:str,total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float
quantile_range2:str,total_trips2:int,average_fare2:float

quantile_range9:str,total_trips9:int,average_fare9:float

```

In the table above, **Duration_Range_Minutes** represents the range of trip durations for each of the 10 quantiles between 1 and 50 minutes (rounded to the nearest minute). **Total_Trips** is the total number of trips within each quantile, and **Average_Fare** is the average fare for trips in each quantile. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
