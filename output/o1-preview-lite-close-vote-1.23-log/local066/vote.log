After reviewing the three provided SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have compared them based on correctness, efficiency, and readability to determine which one best fulfills the task requirements.

**Task Summary:**

- **Objective:** Summarize the total quantity of each ingredient used in the pizzas we delivered.
- **Output:** The name and quantity for each ingredient.

### **Comparison of the SQL Queries:**

#### **1. 0result.sql**

- **Approach:**
  - Uses common table expressions (CTEs) to organize the query into logical steps.
  - Utilizes `json_each` to split comma-separated lists by treating them as JSON arrays.
  - Handles delivered orders, default toppings, exclusions, and extras separately before combining them in the final step.
  - **CTEs Used:**
    - `Delivered_Orders`: Filters out canceled orders.
    - `Orders`: Retrieves customer orders associated with delivered orders.
    - `Default_Toppings`: Splits base toppings for each pizza.
    - `Exclusions`: Splits exclusions per order.
    - `Extras`: Splits extras per order.
    - `Final_Toppings`: Adjusts base toppings by applying exclusions and adding extras.
- **Advantages:**
  - Clear and structured approach.
  - Efficiently handles the splitting of lists using `json_each`.
  - Readable and maintainable due to well-named CTEs.
- **Results:**
  ```
  Ingredient_Name,Total_Quantity
  Bacon,12
  Cheese,10
  Mushrooms,10
  Beef,9
  Chicken,9
  Pepperoni,9
  Salami,9
  BBQ Sauce,7
  Onions,3
  Peppers,3
  Tomato Sauce,3
  Tomatoes,3
  ```

#### **2. 1result.sql**

- **Approach:**
  - Uses recursive common table expressions to parse comma-separated strings.
  - Splits base toppings, exclusions, and extras using recursive functions.
  - **CTEs Used:**
    - `delivered_orders`: Retrieves delivered orders with base toppings.
    - `split_base_toppings`: Recursively splits base toppings for each order.
    - `split_exclusions`: Recursively splits exclusions per order.
    - `split_extras`: Recursively splits extras per order.
    - `final_toppings`: Adjusts base toppings by applying exclusions and adding extras.
- **Advantages:**
  - Does not rely on JSON functions; uses string manipulation suitable for environments without JSON support.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Recursive CTEs can be less efficient for large datasets.
  - More complex and harder to read due to recursive logic.
- **Results:**
  ```
  Ingredient_Name,Total_Quantity
  Bacon,12
  Mushrooms,10
  Cheese,10
  Salami,9
  Pepperoni,9
  Chicken,9
  Beef,9
  BBQ Sauce,7
  Tomatoes,3
  Tomato Sauce,3
  Peppers,3
  Onions,3
  ```

#### **3. 2result.sql**

- **Approach:**
  - Similar to `0result.sql`, uses CTEs and `json_each` to handle splitting.
  - Processes delivered orders, base toppings, exclusions, and extras.
  - **CTEs Used:**
    - `delivered_orders`: Retrieves delivered orders.
    - `base_toppings_per_order`: Splits base toppings using `json_each`.
    - `exclusions_per_order`: Splits exclusions.
    - `extras_per_order`: Splits extras.
    - `adjusted_base_toppings_per_order`: Applies exclusions to base toppings.
    - `adjusted_toppings_per_order`: Combines adjusted base toppings and extras.
    - `toppings_usage`: Aggregates the total quantity per topping.
- **Advantages:**
  - Efficient splitting using `json_each`.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Slightly less organized compared to `0result.sql`.
  - The final output is ordered by ingredient name rather than quantity.
- **Results:**
  ```
  Ingredient_Name,Total_Quantity
  BBQ Sauce,7
  Bacon,12
  Beef,9
  Cheese,10
  Chicken,9
  Mushrooms,10
  Onions,3
  Pepperoni,9
  Peppers,3
  Salami,9
  Tomato Sauce,3
  Tomatoes,3
  ```

### **Conclusion and Recommendation:**

All three SQL queries correctly compute the total quantity of each ingredient used in the delivered pizzas. They account for base toppings, exclusions, and extras as per the customer orders.

However, **`0result.sql`** stands out for the following reasons:

- **Clarity and Readability:**
  - The query is well-structured with appropriately named CTEs, making it easy to follow the data transformations.
- **Efficiency:**
  - Uses `json_each` for splitting lists, which is efficient in SQLite.
- **Output Formatting:**
  - The final results are ordered by total quantity in descending order and then by ingredient name, which aligns with typical reporting needs.

### **Recommended SQL:**

```plaintext
0result.sql
```

*Note:* The inclusion of `plaintext` ensures compliance with the specified output format.
