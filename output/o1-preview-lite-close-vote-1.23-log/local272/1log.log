Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `orderlines.order_id`: To select order 423.
- `orderlines.product_id`: To identify products in order 423.
- `orderlines.qty`: Quantity required for each product in order 423.
- `inventory.product_id`: To find inventory entries matching the products.
- `inventory.qty`: Available quantity at each inventory location.
- `inventory.location_id`: To locate where the inventory is stored.
- `inventory.purchase_id`: To obtain purchase dates for inventory prioritization.
- `locations.id`: To join with `inventory.location_id`.
- `locations.warehouse`: To filter inventory in warehouse 1.
- `locations.aisle`: To get aisle information.
- `locations.position`: To get position information.
- `purchases.id`: To join with `inventory.purchase_id`.
- `purchases.purchased`: To prioritize locations with earlier dates.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `orderlines.order_id = 423`: To focus on the specific order.
- `locations.warehouse = 1`: To ensure inventory is from warehouse 1.
- Prioritize inventory by earlier purchase dates (`purchases.purchased ASC`).
- Prioritize inventory with smaller quantities (`inventory.qty ASC`).

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Find products in order 423:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
   FROM "orderlines"
   WHERE "order_id" = 423
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get required quantities for products in order 423:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", "qty" AS "required_qty"
   FROM "orderlines"
   WHERE "order_id" = 423
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List inventory entries for products in order 423:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "inventory"
   WHERE "product_id" IN (
       SELECT "product_id"
       FROM "orderlines"
       WHERE "order_id" = 423
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get inventory with location details for products in order 423:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "inventory".*, "locations"."warehouse", "locations"."aisle", "locations"."position"
   FROM "inventory"
   JOIN "locations" ON "inventory"."location_id" = "locations"."id"
   WHERE "inventory"."product_id" IN (
       SELECT "product_id"
       FROM "orderlines"
       WHERE "order_id" = 423
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Filter inventory to warehouse 1 for products in order 423:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "inventory".*, "locations"."aisle", "locations"."position"
   FROM "inventory"
   JOIN "locations" ON "inventory"."location_id" = "locations"."id"
   WHERE "inventory"."product_id" IN (
       SELECT "product_id"
       FROM "orderlines"
       WHERE "order_id" = 423
   )
   AND "locations"."warehouse" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Include purchase dates in inventory entries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "inventory".*, "locations"."aisle", "locations"."position", "purchases"."purchased"
   FROM "inventory"
   JOIN "locations" ON "inventory"."location_id" = "locations"."id"
   JOIN "purchases" ON "inventory"."purchase_id" = "purchases"."id"
   WHERE "inventory"."product_id" IN (
       SELECT "product_id"
       FROM "orderlines"
       WHERE "order_id" = 423
   )
   AND "locations"."warehouse" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Prioritize inventory by earliest purchase dates and smaller quantities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "inventory".*, "locations"."aisle", "locations"."position", "purchases"."purchased"
   FROM "inventory"
   JOIN "locations" ON "inventory"."location_id" = "locations"."id"
   JOIN "purchases" ON "inventory"."purchase_id" = "purchases"."id"
   WHERE "inventory"."product_id" IN (
       SELECT "product_id"
       FROM "orderlines"
       WHERE "order_id" = 423
   )
   AND "locations"."warehouse" = 1
   ORDER BY "purchases"."purchased" ASC, "inventory"."qty" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate total available quantity per product in warehouse 1:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "inventory"."product_id", SUM("inventory"."qty") AS "total_available_qty"
   FROM "inventory"
   JOIN "locations" ON "inventory"."location_id" = "locations"."id"
   WHERE "locations"."warehouse" = 1
   AND "inventory"."product_id" IN (
       SELECT "product_id"
       FROM "orderlines"
       WHERE "order_id" = 423
   )
   GROUP BY "inventory"."product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Compare required and available quantities for products in order 423:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "o"."product_id", "o"."qty" AS "required_qty", SUM("i"."qty") AS "available_qty"
   FROM "orderlines" AS "o"
   LEFT JOIN "inventory" AS "i" ON "o"."product_id" = "i"."product_id"
   LEFT JOIN "locations" AS "l" ON "i"."location_id" = "l"."id"
   WHERE "o"."order_id" = 423
   AND "l"."warehouse" = 1
   GROUP BY "o"."product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Select the optimal location to pick the highest quantity without exceeding available inventory:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
        "o"."product_id",
        "o"."qty" AS "required_qty",
        "i"."qty" AS "available_qty",
        "l"."aisle",
        "l"."position",
        "p"."purchased"
    FROM "orderlines" AS "o"
    JOIN "inventory" AS "i" ON "o"."product_id" = "i"."product_id"
    JOIN "locations" AS "l" ON "i"."location_id" = "l"."id"
    JOIN "purchases" AS "p" ON "i"."purchase_id" = "p"."id"
    WHERE "o"."order_id" = 423
    AND "l"."warehouse" = 1
    ORDER BY "p"."purchased" ASC, "i"."qty" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Note:** These queries help in understanding the data and relations among the tables relevant to the task. They progressively build toward identifying the product ID, aisle, position, and quantity to pick for order 423, adhering to the specified conditions.Query:

Task: Which product ID, aisle, and position should be selected to pick the highest quantity for order 423, ensuring the picked quantity does not exceed the available inventory in warehouse 1, and calculate the quantity to be picked while prioritizing locations with earlier dates and smaller quantities?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
product_id,aisle,position,quantity_to_pick
product_id:int,aisle:str,position:int,quantity:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```
To fulfill order 423, we have selected the product ID, aisle, and position that allow us to pick the highest possible quantity without exceeding the available inventory in warehouse 1. We prioritized locations with earlier purchase dates and smaller quantities to ensure efficient stock rotation and optimal inventory management..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
