I recommend using `2result.sql` as the correct answer. This SQL query accurately calculates the bank concentration per zip code by weighting the number of bank locations with the overlap area between zip codes and block groups. It ensures a precise representation of the concentration by considering both the number of bank branches and the spatial overlap, using functions like `SAFE_DIVIDE` to handle any potential division errors.
