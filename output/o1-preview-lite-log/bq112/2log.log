Begin Exploring Related Columns
First, consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task:

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.bls_qcew.*` (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages)
   - **`area_fips`**: FIPS code of the county.  
     *Usage*: To filter data for Allegheny County.
   - **`avg_wkly_wage_10_total_all_industries`**: Average weekly wage for all industries.  
     *Usage*: To obtain wage data for Allegheny County in 1998 and 2017.

2. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.geo_us_boundaries.counties`
   - **`state_fips_code`**: FIPS code for the state.  
     *Usage*: To identify Pennsylvania (`state_fips_code` = '42').
   - **`county_fips_code`**: FIPS code for the county.  
     *Usage*: To identify Allegheny County (`county_fips_code` = '003').
   - **`county_name`**: Name of the county.  
     *Usage*: To filter for Allegheny County and retrieve the FIPS code.

3. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.bls.cpi_u` (Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers)
   - **`year`**: Year of the CPI data.  
     *Usage*: To select the years 1998 and 2017.
   - **`value`**: CPI value.  
     *Usage*: To calculate inflation between 1998 and 2017.
   - **`item_name`**: Name of the CPI item category.  
     *Usage*: To filter for "All items".
   - **`area_name`**: Name of the geographic area.  
     *Usage*: To filter for "U.S. city average" or "Pittsburgh, PA" if available.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Allegheny County Identification:**
  - `state_fips_code` = '42' (Pennsylvania)
  - `county_fips_code` = '003' (Allegheny County)
  - `area_fips` = '42003' (Combined state and county FIPS code for wage data)
- **Time Frame:**
  - `year` = 1998 or `year` = 2017
- **CPI Data Filters:**
  - `item_name` = 'All items'
  - `area_name` = 'U.S. city average' (National average CPI)

Task: Did the increase on average annual wages for all industries in Allegheny County, Pittsburgh keep pace with inflation of all consumer items between 1998 and 2017? Tell me their growth rates respectively (2 decimals).

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Wage_growth_rate,Inflation_rate
86.32,50.36
```

Between 1998 and 2017, the average annual wages for all industries in Allegheny County, Pittsburgh increased by **86.32%**, while the inflation rate of all consumer items was **50.36%**. Therefore, the wage growth outpaced inflation during this period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Tell me their growth rates respectively (2 decimals)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
