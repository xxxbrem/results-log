After comparing both SQL queries, I have determined that `2result.sql` is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Efficient Data Filtering:** `2result.sql` uses explicit `JOIN` operations to filter data based on `season_id` by joining the `player_match` table with the `match` table. This is generally more efficient and considered better practice than using subqueries with `IN` clauses, as seen in `0result.sql`.

- **Clear Table Relationships:** By joining the tables directly, `2result.sql` makes the relationships between the tables explicit, improving readability and maintainability of the code.

- **Accurate Results:** Both queries produce the same results, but the approach in `2result.sql` is more robust due to the direct joins, which can help prevent potential issues that might arise from subqueries, such as duplicated or missing data.
