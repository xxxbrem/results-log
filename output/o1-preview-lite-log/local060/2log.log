Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant tables and columns:**

1. **sales**:
   - `"prod_id"`: Identifies products sold.
   - `"cust_id"`: Links sales to customers.
   - `"time_id"`: Date of sale; links to the `times` table.
   - `"promo_id"`: Identifies if a promotion was applied.
   - `"quantity_sold"`: Quantity of the product sold.
   - `"amount_sold"`: Monetary amount of the sale.

2. **times**:
   - `"time_id"`: Date of sale.
   - `"calendar_year"`: Year of the sale (e.g., 2019, 2020).
   - `"calendar_quarter_number"`: Quarter of the year (e.g., 4 for Q4).
   - `"calendar_month_number"`: Month of the year.
   - Other date-related columns to filter sales within specific periods.

3. **customers**:
   - `"cust_id"`: Customer identifier.
   - `"country_id"`: Links to the `countries` table to identify the customer's country.

4. **countries**:
   - `"country_id"`: Country identifier.
   - `"country_name"`: Name of the country (e.g., 'United States').

5. **products**:
   - `"prod_id"`: Product identifier.
   - `"prod_name"`: Name of the product.

6. **promotions**:
   - `"promo_id"`: Promotion identifier.
   - `"promo_begin_date"` and `"promo_end_date"`: Dates when the promotion is active.
   - Used to determine if a sale was made under a promotion.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Filter sales to Q4 of 2019 and 2020**:
  - `"calendar_year"` = 2019 or 2020.
  - `"calendar_quarter_number"` = 4.

- **Filter sales to the United States**:
  - `"country_name"` = 'United States'.

- **Exclude products with promotions in Q4 2019 or Q4 2020**:
  - Identify products that had no promotions during these periods.

- **Calculate total sales per product**:
  - Sum `"quantity_sold"` or `"amount_sold"` grouped by `"prod_id"`.

- **Determine top 20% products by sales**:
  - Rank products based on total sales and select the top 20%.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct product IDs from the sales table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "prod_id"
   FROM "sales"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct customer IDs and their country IDs from the customers table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "cust_id", "country_id"
   FROM "customers"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List distinct country names from the countries table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_name"
   FROM "countries"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve sales data for Q4 2019:**
   ```sql
   SELECT s.*
   FROM "sales" AS s
   JOIN "times" AS t ON s."time_id" = t."time_id"
   WHERE t."calendar_year" = 2019
     AND t."calendar_quarter_number" = 4
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve sales data for Q4 2020:**
   ```sql
   SELECT s.*
   FROM "sales" AS s
   JOIN "times" AS t ON s."time_id" = t."time_id"
   WHERE t."calendar_year" = 2020
     AND t."calendar_quarter_number" = 4
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Identify promotions active during Q4 2019:**
   ```sql

Task: What is the change in each product’s share of total sales in the top 20% of products (by sales), between Q4 of 2019 and 2020, in the US? Include only products with no promotions in Q4 2019 or Q4 2020, and provide results in decreasing order of the change in sales share.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_ID,Product_Name,Q4_2019_Sales_Share,Q4_2020_Sales_Share,Change_in_Sales_Share
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,share2019:float,share2020:float,change_in_share:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,share2019:float,share2020:float,change_in_share:float
...
(Attention: results are provided in decreasing order of the change in sales share)
```

This table lists the products in the top 20% of products by sales (excluding products with any promotions in Q4 2019 or Q4 2020) in the US. It shows each product's share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, as well as the change in sales share between these periods. The results are sorted in decreasing order of the change in sales share. The `Change_in_Sales_Share` is calculated as `Q4_2020_Sales_Share` minus `Q4_2019_Sales_Share`..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
