- `"player"."player_name"`: Name of the player.
- `"player"."batting_hand"`: Indicates if the player bats left-handed or right-handed.
- `"player"."bowling_skill"`: Type of bowling skill (e.g., Legbreak, Offbreak); used to describe the player's bowling style.
- `"player_match"."player_id"`: Identifies the player in match participation records.
- `"player_match"."match_id"`: Identifies matches played by the player.
- `"player_match"."role"`: Role of the player in each match (e.g., Batsman, Bowler); used to determine the most frequent role.
- `"ball_by_ball"."striker"`: Player ID of the batsman on strike; used to calculate total runs and balls faced.
- `"ball_by_ball"."bowler"`: Player ID of the bowler; used to calculate wickets taken and runs conceded.
- `"ball_by_ball"."match_id"`, `"ball_by_ball"."over_id"`, `"ball_by_ball"."ball_id"`, `"ball_by_ball"."innings_no"`: Identifiers to link deliveries across tables.
- `"batsman_scored"."runs_scored"`: Runs scored on each delivery; used to calculate total runs and highest scores.
- `"wicket_taken"."player_out"`: Player ID of the dismissed batsman; used to calculate total dismissals.
- `"wicket_taken"."kind_out"`: Method of dismissal; can be used for detailed analysis of dismissals.

Task: For each player, list their ID, name, most frequent role across all matches, batting hand, bowling skill, total runs scored, total matches played, total dismissals, batting average, highest score in a single match, number of matches where their score exceeded 30, 50, and 100, total balls faced in their career, strike rate, total wickets taken, economy rate, and their best performance in a single match (most wickets taken, in the format "wickets taken-runs given"). Ignore the extra runs data.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
player_id,player_name,most_frequent_role,batting_hand,bowling_skill,total_runs_scored,total_matches_played,total_dismissals,batting_average,highest_score_in_single_match,number_of_matches_scored_over_30,number_of_matches_scored_over_50,number_of_matches_scored_over_100,total_balls_faced,strike_rate,total_wickets_taken,economy_rate,best_bowling_performance

```

In this table, each row represents a player with their statistical performance across all matches. The columns include identifiers, personal attributes, batting and bowling statistics, and career highlights, formatted according to the specified data types..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
