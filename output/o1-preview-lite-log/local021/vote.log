After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query to answer your question.

**Reason:**

Both SQL queries aim to calculate the **average total score of strikers who have scored more than 50 runs in at least one match**. They follow similar logic:

1. **Compute total runs per striker per match.**
2. **Identify strikers who have scored more than 50 runs in at least one match.**
3. **Calculate the average runs per match for these strikers.**
4. **Compute the overall average of these averages.**

However, there are some differences between the two queries:

- **Precision of the Result:**
  - **`0result.sql`** uses the `ROUND` function to round the final average to four decimal places.
  - **`2result.sql`** provides the precise average without rounding, ensuring maximum accuracy.

- **Use of DISTINCT:**
  - **`2result.sql`** includes `SELECT DISTINCT "striker"` in the subquery to ensure that only unique strikers are considered. This prevents any potential duplication of entries that could skew the results.

- **Syntax and Readability:**
  - **`2result.sql`** utilizes quoted identifiers (e.g., `"bb"."striker"`), which is standard in SQL dialects like PostgreSQL. This improves clarity and ensures that column names are interpreted correctly, especially if they could be mistaken for SQL keywords.

Given these factors, **`2result.sql`** is more precise and methodologically sound. It ensures that the calculation is accurate and that only the correct set of strikers is included in the computation.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:
