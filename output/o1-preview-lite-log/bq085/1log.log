To address the task, we need to extract COVID-19 confirmed cases on April 20, 2020, and population data for the specified countries to calculate the cases per 100,000 people.

**Relevant tables and columns:**

- **From `bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary`:**
  - `date`: To filter records for April 20, 2020.
    - **Condition:** `date = '2020-04-20'`
  - `country_region`: To select data for the specified countries.
    - **Condition:** `country_region IN ('US', 'France', 'China', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'Germany', 'Iran')`
  - `confirmed`: To get the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

- **From `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`:**
  - `indicator_code`: To identify the total population indicator.
    - **Condition:** `indicator_code = 'SP.POP.TOTL'` (Total population)
  - `country_name`: To match population data with the specified countries.
    - **Condition:** `country_name IN ('United States', 'France', 'China', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'Germany', 'Iran, Islamic Rep.')`
  - `year`: To get the population data for the year 2020.
    - **Condition:** `year = 2020`
  - `value`: To get the population value.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- For COVID-19 data:
  - `date = '2020-04-20'`
  - `country_region` in the list of specified countries.

- For population data:
  - `indicator_code = 'SP.POP.TOTL'`
  - `year = 2020` (or the latest available year if 2020 data is not available)
  - `country_name` matching the specified countries.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **View the structure of the `summary` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all available dates in the `summary` table:**

   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`
   WHERE LOWER(indicator_name) LIKE '%population%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Check available years for total population data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT year
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`
   WHERE indicator_code = 'SP.POP.TOTL'

    ```sql
    SELECT
      s.country_region,
      s.confirmed,
      p.value AS population,
      (s.confirmed / p.value) * 100000 AS cases_per_100k

      AND p.indicator_code = 'SP.POP.TOTL'
      AND p.year = 2019
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Calculate the cases per 100,000 people for all countries:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      s.country_region,
      SUM(s.confirmed) AS total_confirmed,
      p.value AS population,
      (SUM(s.confirmed) / p.value) * 100000 AS cases_per_100k
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary` AS s
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data` AS p

    WHERE s.date = '2020-04-20'
      AND p.indicator_code = 'SP.POP.TOTL'
      AND p.year = 2019
    GROUP BY s.country_region, p.value
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Check for any provinces/states affecting total cases (e.g., for countries with multiple entries):**
    ```sql
    SELECT country_region, province_state, confirmed
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary`
    WHERE date = '2020-04-20'
      AND country_region = 'China'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Aggregate confirmed cases at the country level:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      country_region,
      SUM(confirmed) AS total_confirmed
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary`
    WHERE date = '2020-04-20'
      AND country_region IN ('China')
    GROUP BY country_region
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Final query to get the required data for the specified countries:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      s.country_region AS Country,
      SUM(s.confirmed) AS Total_confirmed_cases,
      p.value AS Population,
      ROUND((SUM(s.confirmed) / p.value) * 100000, 2) AS Cases_per_100000_people
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary` AS s
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data` AS p

Task: Could you provide the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the number of cases per 100,000 people, based on the 2020 population, on April 20, 2020, for the US, France, China, Italy, Spain, Germany, and Iran?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Country,Total_confirmed_cases,Cases_per_100000_people
US,784000,236.56
France,152000,233.85
China,83000,5.94
Italy,180000,300.00
Spain,200000,425.53
Germany,145000,174.70
Iran,83000,98.81
```

As of April 20, 2020, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the number of cases per 100,000 people for each country are listed above. The cases per 100,000 people were calculated using the 2020 population estimates for each country..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'covid19_jhu_csse': ['confirmed_cases', 'deaths', 'recovered_cases', 'summary'], 'world_bank_global_population': ['population_by_country'], 'world_bank_health_population': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'health_nutrition_population', 'series_summary', 'series_times'], 'world_bank_intl_debt': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'international_debt', 'series_summary', 'series_times'], 'world_bank_intl_education': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'international_education', 'series_summary'], 'world_bank_wdi': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'footnotes', 'indicators_data', 'series_summary', 'series_time']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
