After comparing both SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script for the task.

```plaintext
0result.sql
```

**Reason:**

1. **Age Filter with Unit Check:**
   - **`0result.sql`** correctly extracts the numerical age and ensures that the age unit is in years ('Y'):
     ```sql
     AND TRY_TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING("PatientAge", 1, 3)) >= 60
     AND SUBSTRING("PatientAge", 4, 1) = 'Y'
     ```
     - This ensures that only patients aged **60 years or older** are included.
   - In contrast, **`1result.sql`** does not check the age unit:
     ```sql
     AND TO_NUMBER(REGEXP_SUBSTR(dp."PatientAge", '^[0-9]+')) > 60
     ```
     - Without verifying that the unit is 'Y', there's a risk of including patients whose ages are over 60 in months or days (e.g., '061M' or '062D'), which is not desired.

2. **Body Part Examined Condition:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses a case-insensitive partial match to filter the body part examined:
     ```sql
     AND "BodyPartExamined" ILIKE '%mediastinum%'
     ```
     - This approach captures all records where **'mediastinum'** appears anywhere in the **`BodyPartExamined`** field, regardless of case or additional text (e.g., 'Mediastinum', 'mediastinum region', 'upper mediastinum').
   - **`1result.sql`** uses an exact match that is case-sensitive:
     ```sql
     AND dp."BodyPartExamined" = 'MEDIASTINUM'
     ```
     - This may exclude relevant records that do not match exactly or have variations in case or additional descriptors.

3. **Study Date Inclusion:**
   - **`0result.sql`** includes studies conducted **on** September 1, 2014:
     ```sql
     AND "StudyDate" >= '2014-09-01'
     ```
     - This aligns with the task requirement of including studies **after September 1, 2014**, including that date.
   - **`1result.sql`** excludes studies on that date:
     ```sql
     AND dp."StudyDate" > '2014-09-01'
     ```
     - This may omit relevant studies conducted exactly on September 1, 2014.

4. **Comprehensive Data Retrieval:**
   - Both scripts retrieve identification and descriptive data, including storage details and size metrics. However, **`0result.sql`** provides a more accurate and inclusive dataset based on the task requirements.

5. **Ordering of Results:**
   - **`0result.sql`** includes an **`ORDER BY`** clause to sort the results by series size in descending order:
     ```sql
     ORDER BY "Series_Size_MB" DESC NULLS LAST
     ```
     - This adds value by prioritizing series with larger sizes, which might be of interest for storage and data management considerations.

**Conclusion:**

- **`0result.sql`** better fulfills the task by accurately filtering patients over 60 years old (in years), inclusively matching the body part examined, correctly handling the study date, and providing a useful ordering of the results.
- Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script to use for this task.
