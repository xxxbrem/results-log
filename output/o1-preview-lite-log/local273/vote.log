Based on the comparison of the three SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL that fulfills the task requirements.

---

### **Reasoning:**

**Task Requirements:**

- **Compute the average pick percentage for each product**, considering:
  - **Quantities picked from inventory locations ordered by earliest purchase date and smallest quantity**.
  - **Picked quantities matching the overlapping range between the order quantity and the available inventory**.

**Comparison of SQL Queries:**

#### **1. `0result.sql`:**

- **Approach:**
  - Calculates the average of the ratio `(picked_qty / ordered_qty)` for each picking line.
  - Does **not** consider the ordering of inventory by purchase date or quantity.
  - Does **not** ensure that the picked quantity matches the overlapping range between order quantity and available inventory.

- **Result:**

  ```
  Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
  Der Helle Kumpel,0.23076923076923078
  Hoppy Crude Oil,0.375
  ```

- **Issue:**
  - This method averages the pick percentages at the line level, which can be misleading.
  - Fails to consider inventory constraints and the specific ordering of inventory consumption.
  - Does not meet the task requirement of considering inventory ordered by purchase date and quantity.

#### **2. `1result.sql`:**

- **Approach:**
  - Calculates:
    - Total ordered quantity per product.
    - Total picked quantity per product.
    - Total inventory quantity per product.
  - Determines the overlapping quantity as the minimum of total ordered and total inventory quantities.
  - Computes the average pick percentage as `(MIN(total_picked_qty, overlapping_qty) / total_ordered_qty) * 100`.
  - **Does not** consider the consumption of inventory ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity.

- **Result:**

  ```
  Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
  Hoppy Crude Oil,41.6667
  Monks and Nuns,0.0
  Hercule Trippel,0.0
  Der Helle Kumpel,86.6667
  Hazy Pink Cloud,0.0
  Pale Rider Rides,0.0
  ```

- **Issue:**
  - Overlapping quantity is computed at the total level, not considering how inventory is consumed.
  - Ignores the ordering of inventory by purchase date and quantity.
  - May overestimate the pick percentage if older inventory isn't sufficient.
  - Partially addresses the overlapping range but lacks the inventory consumption order.

#### **3. `2result.sql`:**

- **Approach:**
  - Simulates the picking process by:
    - Calculating cumulative inventory quantities per product, ordered by earliest purchase date and smallest quantity.
    - Determining the picked quantity from each inventory batch without exceeding the total ordered quantity.
    - Summing the picked quantities to find the total picked quantity per product.
  - Computes the average pick percentage as `(total_picked_qty / total_ordered_qty) * 100`.

- **Result:**

  ```
  Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
  Hoppy Crude Oil,41.6667
  Monks and Nuns,100.0
  Hercule Trippel,100.0
  Der Helle Kumpel,100.0
  Hazy Pink Cloud,100.0
  Pale Rider Rides,100.0
  ```

- **Why It's Correct:**
  - **Considers Inventory Order:**
    - Inventory is consumed starting from the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity.
  - **Ensures Overlapping Range:**
    - Picking stops once the cumulative picked quantity reaches the total ordered quantity.
  - **Accurate Pick Percentage:**
    - Reflects the real pick percentage based on available inventory in the specified order.
  - **Meets All Task Requirements:**
    - Precisely models inventory consumption and calculates the average pick percentage accordingly.

---

### **Conclusion:**

**`2result.sql`** correctly implements the required logic by:

- **Ordering inventory by earliest purchase date and smallest quantity.**
- **Calculating the picked quantities without exceeding the total ordered quantities.**
- **Ensuring that the picked quantities align with the overlapping range between orders and available inventory.**
