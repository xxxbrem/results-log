2025-01-25 02:37:21 - root - INFO - It seems that the error is due to an incorrect table name in your SQL query. Based on the schema information provided, the tables are structured as:

- **Database**: `NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA`
- **Schema**: `NETHERLANDS`
- **Tables**: `V_ADMINISTRATIVE`, `V_BUILDING`, `V_ROAD`

However, in your query, the table is referenced as:

```sql
NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA.NETHERLANDS.NETHERLANDS.V_ROAD
```

The extra `NETHERLANDS` in the table path is likely causing the "Object does not exist" error. The correct table reference should omit the extra `NETHERLANDS`. Therefore, the correct table path is:

```sql
NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA.NETHERLANDS.V_ROAD
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "CLASS"
FROM NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA.NETHERLANDS.V_ROAD
LIMIT 100;
```

    GROUP BY "QUADKEY"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Issue Identification:** The error occurred because the table reference included an extra `NETHERLANDS`, which does not exist in the database path.
  
- **Solution:** Remove the extra `NETHERLANDS` from the table path to correctly reference the table as `NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA.NETHERLANDS.V_ROAD`.

- **Verification:** You can verify the correct table names using the schema information provided:
  
  ```plaintext
  {'NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA': {'NETHERLANDS': ['V_ADMINISTRATIVE', 'V_BUILDING', 'V_ROAD']}}
  ```

2025-01-25 02:38:07 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering a syntax error with your SQL query. The error message:

```
SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA'.
```

indicates that the SQL parser doesn't recognize `NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA` at the beginning of the statement. This suggests an issue with the way the table is referenced in your query.

Here are steps to resolve the issue:

**1. Correct the Table Reference:**

There's an extra `NETHERLANDS` in your table reference. Based on the schema information:

- **Database**: `NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA`
- **Schema**: `NETHERLANDS`
- **Tables**: `V_ADMINISTRATIVE`, `V_BUILDING`, `V_ROAD`

The correct table path should be:

```
NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA.NETHERLANDS.V_ROAD
```

**2. Enclose Identifiers in Double Quotes:**

In SQL, especially with case-sensitive identifiers or names containing special characters, it's important to enclose database, schema, and table names in double quotes.

**3. Revised Query:**

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "CLASS"
FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **"NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"**, **"NETHERLANDS"**, and **"V_ROAD"** are enclosed in double quotes to ensure they're interpreted correctly.
- The extra `NETHERLANDS` in the table path has been removed.
- The `SELECT DISTINCT "CLASS"` portion remains the same.
- `LIMIT 100` to limit the output to 100 rows.

**4. Verify Database and Schema Settings:**

If you have set `NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA` as your default database and `NETHERLANDS` as your default schema in your session, you can simplify the query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "CLASS"
FROM "V_ROAD"
LIMIT 100;
```

To set the default database and schema, you can use:

```sql
USE DATABASE "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA";
USE SCHEMA "NETHERLANDS";
```

**5. Additional Tips:**

- **Check for Case Sensitivity:** SQL databases can be case-sensitive. Enclosing identifiers in double quotes preserves the case.
- **Avoid Syntax Errors:** Ensure that all SQL keywords (like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) are correctly spelled and placed.
- **Remove Extra Dots:** Make sure there are no extra periods (`.`) or typos in your table references.

**6. Full Corrected Query:**

```sql
-- Set the database and schema if not already set
USE DATABASE "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA";
USE SCHEMA "NETHERLANDS";

-- Run the query
SELECT DISTINCT "CLASS"
FROM "V_ROAD"
LIMIT 100;
```

**7. Test Other Queries:**

You can apply the same corrections to the other queries:

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT "LENGTH_M", "CLASS", "SUBCLASS", "QUADKEY"
FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
WHERE "QUADKEY" IN ('12020210', '12020211')
LIMIT 100;
```

**8. Summary:**

- The syntax error is due to the SQL parser not recognizing the table reference at the start of the statement.
- Enclose database, schema, and table names in double quotes to handle case sensitivity and special characters.
- Ensure the table path correctly reflects the database structure without extra components.

**Please try running the corrected query and see if it resolves the error. Let me know if you need further assistance or if you encounter additional issues.**

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table**: `NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA.NETHERLANDS.NETHERLANDS.V_ROAD`
  
  - `"CLASS"`: Used to identify the class of each road segment; will be used for grouping.
  - `"SUBCLASS"`: Used to identify the subclass of each road segment; will be used for grouping.
  - `"LENGTH_M"`: Contains the length of each road segment in meters; will be summed to calculate total lengths.
  - `"QUADKEY"`: Used to filter the data for the specific areas corresponding to Amsterdam and Rotterdam ('12020210' and '12020211').

**Conditions to be Used:**

- Filter records where `"QUADKEY"` is either '12020210' (Amsterdam) or '12020211' (Rotterdam).
- Cast `"LENGTH_M"` from `TEXT` to `FLOAT` for numerical calculations.
- Group data by `"CLASS"` and `"SUBCLASS"` to calculate total lengths per category.

Task: Determine the total length of roads for each class and subclass in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, based on specific QUADKEY segments '12020210' and '12020211'? Show the class, subclass, and total road lengths for both cities

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
City,Class,Subclass,Total_Road_Length_meters
Amsterdam,class1:str,subclass1:str,length1:float
Amsterdam,class2:str,subclass2:str,length2:float
...
Rotterdam,class1:str,subclass1:str,length3:float
Rotterdam,class2:str,subclass2:str,length4:float
...
```

The table above shows the total length of roads for each class and subclass in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, based on the specific QUADKEY segments '12020210' and '12020211'. The lengths are given in meters..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA': {'NETHERLANDS': ['V_ADMINISTRATIVE', 'V_BUILDING', 'V_ROAD']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
