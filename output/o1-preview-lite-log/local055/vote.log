After comparing both SQL queries, **`2result.sql`** is the correct choice.

**Reason:**

- **Structured Approach:** `2result.sql` creates an initial Common Table Expression (CTE) called `ArtistsSales`, which calculates the total quantity sold per artist once. This CTE is then reused to find both the best-selling and least-selling artists. This approach is more efficient and avoids redundant calculations.
  
- **Clear Formatting:** The final result uses the `ROUND` function to format the difference to four decimal places, which is precise and clear.

- **Clarity and Readability:** By organizing the query into logical CTEs with descriptive names, `2result.sql` enhances readability and maintainability.
