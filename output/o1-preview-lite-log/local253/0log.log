The table structure information is (table names): 
['hardware_dim_customer', 'hardware_fact_pre_invoice_deductions', 'web_sales_reps', 'hardware_dim_product', 'web_orders', 'StaffHours', 'university_enrollment', 'university_faculty', 'university_student', 'university_offering', 'web_accounts', 'web_events', 'SalaryDataset', 'web_region', 'hardware_fact_gross_price', 'hardware_fact_manufacturing_cost', 'university_course', 'hardware_fact_sales_monthly']
Begin Exploring Related Columns
First, let's consider which columns and conditions in the **SalaryDataset** table are relevant to the task:

**Relevant Columns:**

- **CompanyName**: Used to identify and group data by company.
- **Location**: To filter data for the cities Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad.
- **Salary**: Contains salary information; we'll need to understand its format and extract numeric values for calculations.
- **SalariesReported**: Indicates the number of salaries reported; may be useful for data reliability.
- **JobTitle**: Could be used to filter or group data by job titles if needed.

**Potential Conditions:**

- Filter data where `Location` is Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, or Hyderabad.
- Extract numeric values from the `Salary` column for calculations.
- Compute average salaries per company in each location.
- Compute national average salaries per company across all locations.

Now, here are at least 10 SQLite SQL queries, from simple to complex, to explore the data:

1. **List all unique locations in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Location" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all unique company names in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "CompanyName" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **View sample salary entries to understand the format of the "Salary" column:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Salary" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find the number of records for each location to see data distribution:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Location", COUNT(*) AS "Count" FROM "SalaryDataset" GROUP BY "Location" ORDER BY "Count" DESC LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve records for Mumbai to inspect data specific to that city:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Location" LIKE '%Mumbai%' LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve records for Pune:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Location" LIKE '%Pune%' LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Retrieve records for New Delhi:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Location" LIKE '%New Delhi%' LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Retrieve records for Hyderabad:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Location" LIKE '%Hyderabad%' LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **View distinct salary entries to understand possible salary formats:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Salary" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count the number of salaries reported per company to assess data volume:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "CompanyName", COUNT(*) AS "SalariesCount" FROM "SalaryDataset" GROUP BY "CompanyName" ORDER BY "SalariesCount" DESC LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **List the job titles in the dataset to understand the roles included:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "JobTitle" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Check for entries where "Salary" is not null to ensure data completeness:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS "NonNullSalaries" FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Salary" IS NOT NULL;
    ```

13. **Attempt to extract numeric salary values (this may need to be refined based on actual data):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Salary", REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE("Salary", '₹', ''), '$', ''), ',', ''), 'K', '') AS "SalaryNumeric" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Retrieve salaries and locations for companies in the target cities:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "CompanyName", "Location", "Salary" FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Location" IN ('Mumbai', 'Pune', 'New Delhi', 'Hyderabad') LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find the top 5 companies by number of salaries reported in the target cities:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "CompanyName", COUNT(*) AS "SalariesCount" FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Location" IN ('Mumbai', 'Pune', 'New Delhi', 'Hyderabad') GROUP BY "CompanyName" ORDER BY "SalariesCount" DESC LIMIT 5;
    ```

These queries will help us understand the data in the **SalaryDataset** table, explore the salary formats, identify the companies and locations present, and prepare the data for calculating the average salaries required for the report.Query:

Task: For the salary dataset, create a detailed SQL report that compares the top 5 companies by average salary in Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad to the national average salary. The report should include the following columns: Location, Company Name, Average Salary in State, and Average Salary in Country.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Location,Company Name,Average Salary in State,Average Salary in Country
Mumbai,company1:str,avg_salary_state1:float,avg_salary_country1:float
Pune,company2:str,avg_salary_state2:float,avg_salary_country2:float
...
```

**Explanation:**

This report compares the top 5 companies by average salary in the cities of Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad to the national average salary. It includes the following columns:

- **Location**: The city where the company is located.
- **Company Name**: The name of the company.
- **Average Salary in State**: The average salary offered by the company in that city.
- **Average Salary in Country**: The national average salary for the company across all locations..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
