1result.sql
```

I chose `1result.sql` because it accurately calculates overtakes of each type during the first five laps by:

- **Accounting for multiple positions gained**: It expands position gains greater than one to count each overtake individually.
- **Identifying overtaken drivers**: It maps each overtake to the specific driver who was overtaken.
- **Classifying overtakes properly**: It distinguishes between on-track overtakes, overtakes due to pit stops, and overtakes due to retirements.
