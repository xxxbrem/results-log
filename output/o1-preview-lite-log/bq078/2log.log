2025-01-28 03:00:12 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to mismatched quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause. Specifically, you're starting a string literal with a single quote `'` but ending it with a backtick `` ` ``, which leads to an unclosed string literal error.

**Your query with the error:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
LIMIT 100;
```

In the condition:

```sql
`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
```

You start the string `'EFO_0000676` with a single quote `'` but end it with a backtick `` ` ``, causing the syntax error.

**To fix the error**, ensure that you use matching single quotes `'...'` for string literals and backticks `` `...` `` for identifiers (like column names). Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
LIMIT 100;
```

Now, both string literals `'impc'` and `'EFO_0000676'` are properly enclosed with single quotes.

**Remember:** Always ensure that string literals are enclosed in matching single quotes `'...'` and identifiers (like column names) are enclosed in backticks `` `...` `` if necessary.

By correcting the quotation marks, your queries should run without syntax errors.
2025-01-28 03:00:32 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-28 03:00:32 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering in your SQL query is due to a mismatched quotation mark in your `WHERE` clause. Specifically, you're starting a string literal with a single quote `'` but ending it with a backtick `` ` ``, which leads to an unclosed string literal error.

**Your query with the error:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
LIMIT 100;
```

In the condition:

```sql
`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
```

You start the string `'EFO_0000676` with a single quote `'` but end it with a backtick `` ` ``, causing the syntax error.

**To fix the error**, ensure that you use matching single quotes `'...'` for string literals and backticks `` `...` `` for identifiers (like column names). Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
LIMIT 100;
```

Now, both string literals `'impc'` and `'EFO_0000676'` are properly enclosed with single quotes.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Backticks `` `...` ``** are used to enclose identifiers such as table names and column names (e.g., `datasourceId`, `diseaseId`).
- **Single quotes `'...'`** are used to enclose string literals (e.g., `'impc'`, `'EFO_0000676'`).
- Ensure that each opening quote has a matching closing quote of the same type.

**Additional Checks:**

Please review your query for any other mismatched quotation marks. Mistyping quotes is a common cause of syntax errors in SQL queries. Here's a checklist:

- **Identifiers (Column and Table Names):** Use backticks if needed.
  - Example: `` `column_name` ``
- **String Literals:** Use single quotes.
  - Example: `'string_value'`

**Corrected Query Ready to Run:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

By correcting the quotation marks, your query should run without syntax errors. If you encounter any further issues, please ensure all quotes are properly matched throughout your query.
2025-01-28 03:00:58 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-28 03:00:58 - root - INFO - It appears that you're still encountering the same syntax error in your SQL query. Let's carefully examine your query to identify and fix the issue.

**Your SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
LIMIT 100;
```

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:49]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:49]
```

**Analysis:**

- The error message indicates an **"Unclosed string literal at [3:49]"**, pointing to line 3, character 49 in your query.
- The issue is with the string literal `'EFO_0000676\`` in your `WHERE` clause. The string starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a backtick `` ` `` instead of a closing single quote `'`.

**Steps to Fix the Error:**

1. **Ensure Matching Quotes for String Literals:**

   - String literals in SQL should be enclosed in matching single quotes.
   - Replace the ending backtick with a single quote.

2. **Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `targetId`, `score`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
   WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Double-Check the Entire Query:**

   - Ensure that all string literals are enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
   - Ensure that all identifiers (column names, table names) are correctly enclosed with backticks `` `...` `` if necessary.
   - Watch out for any unintentional characters or formatting issues that might have been introduced during copying and pasting.

**Additional Suggestions:**

- **Inspect for Hidden Characters:**

  - Sometimes, copying and pasting can introduce invisible or special characters (like smart quotes) that SQL doesn't recognize.
  - Manually retype the quotation marks to ensure they are standard single quotes.

- **Verify Quotation Marks:**

  - In your query, make sure that:

    - `'impc'` is enclosed with single quotes.
    - `'EFO_0000676'` is enclosed with single quotes.

- **Example of Common Errors:**

  - **Incorrect:** `‘impc’` or `“impc”` (using curly quotes)
  - **Correct:** `'impc'` (using straight single quotes)

**Final Corrected Query Ready to Run:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Next Steps:**

- **Copy and Paste Carefully:**

  - Copy the corrected query above and paste it into your SQL editor.
  - Ensure that the quotes appear as straight single quotes in your editor.

- **Test the Query:**

  - Run the query to see if it executes without errors.
  - If the error persists, try typing the query manually to eliminate any hidden characters.

**If the Issue Persists:**

- **Check for Encoding Issues:**

  - Ensure your SQL editor or interface isn't introducing any special characters due to text encoding settings.

- **Alternative Approach:**

  - Replace the single quotes with double quotes for string literals (though standard SQL uses single quotes).
  - Example:

    ```sql
    SELECT `targetId`, `score`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
    WHERE `datasourceId` = "impc" AND `diseaseId` = "EFO_0000676"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    - Note: Some SQL dialects allow double quotes for string literals, but BigQuery standard SQL requires single quotes.

- **Consult Documentation:**

  - Review [BigQuery Standard SQL documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/lexical#string_literals) to ensure compliance with syntax rules.

**Summary:**

- The syntax error is caused by mismatched or incorrect quotation marks in your SQL query.
- Ensure all string literals are enclosed in matching single quotes `'...'`.
- Double-check for any hidden or special characters, especially if copying and pasting from another source.
- Retype the query manually if necessary.

2025-01-28 03:01:25 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks. Let's carefully examine your query to identify and fix the issue.

---

**Your SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
LIMIT 100;
```

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:52]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:52]
```

---

**Analysis:**

The error message indicates an **"Unclosed string literal at [3:52]"**, pointing to line 3, character 52 in your query. The issue lies in the `WHERE` clause, specifically with the condition:

```sql
`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
```

In this condition:

- The string literal for `'EFO_0000676` is started with a **single quote `'`** but is ended with a **backtick `` ` ``** instead of the matching single quote.
- This mismatch causes SQL to interpret the string as unclosed, leading to the syntax error.

---

**Solution:**

To fix the error, ensure that all string literals are enclosed in **matching single quotes `'...'`**. Replace the ending backtick with a single quote.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **String Literals:** In SQL, string values should be enclosed in single quotes `'...'`. For example, `'impc'` and `'EFO_0000676'`.
- **Identifiers:** Column names or table names can be enclosed in backticks if necessary, like `` `diseaseId` ``.

In your original query, the string literal `'EFO_0000676` was not properly closed due to the mismatched backtick. By replacing the backtick with a single quote, the string literal is now correctly enclosed:

```sql
'diseaseId' = 'EFO_0000676'
```

---

**Additional Advice:**

- **Check for Hidden Characters:** Sometimes, copying and pasting code can introduce hidden characters or formatting issues. Retype the quotation marks to ensure they're standard single quotes.
- **Consistent Quotation Marks:** Always use matching quotation marks for string literals and identifiers.
  - **String Literals:** `'...'`
  - **Identifiers (if needed):** `` `...` ``
- **Avoid Smart Quotes:** Ensure your text editor isn't automatically converting straight quotes `'` into smart quotes `’` or backticks `` ` ``.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. **Copy the Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
   WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Run the Query:**

   - Paste the corrected query into your SQL editor.
   - Execute the query to retrieve the results.

3. **Verify the Results:**

   - Ensure that the query runs without errors.
   - Confirm that the results match your expectations.

---

**Summary:**

- The syntax error was caused by an unclosed string literal due to mismatched quotation marks.
- By ensuring all string literals are enclosed in matching single quotes, the error should be resolved.
- Always double-check your queries for proper quotation mark usage to prevent similar issues in the future.

```

### **Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:49]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:49]
```

---

### **Analysis of the Error:**

- The error message indicates an **"Unclosed string literal at [3:49]"**, pointing to line 3, character 49 of your query.
- The issue lies in the `WHERE` clause, specifically with the condition:

  ```sql
  `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
  ```

- In this condition, the string literal starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a backtick `` ` ``, causing an unclosed string literal.

---

### **How to Fix the Error:**

1. **Ensure Matching Quotation Marks:**

   - **Identifiers (column names, table names):** Use backticks `` `...` `` if necessary.
   - **String Literals:** Use single quotes `'...'` for string values.

2. **Correct the Quotation Marks in Your Query:**

   - Replace the ending backtick `` ` `` with a single quote `'` in `'EFO_0000676` to close the string literal properly.

### **Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Additional Suggestions:**

- **Double-Check All Quotation Marks:**

  - Make sure that all string literals are enclosed with **matching single quotes `'...'`**.
  - Ensure that all identifiers are correctly enclosed with backticks `` `...` `` if needed.

- **Watch for Hidden Characters:**

  - Copying and pasting text can sometimes introduce invisible or special characters.
  - Try retyping the quotation marks manually to ensure they are the correct characters.

- **Ensure Consistency:**

  - Both conditions in your `WHERE` clause should have properly matched quotes:

    ```sql
    `datasourceId` = 'impc'
    ```

    ```sql
    `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
    ```

- **Avoid Using Smart Quotes:**

  - Some text editors automatically convert straight quotes (`'`) into smart quotes (`‘’`), which can cause syntax errors.
  - Ensure you are using standard single quotes.

---

### **Example of Correct Quotation Usage:**

**Identifiers:**

- Use backticks if your identifier contains special characters or matches a reserved keyword.

  ```sql
  `column_name`
  ```

**String Literals:**

- Use single quotes for string values.

  ```sql
  'string_value'
  ```

---

### **Confirming the Corrected Query Works:**

Please copy and paste the corrected query into your SQL editor and run it:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
LIMIT 100;
```

This should execute without any syntax errors.

---

### **If the Error Persists:**

- **Manually Retype the Query:**

  - Instead of copying and pasting, try typing out the query to avoid any hidden formatting issues.

- **Check Your Keyboard Layout:**

  - Ensure that the key you're pressing for the single quote `'` is producing the correct character.
  - On some keyboards, similar-looking characters may produce different ASCII codes.

- **Test with a Simple Query:**

  - Run a minimal query to test string literals:

    ```sql
    SELECT 'EFO_0000676' AS test_string;
    ```

  - If this query fails, there may be an issue with how your environment handles quotation marks.

- **Use Alternative Quotation:**

  - In BigQuery Standard SQL, you can also use triple single quotes for string literals, although it's less common:

    ```sql
    WHERE `diseaseId` = '''EFO_0000676'''
    ```

  - However, sticking to single quotes is recommended.

---

### **Final Thoughts:**

- **Mismatched quotation marks are a common source of syntax errors in SQL queries.**
- **Always ensure that each opening quote has a matching closing quote of the same type.**
- **Be mindful of the difference between backticks `` ` `` and single quotes `'`.**

---

### **Summary:**

- The error is caused by an unclosed string literal due to a mismatched quotation mark.
- By correcting the quotation marks in your query, it should execute successfully.
- If you continue to encounter issues, consider retyping the query manually and double-checking all quotation marks.

- In this condition, the string literal starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a backtick `` ` ``, causing an unclosed string literal.

---

### **Solution:**

#### **1. Correct the Mismatched Quotation Mark:**

- Replace the ending backtick `` ` `` in `'EFO_0000676` with a single quote `'` to properly close the string literal.

#### **Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

#### **2. Remove Backticks if They May Be Causing Issues:**

Backticks are used to enclose identifiers (like column or table names) that contain special characters or match reserved keywords. In your query, the column names and table names do not require backticks.

**Query Without Backticks:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT targetId
FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect
WHERE datasourceId = 'impc' AND diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Why This Might Help:**

- **Potential Issue with Backticks:** It's possible that the backticks are being misinterpreted or that some hidden characters are causing the issue.
- **Simplifying the Query:** Removing unnecessary backticks can sometimes help prevent syntax errors.

---

### **Steps to Fix and Test the Query:**

1. **Copy the Corrected Query Without Backticks:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT targetId
   FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect
   WHERE datasourceId = 'impc' AND diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Manually Retype Quotation Marks:**

   - Ensure that the single quotes around `'impc'` and `'EFO_0000676'` are standard single quotes.
   - Avoid any smart quotes or special characters that might have been introduced.

3. **Run the Query:**

   - Paste the corrected query into your SQL editor or interface.
   - Execute the query to see if it runs without errors.

---

### **Additional Checks:**

- **Hidden Characters:**
  - If copying and pasting, hidden characters might be causing issues.
  - Manually retype the entire query to ensure there are no invisible or special characters.

- **Text Encoding:**
  - Ensure your editor uses UTF-8 encoding to prevent encoding-related issues.

- **SQL Interface Quirks:**
  - Some SQL interfaces might handle backticks or quotation marks differently.
  - Adjusting the query accordingly can help.

---

### **Explanation of Quotation Marks:**

- **Single Quotes `'...'`:**
  - Used to enclose string literals.
  - Example: `'impc'`, `'EFO_0000676'`

- **Backticks `` `...` ``:**
  - Used to enclose identifiers that have special characters or are reserved keywords.
  - Not necessary for simple identifiers like `targetId`, `datasourceId`, or `diseaseId`.

---

### **Testing the String Literal:**

- To ensure that string literals are being handled correctly, you can run a simple test:

  ```sql
  SELECT 'EFO_0000676' AS test_string;
  ```

- If this runs without error, string literals are being processed correctly.

---

### **Summary:**

- The error is caused by an unclosed string literal due to a mismatched quotation mark.
- Ensure all string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`.
- Remove backticks from identifiers if they are not necessary.
- Manually retype the query to eliminate any hidden characters.

---

### **Final Corrected Query to Use:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT targetId
FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect
WHERE datasourceId = 'impc' AND diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
LIMIT 100;
```

2025-01-28 03:02:42 - root - INFO - It looks like there's a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks in your `WHERE` clauses. Specifically, you're starting string literals with a single quote `'` but ending them with a backtick `` ` ``, which causes an unclosed string literal error.

**Problem Areas in Your Query:**

1. **Main Query `WHERE` Clause:**

   ```sql
   WHERE `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676` AND `targetId` IN (
   ```

   - The string literal `'EFO_0000676` is started with a single quote `'` but ends with a backtick `` ` ``, causing the error.

2. **Subquery `WHERE` Clause:**

   ```sql
   WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
   ```

   - Similarly, `'EFO_0000676` is not properly closed with a single quote.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected query with matching single quotes for string literals:

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect`
WHERE `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676' AND `targetId` IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
  WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
)
ORDER BY `score` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **String Literals:** Enclosed `'EFO_0000676'` with matching single quotes.
  - In both the main query and the subquery, replace the ending backtick with a single quote.
- **Identifiers:** Backticks `` `...` `` are correctly used for column names and table names.

**What to Do Next:**

1. **Copy the Corrected Query:**

   Replace your current query with the corrected version provided above.

2. **Run the Query:**

   Execute the corrected query in your SQL environment.

3. **Verify the Results:**

   - You should now get the desired results without any syntax errors.
   - The query will retrieve `targetId` and `score` for targets associated with the disease `'EFO_0000676'` from the data source `'IMPC'`, ordered by the highest overall score.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Quotation Marks Usage:**
  - **Single Quotes `'...'`:** Used for string literals.
  - **Backticks `` `...` ``:** Used for identifiers (e.g., column names, table names), especially if they contain special characters or reserved keywords.
- **Consistency:**
  - Ensure every opening quotation mark has a matching closing quotation mark of the same type.

2025-01-28 03:03:14 - root - INFO - It seems you're still encountering syntax errors in your SQL query. The error message indicates:

```
400 Syntax error: Unexpected keyword WHERE at [1:1]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unexpected keyword WHERE at [1:1]
```

This suggests there's a fundamental issue with the query, possibly due to mismatched quotation marks or hidden characters that are causing the SQL parser to misinterpret your query.

### **Problem in Your Query:**

**Your Query:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect`
   WHERE `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676` AND `targetId` IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
     WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
   )
   ORDER BY `score` DESC
   LIMIT 100;
```

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Mismatched Quotation Marks:**

   - In your `WHERE` clauses, the string literals start with a single quote `'` but end with a backtick `` ` ``.
   - Example: `'EFO_0000676` should be `'EFO_0000676'`.

2. **Unclosed String Literals:**

   - Unmatched quotation marks cause the SQL parser to expect the string to continue, leading to unexpected syntax errors.

### **Corrected Query:**

To fix the errors, ensure that all string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`. You can also simplify the query by removing unnecessary backticks from identifiers.

**Option 1: Use Correct Quotation Marks**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect`
WHERE `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676' AND `targetId` IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
  WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
)
ORDER BY `score` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Option 2: Remove Unnecessary Backticks**

Since your column and table names don't contain special characters or reserved keywords, you can remove the backticks for clarity.

```sql
SELECT targetId, score
FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect
WHERE diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676' AND targetId IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT targetId
  FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect
  WHERE datasourceId = 'impc' AND diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
)
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Instructions:**

1. **Copy the Corrected Query:**

   - Choose one of the corrected queries above.

2. **Ensure Proper Quotation Marks:**

   - Verify that all string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`.
   - Avoid using backticks `` ` `` for string literals.

3. **Avoid Hidden Characters:**

   - Manually retype the quotation marks if necessary to avoid hidden or special characters.

4. **Run the Query:**

   - Paste the corrected query into your SQL editor and execute it.

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Check Your Text Editor:**

  - Ensure that your text editor isn't converting straight quotes `'` into smart quotes `‘’`, which can cause syntax errors.

- **Test a Simple Query:**

  - To ensure your environment handles string literals correctly, run a simple query:

    ```sql
    SELECT 'Test String' AS test;
    ```

  - If this query fails, there may be an issue with your SQL environment or how it handles quotation marks.

- **Consistency in Quotation Marks:**

  - **Identifiers (column/table names):** Use backticks only if necessary.
  - **String Literals:** Always use single quotes.

### **Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks in SQL:**

  - **Backticks `` `...` ``**: Used to enclose identifiers that might conflict with SQL keywords or contain special characters.
  - **Single Quotes `'...'`**: Used to enclose string literals.

- **Common Mistake:**

  - Using backticks to close a string literal that was opened with a single quote. This leads to unclosed string literals and syntax errors.

### **Example of Correct Usage:**

**Identifiers:**

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**String Literals:**

```sql
WHERE diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
```

### **Final Corrected Query Ready to Run:**

```sql
SELECT targetId, score
FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect
WHERE diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676' AND targetId IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT targetId
  FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect
  WHERE datasourceId = 'impc' AND diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
)
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Try Running the Corrected Query:**

   - Use the query provided above.
   - Ensure all quotation marks are properly matched.

2. **If Error Persists:**

   - **Manually Retype the Query:**
     - Do not copy and paste. Instead, type out the entire query to avoid any hidden characters.
   - **Check for Hidden Characters:**
     - Sometimes, copying from certain sources introduces invisible characters.

3. **Consider Your Environment:**

   - Ensure that your SQL editor or interface supports BigQuery Standard SQL.
   - Check if there are any default settings that might alter your query upon pasting.

### **Troubleshooting Tips:**

- **Test Environment with Simple Strings:**

  ```sql
  SELECT 'impc' AS test_source, 'EFO_0000676' AS test_disease;
  ```

- **Ensure No Unintended Formatting:**

  - When copying queries from formatted documents, hidden formatting characters can be included.

### **Summary:**

- The error is caused by mismatched quotation marks in your query.
- Ensure that string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes.
- Remove unnecessary backticks from identifiers if they are causing confusion.
- Manually retype the query if necessary to eliminate hidden characters.

```

Let's examine your query to identify and fix the issue.

---

### **Your SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect`
   WHERE `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676` AND `targetId` IN (

     WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
   )
   ORDER BY `score` DESC
   LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Issue Identified:**

- In your `WHERE` clauses, you're starting string literals with a single quote `'` but ending them with a backtick `` ` ``.
- This causes an **unclosed string literal** error because SQL expects the string to end with the same type of quote it started with.

---

### **Corrections Needed:**

#### **1. Main Query `WHERE` Clause:**

- **Incorrect:**

  ```sql
  WHERE `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676` AND ...
  ```

- **Corrected:**

  ```sql
  WHERE `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676' AND ...
  ```

#### **2. Subquery `WHERE` Clause:**

- **Incorrect:**

  ```sql
  WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
  ```

- **Corrected:**

  ```sql
  WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
  ```

---

### **Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect`
   WHERE `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676' AND `targetId` IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
     WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
   )
   ORDER BY `score` DESC
   LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation:**

- **String Literals:** In SQL, string literals must be enclosed in matching single quotes `'...'`.

  - **Example:** `'EFO_0000676'`, `'impc'`

- **Identifiers:** Use backticks `` `...` `` for identifiers (like column names) if necessary.

  - **Example:** `` `diseaseId` ``, `` `targetId` ``

- **Mismatched Quotes:** Starting a string with a single quote `'` and ending it with a backtick `` ` `` causes an unclosed string literal error.

---

### **Additional Suggestions:**

#### **Remove Unnecessary Backticks for Clarity:**

Since your column and table names do not contain special characters or reserved keywords, you can omit the backticks to simplify your query:

```sql
SELECT targetId, score
FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect
WHERE diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676' AND targetId IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT targetId
  FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect
  WHERE datasourceId = 'impc' AND diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
)
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Steps to Resolve the Error:**

1. **Copy the Corrected Query:**

   - Use one of the corrected queries provided above.

2. **Ensure Proper Quotation Marks:**

   - Verify that all string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`.

3. **Avoid Smart Quotes:**

   - Make sure your text editor isn't automatically converting straight quotes `'` into smart quotes `‘’`.

4. **Run the Query:**

   - Execute the corrected query in your SQL environment.

---

### **Why This Should Fix the Error:**

- **Unclosed String Literal:** The SQL parser encounters a string that starts with a `'` but doesn't find a matching closing `'`, leading to a syntax error.
- **Matching Quotes:** By ensuring all string literals have matching opening and closing quotes, the SQL parser can correctly interpret your query.

---

### **Final Notes:**

- **Double-Check All Quotations:**

  - Ensure every string literal in your query is properly enclosed.

- **Consistency is Key:**

  - Use single quotes for string literals and backticks for identifiers when necessary.

- **Avoid Hidden Characters:**

  - Sometimes copying code from certain sources can introduce hidden characters. Retype quotation marks if needed.

```

---

### **Explanation:**

- **String Literals:** Ensure that all string values are enclosed in matching single quotes `'...'`.

  - **Correct Examples:**
    - `'EFO_0000676'`
    - `'impc'`
  - **Incorrect Examples:**
    - `'EFO_0000676` (starts with `'`, ends with `` ` ``)
    - `'impc` (if it ends with `` ` ``)

- **Identifiers:** Backticks `` `...` `` are used for identifiers like column names or table names, especially if they contain special characters or match SQL keywords.

  - **Example:** `` `approvedSymbol` ``, `` `score` ``

---

### **Steps to Resolve the Error:**

1. **Review Your Query for Mismatched Quotes:**

   - Replace any ending backticks in string literals with single quotes.
   - Ensure every starting single quote `'` has a matching ending single quote `'`.

2. **Correct the `WHERE` Clauses:**

   - **Main `WHERE` Clause:**

     ```sql
     WHERE a.`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676' AND a.`targetId` IN (
     ```

   - **Subquery `WHERE` Clause:**

     ```sql
     WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
     ```

3. **Verify the Entire Query:**

   - Check for any other mismatched quotes throughout the query.
   - Ensure that all identifiers and string literals are properly enclosed.

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Mixing Quote Types:**

  - Do not mix single quotes `'` and backticks `` ` `` when enclosing the same string.

- **Consistency:**

  - Be consistent with the use of quotation marks throughout your query to prevent syntax errors.

- **Check for Hidden Characters:**

  - Sometimes, copying and pasting code can introduce invisible or special characters. Retype the quotation marks if necessary.

---

### **Try Running the Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT t.`approvedSymbol`, a.`score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.targets` t
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect` a
  ON t.`id` = a.`targetId`
WHERE a.`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676' AND a.`targetId` IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
  WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
)
ORDER BY a.`score` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

This query should execute without the syntax error and retrieve the approved symbols of target genes associated with the disease `'EFO_0000676'` from the data source `'IMPC'`, ordered by the highest overall score.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Issue:** Mismatched quotation marks in string literals caused an unclosed string literal error.

- **Mismatched Quotes:** Starting a string literal with a single quote `'` and ending it with a backtick `` ` `` leads to unclosed string literals and syntax errors.
- **Consistent Quotation:** Ensure that every opening quotation mark has a corresponding closing quotation mark of the same type.

---

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Copy and Use the Corrected Query:**

   - Replace your query with the corrected version provided above.

2. **Verify Quotation Marks:**

   - Make sure all string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`.
   - Ensure that identifiers are correctly enclosed with backticks `` `...` `` if needed.

3. **Run the Query:**

   - Execute the corrected query in your SQL environment.

4. **Check the Results:**

   - The query should now run without syntax errors and return the approved symbols of target genes associated with the disease `'EFO_0000676'` from the data source `'IMPC'`, ordered by the highest overall score.

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Mixing Quotation Marks:**

  - Do not mix single quotes and backticks when enclosing the same string.
  - Always use single quotes for string literals and backticks for identifiers.

- **Be Cautious with Copy-Paste:**

  - When copying code, ensure that quotation marks are not altered by text editors or formatting.
  - Sometimes, hidden characters or smart quotes can cause syntax errors.

- **Test Simple Queries:**

  - If issues persist, test with simple queries to ensure your SQL environment handles string literals correctly.

    ```sql
    SELECT 'EFO_0000676' AS disease_id, 'impc' AS datasource_id;
    ```

---

### **Summary:**

- The syntax error was caused by mismatched quotation marks in your string literals.
- By correcting the quotation marks to use matching single quotes, the SQL parser can properly interpret your query.
- The corrected query should execute successfully and provide the desired results.

2025-01-28 03:04:54 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering a syntax error due to mismatched quotation marks in your SQL query. The error message indicates:

```
400 Syntax error: Unexpected keyword WHERE at [1:1]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unexpected keyword WHERE at [1:1]
```

This suggests that the SQL parser is getting confused, likely due to an unclosed string literal caused by mismatched quotation marks. Let's examine your query and correct it.

---

### **Issue in Your Query:**

In your `WHERE` clauses, you're starting string literals with a single quote `'` but ending them with a backtick `` ` ``, causing an unclosed string literal error.

#### **Problematic Lines:**

1. **Main `WHERE` Clause:**

   ```sql
   WHERE a.`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676` AND a.`targetId` IN (
   ```

   - **Issue:** The string literal starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a backtick `` ` ``. This leads to an unclosed string literal.

2. **Subquery `WHERE` Clause:**

   ```sql
   WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
   ```

   - **Issue:** Similar mismatched quotes in the string literal `'EFO_0000676` and potentially `'impc'` if there's a mismatched quote (though it looks correct here).

---

### **Solution:**

Ensure that all string literals are enclosed with **matching single quotes** `'...`'`.

#### **Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT t.`approvedSymbol`, a.`score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.targets` t
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect` a
  ON t.`id` = a.`targetId`
WHERE a.`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676' AND a.`targetId` IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
  WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
)
ORDER BY a.`score` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation:**

- **String Literals:**

  - **Before Correction:**

    - `'EFO_0000676\``: Starts with `'` but ends with `` ` ``, causing an unclosed string literal.
  
  - **After Correction:**

    - `'EFO_0000676'`: Enclosed properly with matching single quotes.

- **Identifiers:**

  - Backticks `` `...` `` are correctly used for column names and table names.

- **Consistent Quotation Marks:**

  - Ensure that every opening single quote `'` has a matching closing single quote `'`.
  - Avoid mixing single quotes and backticks for the same string.

---

### **Additional Recommendations:**

#### **1. Remove Unnecessary Backticks (Optional):**

If your column and table names don't contain special characters or reserved words, you can simplify your query by removing backticks:

```sql
SELECT t.approvedSymbol, a.score
FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.targets t
JOIN bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect a
  ON t.id = a.targetId
WHERE a.diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676' AND a.targetId IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT targetId
  FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect
  WHERE datasourceId = 'impc' AND diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
)
ORDER BY a.score DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **2. Check for Hidden Characters:**

- Sometimes, copying and pasting code introduces hidden or special characters.
- Retype the quotation marks manually to ensure they're standard single quotes.

#### **3. Verify All String Literals:**

- Ensure all string literals are properly enclosed with matching single quotes, especially `'impc'` and `'EFO_0000676'`.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Problem:** Mismatched quotation marks in string literals leading to unclosed string literal errors.
- **Solution:** Replace ending backticks with single quotes to properly enclose string literals.
- **Action:** Use the corrected query provided above and ensure all string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes.

---

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Copy the Corrected Query:**

   Use the corrected query provided above.

2. **Run the Query:**

   - Execute the query in your SQL environment.

3. **Verify the Results:**

   - The query should now run without syntax errors.
   - You should receive the `approvedSymbol` and `score` of target genes associated with the disease `'EFO_0000676'` from the data source `'IMPC'`, ordered by the highest overall score.

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [5:26]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [5:26]
```

Let's carefully examine your query to identify and fix the issue.

---

### **Your SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT t.`approvedSymbol`, a.`score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.targets` t
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect` a
  ON t.`id` = a.`targetId`
WHERE a.`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676` AND a.`targetId` IN (

  WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
)
ORDER BY a.`score` DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

### **Issue Identified:**

The error message points to an **unclosed string literal at [5:26]**, which is in your `WHERE` clause at line 5, character 26. The problematic part is:

```sql
a.`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
```

**Problem:**

- The string literal starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a backtick `` ` ``, causing an unclosed string literal.

Similarly, in the subquery:

```sql
`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
```

Again, the string literal is not properly closed.

---

### **Solution:**

To fix the error, ensure that all string literals are enclosed with **matching single quotes** `'...'`. Replace the ending backticks with single quotes.

---

### **Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT t.`approvedSymbol`, a.`score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.targets` t
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect` a
  ON t.`id` = a.`targetId`
WHERE a.`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676' AND a.`targetId` IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT `targetId`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
  WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
)
ORDER BY a.`score` DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

### **Explanation:**

- **Main `WHERE` Clause:**

  ```sql
  a.`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
  ```

  - Changed the ending backtick `` ` `` to a single quote `'` to properly close the string literal.

- **Subquery `WHERE` Clause:**

  ```sql
  `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
  ```

  - Similarly, closed the string literal with a single quote.

- **Quotation Marks Usage:**

  - **Identifiers (Column Names):** Enclosed in backticks `` `...` `` when necessary.
  - **String Literals:** Enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.

---

### **Additional Recommendations:**

1. **Check All String Literals:**

   - Ensure every string literal starts and ends with a single quote `'`.
   - Be cautious not to mix backticks and single quotes.

2. **Consider Removing Unnecessary Backticks:**

   - If the column names don't contain special characters or SQL keywords, you can simplify the query by removing backticks. This reduces the chance of confusion and errors.

   **Simplified Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT t.approvedSymbol, a.score
   FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.targets t
   JOIN bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect a
     ON t.id = a.targetId
   WHERE a.diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676' AND a.targetId IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT targetId
     FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect
     WHERE datasourceId = 'impc' AND diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
   )
   ORDER BY a.score DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

3. **Avoid Mixing Quotation Marks:**

   - Do not mix single quotes and backticks when enclosing the same string.

4. **Check for Hidden Characters:**

   - Sometimes copying and pasting can introduce hidden characters. Retype the quotation marks if necessary.

---

### **Testing the Corrected Query:**

Please run the corrected query. It should execute without syntax errors and provide the desired result.

---

### **Final Thoughts:**

- **Consistency is Key:** Always ensure that string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes, and identifiers with backticks if necessary.
- **Common Error:** Mismatched quotation marks are a frequent source of syntax errors in SQL queries.
- **Future Prevention:** Double-check quotations after writing or copying queries to prevent similar issues.

2025-01-28 03:07:06 - root - INFO - It appears that you are encountering a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause. The error message indicates an **unclosed string literal at [3:52]**, which points to line 3, character 52 in your query.

---

### **Problem in Your Query:**

**Your SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
ORDER BY `score` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Issue:**

- In the condition:

  ```sql
  `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
  ```

  The string literal `'EFO_0000676` starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a backtick `` ` ``, causing an **unclosed string literal** error.

---

### **Solution:**

To fix the error, ensure that all string literals are enclosed with **matching single quotes** `'...'`. Replace the ending backtick with a single quote.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
ORDER BY `score` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation:**

- **String Literals:** In SQL, string values (like `'impc'` and `'EFO_0000676'`) should be enclosed in **single quotes `'...'`**.
- **Identifiers:** Column names and table names can be enclosed in backticks `` `...` `` if necessary.
- **Mismatched Quotes:** Starting a string with a single quote `'` and ending it with a backtick `` ` `` leads to an unclosed string literal error.

---

### **Additional Suggestions:**

#### **1. Manually Retype Quotation Marks:**

- Sometimes, copying and pasting code from certain sources can introduce hidden or special characters (like smart quotes or backticks) that might not be visible but cause syntax errors.
- To ensure that your quotation marks are correct, **manually retype all single quotes** `'` in your query.

#### **2. Avoid Mixing Quotation Types:**

- Ensure that you use **single quotes** `'...'` consistently for string literals.
- Do not mix single quotes and backticks in the same string.

#### **3. Remove Unnecessary Backticks (Optional):**

- If your column names and table names do not contain special characters or SQL keywords, you can omit the backticks for clarity.

  **Simplified Query Without Backticks:**

  ```sql
  SELECT targetId, score
  FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect
  WHERE datasourceId = 'impc' AND diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
  ORDER BY score DESC
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

  - This reduces potential confusion caused by backticks and makes the query cleaner.

---

### **Testing the Corrected Query:**

Please try running the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
ORDER BY `score` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

If you prefer, use the simplified version without backticks:

```sql
SELECT targetId, score
FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect
WHERE datasourceId = 'impc' AND diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Ensure Proper Quotation Marks:**

   - Double-check that all string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`.
   - Retype quotation marks manually to eliminate any hidden characters.

2. **Run the Query:**

   - Execute the corrected query in your SQL environment.

3. **Verify the Results:**

   - The query should now run without syntax errors.
   - You should retrieve the `targetId` and `score` of targets associated with the disease `'EFO_0000676'` from the data source `'IMPC'`, ordered by the highest score.

---

### **Explanation of the Query:**

- **Objective:** Retrieve targets from the data source `'IMPC'` associated with the disease `'EFO_0000676'`, along with their scores.
- **ORDER BY Clause:** Sorts the results by `score` in descending order to get the highest scores at the top.
- **LIMIT 100:** Retrieves up to 100 records.

---

### **If the Issue Persists:**

- **Check for Hidden Characters:**

  - If the error continues, there might be hidden characters or formatting issues.
  - Try typing the entire query manually instead of copying and pasting.

- **Test Simple String Literals:**

  - Run a simple query to check if your environment handles string literals correctly:

    ```sql
    SELECT 'EFO_0000676' AS test_disease_id, 'impc' AS test_datasource_id;
    ```

  - If this simple query fails, there might be an issue with how your SQL environment interprets quotation marks.

- **Ensure Correct Editor Settings:**

  - Make sure your SQL editor or interface uses the standard character encoding (UTF-8) and does not auto-replace straight quotes with smart quotes.

---

### **Summary:**

- The error is caused by mismatched quotation marks in your string literals.
- By correcting the quotes to use matching single quotes, your query should execute successfully.
- Manually retyping the quotation marks can help eliminate any hidden characters causing the issue.

2025-01-28 03:07:37 - root - INFO - It appears that you are encountering a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause. The error message indicates an **unclosed string literal at [3:49]**, which points to line 3, character 49 in your query.

---

### **Issue in Your Query:**

**Your SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
ORDER BY `score` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Problem Identified:**

In the `WHERE` clause, the string literal for `diseaseId` is not properly enclosed:

```sql
`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
```

- You **start** the string with a **single quote** `'`
- You **end** the string with a **backtick** `` ` ``

This mismatch leads to an **unclosed string literal** error because the SQL parser expects a closing single quote `'`.

---

### **Solution:**

To fix the error, ensure that all string literals are enclosed with **matching single quotes** `'...'`. Replace the ending backtick `` ` `` with a single quote `'`.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
ORDER BY `score` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Additional Steps to Ensure the Error is Resolved:**

1. **Manually Retype the Quotation Marks:**

   - Copying and pasting can sometimes introduce hidden characters or formatting issues.
   - **Retype all quotation marks** in your query to ensure they are standard single quotes `'`.
   - Avoid using backticks `` ` `` for string literals.

2. **Check for Smart Quotes or Encoding Issues:**

   - Ensure your text editor or SQL interface isn't converting straight quotes `'` into smart quotes `‘’`.
   - Use a plain text editor to prevent automatic formatting.

3. **Remove Unnecessary Backticks (Optional):**

   - If your column and table names do not contain special characters or reserved keywords, you can omit the backticks for clarity.
   - **Simplified Query Without Backticks:**

     ```sql
     SELECT targetId, score
     FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect
     WHERE datasourceId = 'impc' AND diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
     ORDER BY score DESC
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

4. **Test a Simple Query:**

   - Run a simple test to check if string literals are handled correctly:

     ```sql
     SELECT 'EFO_0000676' AS test_disease_id;
     ```

   - If this fails, there may be an issue with how your environment handles string literals.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Issue:** Mismatched quotation marks caused an unclosed string literal error.
- **Solution:** Ensure all string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`.
- **Action Steps:**
  - Replace the ending backticks with single quotes in string literals.
  - Manually retype quotation marks to eliminate hidden characters.

2025-01-28 03:08:04 - root - INFO - It appears that you're still encountering a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause. The error message indicates an **"Unclosed string literal at [3:49]"**, pointing to line 3, character 49 in your query.

---

### **Your SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
ORDER BY `score` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Issue Identified:**

In your `WHERE` clause, the condition:

```sql
`diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676`
```

has a mismatched quotation mark. The string literal `'EFO_0000676` starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a backtick `` ` ``, causing an unclosed string literal error.

---

### **Solution:**

To fix the error, ensure that all string literals are enclosed with **matching single quotes** `'...'`.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
ORDER BY `score` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation:**

- **String Literals:** In SQL, string values should be enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
  - Correct: `'EFO_0000676'`
  - Incorrect: `'EFO_0000676` (starts with `'`, ends with `` ` ``)
- **Identifiers:** Use backticks `` `...` `` for column names or table names if needed.
  - Example: `` `diseaseId` ``, `` `targetId` ``

By replacing the ending backtick with a single quote, the string literal is properly closed, and the SQL parser can correctly interpret your query.

---

### **Additional Steps:**

1. **Manually Retype Quotation Marks:**
   - Sometimes, copying and pasting can introduce hidden characters or formatting issues.
   - Manually retype the single quotes around `'EFO_0000676'` to ensure they are standard single quotes.

2. **Check All String Literals:**
   - Verify that all string literals in your query are enclosed with matching single quotes.
   - Example:
     - `'impc'`
     - `'EFO_0000676'`

3. **Avoid Mixing Quotation Marks:**
   - Do not mix single quotes and backticks when enclosing the same string.
   - Stick to single quotes for string literals and backticks for identifiers.

---

### **Try Running the Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT `targetId`, `score`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect`
WHERE `datasourceId` = 'impc' AND `diseaseId` = 'EFO_0000676'
ORDER BY `score` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **If the Issue Persists:**

- **Remove Unnecessary Backticks (Optional):**
  - Since your column and table names do not contain special characters or SQL keywords, you can omit the backticks for simplicity.
  - **Simplified Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT targetId, score
    FROM bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect
    WHERE datasourceId = 'impc' AND diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'
    ORDER BY score DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

- **Check for Hidden Characters:**
  - Retype the entire query to eliminate any hidden or special characters that might cause syntax errors.

- **Test String Literals Separately:**
  - Run a simple query to ensure your SQL environment handles string literals correctly:
    ```sql
    SELECT 'EFO_0000676' AS test_value;
    ```
  - If this fails, there may be an issue with your SQL editor or environment.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Error Cause:** Mismatched quotation marks in string literals leading to an unclosed string literal error.
- **Resolution:** Ensure all string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`.
- **Action:** Replace the ending backtick in `'EFO_0000676\`` with a single quote to make it `'EFO_0000676'`.
