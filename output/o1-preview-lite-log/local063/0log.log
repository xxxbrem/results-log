2025-01-24 22:41:17 - root - INFO - ```sql
SELECT "prod_id", SUM("quantity_sold") AS "total_quantity_sold"
FROM "sales"
GROUP BY "prod_id"
ORDER BY "total_quantity_sold" DESC
LIMIT (
    SELECT CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT "prod_id") * 0.2 AS INTEGER)
    FROM "sales"
);
```

**Explanation:**

The error `"datatype mismatch"` occurs because the `LIMIT` clause in SQLite expects an integer value, but the expression `(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "prod_id") * 0.2 FROM "sales")` returns a floating-point number (since multiplying by `0.2` produces a float).

To fix this issue, we need to:

1. **Ensure the subquery returns an integer value:**

   - Use `CAST(... AS INTEGER)` to convert the floating-point result to an integer.

2. **Place the subquery inside parentheses directly in the `LIMIT` clause:**

   - SQLite supports subqueries in the `LIMIT` clause if they return an integer.

**Corrected Query Details:**

- **Subquery in `LIMIT`:**

  ```sql
  (
      SELECT CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT "prod_id") * 0.2 AS INTEGER)
      FROM "sales"
  )
  ```

  - This computes the number of products (`COUNT(DISTINCT "prod_id")`), multiplies it by `0.2` to get 20%, and casts the result to an integer.

- **Full Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "prod_id", SUM("quantity_sold") AS "total_quantity_sold"
  FROM "sales"
  GROUP BY "prod_id"
  ORDER BY "total_quantity_sold" DESC
  LIMIT (
      SELECT CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT "prod_id") * 0.2 AS INTEGER)
      FROM "sales"
  );
  ```

By making this correction, the `LIMIT` clause now receives an integer value, and the query should execute without the `"datatype mismatch"` error.

  - `"cust_id"`: Used to link sales to customers.
  - `"time_id"`: Used to identify the date of the sale.
  - `"promo_id"`: Used to identify if a promotion was applied.
  - `"quantity_sold"`: Used to calculate total sales per product.
- **products**
  - `"prod_id"`: Product identifier.
  - `"prod_name"`: Name of the product.

  - `"country_id"`: Used to identify the customer's country.
- **countries**
  - `"country_id"`: Country identifier.
  - `"country_name"`: Name of the country (e.g., 'United States').
- **times**

**Conditions to be Used:**

- Sales without any promotion (`promo_id` corresponding to no promotion).
- Sales in the United States (`country_name` = 'United States').
- Time periods corresponding to Q4 in 2019 and 2020.
- Products in the top 20% by total sales.
- Calculation of sales share changes between the two periods.

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. **List Distinct Promotion IDs and Names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "promo_id", "promo_name" FROM "promotions" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Check for Promotion IDs Indicating No Promotion:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "promo_id" FROM "promotions" WHERE "promo_name" LIKE '%No Promotion%' LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List All Countries and Their IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_id", "country_name" FROM "countries" LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find the Country ID for the United States:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_id" FROM "countries" WHERE "country_name" = 'United States';
   ```

5. **List All Customers from the United States:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "cust_id" FROM "customers" WHERE "country_id" = (
       SELECT "country_id" FROM "countries" WHERE "country_name" = 'United States'
   ) LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Get Time IDs for Q4 2019:**

   ```sql

   FROM "sales"
   GROUP BY "prod_id"
   ORDER BY "total_quantity_sold" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List Product Names and IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "prod_id", "prod_name" FROM "products" LIMIT 100;
   ```

    ```

    *(Note: If there is a specific "promo_id" that indicates no promotion, replace the query accordingly.)*

11. **List Sales in the US Without Promotion in Q4 2019:**

    ```sql

    *(Note: SQLite may not support LIMIT with a subquery directly; adjust accordingly.)*

16. **Get Product Names for Top Products:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."prod_id", p."prod_name"
    FROM "products" AS p
    WHERE p."prod_id" IN (

Task: Which product has the smallest change in sales share for each product from the top 20% of products by total sales between Q4 in 2019 and 2020 in US without any promotion?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name
name:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This table shows the product with the smallest change in sales share between Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 in the US without any promotion, among the top 20% of products by total sales..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
