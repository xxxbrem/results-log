Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task, we'll need to identify the relevant tables and columns from the available datasets. We'll use the `tlc_yellow_trips_2016` table for Yellow Taxi trips and the `taxi_zone_geom` table to get the pickup and dropoff zones.

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

**Table:** `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`

- **`pickup_datetime`**: To filter trips between July 1 and July 7, 2016.
- **`dropoff_datetime`**: To calculate the trip duration.
- **`passenger_count`**: To filter trips with more than 5 passengers.
- **`trip_distance`**: To filter trips that are at least 10 miles.
- **`fare_amount`**: To ensure the fare is positive.
- **`total_amount`**: To rank the trips by total fare amount.
- **`tip_amount`**: To calculate the tip rate.
- **`pickup_location_id`**: To identify the pickup zone.
- **`dropoff_location_id`**: To identify the dropoff zone.

**Table:** `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.taxi_zone_geom`

- **`zone_id`**: To join with `pickup_location_id` and `dropoff_location_id`.
- **`zone_name`**: To get the names of the pickup and dropoff zones.

### Conditions to be Used:

- **Date Range**: `pickup_datetime` between `'2016-07-01'` and `'2016-07-07 23:59:59'`.
- **Passenger Count**: `passenger_count > 5`.
- **Trip Distance**: `trip_distance >= 10`.
- **Positive Fare**: `fare_amount > 0`.
- **Avoid Invalid Items**: Ensure all required fields are not null or invalid.

### SQL Queries to Understand the Data:

Below are 10 different SQL queries to explore the data and understand the related columns.

1. **Sample Data from `tlc_yellow_trips_2016`**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Date Range of the Dataset**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     MIN(pickup_datetime) AS min_pickup_date,
     MAX(pickup_datetime) AS max_pickup_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`;
   ```

3. **Distinct Passenger Counts**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT passenger_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Trips with Passenger Count Greater Than 5**

   ```sql
   SELECT passenger_count, trip_distance, fare_amount
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
   WHERE passenger_count > 5
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Trips with Trip Distance Greater Than or Equal to 10 Miles**

   ```sql
   SELECT trip_distance, fare_amount
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
   WHERE trip_distance >= 10
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Trips with Positive Fare Amount**

   ```sql
   SELECT fare_amount, total_amount
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
   WHERE fare_amount > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Trips Between July 1 and July 7, 2016**

   ```sql
   SELECT pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime, trip_distance
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
   WHERE pickup_datetime BETWEEN '2016-07-01' AND '2016-07-07 23:59:59'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Trip Durations and Speeds Calculation**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     pickup_datetime,
     dropoff_datetime,
     TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime, pickup_datetime, MINUTE) AS trip_duration_minutes,
     trip_distance,
     (trip_distance / (TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime, pickup_datetime, SECOND) / 3600)) AS speed_mph
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
   WHERE pickup_datetime BETWEEN '2016-07-01' AND '2016-07-07 23:59:59'
     AND passenger_count > 5
     AND trip_distance >= 10
     AND fare_amount > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate Tip Rate**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     fare_amount,
     tip_amount,
     (tip_amount / fare_amount) * 100 AS tip_rate_percentage
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
   WHERE fare_amount > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Join with Zone Names**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      t.pickup_location_id,
      pz.zone_name AS pickup_zone,
      t.dropoff_location_id,
      dz.zone_name AS dropoff_zone,
      t.trip_distance,
      t.fare_amount
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016` AS t
    LEFT JOIN `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.taxi_zone_geom` AS pz
      ON t.pickup_location_id = pz.zone_id
    LEFT JOIN `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.taxi_zone_geom` AS dz
      ON t.dropoff_location_id = dz.zone_id
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the data and preparing to write the final query that answers the task.

Task: Which are the top 10 taxi trips in New York City from July 1 to July 7, 2016, with more than 5 passengers, a trip distance of at least 10 miles, and a positive fare, ranked by total fare amount? Display the pickup and dropoff zones, trip duration, driving speed in miles per hour, and tip rate. Note that you should avoid invalid items.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the top 10 taxi trips in New York City from July 1 to July 7, 2016, with more than 5 passengers, a trip distance of at least 10 miles, and a positive fare, we would filter the taxi trip data based on these criteria and rank the trips by total fare amount in descending order. Below is a table displaying the pickup and dropoff zones, trip duration, driving speed in miles per hour, and tip rate for these trips.

```csv
Pickup_Zone,Dropoff_Zone,Trip_Duration_minutes,Driving_Speed_mph,Tip_Rate_Percentage
pickup_zone1:str,dropoff_zone1:str,duration1:float,speed1:float,tip_rate1:float
pickup_zone2:str,dropoff_zone2:str,duration2:float,speed2:float,tip_rate2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'new_york_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'new_york_citibike': ['citibike_stations', 'citibike_trips'], 'new_york_mv_collisions': ['nypd_mv_collisions'], 'new_york_subway': ['geo_nyc_borough_boundaries', 'routes', 'station_complexes', 'station_entrances', 'stations', 'stop_times', 'subway_ridership_2013_present', 'trips'], 'new_york_taxi_trips': ['taxi_zone_geom', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2015', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2016', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2017', 'tlc_green_trips_2014', 'tlc_green_trips_2015', 'tlc_green_trips_2016', 'tlc_green_trips_2017', 'tlc_green_trips_2018', 'tlc_green_trips_2019', 'tlc_green_trips_2020', 'tlc_green_trips_2021', 'tlc_green_trips_2022', 'tlc_green_trips_2023', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2011', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2012', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2013', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2014', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2015', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2016', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2017', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2018', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2019', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2020', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2021', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2022', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2023'], 'new_york_trees': ['tree_census_1995', 'tree_census_2005', 'tree_census_2015', 'tree_species']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
