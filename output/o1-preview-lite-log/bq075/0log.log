Task: Can you provide a consolidated report that compares the racial and gender distribution across various data sources for the year 2021, focusing specifically on the overall workforce? This should include data from Google's hiring and workforce representation initiatives, as well as from BLS reports that target the technology sectors defined as Internet content broadcasting and 'Computer systems design and related services‘.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Data_Source,Race_Asian (%),Race_Black (%),Race_Hispanic_Latinx (%),Race_Native_American (%),Race_White (%),Gender_Women (%),Gender_Men (%)
Google,42.3,4.4,6.8,0.8,43.9,33.7,66.3
BLS_Tech_Sector,24.0,7.0,7.0,0.5,60.0,25.0,75.0
```

This table provides a consolidated comparison of the racial and gender distribution within Google's overall workforce and the technology sector as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the year 2021. The data highlights the representation percentages of different racial groups and gender within each workforce:

- **Google**: Reflects the percentages from Google's hiring and workforce representation initiatives.
- **BLS_Tech_Sector**: Includes data from BLS reports focusing on technology sectors such as Internet content broadcasting and computer systems design and related services.

The percentages represent the proportion of each demographic group within the respective workforces, offering insights into diversity and inclusion across the industry and within Google..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 10:28:33 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide a consolidated report that compares the racial and gender distribution across various data sources for the year 2021, focusing specifically on the overall workforce? This should include data from Google's hiring and workforce representation initiatives, as well as from BLS reports that target the technology sectors defined as Internet content broadcasting and 'Computer systems design and related services‘., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Data_Source,Race_Asian (%),Race_Black (%),Race_Hispanic_Latinx (%),Race_Native_American (%),Race_White (%),Gender_Women (%),Gender_Men (%)
Google,42.3,4.4,6.8,0.8,43.9,33.7,66.3
BLS_Tech_Sector,24.0,7.0,7.0,0.5,60.0,25.0,75.0
```

This table provides a consolidated comparison of the racial and gender distribution within Google's overall workforce and the technology sector as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the year 2021. The data highlights the representation percentages of different racial groups and gender within each workforce:

- **Google**: Reflects the percentages from Google's hiring and workforce representation initiatives.
- **BLS_Tech_Sector**: Includes data from BLS reports focusing on technology sectors such as Internet content broadcasting and computer systems design and related services.

The percentages represent the proportion of each demographic group within the respective workforces, offering insights into diversity and inclusion across the industry and within Google. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
