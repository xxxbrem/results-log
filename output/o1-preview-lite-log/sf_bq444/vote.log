After comparing both SQL queries, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct query to use. Here are the reasons:

1. **Explicit Casting**: The query in `0result.sql` casts `"topics"[0]` to a string using `::STRING`. This ensures that the comparison with the topic hashes is accurate, especially if the `"topics"` array elements are not already stored as strings.

2. **Consistent Syntax**: The query uses consistent and clear schema referencing without aliases, which can improve readability and maintainability.

3. **Equivalent Results**: Both queries produce the same result set, but the explicit casting in `0result.sql` adds an extra layer of correctness.

**Therefore, the correct SQL file is:**

```plain
0result.sql
```
