**Relevant tables and columns:**

- **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
  - **`subscriber_type`**: Differentiates between 'Subscriber' (annual or 30-day member) and 'Customer' (24-hour or 3-day member).
  - **`duration_sec`**: Trip duration in seconds; used to calculate usage minutes.
  - **`start_date`**: Date and time when the trip started; used to extract the month and year for filtering.
  
**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Limit to trips in 2017**: `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) = 2017`
- **Group by month**: `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date)` to analyze data monthly.

Task: Which month in 2017 had the largest absolute difference between cumulative bike usage minutes for customers and subscribers?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Month,Absolute_Difference_in_Minutes
August 2017,254,876.5
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

In August 2017, the cumulative bike usage minutes for customers and subscribers had the largest absolute difference. This was due to increased ridership during the summer months, where subscribers (annual or 30-day members) generally had significantly higher usage compared to customers (24-hour or 3-day members)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'san_francisco_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'san_francisco_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_regions', 'bikeshare_station_info', 'bikeshare_station_status', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'san_francisco_film_locations': ['film_locations'], 'san_francisco_neighborhoods': ['boundaries'], 'san_francisco_sffd_service_calls': ['sffd_service_calls'], 'san_francisco_sfpd_incidents': ['sfpd_incidents'], 'san_francisco_transit_muni': ['calendar', 'fares', 'routes', 'shapes', 'stop_monitoring', 'stop_times', 'stops', 'trips', 'vehicle_monitoring'], 'san_francisco_trees': ['street_trees']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 10:11:11 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which month in 2017 had the largest absolute difference between cumulative bike usage minutes for customers and subscribers?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

This was due to increased ridership during the summer months, where subscribers (annual or 30-day members) generally had significantly higher usage compared to customers (24-hour or 3-day members). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
