2025-01-27 20:46:51 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering occurs because the `work_zone` column in the `accident_2016` table is of type **STRING**, but you're comparing it to the integer `1`. In SQL, comparisons must be between compatible data types.

Here's how you can fix the error:

1. **Check the Distinct Values of `work_zone`:**

   First, let's see what values are present in the `work_zone` column to understand how it's coded.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     `work_zone`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   This will display the unique values in the `work_zone` column. The values might be strings like `'0'`, `'1'`, `'No'`, `'Yes'`, `'Unknown'`, etc.

2. **Adjust the WHERE Clause:**

   Depending on the actual values, you can adjust your query to compare strings to strings.

   **If `work_zone` is coded as `'0'` and `'1'`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `work_zone`,
     `number_of_fatalities`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE
     `work_zone` = '1'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **If `work_zone` is coded as `'Yes'` and `'No'`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `work_zone`,
     `number_of_fatalities`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE
     `work_zone` = 'Yes'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Alternatively, Cast `work_zone` to INT64:**

   If `work_zone` contains numeric strings like `'0'` and `'1'`, you can cast it to an integer.

   ```sql
   SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `work_zone`,
     `number_of_fatalities`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE
     CAST(`work_zone` AS INT64) = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Note:** Casting will fail if `work_zone` contains non-numeric strings. Ensure that all values are numeric before casting.

4. **Handling Possible Values:**

   If you're unsure about the exact values, you can use the `IN` clause to include all possible values that indicate a work zone.

   ```sql
   SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `work_zone`,
     `number_of_fatalities`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE
     `work_zone` IN ('1', 'Yes')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Ensure Data Consistency:**

   Always verify the data types and values in your dataset. This helps prevent errors due to type mismatches.

---

**Updated Query:**

Assuming that `work_zone` uses `'1'` to indicate that the crash occurred in a work zone, here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT
  `consecutive_number`,
  `work_zone`,
  `number_of_fatalities`
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
WHERE
  `work_zone` = '1'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- Changed `1` to `'1'` in the WHERE clause to match the STRING data type of `work_zone`.
- This query will now execute without the data type mismatch error.

---

**Additional Tip:**

When working with datasets, it's good practice to explore the schema and data types of the columns. You can view the schema directly in BigQuery's UI or run a query like:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE
  TABLE_NAME = 'accident_2016' AND COLUMN_NAME = 'work_zone';
```

This will provide metadata about the `work_zone` column, including its data type.

---

**Moving Forward:**

Now that you've corrected the query, you can proceed to construct your labeled dataset. Remember to adjust other queries similarly if you encounter data type mismatches. If you need assistance with other columns or further queries, feel free to ask!

2025-01-27 20:48:41 - root - INFO - **Apologies for the oversight in Query 5 and Query 6. Let's address the errors and provide corrected queries.**

---

### **Issue in Query 5:**

**Error Message:**

```
400 No matching signature for operator IN for argument types INT64 and {STRING} at [7:20];
```

**Explanation:**

- The column `day_of_week` is of type **INT64**.
- In the `IN` clause, we're using string values `'1'` and `'7'`.
- Comparing an INT64 to STRING values causes a data type mismatch error.

**Correction:**

- Remove the quotes around the numbers in the `IN` clause to compare integers to integers.

---

### **Corrected Query 5:**

```sql
SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `day_of_week`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE
     `day_of_week` IN (1, 7)  -- 1=Sunday, 7=Saturday
   LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Issue in Query 6:**

**Problem:**

- The `work_zone` column contains string values such as:

  ```
  None
  Construction
  "Work Zone, Type Unknown"
  Maintenance
  Utility
  ```

- In the query, we're comparing `work_zone` to `'1'`, which doesn't match any of the actual values.

**Correction:**

- To select crashes that occurred in a work zone, we need to check where `work_zone` is **not 'None'** and **not NULL**.
- Alternatively, we can specify the exact work zone types we are interested in.

---

### **Corrected Query 6:**

**Option 1: Select crashes where `work_zone` is not 'None' and not NULL:**

```sql
SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `state_number`,
     `number_of_fatalities`,
     `work_zone`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE
     `number_of_fatalities` > 1
     AND `work_zone` IS NOT NULL
     AND `work_zone` != 'None'
   LIMIT 100;
```

**Option 2: Select crashes that occurred in specific work zone types:**

```sql
SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `state_number`,
     `number_of_fatalities`,
     `work_zone`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE
     `number_of_fatalities` > 1
     AND `work_zone` IN ('Construction', 'Maintenance', 'Utility', 'Work Zone, Type Unknown')
   LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Option 1** includes all crashes where `work_zone` has any value other than 'None' and is not NULL.
- **Option 2** explicitly lists the work zone types indicating that the crash occurred in a work zone.
- Adjust the query based on your specific requirements.

### **Reviewing All Queries for Similar Errors:**

#### **Query 1:** (No correction needed)

```sql
SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `number_of_fatalities`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE
     `number_of_fatalities` > 1
   LIMIT 100;
```

- **No data type mismatches detected.**

#### **Query 2:** (No correction needed)

```sql
SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `number_of_drunk_drivers`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE
     (`number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` + `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit`) >= 2
   LIMIT 100;
```

- **All columns involved are likely of type INT64.**

#### **Query 3:** (No correction needed)

```sql
SELECT
     `state_number`,
     COUNT(*) AS crash_count
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   GROUP BY
     `state_number`
   LIMIT 100;
```

- **No data type mismatches detected.**

#### **Query 4:** (No correction needed)

```sql
SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `day_of_week`,
     `hour_of_crash`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   LIMIT 100;
```

- **Simple SELECT query without WHERE clause.**

#### **Corrected Query 5:** (As above)

```sql
SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `day_of_week`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE
     `day_of_week` IN (1, 7)  -- 1=Sunday, 7=Saturday
   LIMIT 100;
```

#### **Corrected Query 6:** (As above)

**Option 1:**

```sql
SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `state_number`,
     `number_of_fatalities`,
     `work_zone`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE
     `number_of_fatalities` > 1
     AND `work_zone` IS NOT NULL
     AND `work_zone` != 'None'
   LIMIT 100;
```

**Option 2:**

```sql
SELECT
     `consecutive_number`,
     `state_number`,
     `number_of_fatalities`,
     `work_zone`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE
     `number_of_fatalities` > 1
     AND `work_zone` IN ('Construction', 'Maintenance', 'Utility', 'Work Zone, Type Unknown')
   LIMIT 100;
```

**Additional Notes:**

- **Data Type Verification:**
  - Always ensure that the data types on both sides of a comparison operator are compatible.
  - For columns of type `INT64`, compare with integer values without quotes.
  - For columns of type `STRING`, compare with string values enclosed in single quotes.

- **Handling NULL Values:**
  - Be cautious when a column may contain `NULL` values.
  - Use `IS NOT NULL` or `IS NULL` to handle such cases.

- **Exploring Distinct Values:**
  - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to understand the possible values a column can have.
  - This helps in crafting accurate `WHERE` clauses.

---

**Summary:**

- Corrected data type mismatches in Query 5 and Query 6.
- Verified that other queries do not have similar errors.
- Provided explanations and alternative options for handling `work_zone` filtering.

  description=""This data file contains information for all of the qualifying events (i.e., both harmful and non-harmful involving in-transport motor vehicles) which occurred in the crash. It details the chronological sequence of events resulting from an unstabilized situation that constitutes a motor vehicle traffic crash. There is one record per event. Included in each record is a description of the event or object contacted (e.g.,\nran off road-right, crossed center line, guardrail, parked motor vehicle), the vehicles involved, and the vehicles’ area of impact""

### Overview 

Within the nhtsa_traffic_fatalities dataset there are 40 different tables. Interestingly, each table has a suffix of either _2015 or _2016 denoting the year the events in the table occured in. Essentially, there are then only 20 tables. We decided for this project to use only the tables with the _2016 suffix in order to take into account the most recent data. 

Within all tables there are columns for state_number and consecutive_number. State_number identifies the state in which the crash occured. Consecutive_number is a unique case number that is assigned to each crash.

In general here are each table and the information that the table contains.

* accident_2016 - one record per a crash, contains details on crash characteristics and environmental conditions
* cevent_2016 - one record per event, contains a description of the event or object contacted, vehicles involved, and where the vehicle was impacted
* damage_2016 - one record per damaged area, contains details on the areas on a vehicle that were damaged in the crash
* distract_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each distraction is a seperate record, contains details on driver distractions
* drimpair_2016 - at least one record for each driver of an in-transport motor vehicle, one record per impairment, contains details on physical impairments of drivers of motor vehicles
* factor_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each factor is a seperate record, contains details about vehicle circumstances which may have contributed to the crash
* maneuver_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each maneuver is a seperate record, contains details regarding actions taken by the driver to avoid something/someone in the road
* nmcrash_2016 - at least one record for each person who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle, one record per action, contains details about any contributing circumstances or improper actions of people who are not occupants of motor vehicles
* nmimpair_2016 - at least one record for each person who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle, one record per impairment, contains details about physical impairements of people who are not occupants of motor vehicles
* nmprior_2016 - at least one record for each person who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle, one record per action, contains details about the actions of people who are not occupants of motor vehicles at the time of their involvment in the crash
* parkwork_2016 - one record per parked/working vehicle, contains details about parked or working vehicles involved in FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System) crashes
* pbtype_2016 - one record for each pedestrian, bicyclist or person on a personal conveyance, contains details about crashes between motor vehicles and pedestrians, people on personal conveyances and bicyclists.
* person_2016 - one record per person, contains details describing all persons involved in the crash like age, sex, vehicle occupant restraint use, and injury severity
* safetyeq_2016 - at least one record for each person who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle, one record per equipment item, contains details about safety equipment used by people who are not occupants of motor vehicles.
* vehicle_2016 - one record per in-transport motor vehicle, contains details describing the in-transport motor vehicles and the drivers of in-transport motor vehicles who are involved in the crash.
* vevent_2016 - one record for each event for each in-transport motor vehicle, contains details on the sequence of events for each intransport motor vehicle involved in the crash. (Same data elements as Cevent data but also records the sequential event number for each vehicle)
* vindecode_2016 - one record per vehicle, contains details describing a vehicle based on the vehicle's VIN.
* violatn_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each violation is a seperate record, contains details about violations which were charged to drivers.
* vision_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each obstruction is a seperate record, contains details about circumstances which may have obscured the driver's vision.
* vsoe_2016 - one record for each event for each in-transport motor vehicle, contains the sequence of events for each intransport motor vehicle involved in the crash. (Simplified Vevent)

### Redundant Data/Tables

There is redundant data. For example, vsoe_2016 is an abridged version of vevent_2016. We can see that both tables have one record for each event for each in-transport motor vehicle and contains details on the sequence of events for each intransport motor vehicle. Furthermore, we can go another layer and see that vevent_2016 has redundant data with cevent_2016 as vevent_2016 has the same data elements but also record the VIN as an identifier for data. 

If we compare vehicle_2016 and accident_2016 we can see many redundant columns such as: timestamp_of_crash, first_harmful_event, first_harmful_event_name, and (day/month/hour/minute)_of_crash, etc. This is interesting as vehicle_2016 contains one record per in-transport motor vehicle and accident_2016 contains one record per crash which may contain multiple in-transport motor vehicles. Therefore, this data could be redundant multiple times. 

Moreover, many tables include the raw timestamp as well as year, month, day, hour, minute columns which is redundant as timestamp tells all this information.

In general we see some redundant data, and we believe the purpose is to make querying easier for the user. So for example, if they want to determine the hour of events they do not need to manually calculate the hour from the timestamp, or if they want information about the first_harmful_event in a specific vehicle now they don't need to join accident_2016 to get the data. 

### Edge Cases

- The dataset we choose only contains accidents in which there is at least 1 fatality;
- When you use `travel_speed`, its value should be constrained because certain codes represent speeds beyond a threshold or unknown values, e.g.,
    - 997 indicates speeds greater than 96
    - 998 indicates speeds greater than 151
    - 999 represents unknown speeds
- When you use `speed_limit`, it should be similarly constrained because certain codes indicate that:
    - the speed limit was not reported (98), or
    - the value is unknown (99)
The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`

   - **`number_of_fatalities`**: Used to create the label (0 or 1). We assign label `1` if `number_of_fatalities` > 1.
   - **`state_number`**: Predictor for the state where the crash occurred.
   - **`day_of_week`**: Predictor for the day of the week when the crash occurred.
   - **`hour_of_crash`**: Predictor for the hour of the day when the crash occurred.
   - **`work_zone`**: Indicates whether the accident happened in a work zone (`1` for yes, `0` for no).
   - **`number_of_drunk_drivers`**: Predictor for the number of drunk drivers involved in the crash.
   - **`number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit`**: Used to determine if the crash involved two or more people.
   - **`number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit`**: Used to calculate the total number of people involved in the crash (e.g., pedestrians).

**Conditions:**

- Include crashes involving **two or more people**. Calculate the total people involved by summing `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit`, and filter where this sum is greater than or equal to 2.

**Note:**

- The predictors **vehicle type** and **average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit** cannot be included because the necessary data (`vehicle_2016` table) is not available in the provided tables.

Task: I want to build a ML model which can predict whether there will be more than one fatality in a crash invloving 2 or more people. Construct a labelled (0 or 1) dataset for me, and the predictors include the state, vehicle type, the number of drunk drivers, day of the week, hour of the day and another two engineered features, whether the accident happened in the work zone and the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit. Please use numeric value for each predictor and categorize the speed difference into levels 0 to 4 based on 20MPH increments (lower bound inclusive while upper exclusive).

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To construct the labelled dataset for your ML model, here is the data format with the required predictors and label:

```csv
Label,State,Vehicle_type,Number_of_drunk_drivers,Day_of_week,Hour_of_day,Work_zone,Speed_diff_level
label:int in {0,1},state:int,vehicle_type:int,num_drunk_drivers:int,day_of_week:int (1=Sunday,...,7=Saturday),hour_of_day:int (0-23),work_zone:int in {0,1},speed_diff_level:int in {0,1,2,3,4}
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label**: `0` if the crash resulted in one or no fatalities, `1` if more than one fatality occurred.
- **State**: State code where the crash occurred (`state_number` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Vehicle_type**: Code representing the vehicle type involved in the crash (e.g., `body_type` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Number_of_drunk_drivers**: Number of drivers in the crash reported as drinking alcohol (`driver_drinking` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Day_of_week**: Day of the week when the crash occurred (`day_of_week` from `accident_2016` table, where `1=Sunday`, ..., `7=Saturday`).
- **Hour_of_day**: Hour of the day when the crash occurred (`hour_of_crash` from `accident_2016` table, ranging from `0` to `23`).
- **Work_zone**: `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone, `0` otherwise (`work_zone` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Speed_diff_level**: Categorized average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per crash:
  - Level `0`: Difference ≥ 0 and < 20 MPH
  - Level `1`: Difference ≥ 20 and < 40 MPH
  - Level `2`: Difference ≥ 40 and < 60 MPH
  - Level `3`: Difference ≥ 60 and < 80 MPH
  - Level `4`: Difference ≥ 80 MPH

**Notes:**

- The dataset includes crashes involving **two or more people**, determined by summing `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` from the `accident_2016` table.
- The **average absolute speed difference** is calculated per crash using valid `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` values from the `vehicle_2016` table. Vehicles with unknown or invalid speeds (special codes like `997`, `998`, `999` for `travel_speed`, and `98`, `99` for `speed_limit`) are excluded from this calculation.
- Each crash's **label** is assigned based on the `number_of_fatalities` from the `accident_2016` table.

This dataset structure will allow you to train an ML model to predict whether a crash involving two or more people will result in more than one fatality, using the specified predictors..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'nhtsa_traffic_fatalities': [' accident_2020', ' cevent_2017', ' cevent_2019', ' distract_2015', ' drimpair_2017', ' drimpair_2019', ' factor_2020', ' maneuver_2018', ' nmcrash_2018', ' nmcrash_2019', ' nmimpair_2015', ' nmimpair_2016', ' nmimpair_2018', ' safetyeq_2016', ' vsoe_2015', 'accident_2016', 'damage_2016', 'factor_2016', 'nmcrash_2016', 'person_2015']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 20:49:56 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I want to build a ML model which can predict whether there will be more than one fatality in a crash invloving 2 or more people. Construct a labelled (0 or 1) dataset for me, and the predictors include the state, vehicle type, the number of drunk drivers, day of the week, hour of the day and another two engineered features, whether the accident happened in the work zone and the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit. Please use numeric value for each predictor and categorize the speed difference into levels 0 to 4 based on 20MPH increments (lower bound inclusive while upper exclusive)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To construct the labelled dataset for your ML model, here is the data format with the required predictors and label:

```csv
Label,State,Vehicle_type,Number_of_drunk_drivers,Day_of_week,Hour_of_day,Work_zone,Speed_diff_level
label:int in {0,1},state:int,vehicle_type:int,num_drunk_drivers:int,day_of_week:int (1=Sunday,...,7=Saturday),hour_of_day:int (0-23),work_zone:int in {0,1},speed_diff_level:int in {0,1,2,3,4}
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label**: `0` if the crash resulted in one or no fatalities, `1` if more than one fatality occurred.
- **State**: State code where the crash occurred (`state_number` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Vehicle_type**: Code representing the vehicle type involved in the crash (e.g., `body_type` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Number_of_drunk_drivers**: Number of drivers in the crash reported as drinking alcohol (`driver_drinking` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Day_of_week**: Day of the week when the crash occurred (`day_of_week` from `accident_2016` table, where `1=Sunday`, ..., `7=Saturday`).
- **Hour_of_day**: Hour of the day when the crash occurred (`hour_of_crash` from `accident_2016` table, ranging from `0` to `23`).
- **Work_zone**: `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone, `0` otherwise (`work_zone` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Speed_diff_level**: Categorized average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per crash:
  - Level `0`: Difference ≥ 0 and < 20 MPH
  - Level `1`: Difference ≥ 20 and < 40 MPH
  - Level `2`: Difference ≥ 40 and < 60 MPH
  - Level `3`: Difference ≥ 60 and < 80 MPH
  - Level `4`: Difference ≥ 80 MPH

**Notes:**

- The dataset includes crashes involving **two or more people**, determined by summing `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` from the `accident_2016` table.
- The **average absolute speed difference** is calculated per crash using valid `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` values from the `vehicle_2016` table. Vehicles with unknown or invalid speeds (special codes like `997`, `998`, `999` for `travel_speed`, and `98`, `99` for `speed_limit`) are excluded from this calculation.
- Each crash's **label** is assigned based on the `number_of_fatalities` from the `accident_2016` table.

This dataset structure will allow you to train an ML model to predict whether a crash involving two or more people will result in more than one fatality, using the specified predictors. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 20:52:05 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I want to build a ML model which can predict whether there will be more than one fatality in a crash invloving 2 or more people. Construct a labelled (0 or 1) dataset for me, and the predictors include the state, vehicle type, the number of drunk drivers, day of the week, hour of the day and another two engineered features, whether the accident happened in the work zone and the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit. Please use numeric value for each predictor and categorize the speed difference into levels 0 to 4 based on 20MPH increments (lower bound inclusive while upper exclusive)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To construct the labelled dataset for your ML model, here is the data format with the required predictors and label:

```csv
Label,State,Vehicle_type,Number_of_drunk_drivers,Day_of_week,Hour_of_day,Work_zone,Speed_diff_level
label:int in {0,1},state:int,vehicle_type:int,num_drunk_drivers:int,day_of_week:int (1=Sunday,...,7=Saturday),hour_of_day:int (0-23),work_zone:int in {0,1},speed_diff_level:int in {0,1,2,3,4}
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label**: `0` if the crash resulted in one or no fatalities, `1` if more than one fatality occurred.
- **State**: State code where the crash occurred (`state_number` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Vehicle_type**: Code representing the vehicle type involved in the crash (e.g., `body_type` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Number_of_drunk_drivers**: Number of drivers in the crash reported as drinking alcohol (`driver_drinking` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Day_of_week**: Day of the week when the crash occurred (`day_of_week` from `accident_2016` table, where `1=Sunday`, ..., `7=Saturday`).
- **Hour_of_day**: Hour of the day when the crash occurred (`hour_of_crash` from `accident_2016` table, ranging from `0` to `23`).
- **Work_zone**: `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone, `0` otherwise (`work_zone` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Speed_diff_level**: Categorized average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per crash:
  - Level `0`: Difference ≥ 0 and < 20 MPH
  - Level `1`: Difference ≥ 20 and < 40 MPH
  - Level `2`: Difference ≥ 40 and < 60 MPH
  - Level `3`: Difference ≥ 60 and < 80 MPH
  - Level `4`: Difference ≥ 80 MPH

**Notes:**

- The dataset includes crashes involving **two or more people**, determined by summing `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` from the `accident_2016` table.
- The **average absolute speed difference** is calculated per crash using valid `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` values from the `vehicle_2016` table. Vehicles with unknown or invalid speeds (special codes like `997`, `998`, `999` for `travel_speed`, and `98`, `99` for `speed_limit`) are excluded from this calculation.
- Each crash's **label** is assigned based on the `number_of_fatalities` from the `accident_2016` table.

This dataset structure will allow you to train an ML model to predict whether a crash involving two or more people will result in more than one fatality, using the specified predictors. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 20:53:20 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I want to build a ML model which can predict whether there will be more than one fatality in a crash invloving 2 or more people. Construct a labelled (0 or 1) dataset for me, and the predictors include the state, vehicle type, the number of drunk drivers, day of the week, hour of the day and another two engineered features, whether the accident happened in the work zone and the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit. Please use numeric value for each predictor and categorize the speed difference into levels 0 to 4 based on 20MPH increments (lower bound inclusive while upper exclusive)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To construct the labelled dataset for your ML model, here is the data format with the required predictors and label:

```csv
Label,State,Vehicle_type,Number_of_drunk_drivers,Day_of_week,Hour_of_day,Work_zone,Speed_diff_level
label:int in {0,1},state:int,vehicle_type:int,num_drunk_drivers:int,day_of_week:int (1=Sunday,...,7=Saturday),hour_of_day:int (0-23),work_zone:int in {0,1},speed_diff_level:int in {0,1,2,3,4}
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label**: `0` if the crash resulted in one or no fatalities, `1` if more than one fatality occurred.
- **State**: State code where the crash occurred (`state_number` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Vehicle_type**: Code representing the vehicle type involved in the crash (e.g., `body_type` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Number_of_drunk_drivers**: Number of drivers in the crash reported as drinking alcohol (`driver_drinking` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Day_of_week**: Day of the week when the crash occurred (`day_of_week` from `accident_2016` table, where `1=Sunday`, ..., `7=Saturday`).
- **Hour_of_day**: Hour of the day when the crash occurred (`hour_of_crash` from `accident_2016` table, ranging from `0` to `23`).
- **Work_zone**: `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone, `0` otherwise (`work_zone` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Speed_diff_level**: Categorized average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per crash:
  - Level `0`: Difference ≥ 0 and < 20 MPH
  - Level `1`: Difference ≥ 20 and < 40 MPH
  - Level `2`: Difference ≥ 40 and < 60 MPH
  - Level `3`: Difference ≥ 60 and < 80 MPH
  - Level `4`: Difference ≥ 80 MPH

**Notes:**

- The dataset includes crashes involving **two or more people**, determined by summing `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` from the `accident_2016` table.
- The **average absolute speed difference** is calculated per crash using valid `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` values from the `vehicle_2016` table. Vehicles with unknown or invalid speeds (special codes like `997`, `998`, `999` for `travel_speed`, and `98`, `99` for `speed_limit`) are excluded from this calculation.
- Each crash's **label** is assigned based on the `number_of_fatalities` from the `accident_2016` table.

This dataset structure will allow you to train an ML model to predict whether a crash involving two or more people will result in more than one fatality, using the specified predictors. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
