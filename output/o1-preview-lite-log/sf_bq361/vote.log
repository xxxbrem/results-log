After comparing all three SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer for the following reasons:

- **Accurate Cohort Selection**: It correctly identifies users whose first purchase was in January 2020 by using the `MIN("created_at")` to find each user's first order date and filtering for dates between `'2020-01-01'` and `'2020-02-01'`.
- **Proper Subsequent Purchase Tracking**: It ensures that only purchases made *after* the first purchase are considered by checking that `o."created_at" > ju.first_order_at`.
- **Comprehensive Month Generation**: The query generates all months from February to December 2020 using the `generator` function, ensuring that months with zero returning users are included in the final result.
- **Accurate Proportion Calculation**: It calculates the proportion of returning users correctly by dividing the count of distinct users who made purchases in each month by the total number of users in the January cohort.

The other queries either lack the condition to ensure purchases are after the first purchase (`0result.sql`) or have unnecessary complexity without additional benefits (`2result.sql`).

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
