After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I recommend choosing **`0result.sql`** as the correct SQL query. Here's the reasoning:

### **Comparison of SQL Queries:**

1. **`0result.sql`**:

   - **Age Calculation**: Accurately calculates age by considering whether the user's birthday has occurred this year.
     - **Formula**:
       ```sql
       CAST(strftime('%Y', 'now') AS INTEGER) - CAST(strftime('%Y', birth_date) AS INTEGER)
       - (strftime('%m-%d', 'now') < strftime('%m-%d', birth_date)) AS age
       ```
     - **Explanation**: Subtracts 1 from the age if the current date is before the user's birthday, ensuring precise age calculation.

2. **`1result.sql`**:

   - **Age Calculation**: Calculates age by subtracting the birth year from the current year.
     - **Formula**:
       ```sql
       CAST(strftime('%Y', 'now') AS INTEGER) - CAST(SUBSTR("birth_date", 1, 4) AS INTEGER) AS age
       ```
     - **Explanation**: Does **not** account for whether the user's birthday has occurred this year, potentially overestimating the age by 1 for users whose birthdays are later in the year.

3. **`2result.sql`**:

   - **Age Calculation**: Uses the Julian day calculation method.
     - **Formula**:
       ```sql
       CAST((julianday('now') - julianday("birth_date")) / 365.25 AS INTEGER) AS age
       ```
     - **Explanation**: Approximates the age based on average year length, which can introduce minor inaccuracies due to leap years and does not account for the exact birthday.

### **Why `0result.sql` is the Correct Choice:**

- **Accurate Age Calculation**: By considering whether the user's birthday has passed in the current year, `0result.sql` provides the most precise age calculation.
- **Proper Age Categorization**: Ensures users are placed in the correct age categories based on their actual age.
- **Avoids Overestimation**: Prevents overestimating the age of users whose birthdays have not yet occurred in the current year.

### **Conclusion:**

For accurate results in counting the number of users in each age category, **`0result.sql`** is the preferred and correct SQL query.
