After reviewing both SQL scripts and their corresponding results, I have determined which SQL script accurately answers the task.

**Task Summary:**
- **Objective:** Calculate monthly statistics for new StackOverflow users created in 2021.
- **Metrics to compute:**
  - The percentage of new users who asked questions within their first 30 days.
  - The percentage of new users who both asked questions and then answered questions within their first 30 days.

**Comparison of the SQL Scripts:**

### **1. 0result.sql**

**Overview:**
- Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate:
  - `total_users`: Total new users per month in 2021.
  - `users_who_asked`: Users who asked questions within 30 days of account creation.
  - `users_asked_and_answered`: Users who both asked and answered questions within 30 days of account creation.
- Joins the CTEs on the month and calculates the required percentages.

**Key Points:**
- Filters posts within 30 days of user creation using `TIMESTAMP_ADD(u.creation_date, INTERVAL 30 DAY)`.
- Counts distinct user IDs to avoid duplicate counts due to multiple posts by the same user.
- Uses `ROUND` for percentage calculations to four decimal places.
- Orders the results by month.

### **2. 2result.sql**

**Overview:**
- Also uses CTEs to calculate:
  - `new_users`: List of new users in 2021 with their creation month.
  - `users_with_questions`: Users who asked questions within 30 days.
  - `users_with_questions_and_answers`: Users who asked questions and also answered within 30 days.
- Joins the CTEs on user IDs and calculates percentages.

**Key Points:**
- Joins are performed on user IDs and months.
- Uses `ROUND` and `SAFE_DIVIDE` for percentage calculations to handle division by zero cases.
- Orders the results by year and month.

**Analysis and Reasoning:**

Both SQL scripts aim to calculate the required statistics, but there are subtle differences:

- **Consistency in Calculations:**
  - **0result.sql** directly calculates percentages using counts from the same dataset, ensuring consistency.
  - **2result.sql** introduces potential discrepancies by joining on user IDs and months separately, which might lead to mismatches if users have activity spanning multiple months.

- **Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - **0result.sql** correctly handles cases where users might perform actions in different months by aggregating based on the accurate month of user creation.
  - **2result.sql** could potentially misattribute user activity to incorrect months due to the way it extracts and uses the month from different tables.

- **Percentage Calculation:**
  - Both scripts use `ROUND`, but **0result.sql** seems to have a more straightforward calculation without the need for `SAFE_DIVIDE`, which indicates confidence in data consistency.

- **Result Comparison:**
  - When comparing the results (`0result.csv` and `2result.csv`), the percentages are very close, but **0result.sql** provides slightly more precise values in line with expected trends.

**Conclusion:**

After careful evaluation, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script as it provides a more accurate and consistent calculation of the required statistics, properly aligns user activities within the correct time frames, and handles the data aggregation more effectively.
