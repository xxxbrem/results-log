Task: How many debt indicators for Russia have a value of 0, excluding NULL values?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators_with_Value_Zero
num:int
```

To determine the number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of 0 (excluding NULL values), we need to count the records in the `international_debt` table where `country_code` is `'RUS'` and `value` is `0`. Since the actual data is not provided, the exact number (`num`) cannot be calculated here..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'world_bank_global_population': ['population_by_country'], 'world_bank_health_population': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'health_nutrition_population', 'series_summary', 'series_times'], 'world_bank_intl_debt': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'international_debt', 'series_summary', 'series_times'], 'world_bank_intl_education': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'international_education', 'series_summary'], 'world_bank_wdi': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'footnotes', 'indicators_data', 'series_summary', 'series_time']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 11:42:50 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many debt indicators for Russia have a value of 0, excluding NULL values?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Number_of_Debt_Indicators_with_Value_Zero
num:int
```

To determine the number of debt indicators for Russia that have a value of 0 (excluding NULL values), we need to count the records in the `international_debt` table where `country_code` is `'RUS'` and `value` is `0`. Since the actual data is not provided, the exact number (`num`) cannot be calculated here. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
