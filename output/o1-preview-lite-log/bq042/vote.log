After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL to use is **1result.sql**.

**Reason:**

- **Data Accuracy:** The SQL in **1result.sql** handles missing or invalid data by checking for sentinel values (e.g., `9999.9` for temperature, `999.9` for wind speed, `99.99` for precipitation) and replaces them with `NULL`. This ensures that the analysis only includes valid and meaningful data.
  
  ```sql
  CASE WHEN temp != 9999.9 THEN temp ELSE NULL END AS Mean_Temperature_F,
  ```

- **Data Types:** It correctly casts string values to numeric types where necessary, ensuring accurate comparisons and calculations.

- **Functionality:** Using the `DATE()` function to construct the date ensures that the date is properly formatted and valid.

- **Data Consistency:** By excluding invalid data, the results are more reliable for analysis over the years.

On the other hand, **0result.sql** does not account for missing or invalid data. It might include incorrect values in the analysis, leading to inaccurate conclusions.

**Therefore, the correct SQL to use is:**

1result.sql
