2025-01-28 05:15:45 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to a data type mismatch in your SQL query. Specifically, you're comparing columns of type `STRING` with values of type `INT64` (integers) without proper conversion or matching data types.

**Issues in Your Query:**

1. **Incorrect `wban` Code:**
   - In your first query, you obtained the `wban` code for LaGuardia Airport as `'14732'`.
   - However, in your second query, you're using `wban = '94728'`, which doesn't match the `wban` code for LaGuardia.

2. **Data Type Mismatch:**
   - The columns `mo` (month) and `da` (day) in the `gsod2011` table are of type `STRING`.
   - In your query, you're comparing these string columns with integer values (`mo = 6` and `da = 12`), which causes the error.

**Corrected Query:**

Here’s the revised query with the corrections:

```sql
SELECT year, mo, da, temp, wdsp, prcp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2011`
WHERE stn = '725030' AND wban = '14732' AND mo = '6' AND da = '12'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Updated `wban` Code:**
   - Changed `wban = '94728'` to `wban = '14732'` to match the `wban` code for LaGuardia Airport.

2. **Matching Data Types:**
   - Enclosed the month and day values in quotes (`'6'` and `'12'`) to match the `STRING` data type of the `mo` and `da` columns.
   - Alternatively, you could cast the columns to integers, but it's simpler to compare strings with strings.

**Why the Error Occurred:**

- **Error Message Interpretation:**
  - The error message indicates a mismatch between a `STRING` and an `INT64` in the equality comparison.
  - Since `mo` and `da` are `STRING` types, comparing them directly to integers (`6` and `12`) without quotes leads to the type mismatch.

**Additional Note:**

- Always ensure that the data types on both sides of a comparison operator are the same or compatible. If necessary, use casting functions or adjust your literals to match the column types.

**Running the Corrected Query:**

By using the corrected query above, you should retrieve the desired weather data for LaGuardia Airport on June 12, 2011, without any errors.

**Example Output:**

Assuming the data exists, the query would return:

```csv
year, mo, da, temp, wdsp, prcp
2011, 6, 12, <temp_value>, <wind_speed_value>, <precipitation_value>
```

This will provide you with the mean temperature (`temp`), mean wind speed (`wdsp`), and total precipitation (`prcp`) for the specified date and location.

**Remember to Apply the Corrections to Other Queries:**

When writing your queries for other years or dates, make sure to:

- Use the correct `wban` code `'14732'`.
- Enclose numerical string comparisons in quotes, e.g., `mo = '6'` and `da = '12'`.

**Rewriting the Original Query with Corrections:**

1. **Original Query with Errors:**

   ```sql
   SELECT year, mo, da, temp, wdsp, prcp
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2011`
   WHERE stn = '725030' AND wban = '94728' AND mo = 6 AND da = 12
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT year, mo, da, temp, wdsp, prcp
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2011`
   WHERE stn = '725030' AND wban = '14732' AND mo = '6' AND da = '12'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

I hope this helps you resolve the error and successfully analyze the weather conditions at LaGuardia Airport.

Task: Help me analyze the weather conditions (including temperature, wind speed and precipitation) at NYC's airport LaGuardia for June 12, year over year, starting from 2011 to 2020.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Date,Mean_Temperature_F,Average_Wind_Speed_knots,Total_Precipitation_inches
2011-06-12,temp:float,wind_speed:float,precipitation:float
2012-06-12,temp:float,wind_speed:float,precipitation:float
2013-06-12,temp:float,wind_speed:float,precipitation:float
2014-06-12,temp:float,wind_speed:float,precipitation:float
2015-06-12,temp:float,wind_speed:float,precipitation:float
2016-06-12,temp:float,wind_speed:float,precipitation:float
2017-06-12,temp:float,wind_speed:float,precipitation:float
2018-06-12,temp:float,wind_speed:float,precipitation:float
2019-06-12,temp:float,wind_speed:float,precipitation:float
2020-06-12,temp:float,wind_speed:float,precipitation:float
```

This table displays the mean temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, average wind speed in knots, and total precipitation in inches at LaGuardia Airport in New York City on June 12th for each year from 2011 to 2020..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

```

**Explanation:**

- Removed quotes around `g.mo` and `g.da` in the `WHERE` clause since they are integers.
- Used the specific station identifiers `g.stn = '725030'` and `g.wban = '14732'` for LaGuardia Airport.
- Removed the join with the `stations` table since we are directly specifying the station codes.
- Ensured that the `_TABLE_SUFFIX` comparison works correctly by keeping the year values as strings.
- The query now should return data if available for the specified dates and station.

**Note:** If this query still returns no data, it may be because the NOAA GSOD dataset does not contain data for LaGuardia Airport on June 12 from 2011 to 2020. In that case, consider verifying if data exists for nearby dates or stations.

```

**Explanation:**

- **Corrected `wban` Code:** Changed `g.wban = '14732'` to `g.wban = '94728'` because the correct `wban` code for LaGuardia Airport is `'94728'`.
  
- **Data Type Consistency:**
  - **Month and Day:** `g.mo` and `g.da` are of type **STRING** in the dataset. So we compare them to the string literals `'6'` and `'12'` instead of integers `6` and `12`.
  
- **Ordering:**
  - Casted `g.year` to `INT64` in the `ORDER BY` clause to ensure correct numerical ordering by year.

- **Removed Join:**
  - Since we are directly specifying the station codes (`g.stn` and `g.wban`), the join with the `stations` table is unnecessary.

**Note:** Ensure that the station codes (`stn` and `wban`) are correct for LaGuardia Airport in the NOAA GSOD dataset. If no data is returned, it could be due to missing data for the specified dates or an incorrect station code.

```

**Explanation:**

- **Data Type Casting:**
  - Cast `_TABLE_SUFFIX` to `INT64` using `CAST(_TABLE_SUFFIX AS INT64)` so it can be compared numerically in the `BETWEEN` clause.
  - Ensure `g.year` matches the table suffix by adding `AND g.year = CAST(_TABLE_SUFFIX AS INT64)`.

- **Date Components:**
  - `g.mo` and `g.da` are integers, so we compare them to integers `6` and `12` without quotes.
  - In the `SELECT` statement, cast `g.mo` and `g.da` to strings when using `LPAD` to format the date.

- **Station Codes:**
  - Join with the `stations` table to accurately match LaGuardia Airport using the station's `name`.
  - Use `LOWER(s.name) LIKE '%la guardia%'` to find the correct station regardless of case.

- **Ordering:**
  - Order by `g.year` to get the data in chronological order.

**Notes:**

- By casting `_TABLE_SUFFIX` to `INT64`, we resolve the data type mismatch causing the original error.
- This query should retrieve the weather data for LaGuardia Airport on June 12 from 2011 to 2020.
- If the query still returns no data, it's possible that data for LaGuardia Airport on June 12 is not available in the dataset for those years. In that case, you might consider:
  - Checking nearby dates or months.
  - Verifying the station codes by querying the `stations` table separately.
  - Expanding the search to include nearby stations or multiple station names.

**Example to Verify Station Codes:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT usaf, wban, name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%la guardia%'
```

**Alternative Station Codes:**

- If multiple station codes are returned for LaGuardia Airport, you can modify the query to include all relevant `usaf` and `wban` combinations.

**Final Reminder:**

- Ensure that the joined station names and codes accurately represent LaGuardia Airport to retrieve the correct data.
- Double-check the availability of data for the specified dates and handle any missing data appropriately.

2025-01-28 05:49:13 - root - INFO - It appears that the NOAA GSOD dataset may not contain data for LaGuardia Airport (`name` LIKE '%la guardia%') on June 12th from 2011 to 2020. This could be due to data availability issues for that specific station and date combination.

However, we can attempt to retrieve data for LaGuardia Airport for the entire month of June from 2011 to 2020 to see if any data is available. Here's a SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(g.year, '-', LPAD(g.mo, 2, '0'), '-', LPAD(g.da, 2, '0')) AS Date,
  g.temp AS Mean_Temperature_F,
  g.wdsp AS Average_Wind_Speed_knots,
  g.prcp AS Total_Precipitation_inches
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS g
JOIN
  (
    SELECT usaf, wban
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
    WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%la guardia%'
  ) AS s
ON
  g.stn = s.usaf AND g.wban = s.wban
WHERE
  g.mo = '06'
  AND CAST(_TABLE_SUFFIX AS INT64) BETWEEN 2011 AND 2020
  AND g.year = _TABLE_SUFFIX
ORDER BY
  g.year, g.da;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Station Matching:**
  - We use a subquery to select the `usaf` and `wban` codes for stations where the name contains 'la guardia' (case-insensitive).
  - We join this subquery with the GSOD data to filter for LaGuardia Airport.

- **Date Filtering:**
  - We set `g.mo = '06'` to select data for the month of June.
  - We remove the day filter to include all days in June, since data for June 12th may not be available.
  
- **Table Suffix and Year Matching:**
  - We cast `_TABLE_SUFFIX` to `INT64` to compare it numerically in the `BETWEEN` clause.
  - We ensure that `g.year = _TABLE_SUFFIX` to match the year in the data with the table suffix (year).

- **Ordering:**
  - We order the results by `g.year` and `g.da` (day) to see the data chronologically.

**Note:**

- If this query returns data, it confirms that some data is available for LaGuardia Airport in June for the years 2011 to 2020.
- If it still returns no data, it suggests that the dataset does not contain data for LaGuardia Airport for the specified period.
- In that case, you might consider querying data for nearby stations such as John F. Kennedy International Airport or Central Park.

**Alternative for a Nearby Station (John F. Kennedy International Airport):**

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(g.year, '-', LPAD(g.mo, 2, '0'), '-', LPAD(g.da, 2, '0')) AS Date,
  g.temp AS Mean_Temperature_F,
  g.wdsp AS Average_Wind_Speed_knots,
  g.prcp AS Total_Precipitation_inches
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS g
JOIN
  (
    SELECT usaf, wban
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
    WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%john f kennedy%'
  ) AS s
ON
  g.stn = s.usaf AND g.wban = s.wban
WHERE
  g.mo = '06'
  AND g.da = '12'
  AND CAST(_TABLE_SUFFIX AS INT64) BETWEEN 2011 AND 2020
  AND g.year = _TABLE_SUFFIX
ORDER BY
  g.year;
```

**Explanation:**

- We adjusted the station name to 'john f kennedy' to fetch data for JFK Airport.
- We retained the filter for June 12th to match your original date of interest.

**Final Remarks:**

- Data availability can vary based on the station and date.
- Ensure that the station codes (`usaf` and `wban`) correspond to the desired location in the GSOD dataset.
- If you're unable to retrieve data for a specific station and date, consider expanding your search to other nearby stations or dates.
