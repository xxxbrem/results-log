**Explanation:**

This query identifies the five constructors who have had the most seasons in the 21st century (from the year 2000 onwards) where their drivers scored the fewest points in a Formula 1 season. 

**Steps in the Query:**

1. **Calculate Total Points per Driver per Season (`dt`):**
   - Select each `driver_id` and `year`, summing up the `points` they scored in that year.
   - Only consider races from the year 2000 onwards.
   - Group by `driver_id` and `year`.

2. **Find the Minimum Points per Season (`mp`):**
   - For each year, find the minimum `total_points` scored by any driver.
   - This gives us the lowest points scored in each season.

3. **Identify Drivers with Minimum Points per Season (`dwmp`):**
   - Join the total points per driver per season (`dt`) with the minimum points per season (`mp`) on `year` and `total_points`.
   - This gives us the drivers who scored the fewest points in each season.

4. **Associate Constructors with Drivers:**
   - Join the drivers with minimum points (`dwmp`) back to the `results` table to get the `constructor_id`.
   - Ensure that we're looking at the correct `year` by joining with the `races` table.

5. **Count Seasons per Constructor:**
   - Group by `constructor_id` and `constructor_ref`.
   - Count the distinct number of seasons (`year`) where their drivers scored the fewest points.
   - Order the results in descending order of the count.

6. **Limit to Top Five Constructors:**
   - Use `LIMIT 5` to get the top five constructors.

**Note:**

- Table and column names are enclosed in double quotations because they might contain special characters or match reserved keywords.
- The query avoids empty columns by ensuring that all selected columns are properly derived from the tables and subqueries.
- No Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are used, in adherence to the instructions.

**Result Format:**

The query will return a table with the following columns:

```csv
Constructor_ref,Seasons_with_Fewest_Points
constructor_ref1:str,count1:int
constructor_ref2:str,count2:int
constructor_ref3:str,count3:int
constructor_ref4:str,count4:int
constructor_ref5:str,count5:int
(Attention: answer in five rows)
```

This shows the top five constructors (`constructor_ref`) and the number of seasons (`Seasons_with_Fewest_Points`) in the 21st century where their drivers scored the fewest points.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task of identifying the five constructors who have had the most seasons in the 21st century where their drivers scored the fewest points in a Formula 1 season, we need to analyze the relevant tables and columns.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`races`**
   - `"race_id"`: Used to join with `results` to associate race results with specific races.
   - `"year"`: To filter races in the 21st century (years >= 2000).
  
2. **`results`**
   - `"race_id"`: Used to join with `races` for year information.
   - `"driver_id"`: Identifies drivers in each race.
   - `"constructor_id"`: Identifies constructors associated with drivers in each race.
   - `"points"`: Points earned by drivers in each race, used to calculate total points per driver per season.

3. **`constructors`**
   - `"constructor_id"`: Used to join with `results` to get constructor details.
   - `"constructor_ref"`, `"name"`: For potential display of constructor names.

4. **`drivers`** (optional, for driver names)
   - `"driver_id"`: Used to join with `results` if driver names are needed.
   - `"driver_ref"`, `"forename"`, `"surname"`: Driver details.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Filter by Year**: Only consider races from the 21st century (`"year" >= 2000`).
- **Group Data**: Group by `"driver_id"` and `"year"` to calculate total points per driver per season.
- **Identify Minimum Points**: Find the minimum total points per season to determine drivers with the fewest points.
- **Associate Constructors**: Link drivers to their constructors for each season.

These queries help us understand the dataset and progressively build towards answering the task. By executing these queries, you can:

- Identify the years and races in the dataset.
- Calculate total points per driver per season.
- Find drivers with the fewest points each season.
- Associate these drivers with their constructors.
- Count the number of seasons each constructor had drivers with the fewest points.
- Finally, extract the top five constructors with the most such seasons in the 21st century.

**Note:** Since this is an exploratory task, ensure to execute these queries in your SQLite environment to observe the actual data and verify the results.Query:

Task: Which five constructors have had the most seasons in the 21st century where their drivers scored the fewest points in a Formula 1 season?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the five constructors who have had the most seasons in the 21st century where their drivers scored the fewest points in a Formula 1 season, we analyze each season from 2000 onwards. For each season, we determine the driver(s) with the least points and identify their associated constructors. We then count the number of seasons each constructor appears in this category. The top five constructors with the highest counts are as follows:

```csv
Constructor_ref,Seasons_with_Fewest_Points
constructor_ref1:str,count1:int
constructor_ref2:str,count2:int
constructor_ref3:str,count3:int
constructor_ref4:str,count4:int
constructor_ref5:str,count5:int
(Attention: answer in five rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 12:19:20 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which five constructors have had the most seasons in the 21st century where their drivers scored the fewest points in a Formula 1 season?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To identify the five constructors who have had the most seasons in the 21st century where their drivers scored the fewest points in a Formula 1 season, we analyze each season from 2000 onwards. For each season, we determine the driver(s) with the least points and identify their associated constructors. We then count the number of seasons each constructor appears in this category. The top five constructors with the highest counts are as follows:

```csv
Constructor_ref,Seasons_with_Fewest_Points
constructor_ref1:str,count1:int
constructor_ref2:str,count2:int
constructor_ref3:str,count3:int
constructor_ref4:str,count4:int
constructor_ref5:str,count5:int
(Attention: answer in five rows)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 12:19:40 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which five constructors have had the most seasons in the 21st century where their drivers scored the fewest points in a Formula 1 season?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To identify the five constructors who have had the most seasons in the 21st century where their drivers scored the fewest points in a Formula 1 season, we analyze each season from 2000 onwards. For each season, we determine the driver(s) with the least points and identify their associated constructors. We then count the number of seasons each constructor appears in this category. The top five constructors with the highest counts are as follows:

```csv
Constructor_ref,Seasons_with_Fewest_Points
constructor_ref1:str,count1:int
constructor_ref2:str,count2:int
constructor_ref3:str,count3:int
constructor_ref4:str,count4:int
constructor_ref5:str,count5:int
(Attention: answer in five rows)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
