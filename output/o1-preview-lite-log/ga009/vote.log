After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for calculating the average number of engaged sessions per user in December 2020.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Avoiding the Cartesian Product Issue in `1result.sql`:**
   - In **`1result.sql`**, the query performs two `UNNEST` operations directly in the `FROM` clause:
     ```sql
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*`,
       UNNEST(`event_params`) AS ep_session_id,
       UNNEST(`event_params`) AS ep_session_engaged
     ```
   - This approach can create a **Cartesian product** between `ep_session_id` and `ep_session_engaged`. For each event, if `event_params` contains multiple keys, the combination of all possible pairs of parameters can lead to **overcounting** of sessions. This means the same session might be counted multiple times if the event has multiple parameters.

2. **Use of Scalar Subqueries in `2result.sql`:**
   - In **`2result.sql`**, the query extracts `ga_session_id` and `session_engaged` using **scalar subqueries**:
     ```sql
     SELECT
       user_pseudo_id,
       (SELECT value.int_value FROM UNNEST(event_params) WHERE key = 'ga_session_id') AS ga_session_id,
       (SELECT value.int_value FROM UNNEST(event_params) WHERE key = 'session_engaged') AS session_engaged
     ```
   - This method ensures that each parameter is extracted **independently** for each event without causing unintended duplication of rows. It retrieves the specific values needed without combining all possible pairs of event parameters.

3. **Accurate Counting of Engaged Sessions:**
   - By correctly associating each `session_engaged` flag with its corresponding `ga_session_id`, **`2result.sql`** accurately counts the number of unique engaged sessions per user.
   - The condition `session_engaged = 1` ensures only engaged sessions are counted, and grouping by `user_pseudo_id` provides the total engaged sessions per user.

4. **Reliable Aggregation:**
   - The calculation of the average in **`2result.sql`** is based on reliable counts, leading to a more accurate average number of engaged sessions per user.

5. **Consistent and Precise Results:**
   - While both queries produce similar numerical results, the methodology in **`2result.sql`** is more robust and less prone to errors associated with data duplication.
