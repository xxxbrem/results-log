After comparing both SQL queries, **`1result.sql`** is the correct query. This query accurately uses the columns `ecommerce.tax_value_in_usd` and `ecommerce.purchase_revenue_in_usd` to calculate the tax rate per item category and retrieves the transaction details accordingly. Using these columns ensures that all monetary values are consistently in USD, which is crucial for accurate tax rate calculations and comparisons. The query also properly filters out any null or non-positive values, leading to precise and reliable results.
