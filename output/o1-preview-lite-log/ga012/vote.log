After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Date Filtering:** The task specifies to find transactions **on November 30, 2020**. The query in `1result.sql` includes `event_date = '20201130'` in both the subquery and the main query, ensuring that only events from that specific date are considered.
- **Proper Aggregation:** In `1result.sql`, the tax rate is calculated for each `item_category` based on the data from November 30, 2020, which aligns with the task's requirement.
- **Data Consistency:** By filtering on the event date, `1result.sql` avoids including transactions from other dates, which could lead to incorrect identification of the item category with the highest tax rate for the specified date.
- **Correct Outcome:** The results obtained from `1result.sql` accurately represent the transactions, total item quantities, and purchase revenues for the item category with the highest tax rate on November 30, 2020.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**
