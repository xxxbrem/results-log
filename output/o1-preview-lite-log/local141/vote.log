After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL for the task. Here's the reasoning:

### **Comparison of the Two SQL Queries:**

1. **`0result.sql`:**

   - **Methodology:**
     - **Subquery `ts` (Total Sales):**
       - Calculates total sales (`TotalSales`) per salesperson per year by summing `TotalDue` from `salesorderheader`.
       - Groups data by `SalesPersonID` and extracted year from `OrderDate`.
     - **Subquery `tq` (Total Quota):**
       - Calculates total sales quota (`TotalQuota`) per salesperson per year by summing `SalesQuota` from `SalesPersonQuotaHistory`.
       - Groups data by `BusinessEntityID` (renamed to `SalesPersonID`) and extracted year from `QuotaDate`.
     - **Main Query:**
       - Joins `ts` and `tq` on `SalesPersonID` and `Year`.
       - Calculates the difference between `TotalSales` and `TotalQuota`.

   - **Advantages:**
     - Performs aggregation **before** joining the data, preventing duplication of records.
     - Ensures accurate summation of sales and quotas per salesperson per year.
     - Avoids inflating totals due to multiple quota records per salesperson per year.

2. **`2result.sql`:**

   - **Methodology:**
     - Joins `salesorderheader` (`soh`) and `SalesPersonQuotaHistory` (`spqh`) on `salespersonid` and year extracted from `orderdate` and `QuotaDate`.
     - Calculates total sales and total quotas by summing `TotalDue` and `SalesQuota`.
     - Groups data by `salespersonid` and year.

   - **Disadvantages:**
     - Performs the join **before** aggregation, which leads to record multiplication.
     - If a salesperson has multiple quota records in a year, each sales order is duplicated for each quota record during the join.
     - Results in inflated totals for both `TotalSales` and `SalesQuota`.
     - Calculates incorrect differences due to the overcounting.

### **Reason for Choosing `0result.sql`:**

- **Accurate Aggregation:**
  - By aggregating the data in subqueries before joining, `0result.sql` ensures that each salesperson's total sales and total quotas are calculated correctly for each year.
- **Avoids Duplication:**
  - Prevents the multiplication of records that occurs when joining data with multiple matches before aggregation.
- **Correct Difference Calculation:**
  - Provides the accurate difference between total sales and quotas without the distortion caused by overcounting.
- **Consistency in Data:**
  - The totals in `0result.csv` align with the expected values based on individual sales and quotas.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

0result.sql
