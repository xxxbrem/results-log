After reviewing both SQL queries, I recommend using `0result.sql`. This query clearly separates the calculations for the average Anosmia search frequencies in 2019 and 2020 into two distinct subqueries. It uses `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM DATE(`date`))` to filter the data by year, which is precise and handles date extraction effectively. Additionally, by using `SAFE_CAST`, it ensures that any potential casting errors are handled gracefully. This approach makes the query more readable and less prone to errors compared to combining the averages in a single SELECT statement with CASE conditions.
