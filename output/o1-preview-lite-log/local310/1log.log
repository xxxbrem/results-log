**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **races**

   - `"race_id"`: Identifier for each race.
   - `"year"`: The year the race took place.
   - *Potential usage*: To link race results to specific years and find the last race of each year.

2. **driver_standings**

   - `"race_id"`: Identifier for the race.
   - `"driver_id"`: Identifier for the driver.
   - `"points"`: Cumulative points of the driver after that race.
   - *Potential usage*: To find the highest driver points in each year.

3. **constructor_standings**

   - `"race_id"`: Identifier for the race.
   - `"constructor_id"`: Identifier for the constructor.
   - `"points"`: Cumulative points of the constructor after that race.
   - *Potential usage*: To find the highest constructor points in each year.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Match the `"race_id"` in standings tables with the `"race_id"` in the races table to get the corresponding year.
- Identify the last race of each year to get the final cumulative points.
- Use aggregate functions like `MAX` to find the highest points.
- Sum the highest driver points and constructor points for each year.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Get all distinct years from the races table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year" FROM "races" ORDER BY "year" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find the number of races held each year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "year", COUNT(*) AS "race_count"
   FROM "races"
   GROUP BY "year"
   ORDER BY "year" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all race IDs and names for the year 2020:**

   ```sql

   FROM "races"
   GROUP BY "year"
   ORDER BY "year" LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get driver standings for the last race of 2019:**

   ```sql
   SELECT ds.*
   FROM "driver_standings" ds
   JOIN "races" r ON ds."race_id" = r."race_id"
   WHERE r."year" = 2019 AND ds."race_id" = (
     SELECT MAX("race_id") FROM "races" WHERE "year" = 2019
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Get constructor standings for the last race of 2019:**

   ```sql
   SELECT cs.*
   FROM "constructor_standings" cs
   JOIN "races" r ON cs."race_id" = r."race_id"
   WHERE r."year" = 2019 AND cs."race_id" = (
     SELECT MAX("race_id") FROM "races" WHERE "year" = 2019
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find the highest driver points for each year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT r."year", MAX(ds."points") AS "max_driver_points"
   FROM "driver_standings" ds
   JOIN "races" r ON ds."race_id" = r."race_id"
   WHERE ds."race_id" IN (
     SELECT MAX("race_id") FROM "races" GROUP BY "year"
   )
   GROUP BY r."year"
   ORDER BY r."year" LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find the highest constructor points for each year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT r."year", MAX(cs."points") AS "max_constructor_points"
   FROM "constructor_standings" cs
   JOIN "races" r ON cs."race_id" = r."race_id"
   WHERE cs."race_id" IN (
     SELECT MAX("race_id") FROM "races" GROUP BY "year"
   )
   GROUP BY r."year"
   ORDER BY r."year" LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate the sum of the highest driver and constructor points for each year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT d."year",
          d."max_driver_points",
          c."max_constructor_points",
          (d."max_driver_points" + c."max_constructor_points") AS "total_points"
   FROM (
     SELECT r."year", MAX(ds."points") AS "max_driver_points"
     FROM "driver_standings" ds
     JOIN "races" r ON ds."race_id" = r."race_id"
     WHERE ds."race_id" IN (
       SELECT MAX("race_id") FROM "races" GROUP BY "year"
     )
     GROUP BY r."year"
   ) d
   JOIN (
     SELECT r."year", MAX(cs."points") AS "max_constructor_points"
     FROM "constructor_standings" cs
     JOIN "races" r ON cs."race_id" = r."race_id"
     WHERE cs."race_id" IN (
       SELECT MAX("race_id") FROM "races" GROUP BY "year"
     )
     GROUP BY r."year"
   ) c ON d."year" = c."year"
   ORDER BY d."year" LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List the three years with the lowest sum of highest driver and constructor points:**

    ```sql
    SELECT d."year",
           (d."max_driver_points" + c."max_constructor_points") AS "total_points"
    FROM (
      SELECT r."year", MAX(ds."points") AS "max_driver_points"
      FROM "driver_standings" ds
      JOIN "races" r ON ds."race_id" = r."race_id"
      WHERE ds."race_id" IN (
        SELECT MAX("race_id") FROM "races" GROUP BY "year"
      )
      GROUP BY r."year"
    ) d
    JOIN (
      SELECT r."year", MAX(cs."points") AS "max_constructor_points"
      FROM "constructor_standings" cs
      JOIN "races" r ON cs."race_id" = r."race_id"
      WHERE cs."race_id" IN (
        SELECT MAX("race_id") FROM "races" GROUP BY "year"
      )
      GROUP BY r."year"
    ) c ON d."year" = c."year"
    ORDER BY "total_points" ASC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

11. **List all driver IDs and their maximum points for each year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT r."year", ds."driver_id", MAX(ds."points") AS "driver_points"
    FROM "driver_standings" ds
    JOIN "races" r ON ds."race_id" = r."race_id"
    WHERE ds."race_id" IN (
      SELECT MAX("race_id") FROM "races" GROUP BY "year"
    )
    GROUP BY r."year", ds."driver_id"
    ORDER BY r."year", "driver_points" DESC LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **List all constructor IDs and their maximum points for each year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT r."year", cs."constructor_id", MAX(cs."points") AS "constructor_points"
    FROM "constructor_standings" cs
    JOIN "races" r ON cs."race_id" = r."race_id"
    WHERE cs."race_id" IN (
      SELECT MAX("race_id") FROM "races" GROUP BY "year"
    )
    GROUP BY r."year", cs."constructor_id"
    ORDER BY r."year", "constructor_points" DESC LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: List the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Sum_of_Highest_Points
year1:int,sum1:float
year2:int,sum2:float
year3:int,sum3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

These are the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-28 04:39:22 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing List the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Sum_of_Highest_Points
year1:int,sum1:float
year2:int,sum2:float
year3:int,sum3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

These are the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
