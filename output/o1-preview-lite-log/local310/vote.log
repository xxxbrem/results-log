After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for the following reasons:

1. **Accurate Identification of the Last Race:**
   - **`0result.sql`** determines the last race of each year by selecting the race with the maximum `"round"` number per `"year"`, which accurately represents the final race of the season.
   - The use of `"round"` ensures that we're considering the chronological order of races within each year.

2. **Correct Calculation of Cumulative Points:**
   - By focusing on the last race, the query captures the cumulative points of drivers and constructors at the end of the season.
   - This approach aligns with the task requirement to find the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor in each year at the season's conclusion.

3. **Avoids Potential Issues with `race_id`:**
   - **`1result.sql`** uses `MAX("race_id")` to identify the last race of the year, which may not accurately reflect the final race, as `"race_id"` is a unique identifier but doesn't guarantee chronological order within a year.
   - **`0result.sql`** avoids this issue by using `"round"` instead.

4. **Considers Cumulative Totals:**
   - **`2result.sql`** calculates the maximum points achieved at any point during the year, which might not represent the cumulative totals at the season's end.
   - **`0result.sql`** ensures that the cumulative totals are taken from the last race, providing an accurate measure of the highest points achieved.

Therefore, the correct SQL query that meets the task requirements is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
