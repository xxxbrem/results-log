After comparing both SQL scripts, I recommend using **1result.sql**. Here's why:

- **Efficiency**: `1result.sql` selects only the necessary columns (`event_date`, `event_name`, `user_pseudo_id`) from the tables. This reduces data processing and can lead to better query performance.
  
- **Clarity**: By selecting only the relevant columns, the query is more focused and easier to understand. It avoids unnecessary data that isn't used in the calculations.

- **Functionality**: Both scripts produce the same results, but `1result.sql` does so with a more streamlined approach.

Therefore, the preferred SQL script is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
