After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL for the task.

**Reason:**

1. **Accurate Date Filtering:**
   - In `1result.sql`, the date comparison uses `DATE(creation_date) BETWEEN '2019-07-01' AND '2019-12-31'`, which correctly filters all posts within the entire days of the specified date range.
   - In `0result.sql`, the date comparison is `creation_date BETWEEN '2019-07-01' AND '2019-12-31'`, which may exclude posts made on `'2019-12-31'` after midnight, as it compares timestamps directly to date strings without truncating the time component.

2. **Consistent Column Alignment:**
   - `1result.sql` selects columns in the order `(user_id, creation_date, tags)` in all subqueries, ensuring the `creation_date` is correctly referenced in the `WHERE` clause.
   - In `0result.sql`, the columns are ordered differently, which could lead to misalignment and incorrect filtering.

3. **Comprehensive Results:**
   - The results from `1result.sql` include entries that match the task requirements more accurately, providing the correct user IDs and associated tags for comments, answers, and questions within the specified parameters.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

1result.sql
