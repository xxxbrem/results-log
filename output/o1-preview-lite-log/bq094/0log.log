**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.fec.committee_2016`
   - **`cmte_id`**: Committee ID - used to uniquely identify committees.
   - **`cmte_nm`**: Committee name - used to obtain the names of committees.
   
2. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_2016`
   - **`cand_id`**: Candidate ID - used to uniquely identify candidates.
   - **`cand_name`**: Candidate name - used to obtain the names of candidates.
   
3. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_committee_2016`
   - **`cmte_id`**: Committee ID - links committees to the candidates they support.
   - **`cand_id`**: Candidate ID - links candidates to the committees that support them.
   
4. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016`
   - **`cmte_id`**: Committee ID - indicates which committee received the donation.
   - **`transaction_amt`**: Transaction amount - used to filter small-dollar donations (under $200).
   - **`transaction_dt`**: Transaction date - used to confirm the donation date (year 2016).

**Potential Conditions:**

- **Donation Amount Condition:** `transaction_amt > 0 AND transaction_amt < 200` - to select donations over $0 and under $200.
- **Year Condition (if needed):** Ensure donations are from the year 2016, though the table `individuals_2016` should already contain data for 2016.
- **Committee Support Condition:** Committees that support candidates, identified via `candidate_committee_2016`.

These queries range from simple data retrieval to more complex aggregations and joins, which help in understanding the data and forming the final result required by the task.

---

**Note:** The final desired output would be obtained from query number 10, which aggregates the necessary information:

- **Committee Name**
- **Number of Supported Candidates**
- **Supported Candidates** (in alphabetical order, separated by commas)
- **Total Small-Dollar Donations**

This query joins the necessary tables and applies the conditions specified in the task.Query:

Task: Please display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,supported_candidates,total_small_dollar_donations
committee_name1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidate_names1:str,total_donations1:float
committee_name2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidate_names2:str,total_donations2:float
...
```

Here is a table listing committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, the table includes the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total amount of small-dollar donations received..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

committee_name1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidate_names1:str,total_donations1:float
committee_name2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidate_names2:str,total_donations2:float
...
```

Here is a table listing committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, the table includes the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total amount of small-dollar donations received. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
