The SQL query in `1result.sql` is the correct choice because it accurately calculates the median total sales while properly handling both even and odd numbers of countries. Here's why:

**Explanation:**

1. **General Approach:**
   - The query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into manageable parts.
   - It first calculates the total sales per country for countries with more than 4 customers.
   - Then, it ranks these total sales amounts in ascending order.
   - It determines the median position(s) based on whether the count of countries is even or odd.
   - Finally, it calculates the average of the median value(s), which yields the median total sales.

2. **Handling Even and Odd Counts:**
   - The query accounts for both scenarios:
     - **Even Count:** Takes the average of the two middle numbers.
     - **Odd Count:** Selects the middle number.
   - This ensures accuracy regardless of the number of countries that meet the criteria.

3. **Robustness:**
   - The query is scalable and will work correctly even if the data changes (e.g., if more countries qualify in the future).
   - It doesn't rely on fixed offsets or limits that are hard-coded for a specific dataset.

4. **Clarity:**
   - The use of CTEs enhances readability and makes the logic clear.
   - It explicitly shows each step, making it easier to understand and maintain.

**In contrast**, the query in `0result.sql` uses a simplified approach that may not handle all cases correctly:

- It relies on `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` to select the two middle values, which works with the current dataset but could fail if the number of countries changes.
- It lacks the logic to determine whether the count is even or odd, which is essential for accurately computing the median.

**Therefore, `1result.sql` is the correct and more reliable choice.**
