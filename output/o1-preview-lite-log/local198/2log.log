Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **customers**
    - `CustomerId`: To join with the `invoices` table.
    - `Country`: To identify the country of each customer.
    - **Potential Usage**: Count the number of customers per country.
    - **Conditions**: Countries where the number of customers are greater than 4.

2. **invoices**
    - `InvoiceId`: Unique identifier for each invoice.
    - `CustomerId`: To associate invoices with customers.
    - `Total`: Total sales amount of each invoice.
    - **Potential Usage**: Sum of `Total` to calculate total sales per country.
    - **Conditions**: Join with `customers` table on `CustomerId`.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Grouping**: Group records by `Country` to aggregate data.
- **Filtering**: Use `HAVING` clause to filter countries with more than 4 customers.
- **Joining Tables**: Inner join between `customers` and `invoices` on `CustomerId`.
- **Aggregation Functions**: Use `COUNT()` and `SUM()` to calculate counts and totals.
- **Ordering**: Order results to assist in median calculation.
- **Limit Results**: Use `LIMIT` to restrict the number of rows returned for inspection.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all distinct countries from customers:**

   SELECT DISTINCT "Country" FROM "customers" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the number of customers in each country:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Country", COUNT(*) AS "NumCustomers"
   FROM "customers"
   GROUP BY "Country"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find countries with more than 4 customers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Country", COUNT(*) AS "NumCustomers"
   FROM "customers"
   GROUP BY "Country"
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 4
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List customer IDs and their countries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "CustomerId", "FirstName", "LastName", "Country"
   FROM "customers"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List invoices with their total amounts:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceId", "CustomerId", "Total"
   FROM "invoices"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join invoices with customers to get country and total:**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."InvoiceId", i."Total", c."Country"
   FROM "invoices" i
   JOIN "customers" c ON i."CustomerId" = c."CustomerId"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate total sales per country:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."Country", SUM(i."Total") AS "TotalSales"
   FROM "customers" c
   JOIN "invoices" i ON c."CustomerId" = i."CustomerId"
   GROUP BY c."Country"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find total sales per country where the number of customers is greater than 4:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."Country", COUNT(c."CustomerId") AS "NumCustomers", SUM(i."Total") AS "TotalSales"
   FROM "customers" c
   JOIN "invoices" i ON c."CustomerId" = i."CustomerId"
   GROUP BY c."Country"
   HAVING COUNT(c."CustomerId") > 4
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Order total sales per country descending:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."Country", SUM(i."Total") AS "TotalSales"
   FROM "customers" c
   JOIN "invoices" i ON c."CustomerId" = i."CustomerId"
   GROUP BY c."Country"
   HAVING COUNT(c."CustomerId") > 4
   ORDER BY "TotalSales" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve total sales values for median calculation:**

    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(i."Total") AS "TotalSales"
    FROM "customers" c
    JOIN "invoices" i ON c."CustomerId" = i."CustomerId"
    GROUP BY c."Country"
    HAVING COUNT(c."CustomerId") > 4
    ORDER BY "TotalSales" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Final Answer:**

```csv
Median_Total_Sales
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

To determine the median value of total sales made in countries where the number of customers is greater than 4, we perform the following steps:

1. **Identify the Countries:**
   - Use the `customers` table to count the number of customers per country.
   - Select countries where the customer count exceeds 4.

2. **Calculate Total Sales per Country:**
   - Join the `customers` and `invoices` tables on `CustomerId`.
   - Sum the `Total` sales from the `invoices` table for each country identified.

3. **Extract Total Sales Values:**
   - Collect the `TotalSales` amounts for these countries.

4. **Compute the Median:**
   - Arrange the `TotalSales` values in ascending order.
   - Calculate the median value from this list.

**Note:** Since the actual data values are not provided, the exact numerical value of the median cannot be computed here. However, the process described will yield the median total sales value when executed against the dataset.Query:

Task: Using the sales data, what is the median value of total sales made in countries where the number of customers is greater than 4?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Median_Total_Sales
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the median value of total sales made in countries where the number of customers is greater than 4, we need to:

1. **Identify Countries with More Than 4 Customers**: Query the `customers` table to find countries having more than 4 customers.

2. **Calculate Total Sales per Country**: For each of these countries, sum the `Total` from the `invoices` table for invoices associated with customers in that country.

3. **Compute the Median**: Collect the total sales figures for all qualifying countries and calculate the median value among them..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2. **Calculate Total Sales per Country**: For each of these countries, sum the `Total` from the `invoices` table for invoices associated with customers in that country.

3. **Compute the Median**: Collect the total sales figures for all qualifying countries and calculate the median value among them. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
