After comparing the SQL scripts and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Task Requirement:** Calculate the average payment value, city, and state for the top 3 customers with the most delivered orders.
  
- **Identification of Top Customers:**
  - According to the data, the top 3 customers with the highest number of delivered orders are:
    1. Customer ID: `9a736b248f67d166d2fbb006bcb877c3` with **33** delivered orders.
    2. Customer ID: `569aa12b73b5f7edeaa6f2a01603e381` with **26** delivered orders.
    3. Customer ID: `f9ae226291893fda10af7965268fb7f6` with **23** delivered orders.
  
- **Analysis of SQL Scripts:**
  - **`1result.sql`** correctly:
    - Aggregates orders by `customer_unique_id` to count delivered orders.
    - Orders the customers by the number of delivered orders in descending order.
    - Limits the result to the top 3 customers.
    - Calculates the average payment value per customer.
    - Retrieves the `customer_city` and `customer_state`.
  - The results in **`1result.csv`** match the expected top 3 customers and provide the required information.
  
- **Comparison with Other Scripts:**
  - **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** do not select the top 3 customers based solely on the highest number of delivered orders. They seem to include customers with fewer delivered orders due to grouping by additional fields, which splits the data and affects the counts.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
