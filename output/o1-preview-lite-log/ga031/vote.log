After carefully analyzing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that accurately answers the task.

**Reasoning:**

- **Understanding the Task:**

  The task is to compute the **user session conversion rate** on January 2nd, 2021, defined as:

  > **Conversion Rate** = (Number of sessions that **started on the Home page** and also visited the **Checkout Confirmation** page) **divided by** (Total number of sessions that **started on the Home page**) Ã— 100%

- **Comparison of SQL Queries:**

  1. **`0result.sql`**:

     - **Denominator (`home_sessions`):** Counts all sessions where the 'Home' page was viewed **at any point** during the session.
     - **Numerator (`converted_sessions`):** Counts sessions where both 'Home' and 'Checkout Confirmation' pages were viewed.
     - **Issue:** Does not consider whether the 'Home' page was the **landing page** (i.e., the first page viewed in the session). This does not align with the task requirement of sessions that **landed on the Home page**.

  2. **`1result.sql`**:

     - **Denominator (`sessions_started_with_home`):** Counts sessions where the **first page viewed** was the 'Home' page. This correctly identifies sessions that **landed on the Home page**.
     - **Numerator:** From these sessions, it counts those that also visited the 'Checkout Confirmation' page.
     - **Conversion Rate Calculation:** Uses the correct formula based on the task definition.
     - **Result:** Yields a conversion rate of **1.1457%**, which is consistent with the expected calculation.

  3. **`2result.sql`**:

     - **Denominator (`sessions_home`):** Counts all sessions where the 'Home' page was viewed **at any point** during the session.
     - **Numerator:** Counts sessions from the above where 'Checkout Confirmation' was also viewed.
     - **Issue:** Similar to `0result.sql`, it does not ensure that the 'Home' page was the **landing page**, thus not meeting the task requirement.

- **Conclusion:**

  - Only **`1result.sql`** correctly filters sessions that **started** with the 'Home' page, aligning with the definition of sessions that **landed** on the 'Home' page.
  - It accurately computes the conversion rate as per the task's specification.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

1result.sql
