After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **2result.sql** is the correct answer.

---

**Reasoning:**

1. **Initial Cohort Definition:**

   - **1result.sql** includes users whose `user_first_touch_timestamp` is between **July 2, 2018** and **July 9, 2018** (inclusive):

     ```sql
     AND user_first_touch_timestamp BETWEEN UNIX_MICROS(TIMESTAMP '2018-07-02') AND UNIX_MICROS(TIMESTAMP '2018-07-09')
     ```

   - **2result.sql** includes users whose `user_first_touch_timestamp` falls between **July 2, 2018** and **July 8, 2018** (inclusive):

     ```sql
     AND DATE(TIMESTAMP_MICROS(`user_first_touch_timestamp`)) BETWEEN '2018-07-02' AND '2018-07-08'
     ```

   - **Explanation:** Since the week starting on **July 2, 2018**, ends on **July 8, 2018**, the correct date range for the initial cohort should be **July 2 to July 8, 2018**. Including **July 9, 2018** (as in **1result.sql**) would incorrectly include users who first used the app on the next week, which is outside the specified time frame.

2. **Week Mapping for Retention Analysis:**

   - **1result.sql** uses `_TABLE_SUFFIX` to map events to weeks:

     ```sql
     CASE
       WHEN _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20180702' AND '20180708' THEN 'Week0'
       WHEN _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20180709' AND '20180715' THEN 'Week1'
       -- and so on
     ```

   - **2result.sql** uses `event_date` to map events to weeks:

     ```sql
     CASE
       WHEN `event_date` BETWEEN '20180702' AND '20180708' THEN 'Week0'
       WHEN `event_date` BETWEEN '20180709' AND '20180715' THEN 'Week1'
       -- and so on
     ```

   - **Explanation:** Using `event_date` is preferable because it represents the actual date on which the event occurred, as recorded in the data. While `_TABLE_SUFFIX` refers to the date partition of the table, discrepancies can occur if events are delayed or if data processing varies. Therefore, `event_date` provides a more accurate mapping for retention analysis.

3. **Accurate Cohort and Retention Counts:**

   - In **2result.sql**, the initial cohort and subsequent retention counts are accurately calculated based on the correct date ranges.
   - This ensures that we only consider users who first used the app during **Week 0** (July 2-8, 2018) and accurately track their retention in the following weeks.

4. **Alignment with Task Requirements:**

   - The task specifies performing a 7-day retention analysis for users who first used the app during the week starting on **July 2, 2018**, which ends on **July 8, 2018**.
   - **2result.sql** adheres to these requirements by using the correct date ranges and accurately mapping events to the respective weeks.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above reasoning, **2result.sql** is the correct SQL query that fulfills the task requirements accurately.
