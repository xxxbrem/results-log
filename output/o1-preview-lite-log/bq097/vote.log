After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Region Matching**: `1result.sql` joins the 2012 and 2017 data using the **`GeoFIPS`** code, which uniquely identifies each geographic region. This ensures that the matching of regions is precise, avoiding any potential issues that might arise from inconsistencies in the `GeoName` field when joining on `GeoName`.

- **Proper Filtering of Massachusetts Regions**: The query filters regions using **`GeoName LIKE '%, MA'`**, which accurately selects regions ending with ', MA'. This approach effectively captures all geographic regions in Massachusetts while excluding other regions like "Alabama" or "Oklahoma" that could erroneously match when using **`GeoName LIKE '%MA'`**.

- **Consistent Results**: The output from `1result.sql` matches the expected increases in average earnings per job for each Massachusetts region between 2012 and 2017.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** provides the most accurate and reliable calculation for the given task.
