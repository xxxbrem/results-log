After comparing the two SQL queries, I have determined that **1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasons:**

- **Filtering Contributions from Brooklyn, NY:** The query in **1result.sql** includes a `WHERE` clause that filters the Federal Election Commission (FEC) data to only include contributions from Brooklyn, NY:

  ```sql
  WHERE
    i.state = 'NY'
    AND LOWER(i.city) LIKE '%brooklyn%'
    AND i.transaction_amt > 0
    AND h.residential_ratio > 0
  ```

  This ensures that only relevant contributions are considered, accurately reflecting the average political donation amounts for census tracts in Kings County.

- **Using `residential_ratio` for Weighting:** The query uses the `residential_ratio` from the HUD ZIP Code crosswalk to weight the contributions when mapping ZIP codes to census tracts:

  ```sql
  i.transaction_amt * h.residential_ratio AS weighted_donation
  ```

  This weighting accounts for the proportion of residential addresses within each ZIP code that fall into a census tract, providing a more precise allocation of donations.

- **Correct Joins and Data Integration:** The query correctly joins the FEC data with the HUD crosswalk and the American Community Survey (ACS) median income data, ensuring that the average donation amounts and median incomes are accurately matched for each census tract in Kings County.

- **Comprehensive Data Aggregation:** By utilizing Common Table Expressions (CTEs), the query systematically aggregates the weighted donations and computes the average donation amounts per census tract, followed by joining with median income data.

In contrast, **0result.sql** does not filter the contributions to only those from Brooklyn, NY, which could include irrelevant data from other locations. Additionally, it uses `total_ratio` instead of `residential_ratio`, which may not appropriately reflect the residential contribution distributions.
