After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that `1result.sql` is the correct SQL for the task.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Retrieval of Target Approved Symbol:**
  - `1result.sql` joins the `knownDrugsAggregated` table with the `targets` table using `k.targetId = t.id`. This ensures that the target's approved symbol is accurately retrieved from the `targets` table, which is the authoritative source for target information.
  - In contrast, `0result.sql` uses the `approvedSymbol` directly from the `knownDrugsAggregated` table (`k.approvedSymbol`). This may not reflect the most current or standardized approved symbols, as changes or updates in the `targets` table would not be reflected.

- **Comprehensive Inclusion of Clinical Trial Links:**
  - Both queries use `STRING_AGG(DISTINCT ..., ', ')` to aggregate clinical trial links. However, `1result.sql` uses a `CROSS JOIN UNNEST` to extract all URLs from the `urls` array, ensuring that all relevant clinical trial links are included.
  - The use of `CROSS JOIN UNNEST(k.urls.list) AS u` in `1result.sql` ensures that each URL is properly un-nested and can be aggregated without missing any entries.

- **Adherence to Best Practices:**
  - Joining with the `targets` table is a best practice to ensure data integrity and accuracy, especially when dealing with standardized identifiers like approved symbols.
  - `1result.sql` aligns with this practice, providing a more reliable and maintainable query.

- **Consistency in Results:**
  - The results from `1result.sql` show that the target approved symbols are consistent with the authoritative data in the `targets` table.
  - This consistency is crucial for downstream analysis or reporting, where accurate target identification is necessary.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**
