After comparing both SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query is the one provided in **2result.sql**. Here's the reasoning:

**Comparison and Reasoning:**

1. **Purpose of the Queries:**
   - Both SQL queries aim to compute the originality score for US patents under the B2 classification granted between 2015 and 2018, based on the diversity of 4-digit IPC codes from their backward citations.

2. **Calculation of Originality Score:**
   - The originality score is defined as:
     \[
     \text{Originality} = 1 - \sum_{k} \left( \frac{n_{ik}}{n_i} \right)^2
     \]
     where:
     - \( n_i \) is the total number of backward citations made by patent \( i \).
     - \( n_{ik} \) is the number of backward citations assigned to IPC code \( k \) by patent \( i \).

3. **Analysis of **0result.sql**:**
   - Counts \( n_i \) as the number of **distinct cited publications**.
   - Counts \( n_{ik} \) as the number of **distinct cited publications** with IPC code \( k \).
   - This approach may underrepresent the influence of patents with multiple IPC codes, as it considers each cited publication only once, regardless of how many IPC codes it covers.

4. **Analysis of **2result.sql**:**
   - Counts \( n_i \) as the **total number of IPC code occurrences** in all backward citations.
   - Counts \( n_{ik} \) as the **number of times IPC code \( k \) appears** in the backward citations.
   - This method acknowledges that a single cited patent may contribute to multiple IPC codes, thus capturing the true diversity of technological fields.

5. **Reason for Choosing **2result.sql**:**
   - The second SQL query aligns better with the standard methodology for calculating the originality score:
     - It takes into account all IPC codes associated with each cited patent.
     - Ensures that patents citing references with multiple IPC codes are appropriately credited for their diversity.
   - By considering the frequency of IPC codes in the citations, it accurately reflects the spread across different technological areas.

6. **Result Consistency:**
   - The patent identified by **2result.sql** (US-10059084-B2) is more likely to have the highest originality score under the correct calculation method.

**Conclusion:**

The SQL query in **2result.sql** correctly calculates the originality score based on the diversity of 4-digit IPC codes from backward citations.
