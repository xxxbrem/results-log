After comparing both SQL queries, **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Calculation of First Touch and Uninstall Timestamps:**
  - **`2result.sql`** uses the `MIN` function to find the earliest `user_first_touch_timestamp` and `event_timestamp` (uninstall timestamp) for each user. This ensures that only the initial app open and the first uninstall event are considered, providing an accurate analysis of users' first experiences with the app.
  - In contrast, **`1result.sql`** selects distinct combinations of `user_pseudo_id` and `user_first_touch_timestamp` without aggregating. This could include multiple first touch timestamps for users who might have reinstalled the app, potentially skewing the results.

- **Proper Alignment of Events within the 7-Day Window:**
  - **`2result.sql`** carefully checks that the uninstall occurred within seven days of the first app open by converting timestamps to intervals and comparing them using the `TIMESTAMP_MICROS` function and `INTERVAL 7 DAY`.
  - It also ensures that crash events are considered only if they occurred between the first app open and the uninstall date, or within seven days, whichever is earlier.

- **Avoids Duplicate Counts:**
  - By grouping and aggregating data, **`2result.sql`** avoids counting the same user multiple times if they have multiple uninstall or crash events.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

2result.sql
