2025-01-26 17:00:16 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to a mismatched quotation mark in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, the closing quotation mark after `'0401` is a backtick (\``) instead of a single quote (`'`), leading to an unclosed string literal.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT cb.`chromosome`, cb.`cytoband_name`, COUNT(*) AS amplifications_count
FROM `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
    ON cc.`RefNo` = cg.`RefNo` AND cc.`CaseNo` = cg.`CaseNo`
JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.CytoBands_hg38` cb
    ON cc.`Chr` = cb.`chromosome`
    AND cc.`Start` >= cb.`hg38_start`
    AND cc.`End` <= cb.`hg38_stop`
WHERE (cg.`Morph` = '3111' OR cg.`Topo` = '0401')
    AND cc.`Type` = 'Amplification'
GROUP BY cb.`chromosome`, cb.`cytoband_name`
ORDER BY cb.`chromosome`, cb.`hg38_start`
LIMIT 100
```

**Explanation:**

- In the original query, the condition `cg.\`Topo\` = '0401\`` has a closing backtick instead of a single quote. This causes a syntax error because the string literal `'0401` is not properly closed.
- Replace the backtick (\``) with a single quote (`'`) to properly close the string literal:

  ```sql
  WHERE (cg.`Morph` = '3111' OR cg.`Topo` = '0401')
  ```

After correcting the quotation mark, the query should run without errors.

---

**Additional Note:**

- Ensure that all string literals are enclosed with single quotes (`'`), and all identifiers (like table names and column names) that require escaping are enclosed with backticks (\``).
- It's good practice to be consistent with quotation marks to avoid such errors.

2025-01-26 17:00:52 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're referencing a column in the `ORDER BY` clause that is neither included in the `SELECT` list nor in the `GROUP BY` clause. Specifically, `cb.hg38_start` is used in the `ORDER BY` but is not part of the grouped columns or the selected output.

In SQL, when you use `GROUP BY`, all columns in the `SELECT` clause must either be aggregated (using functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, etc.) or included in the `GROUP BY` clause. Similarly, columns used in the `ORDER BY` clause must be either:

- Part of the `GROUP BY` clause,
- An aggregate function, or
- A constant value.

Since `cb.hg38_start` is not included in the `GROUP BY` clause or the `SELECT` clause, the query fails.

### **Solution:**

To fix this error, you should include `cb.hg38_start` (and possibly `cb.hg38_stop` if you need the ending base-pair position) in both the `SELECT` clause and the `GROUP BY` clause. This will ensure that the column is recognized when used in the `ORDER BY` clause.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    cb.`chromosome`,
    cb.`cytoband_name`,
    cb.`hg38_start`,
    cb.`hg38_stop`,
    COUNT(*) AS amplifications_count
FROM
    `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
    JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
        ON cc.`RefNo` = cg.`RefNo` AND cc.`CaseNo` = cg.`CaseNo`
    JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.CytoBands_hg38` cb
        ON cc.`Chr` = cb.`chromosome`
        AND cc.`Start` >= cb.`hg38_start`
        AND cc.`End` <= cb.`hg38_stop`
WHERE
    (cg.`Morph` = '3111' OR cg.`Topo` = '0401')
    AND cc.`Type` = 'Amplification'
GROUP BY
    cb.`chromosome`,
    cb.`cytoband_name`,
    cb.`hg38_start`,
    cb.`hg38_stop`
ORDER BY
    cb.`chromosome`,
    cb.`hg38_start`
LIMIT 100
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Added Columns to SELECT Clause:**
  - Included `cb.hg38_start` and `cb.hg38_stop` in the `SELECT` clause to display the starting and ending base-pair positions for each cytoband. This also makes these columns available for grouping and ordering.

- **Updated GROUP BY Clause:**
  - Added `cb.hg38_start` and `cb.hg38_stop` to the `GROUP BY` clause. This is necessary because when you use `GROUP BY`, every non-aggregated column in the `SELECT` clause must be included in the `GROUP BY` clause.

- **ORDER BY Clause:**
  - Now, you can safely use `cb.hg38_start` in the `ORDER BY` clause since it is included in both the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` clauses.

- **Why the Error Occurred:**
  - The error message indicates that `cb.hg38_start` cannot be used in the `ORDER BY` clause because it is neither an aggregate function nor included in the `GROUP BY` clause. SQL requires that all columns referenced in the `ORDER BY` must be in the result set when using `GROUP BY`.

### **Additional Notes:**

- **Sorting Results:**
  - By including `cb.chromosome` and `cb.hg38_start` in the `ORDER BY` clause, the results will be sorted first by chromosome (e.g., `chr1`, `chr2`, ..., `chrX`, `chrY`), and then by the starting base-pair position of each band within each chromosome.

- **Counting Amplifications:**
  - The `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of amplification events per cytoband, as required.

- **Limiting Results:**
  - The `LIMIT 100` clause restricts the output to the first 100 rows. If you need more data, you can adjust or remove this limit.

### **Example Output:**

The corrected query will produce an output similar to:

```csv
chromosome,cytoband_name,hg38_start,hg38_stop,amplifications_count
chr1,p36.33,0,2300000,5
chr1,p36.32,2300000,5300000,3
chr1,p36.31,5300000,7100000,2
...
```

This output shows the number of amplification events (`amplifications_count`) for each cytoband, along with the chromosome, cytoband name, and the start and end positions.

### **Conclusion:**

By including all necessary columns in the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` clauses, you ensure that the SQL query complies with the rules of aggregation and ordering, allowing it to execute without errors.

2025-01-26 17:04:22 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering occurs because the `COUNT` function in SQL accepts only a single argument. When you try to use `COUNT(DISTINCT cc.\`RefNo\`, cc.\`CaseNo\`)`, it results in an error because you're passing two arguments to the `COUNT` function.

### **Cause of the Error:**

- **Error Message:**
  ```
  No matching signature for aggregate function COUNT
  Argument types: INT64, STRING
  Signature: COUNT(T1)
    Signature accepts at most 1 argument, found 2 arguments at [1:19]
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - The `COUNT` function is designed to accept only one argument. When you provide multiple arguments separated by commas, SQL interprets them as separate arguments, which is not allowed.
  - In your query, `cc.\`RefNo\`, cc.\`CaseNo\`` represents two separate columns.

### **Solution:**

To count distinct combinations of multiple columns, you can:

1. **Use the `STRUCT` Function:**
   - The `STRUCT` function creates a single composite value from multiple fields.
   - You can wrap the columns in a `STRUCT` to treat them as a single entity for counting distinct combinations.

2. **Use `CONCAT` to Combine Columns:**
   - Concatenate the columns into a single string.
   - Be cautious with this approach if your data might have overlapping values that could result in the same concatenated string for different combinations.

### **Corrected SQL Query:**

Here is the corrected query using the `STRUCT` function:

```sql
SELECT
  cc.`Type`,
  COUNT(DISTINCT STRUCT(cc.`RefNo`, cc.`CaseNo`)) AS num_cases
FROM
  `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
JOIN
  `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
  ON cc.`RefNo` = cg.`RefNo`
  AND cc.`CaseNo` = cg.`CaseNo`
WHERE
  cg.`Morph` = '3111'
  OR cg.`Topo` = '0401'
GROUP BY
  cc.`Type`
ORDER BY
  num_cases DESC
```

**Alternative using `CONCAT`:**

```sql
SELECT
  cc.`Type`,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(cc.`RefNo`, '_', cc.`CaseNo`)) AS num_cases
FROM
  `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
JOIN
  `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
  ON cc.`RefNo` = cg.`RefNo`
  AND cc.`CaseNo` = cg.`CaseNo`
WHERE
  cg.`Morph` = '3111'
  OR cg.`Topo` = '0401'
GROUP BY
  cc.`Type`
ORDER BY
  num_cases DESC
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Using `STRUCT`:**
  - `COUNT(DISTINCT STRUCT(cc.\`RefNo\`, cc.\`CaseNo\`))` counts the number of distinct combinations of `RefNo` and `CaseNo`.
  - The `STRUCT` function combines `RefNo` and `CaseNo` into a single composite value.
  - `DISTINCT` then considers each unique combination as a distinct value.

- **Using `CONCAT`:**
  - `CONCAT(cc.\`RefNo\`, '_', cc.\`CaseNo\`)` merges `RefNo` and `CaseNo` into a single string separated by an underscore.
  - `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` counts the number of unique concatenated strings.
  - Ensure that the concatenated strings are unique for each combination to avoid counting errors.

### **Applying Corrections to Other Queries:**

Wherever you have used `COUNT(DISTINCT col1, col2)`, you should replace it with one of the methods above.

#### **Example Correction:**

**Original Query with Error:**

```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT cc.`RefNo`, cc.`CaseNo`)
```

**Corrected Query Using `STRUCT`:**

```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT STRUCT(cc.`RefNo`, cc.`CaseNo`))
```

**Corrected Query Using `CONCAT`:**

```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(cc.`RefNo`, '_', cc.`CaseNo`))
```

### **Why Use `STRUCT` Over `CONCAT`:**

- **Accuracy:**
  - `STRUCT` preserves the data types and structures of the combined fields, reducing the risk of accidental value collisions.
  - `CONCAT` converts the values to strings, which can sometimes lead to identical strings for different original values, especially if the values contain underscores or overlapping numbers.

- **Performance:**
  - Using `STRUCT` can be more efficient in terms of processing, as it utilizes the underlying data types.

### **Conclusion:**

By correcting the way you count distinct combinations of columns, you resolve the error and ensure accurate results. Replace all instances where you have multiple arguments in `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` with either the `STRUCT` approach or the `CONCAT` method, depending on your data and requirements.

**Revised Query for Your Error:**

```sql
SELECT
  cc.`Type`,
  COUNT(DISTINCT STRUCT(cc.`RefNo`, cc.`CaseNo`)) AS num_cases
FROM
  `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
JOIN
  `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
  ON cc.`RefNo` = cg.`RefNo`
  AND cc.`CaseNo` = cg.`CaseNo`
WHERE
  cg.`Morph` = '3111'
  OR cg.`Topo` = '0401'
GROUP BY
  cc.`Type`
ORDER BY
  num_cases DESC
```

2025-01-26 17:04:55 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-26 17:04:55 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to BigQuery's limitation on using aggregate functions with `DISTINCT` when the argument is of type `STRUCT`. Specifically, the error message states:

```
Aggregate functions with DISTINCT cannot be used with arguments of type STRUCT
```

### **Cause of the Error:**

- **`COUNT(DISTINCT STRUCT(...))`** is not allowed in BigQuery.
- BigQuery does not support `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` when the argument is a `STRUCT` type.

### **Solution:**

To count distinct combinations of `RefNo` and `CaseNo` grouped by `Type`, we can use a subquery to first retrieve the distinct combinations, and then perform the `COUNT` in the outer query.

### **Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  `Type`,
  COUNT(*) AS num_cases
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    cc.`Type`,
    cc.`RefNo`,
    cc.`CaseNo`
  FROM
    `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
  JOIN
    `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
    ON
      cc.`RefNo` = cg.`RefNo` AND
      cc.`CaseNo` = cg.`CaseNo`
  WHERE
    cg.`Morph` = '3111' OR
    cg.`Topo` = '0401'
) AS distinct_cases
GROUP BY
  `Type`
ORDER BY
  num_cases DESC
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Subquery (`distinct_cases`):**
  - Selects distinct combinations of `Type`, `RefNo`, and `CaseNo` from the joined tables where the conditions on `Morph` and `Topo` are met.
  - This ensures we have a unique list of cases for each `Type`.
  
- **Outer Query:**
  - Groups the results by `Type`.
  - Counts the number of unique cases (`COUNT(*)`) for each `Type`.
  
- **Why This Works:**
  - By moving the `DISTINCT` clause into a subquery, we avoid using `COUNT(DISTINCT STRUCT(...))`, which BigQuery doesn't support.
  - The outer query can then safely perform aggregations on the results of the subquery.

### **Alternative Using `CONCAT`:**

If acceptable for your data, you can concatenate `RefNo` and `CaseNo` into a string to create a unique identifier for each case.

```sql
SELECT
  cc.`Type`,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.`RefNo` AS STRING), '_', cc.`CaseNo`)) AS num_cases
FROM
  `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
JOIN
  `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
ON
  cc.`RefNo` = cg.`RefNo` AND
  cc.`CaseNo` = cg.`CaseNo`
WHERE
  cg.`Morph` = '3111' OR
  cg.`Topo` = '0401'
GROUP BY
  cc.`Type`
ORDER BY
  num_cases DESC
```

**Note:** When using `CONCAT`, ensure that the combination of `RefNo` and `CaseNo` as strings uniquely identifies each case without collisions.

### **Conclusion:**

By restructuring the query to avoid using `COUNT(DISTINCT STRUCT(...))`, we comply with BigQuery's limitations and successfully count the number of unique cases per `Type`. Feel free to run the corrected query, and let me know if you have any further questions or encounter additional issues.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we'll first identify the relevant tables and columns needed to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses using CytoConverter genomic coordinates for breast cancer (`Morph='3111'`) and adenocarcinoma (`Topo='0401'`) samples.

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

**Table:** `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen`
- **`RefNo`**: Reference number; used to link patient data with chromosomal data.
- **`CaseNo`**: Case number; identifies individual cases.
- **`Morph`**: Morphology code; used to select samples with breast cancer (`'3111'`).
- **`Topo`**: Topography code; used to select samples with adenocarcinoma (`'0401'`).

**Table:** `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted`
- **`RefNo`**: Reference number; used to link with `Cytogen` table.
- **`CaseNo`**: Case number; used to link with `Cytogen` table.
- **`InvNo`**: Investigation number; unique identifier for each investigation.
- **`Chr`**: Chromosome; provides chromosome information for abnormalities.
- **`ChrOrd`**: Chromosome ordinal; used to sort chromosomes numerically.
- **`Start`**: Start genomic coordinate of the chromosomal abnormality.
- **`End`**: End genomic coordinate of the chromosomal abnormality.
- **`Type`**: Type of chromosomal abnormality; indicates amplifications, gains, losses, homozygous deletions, etc.
- **`Clone`**: Clone number; may be used to group observations.

**Table:** `mitelman-db.prod.CytoBands_hg38`
- **`chromosome`**: Chromosome name; used to map abnormalities to chromosomal bands.
- **`cytoband_name`**: Name of the cytogenetic band.
- **`hg38_start`**: Start genomic coordinate of the band.
- **`hg38_stop`**: End genomic coordinate of the band.

### Conditions:

- **Sample Selection**: Include only samples where `Morph` = `'3111'` (breast cancer) or `Topo` = `'0401'` (adenocarcinoma).
- **Joining Criteria**: Join `Cytogen` and `CytoConverted` on `RefNo` and `CaseNo` (and possibly `InvNo`).
- **Abnormality Types**: Use `Type` in `CytoConverted` to categorize abnormalities into amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions.

### SQL Queries:

1. **Retrieve distinct Morphology codes in the Cytogen table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `Morph`
   FROM `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen`
   LIMIT 100
   ```

2. **Retrieve distinct Topography codes in the Cytogen table:**

   ```sql

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `CellsPresent`
    FROM `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted`
    LIMIT 100
    ```

19. **Count the number of homozygous deletions per cytoband in the cohort:**

    ```sql
    SELECT cb.`chromosome`, cb.`cytoband_name`, COUNT(*) AS homozygous_deletions
    FROM `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
    JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg

      AND cc.`Type` = 'HomozygousDeletion'
    GROUP BY cb.`chromosome`, cb.`cytoband_name`
    ORDER BY cb.`chromosome`, cb.`hg38_start`
    LIMIT 100
    ```

20. **Determine the total number of chromosomal abnormalities per sample in the cohort:**

    ```sql
    SELECT cc.`RefNo`, cc.`CaseNo`, COUNT(*) AS num_abnormalities
    FROM `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
    JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
      ON cc.`RefNo` = cg.`RefNo` AND cc.`CaseNo` = cg.`CaseNo`
    WHERE cg.`Morph` = '3111' OR cg.`Topo` = '0401`
    GROUP BY cc.`RefNo`, cc.`CaseNo`
    ORDER BY num_abnormalities DESC
    LIMIT 100
    ```

These queries help in understanding the values and distributions within the relevant columns, providing a foundation to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across the specified cohort. They cover simple data retrievals, counts, joins between tables, grouping, and aggregations necessary for the analysis.Query:

Task: Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'mitelman-db': {'prod': ['AuthorReference', 'CytoBands_hg38', 'CytoConverted', 'CytoConvertedLog', 'Cytogen', 'CytogenInv', 'CytogenInvValid', 'KaryAbnorm', 'KaryBit', 'KaryBreak', 'KaryClone', 'Koder', 'MolBiolClinAssoc', 'MolClinAbnorm', 'MolClinBreak', 'MolClinGene', 'RecurrentData', 'RecurrentNumData', 'Reference']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 17:09:59 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:10:57 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:12:16 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:13:11 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:15:01 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:16:58 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
