ORDER BY iso_time

```

**Explanation:**

The error occurred because there was a data type mismatch in the `WHERE` clause. The `season` column is of type `INT64`, so we should compare it without quotes. I removed the quotes around `2020` to match the data type of the `season` column.

Additionally, if the query still returns no data, you may need to simplify the conditions by removing the `sid` filter to retrieve data for any hurricanes in the North Atlantic during 2020. Here's a simplified query:

```sql
SELECT sid, name, latitude, longitude, iso_time
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
WHERE season = 2020 AND basin = 'NA'
ORDER BY iso_time
LIMIT 100
```

This will retrieve the positions of all hurricanes in the North Atlantic during 2020, allowing you to proceed with your analysis.

```

**Explanation:**

The error occurred because `SELECT DISTINCT ON` is not supported in BigQuery. To obtain the last recorded position for each hurricane (`sid`), we use `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank the records within each hurricane based on `iso_time` in descending order. The record with `rn = 1` is the latest (last) position for that hurricane.

  FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
  WHERE season = 2020 AND basin = 'NA'
)
WHERE rn = 1
LIMIT 100
```

**Explanation:**

The error occurred due to a data type mismatch in the `WHERE` clause. The `season` column is of type **INT64**, so we should compare it to an integer without quotes. I corrected this by removing the quotes around `2020` (changed `'2020'` to `2020`).

Also, BigQuery does not support `SELECT DISTINCT ON`, so I used a subquery with `ROW_NUMBER()` partitioned by `sid` and ordered by `iso_time` in descending order to get the last recorded position for each hurricane (`rn = 1`).

This query will return the last latitude and longitude (final coordinates) for each hurricane in the North Atlantic during 2020.

---

**Next Steps:**

Using this query, you can retrieve the final coordinates for all hurricanes. To find the latitude of the hurricane that traveled the **second longest distance**, you can integrate this with the total distance calculation and then select the desired latitude.

Here's the combined query to accomplish the task:

```sql
WITH hurricane_distances AS (
  SELECT
    sid,
    name,
    SUM(ST_DISTANCE(
      ST_GEOGPOINT(longitude, latitude),
      ST_GEOGPOINT(prev_longitude, prev_latitude)
    )) AS total_distance_meters
  FROM (
    SELECT
      sid,
      name,
      latitude,
      longitude,
      LAG(latitude) OVER (PARTITION BY sid ORDER BY iso_time) AS prev_latitude,
      LAG(longitude) OVER (PARTITION BY sid ORDER BY iso_time) AS prev_longitude
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
    WHERE season = 2020 AND basin = 'NA' AND latitude IS NOT NULL AND longitude IS NOT NULL
  )
  WHERE prev_latitude IS NOT NULL AND prev_longitude IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY sid, name
),
hurricane_ranks AS (
  SELECT
    sid,
    name,
    total_distance_meters,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_distance_meters DESC) AS distance_rank
  FROM hurricane_distances
),
second_longest_hurricane AS (
  SELECT sid
  FROM hurricane_ranks
  WHERE distance_rank = 2
)
SELECT
  h.sid,
  h.name,
  h.latitude AS final_latitude
FROM (
  SELECT
    sid,
    name,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    iso_time,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY sid ORDER BY iso_time DESC) AS rn
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
  WHERE season = 2020 AND basin = 'NA'
) h
JOIN second_longest_hurricane s ON h.sid = s.sid
WHERE h.rn = 1
```

This query calculates the total distance traveled by each hurricane, ranks them, selects the one with the second longest distance, and then retrieves its final latitude.

**Final Answer:**

```csv
Latitude
latitude:FLOAT
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The latitude provided represents the final coordinate of the hurricane that traveled the second longest distance in the North Atlantic during 2020.

## ST_DISTANCE

Returns the minimum geodesic distance between two GEOGRAPHY or the minimum Euclidean distance between two GEOMETRY objects.

## Syntax

ST_DISTANCE( <geography_or_geometry_expression_1> , <geography_or_geometry_expression_2> )


## Arguments


geography_or_geometry_expression_1The argument must be of type GEOGRAPHY or GEOMETRY.

geography_or_geometry_expression_2The argument must be of type GEOGRAPHY or GEOMETRY.


## Returns

Returns a REAL value, which represents the distance:

For GEOGRAPHY input values, the distance is in meters.
For GEOMETRY input values, the distance is computed with the same units used to define the input coordinates.


## Usage notes


Returns NULL if one or more input points are NULL.

For GEOMETRY objects, the function reports an error if the two input GEOMETRY objects have different SRIDs.


## Examples


## GEOGRAPHY examples

This shows the distance in meters between two points 1 degree apart along the equator (approximately 111 kilometers or 69 miles).

WITH d AS
    ( ST_DISTANCE(ST_MAKEPOINT(0, 0), ST_MAKEPOINT(1, 0)) ) SELECT d / 1000 AS kilometers, d / 1609 AS miles;
+---------------+--------------+
|    KILOMETERS |        MILES |
|---------------+--------------|
| 111.195101177 | 69.108204585 |
+---------------+--------------+


This shows use of the ST_DISTANCE function with NULL values:

SELECT ST_DISTANCE(ST_MAKEPOINT(0, 0), ST_MAKEPOINT(NULL, NULL));
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ST_DISTANCE(ST_MAKEPOINT(0, 0), ST_MAKEPOINT(NULL, NULL)) |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                      NULL |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+



## GEOMETRY examples

The following example compares the distance calculated for GEOGRAPHY and GEOMETRY input objects.

SELECT ST_DISTANCE(TO_GEOMETRY('POINT(0 0)'), TO_GEOMETRY('POINT(1 1)')) AS geometry_distance,
       ST_DISTANCE(TO_GEOGRAPHY('POINT(0 0)'), TO_GEOGRAPHY('POINT(1 1)')) AS geography_distance;

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task, we need to identify the hurricane that traveled the second longest distance in the North Atlantic during 2020 and then provide the latitude of its final coordinates.

**Relevant Table and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
- **Columns:**
  - `sid`: Storm Identifier - used to identify individual hurricanes.
  - `season`: Used to filter hurricanes in the year 2020.
  - `basin`: Used to filter hurricanes in the North Atlantic (`'NA'`).
  - `iso_time`: Timestamp of each hurricane's recorded position.
  - `latitude`: Latitude coordinate of the hurricane at a specific time.
  - `longitude`: Longitude coordinate of the hurricane at a specific time.
  - `name`: Name of the hurricane - useful for identification.

**Conditions to be Used:**

- `season = '2020'`: To select hurricanes from the year 2020.
- `basin = 'NA'`: To select hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin.

---

Here are **10 SQL queries** to understand the data and approach the problem:

1. **List all seasons available in the dataset:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT season
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
   LIMIT 100
   ```

2. **List all basins available in the dataset:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT basin
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
   LIMIT 100
   ```

3. **Get all hurricane identifiers and names in the North Atlantic during 2020:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT sid, name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
   WHERE season = '2020' AND basin = 'NA'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

4. **Count the number of position records for each hurricane in 2020 in the North Atlantic:**
   ```sql
   SELECT sid, name, COUNT(*) AS num_records
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
   WHERE season = '2020' AND basin = 'NA'
   GROUP BY sid, name
   ORDER BY num_records DESC
   LIMIT 100
   ```

5. **Find the duration of each hurricane in 2020 in the North Atlantic:**
   ```sql
   SELECT sid, name, MIN(iso_time) AS start_time, MAX(iso_time) AS end_time
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
   WHERE season = '2020' AND basin = 'NA'
   GROUP BY sid, name
   LIMIT 100
   ```

6. **Retrieve positions over time for a specific hurricane (example `sid`):**
   ```sql
   SELECT sid, name, latitude, longitude, iso_time
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
   WHERE season = '2020' AND basin = 'NA' AND sid = '2020229N14350'
   ORDER BY iso_time
   LIMIT 100
   ```

7. **Identify hurricanes with the most recorded positions in 2020 in the North Atlantic:**
   ```sql
   SELECT sid, name, COUNT(*) AS num_positions
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
   WHERE season = '2020' AND basin = 'NA'
   GROUP BY sid, name
   ORDER BY num_positions DESC
   LIMIT 100
   ```

8. **Get the positions over time for all hurricanes in 2020 in the North Atlantic:**
   ```sql
   SELECT sid, name, latitude, longitude, iso_time
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
   WHERE season = '2020' AND basin = 'NA'
   ORDER BY sid, iso_time
   LIMIT 100
   ```

9. **Find the last recorded position for each hurricane in 2020 in the North Atlantic:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT ON (sid) sid, name, latitude AS last_latitude, longitude AS last_longitude, iso_time AS last_time
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
   WHERE season = '2020' AND basin = 'NA'
   ORDER BY sid, iso_time DESC
   LIMIT 100
   ```

10. **Calculate the total distance traveled by each hurricane in 2020 in the North Atlantic:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      sid,
      name,
      SUM(ST_DISTANCE(
        ST_GEOGPOINT(longitude, latitude),
        ST_GEOGPOINT(prev_longitude, prev_latitude)
      )) AS total_distance_meters
    FROM (
      SELECT
        sid,
        name,
        latitude,
        longitude,
        LAG(latitude) OVER (PARTITION BY sid ORDER BY iso_time) AS prev_latitude,
        LAG(longitude) OVER (PARTITION BY sid ORDER BY iso_time) AS prev_longitude
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
      WHERE season = '2020' AND basin = 'NA'
    )
    WHERE prev_latitude IS NOT NULL AND prev_longitude IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY sid, name
    ORDER BY total_distance_meters DESC
    LIMIT 100
    ```

---

By analyzing the results of these queries, we can determine:

- Which hurricanes were active in the North Atlantic during 2020.
- The total distance traveled by each hurricane.
- The hurricane that traveled the second longest distance.
- The final latitude of that hurricane.

---

**Final Answer:**

```csv
Latitude
latitude:FLOAT
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

- The latitude provided represents the final coordinate of the hurricane that traveled the second longest distance in the North Atlantic during 2020.

---

**Explanation:**

We used the `hurricanes` table from the `noaa_hurricanes` dataset to perform this analysis. By filtering the data for the 2020 season and the North Atlantic basin (`basin = 'NA'`), we focused on the relevant hurricanes. We calculated the total distance each hurricane traveled by summing the distances between consecutive recorded positions using the `ST_DISTANCE` function. After identifying the hurricane with the second longest total distance, we retrieved its final latitude from the last recorded position.Query:

Task: Can you provide the latitude of the final coordinates for the hurricane that traveled the second longest distance in the North Atlantic during 2020?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Latitude
latitude:FLOAT
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the latitude of the final coordinates for the hurricane that traveled the second longest distance in the North Atlantic during 2020, we analyzed the `hurricanes` table in the `noaa_hurricanes` dataset. We filtered for hurricanes in the 2020 season (`season = '2020'`) within the North Atlantic basin (`basin = 'NA'`). By calculating the total distance each hurricane traveled using their sequential latitude and longitude points, we identified the hurricane with the second longest path. We then retrieved the latitude of its final recorded position..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-22 21:59:25 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide the latitude of the final coordinates for the hurricane that traveled the second longest distance in the North Atlantic during 2020?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.

To find the latitude of the final coordinates for the hurricane that traveled the second longest distance in the North Atlantic during 2020, we analyzed the `hurricanes` table in the `noaa_hurricanes` dataset. We filtered for hurricanes in the 2020 season (`season = '2020'`) within the North Atlantic basin (`basin = 'NA'`). By calculating the total distance each hurricane traveled using their sequential latitude and longitude points, we identified the hurricane with the second longest path. We then retrieved the latitude of its final recorded position. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
