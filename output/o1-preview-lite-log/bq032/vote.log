After comparing the SQL queries, the correct SQL is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reason:**

The SQL script in `1result.sql` correctly calculates the total distance traveled by each hurricane in the North Atlantic during 2020 by:

1. **Calculating Segment Distances:**
   - It uses the `LAG` function over `iso_time` to get the previous latitude and longitude for each hurricane (`sid`).
   - This allows for calculating the distance between each pair of consecutive positions using `ST_DISTANCE`, which accurately measures the distance the hurricane traveled between recorded points.

2. **Summing Total Distances:**
   - It sums these segment distances for each hurricane to get the total distance traveled.
   - By grouping the data by `sid` and `name`, it ensures the total distance is calculated for each individual hurricane.

3. **Identifying the Hurricane with the Second Longest Distance:**
   - It orders the hurricanes by `total_distance` in descending order.
   - The query uses `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1` to select the hurricane with the second longest total distance, which correctly identifies the target hurricane.

4. **Retrieving the Final Latitude:**
   - It joins back to the original hurricane data to find the final recorded latitude for the identified hurricane.
   - By ordering the hurricane's data by `iso_time` in descending order and selecting the first record (`LIMIT 1`), it accurately captures the final latitude of the hurricane's path.

5. **Clarity and Correctness:**
   - The query uses clear and descriptive CTEs (Common Table Expressions) like `hurricane_tracks`, `hurricane_distances`, `second_longest_hurricane`, and `final_position`, which enhance readability and maintainability.
   - Each step logically follows from data extraction to processing and final selection, ensuring the results are accurate.

In contrast, while the other SQL scripts (in `0result.sql` and `2result.sql`) may produce the same result, `1result.sql` demonstrates a clearer structure and more precise operations, making it the correct choice for solving the task.
