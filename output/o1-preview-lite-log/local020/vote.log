After reviewing both SQL queries and their results, I have concluded that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL to determine the bowler with the lowest bowling average per wicket taken. Here is the reasoning:

### Comparison of SQL Queries:

1. **`1result.sql`**:
   - **Calculation of Total Runs Conceded**:
     - Includes all runs conceded, including all types of extras (`wides`, `no-balls`, `byes`, `legbyes`, etc.).
     - Uses `SUM(COALESCE(bs."runs_scored", 0) + COALESCE(e."extra_runs", 0))`.
   - **Wickets Counted**:
     - Counts wickets where `kind_out` is in (`'bowled'`, `'caught'`, `'lbw'`, `'stumped'`, `'hit wicket'`, `'caught and bowled'`).
     - Excludes dismissals like `'run out'` and `'retired hurt'`, which are not credited to the bowler.
   - **Minimum Deliveries Filter**:
     - Filters out bowlers who have bowled fewer than 6 deliveries (`b_stats."deliveries_bowled" >= 6`).

2. **`2result.sql`**:
   - **Calculation of Total Runs Conceded**:
     - Includes runs conceded off the bat (`runs_scored`).
     - Includes only certain types of extra runs: `no-balls` and `wides`, which are directly attributable to the bowler.
     - Excludes `byes` and `legbyes`, which should not be counted against the bowler's runs conceded.
     - Uses:
       ```sql
       SUM(
           COALESCE(bs.runs_scored, 0) +
           CASE WHEN er.extra_type IN ('no ball', 'wides') THEN COALESCE(er.extra_runs, 0) ELSE 0 END
       )
       ```
   - **Wickets Counted**:
     - Counts all wickets where `kind_out` is not `'run out'` and is not `NULL`.
     - Ensures that only wickets credited to the bowler are counted.
   - **No Minimum Deliveries Filter**:
     - Does not impose a minimum number of deliveries bowled.

### Reasons for Choosing `2result.sql`:

- **Accurate Runs Conceded Calculation**:
  - **`2result.sql`** correctly includes only the runs for which the bowler is directly responsible (runs off the bat, `no-balls`, and `wides`).
  - Excludes `byes` and `legbyes`, which are not the bowler's fault and should not be counted against their bowling average.
  - **`1result.sql`** incorrectly includes all extras, such as `byes` and `legbyes`, inflating the total runs conceded.

- **Correct Wicket Attribution**:
  - Both queries correctly exclude wickets not credited to the bowler, such as `run outs` and `retired hurt`.

- **Inclusivity of Bowlers**:
  - **`2result.sql`** does not exclude bowlers based on the number of deliveries bowled, ensuring that any bowler who has taken a wicket is considered.
  - **`1result.sql`** imposes a minimum of 6 deliveries, which could exclude some bowlers with exceptional averages over fewer deliveries.

- **Alignment with Cricket Statistics Standards**:
  - **`2result.sql`** adheres to the standard method of calculating bowling averages in cricket, ensuring accurate and fair comparisons.

### Conclusion:

- **`2result.sql`** provides a more accurate calculation of the bowling average by correctly considering only the runs and wickets directly attributable to the bowler.
- Therefore, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query to answer the question: "Which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken?"
