Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

From `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`:

- **`trip_seconds`**: Used to calculate trip durations in minutes by dividing by 60. Potential usage: rounding to the nearest minute for grouping.
- **`fare`**: Used to calculate the average fare. Potential usage: computing average fare within each quantile group.
- **`trip_start_timestamp`**, **`trip_end_timestamp`**: Potential usage for additional validations on trip durations if needed.
- **`trip_miles`**: Could be useful for understanding distance in relation to duration.
- **`payment_type`**: May provide insights when analyzing fares.
- **Conditions that may be used**:
  - Trips where `trip_seconds` divided by 60 yields durations between 1 and 50 minutes.
  - Exclude trips with null or zero fares.
  - Filter out records with null or zero `trip_seconds`.

---

**Sample BigQuery SQL Queries:**

1. **Select trip durations in seconds and fares for the first 100 trips:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     trip_seconds,
     fare
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select distinct rounded trip durations in minutes (between 1 and 50 minutes):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS trip_minutes
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     trip_seconds IS NOT NULL
     AND trip_seconds > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
   ORDER BY
     trip_minutes
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Fetch trips with rounded durations and corresponding fares:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS trip_minutes,
     fare
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     trip_seconds IS NOT NULL
     AND trip_seconds > 0
     AND fare IS NOT NULL
     AND fare > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count the number of trips for each rounded minute duration between 1 and 50 minutes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS trip_minutes,
     COUNT(*) AS total_trips
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     trip_seconds IS NOT NULL
     AND trip_seconds > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
   GROUP BY
     trip_minutes
   ORDER BY
     trip_minutes
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate the average fare for each rounded minute duration between 1 and 50 minutes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS trip_minutes,
     ROUND(AVG(fare), 2) AS average_fare
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     trip_seconds IS NOT NULL
     AND trip_seconds > 0
     AND fare IS NOT NULL
     AND fare > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
   GROUP BY
     trip_minutes
   ORDER BY
     trip_minutes
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Select the minimum and maximum trip durations in minutes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     MIN(ROUND(trip_seconds / 60)) AS min_trip_minutes,
     MAX(ROUND(trip_seconds / 60)) AS max_trip_minutes
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     trip_seconds IS NOT NULL
     AND trip_seconds > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Fetch trips with trip durations between 1 and 50 minutes and payment type 'Cash':**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS trip_minutes,
     fare,
     payment_type
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE
     trip_seconds IS NOT NULL
     AND trip_seconds > 0
     AND ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50
     AND LOWER(payment_type) = 'cash'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Select distinct payment types used in the trips dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     payment_type
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

Task: Calculate the total number of trips and average fare (formatted to two decimal places) for ten equal quantile groups of taxi trips based on rounded minute durations between 1-50 minutes, displaying each group's formatted time range (XXm to XXm) sorted chronologically, where quantile groups are created from ordered trip durations and time ranges represent the minimum/maximum values within each quantile partition

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To calculate the total number of trips and the average fare for ten equal quantile groups of taxi trips based on rounded minute durations between 1 and 50 minutes, follow these steps:

1. **Filter Trips**: Select trips where the `trip_seconds` converted to minutes (by dividing by 60 and rounding appropriately) result in durations between 1 and 50 minutes.

2. **Calculate Trip Durations**: Round each trip's duration to the nearest whole minute.

3. **Create Quantile Groups**: Order the trips by their rounded durations and divide them into ten equal quantile groups.

4. **Determine Time Ranges**: For each quantile group, find the minimum and maximum trip durations to define the time range (formatted as `XXm to XXm`).

5. **Calculate Aggregates**: For each quantile group, compute:
   - **Total Number of Trips**: Count the number of trips in the group.
   - **Average Fare**: Calculate the average fare of the trips in the group, formatted to two decimal places.

6. **Sort Chronologically**: Ensure the groups are ordered by their time ranges in ascending order.

Here is the expected format of the result:

```csv
Time_range,Total_trips,Average_fare
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips1:int,AverageFare1:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips2:int,AverageFare2:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips3:int,AverageFare3:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips4:int,AverageFare4:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips5:int,AverageFare5:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips6:int,AverageFare6:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips7:int,AverageFare7:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips8:int,AverageFare8:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips9:int,AverageFare9:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips10:int,AverageFare10:float
```

**(Attention: answer in 10 rows)**

* **Time_range**: The formatted time range for each quantile group (e.g., `5m to 7m`), representing the minimum and maximum trip durations within the group.
* **Total_trips**: An integer indicating the total number of trips in each group.
* **Average_fare**: A float formatted to two decimal places showing the average fare for trips in each group.

**Explanation:**

This table summarizes the total number of taxi trips and the average fare for each of the ten quantile groups based on trip durations between 1 and 50 minutes. The trips are grouped such that each quantile contains an equal portion of the data, and the time ranges represent the span of trip durations within each quantile. The results are sorted chronologically by the time ranges..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'chicago_crime': ['crime'], 'chicago_taxi_trips': ['taxi_trips']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
