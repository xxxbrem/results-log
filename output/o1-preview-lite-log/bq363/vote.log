After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer for the task. Here's the reasoning:

**Reasoning:**

1. **Use of the Correct Fare Column:**
   - The task specifies calculating the average **fare**. In the taxi trips dataset:
     - **`fare`** represents the base fare for the trip.
     - **`trip_total`** includes the fare plus additional charges like taxes, tips, and extras.
   - **`1result.sql`** correctly uses the **`fare`** column, aligning with the task's requirement.
   - **`0result.sql`** uses **`trip_total`** as the fare, which does not match the task's specification.

2. **Calculation of Quantiles Based on Trip Durations:**
   - All three queries attempt to create quantile groups based on **rounded trip durations** between 1 and 50 minutes.
   - **`1result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** use the **`NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY trip_minutes)`** function to partition trips into ten equal quantiles based on the rounded trip durations.

3. **Formatting and Output Consistency:**
   - **`1result.sql`** correctly formats the time ranges as 'XXm to XXm' and ensures they are sorted chronologically.
   - The total trips and average fare in the results of **`1result.sql`** align with the expectations based on the dataset and the task requirements.

4. **Consistency in Total Trips Across Quantiles:**
   - The total number of trips in each quantile group in **`1result.sql`** is consistent (with minor differences due to rounding), indicating that trips are evenly distributed across the quantiles.

5. **Average Fare Calculation:**
   - The average fares in **`1result.sql`** increase logically with the trip durations, which is expected and confirms the correctness of the calculations.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above points, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that satisfies all the task requirements.
