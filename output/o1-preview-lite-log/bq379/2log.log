**SQL Queries:**

1. **Find the disease ID for psoriasis:**

   ```sql
   SELECT id, name
   FROM `open-targets-prod.platform.diseases`
   WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%psoriasis%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all target IDs associated with psoriasis:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT targetId
   FROM `open-targets-prod.platform.associationByOverallDirect`
   WHERE diseaseId = 'psoriasis_id'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve all association scores for psoriasis:**

   ```sql
   SELECT targetId, score
   FROM `open-targets-prod.platform.associationByOverallDirect`
   WHERE diseaseId = 'psoriasis_id'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Calculate the mean association score for psoriasis:**

   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(score) AS mean_score
   FROM `open-targets-prod.platform.associationByOverallDirect`
   WHERE diseaseId = 'psoriasis_id';
   ```

5. **List targets with their score differences from the mean:**

   ```sql
   SELECT targetId, score, ABS(score - <mean_score>) AS score_diff
   FROM `open-targets-prod.platform.associationByOverallDirect`
   WHERE diseaseId = 'psoriasis_id'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find the target with the score closest to the mean:**

   ```sql
   SELECT targetId, score, ABS(score - <mean_score>) AS score_diff
   FROM `open-targets-prod.platform.associationByOverallDirect`
   WHERE diseaseId = 'psoriasis_id'
   ORDER BY score_diff ASC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

7. **Get the approved symbol for a specific target ID:**

   ```sql
   SELECT approvedSymbol
   FROM `open-targets-prod.platform.targets`
   WHERE id = 'target_id';
   ```

8. **Join associations with targets to get approved symbols and scores:**

   ```sql
   SELECT a.targetId, a.score, t.approvedSymbol
   FROM `open-targets-prod.platform.associationByOverallDirect` AS a
   JOIN `open-targets-prod.platform.targets` AS t
   ON a.targetId = t.id
   WHERE a.diseaseId = 'psoriasis_id'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Compute the mean score and find the target closest to the mean in one query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT a.targetId, t.approvedSymbol, a.score, ABS(a.score - AVG(a.score) OVER ()) AS score_diff
   FROM `open-targets-prod.platform.associationByOverallDirect` AS a
   JOIN `open-targets-prod.platform.targets` AS t
   ON a.targetId = t.id
   WHERE a.diseaseId = 'psoriasis_id'
   ORDER BY score_diff ASC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

10. **Retrieve the approved symbol of the target whose score is closest to the mean:**

    ```sql
    SELECT t.approvedSymbol
    FROM `open-targets-prod.platform.associationByOverallDirect` AS a
    JOIN `open-targets-prod.platform.targets` AS t ON a.targetId = t.id
    WHERE a.diseaseId = 'psoriasis_id'
    ORDER BY ABS(a.score - (SELECT AVG(score) FROM `open-targets-prod.platform.associationByOverallDirect` WHERE diseaseId = 'psoriasis_id')) ASC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

Task: Which target approved symbol has the overall association score closest to the mean score for psoriasis?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
approvedSymbol
symbol:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the target approved symbol with the overall association score closest to the mean score for psoriasis, we first select all target-disease associations for psoriasis from the `associationByOverallDirect` table where `diseaseId` corresponds to psoriasis. We then calculate the mean of the `score` for these associations. Next, we identify the target whose `score` is closest to this mean value. Finally, we retrieve the `approvedSymbol` of this target from the `targets` table..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'open-targets-prod': {'platform': ['associationByDatasourceDirect', 'associationByDatasourceIndirect', 'associationByDatatypeDirect', 'associationByDatatypeIndirect', 'associationByOverallDirect', 'associationByOverallIndirect', 'baselineExpression', 'diseaseToPhenotype', 'diseases', 'drugWarnings', 'evidence', 'go', 'hpo', 'indication', 'interaction', 'interactionEvidence', 'knownDrugsAggregated', 'mechanismOfAction', 'molecule', 'mousePhenotypes', 'ot_release', 'pharmacogenomics', 'reactome', 'significantAdverseDrugReactions', 'targetEssentiality', 'targetPrioritisation', 'targets']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 12:17:57 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which target approved symbol has the overall association score closest to the mean score for psoriasis?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
approvedSymbol
symbol:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the target approved symbol with the overall association score closest to the mean score for psoriasis, we first select all target-disease associations for psoriasis from the `associationByOverallDirect` table where `diseaseId` corresponds to psoriasis. We then calculate the mean of the `score` for these associations. Next, we identify the target whose `score` is closest to this mean value. Finally, we retrieve the `approvedSymbol` of this target from the `targets` table. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
