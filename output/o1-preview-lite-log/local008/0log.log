Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `batting`
   - **"player_id"**: Used to identify each player and to join with the `player` table.
   - **"g"**: Games played. We can sum this column to get the total games played by each player.
   - **"r"**: Runs scored. Summing this gives the total runs scored by each player.
   - **"h"**: Hits. Summing this provides the total hits by each player.
   - **"hr"**: Home runs. Summing this yields the total home runs by each player.

2. **Table:** `player`
   - **"player_id"**: Used to join with the `batting` table.
   - **"name_given"**: The given name of the player, which we are interested in retrieving.

**Conditions that may be used:**
- Joining `batting` and `player` tables on `player_id` to connect player statistics with their names.
- Summing up the statistical columns (`g`, `r`, `h`, `hr`) grouped by `player_id` to get career totals.
- Ordering results in descending order to find the players with the highest totals.
- Limiting the number of results to focus on top performers.

Task: I would like to know the given names of baseball players who have achieved the highest value of games played, runs, hits, and home runs, with their corresponding score values.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: The baseball players with the highest values in games played, runs, hits, and home runs, along with their given names and corresponding score values, are as follows:

```csv
stat_name,player_name,score
Games played,Peter Edward,3562
Runs,Rickey Henley,2295
Hits,Peter Edward,4256
Home runs,Barry Lamar,762
(Attention: answer in four rows)
```

- **Games played**: Peter Edward (Pete Rose) holds the record with 3,562 games played.
- **Runs**: Rickey Henley (Rickey Henderson) leads with 2,295 runs scored.
- **Hits**: Peter Edward (Pete Rose) is the leader with 4,256 hits.
- **Home runs**: Barry Lamar (Barry Bonds) holds the record with 762 home runs..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 14:57:55 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I would like to know the given names of baseball players who have achieved the highest value of games played, runs, hits, and home runs, with their corresponding score values., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

- **Hits**: Peter Edward (Pete Rose) is the leader with 4,256 hits.
- **Home runs**: Barry Lamar (Barry Bonds) holds the record with 762 home runs. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
