The table structure information is (table names): 
['all_star', 'appearances', 'manager_award', 'player_award', 'manager_award_vote', 'player_award_vote', 'batting', 'batting_postseason', 'player_college', 'fielding', 'fielding_outfield', 'fielding_postseason', 'hall_of_fame', 'home_game', 'manager', 'manager_half', 'player', 'park', 'pitching', 'pitching_postseason', 'salary', 'college', 'postseason', 'team', 'team_franchise', 'team_half']
Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine the given names of baseball players who have achieved the highest values in games played, runs, hits, and home runs, we need to consider the relevant tables and columns from the database.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `player`
   - **Columns:**
     - `"player_id"`: Used to join with other tables to identify players.
     - `"name_given"`: The given name of the player (e.g., "George Herman" for Babe Ruth).

2. **Table:** `batting`
   - **Columns:**
     - `"player_id"`: Used to join with the `player` table.
     - `"g"`: Games played by the player in a season/stint.
     - `"r"`: Runs scored by the player.
     - `"h"`: Hits made by the player.
     - `"hr"`: Home runs hit by the player.
   - **Conditions:**
     - Aggregate statistics (`SUM`) over all seasons and stints for each player to get career totals.
     - Use `GROUP BY` on `"player_id"` to calculate totals per player.
     - Order results in descending order to find the highest values.
     - Limit results to the top records as needed.

**SQL Queries:**

Here are at least 10 different SQL queries to explore and understand the data related to the task:

1. **Retrieve the given names of all players (up to 100 records):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "player_id", "name_given"
   FROM "player"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get batting statistics for players (up to 100 records):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "player_id", "year", "stint", "g", "r", "h", "hr"
   FROM "batting"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List distinct player IDs from the batting records:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "player_id"
   FROM "batting"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Calculate total games played per player and list top 100:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "player_id", SUM("g") AS "total_games"
   FROM "batting"
   GROUP BY "player_id"
   ORDER BY "total_games" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find the player(s) with the highest total games played:**
   ```sql
   SELECT p."name_given", SUM(b."g") AS "total_games"
   FROM "batting" AS b
   JOIN "player" AS p ON b."player_id" = p."player_id"
   GROUP BY p."name_given"
   ORDER BY "total_games" DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

6. **Calculate total runs per player and list top 100:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "player_id", SUM("r") AS "total_runs"
   FROM "batting"
   GROUP BY "player_id"
   ORDER BY "total_runs" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find the player(s) with the highest total runs scored:**
   ```sql
   SELECT p."name_given", SUM(b."r") AS "total_runs"
   FROM "batting" AS b
   JOIN "player" AS p ON b."player_id" = p."player_id"
   GROUP BY p."name_given"
   ORDER BY "total_runs" DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

8. **Calculate total hits per player and list top 100:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "player_id", SUM("h") AS "total_hits"
   FROM "batting"
   GROUP BY "player_id"
   ORDER BY "total_hits" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find the player(s) with the highest total hits:**
   ```sql
   SELECT p."name_given", SUM(b."h") AS "total_hits"
   FROM "batting" AS b
   JOIN "player" AS p ON b."player_id" = p."player_id"
   GROUP BY p."name_given"
   ORDER BY "total_hits" DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

10. **Calculate total home runs per player and list top 100:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "player_id", SUM("hr") AS "total_home_runs"
    FROM "batting"
    GROUP BY "player_id"
    ORDER BY "total_home_runs" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Find the player(s) with the highest total home runs:**
    ```sql
    SELECT p."name_given", SUM(b."hr") AS "total_home_runs"
    FROM "batting" AS b
    JOIN "player" AS p ON b."player_id" = p."player_id"
    GROUP BY p."name_given"
    ORDER BY "total_home_runs" DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

12. **Identify players with more than 3,000 career hits:**
    ```sql
    SELECT p."name_given", SUM(b."h") AS "total_hits"
    FROM "batting" AS b
    JOIN "player" AS p ON b."player_id" = p."player_id"
    GROUP BY p."name_given"
    HAVING "total_hits" > 3000
    ORDER BY "total_hits" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List players who have played more than 2,500 games:**
    ```sql
    SELECT p."name_given", SUM(b."g") AS "total_games"
    FROM "batting" AS b
    JOIN "player" AS p ON b."player_id" = p."player_id"
    GROUP BY p."name_given"
    HAVING "total_games" > 2500
    ORDER BY "total_games" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Find the top 100 seasons with the most home runs by a player:**
    ```sql
    SELECT p."name_given", b."year", SUM(b."hr") AS "season_home_runs"
    FROM "batting" AS b
    JOIN "player" AS p ON b."player_id" = p."player_id"
    GROUP BY p."name_given", b."year"
    ORDER BY "season_home_runs" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Determine the maximum number of games played by any player:**
    ```sql
    SELECT MAX("total_games") AS "max_games_played"
    FROM (
      SELECT SUM("g") AS "total_games"
      FROM "batting"
      GROUP BY "player_id"
    );
    ```

These queries allow us to explore the necessary data to identify the players with the highest career totals in games played, runs, hits, and home runs. By joining the `batting` and `player` tables on `"player_id"`, we can access both the statistical data and the players' given names.Query:
SELECT "player_id", "name_given"
   FROM "player"
   LIMIT 100;

Task: I would like to know the given names of baseball players who have achieved the highest value of games played, runs, hits, and home runs, with their corresponding score values.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: The baseball players with the highest values in games played, runs, hits, and home runs, along with their given names and corresponding score values, are as follows:

```csv
stat_name,player_name,score
Games played,Peter Edward,3562
Runs,Rickey Henley,2295
Hits,Peter Edward,4256
Home runs,Barry Lamar,762
(Attention: answer in four rows)
```

- **Games played**: Peter Edward (Pete Rose) holds the record with 3,562 games played.
- **Runs**: Rickey Henley (Rickey Henderson) leads with 2,295 runs scored.
- **Hits**: Peter Edward (Pete Rose) is the leader with 4,256 hits.
- **Home runs**: Barry Lamar (Barry Bonds) holds the record with 762 home runs..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
