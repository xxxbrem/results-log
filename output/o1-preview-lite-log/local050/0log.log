10. **Project average monthly sales for France in 2021 (assuming no growth):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "t"."calendar_month_number", AVG("s"."amount_sold") AS "projected_sales" FROM "sales" AS "s"
    JOIN "customers" AS "c" ON "s"."cust_id" = "c"."cust_id"
    JOIN "countries" AS "co" ON "c"."country_id" = "co"."country_id"
    JOIN "times" AS "t" ON "s"."time_id" = "t"."time_id"
    WHERE "co"."country_name" = 'France' AND "t"."calendar_year" IN (2019, 2020)
    GROUP BY "t"."calendar_month_number"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Combine projected sales with 2021 exchange rates to convert to USD:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "proj"."calendar_month_number", ("proj"."projected_sales" * "cur"."to_us") AS "projected_sales_usd"
    FROM (
        SELECT "t"."calendar_month_number", AVG("s"."amount_sold") AS "projected_sales" FROM "sales" AS "s"
        JOIN "customers" AS "c" ON "s"."cust_id" = "c"."cust_id"
        JOIN "countries" AS "co" ON "c"."country_id" = "co"."country_id"
        JOIN "times" AS "t" ON "s"."time_id" = "t"."time_id"
        WHERE "co"."country_name" = 'France' AND "t"."calendar_year" IN (2019, 2020)
        GROUP BY "t"."calendar_month_number"
    ) AS "proj"
    JOIN "currency" AS "cur" ON (
        "cur"."country" = 'France' AND
        "cur"."year" = 2021 AND
        "cur"."month" = "proj"."calendar_month_number"
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Retrieve projected sales in USD for all months in 2021:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "proj"."calendar_month_number", ("proj"."projected_sales" * "cur"."to_us") AS "projected_sales_usd"
    FROM (
        SELECT "t"."calendar_month_number", AVG("s"."amount_sold") AS "projected_sales" FROM "sales" AS "s"
        JOIN "customers" AS "c" ON "s"."cust_id" = "c"."cust_id"
        JOIN "countries" AS "co" ON "c"."country_id" = "co"."country_id"
        JOIN "times" AS "t" ON "s"."time_id" = "t"."time_id"
        WHERE "co"."country_name" = 'France' AND "t"."calendar_year" IN (2019, 2020)
        GROUP BY "t"."calendar_month_number"
    ) AS "proj"
    JOIN "currency" AS "cur" ON (
        "cur"."country" = 'France' AND
        "cur"."year" = 2021 AND
        "cur"."month" = "proj"."calendar_month_number"
    )
    ORDER BY "projected_sales_usd"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Retrieve the sorted list of projected monthly sales in USD to determine the median:**

    ```sql
    SELECT ("proj"."projected_sales" * "cur"."to_us") AS "projected_sales_usd"
    FROM (
        SELECT "t"."calendar_month_number", AVG("s"."amount_sold") AS "projected_sales" FROM "sales" AS "s"
        JOIN "customers" AS "c" ON "s"."cust_id" = "c"."cust_id"
        JOIN "countries" AS "co" ON "c"."country_id" = "co"."country_id"
        JOIN "times" AS "t" ON "s"."time_id" = "t"."time_id"
        WHERE "co"."country_name" = 'France' AND "t"."calendar_year" IN (2019, 2020)
        GROUP BY "t"."calendar_month_number"
    ) AS "proj"
    JOIN "currency" AS "cur" ON (
        "cur"."country" = 'France' AND
        "cur"."year" = 2021 AND
        "cur"."month" = "proj"."calendar_month_number"
    )
    ORDER BY "projected_sales_usd"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the data and extracting the necessary information to calculate the median value of average monthly projected sales in USD for France in 2021, using data from 2019 and 2020 for the projection. Each query progressively builds upon the previous one to gather required data and perform necessary calculations.Query:

Task: What is the median value from average monthly projected sales in USD for France in 2021? Please use data from 2019 and 2020 for projection.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Median_average_monthly_projected_sales_USD
median_value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To calculate the median value from average monthly projected sales in USD for France in 2021, we would perform the following steps:

1. **Join Tables**: Combine the `sales`, `customers`, and `countries` tables using the foreign keys to isolate sales data where the customer is located in France.
   
2. **Filter by Years**: Extract sales records from the years **2019** and **2020** to use as the basis for projection.
   
3. **Aggregate Monthly Sales**: Group the filtered sales data by month and calculate the total sales amount for each month in local currency.
   
4. **Project 2021 Sales**: Use the monthly sales data from 2019 and 2020 to project the sales for each month in 2021. This could involve calculating the average growth rate between 2019 and 2020 and applying it to estimate 2021 figures.
   
5. **Convert to USD**: Utilize the `currency` table to convert the projected monthly sales figures from local currency to USD, based on the corresponding exchange rates.
   
6. **Calculate Monthly Averages**: Determine the average projected sales amount for each month in 2021.
   
7. **Compute Median Value**: Sort the monthly average sales figures and identify the median value, which is the middle number in the sorted list.

Please note that without access to the actual data, we cannot provide the exact median value. The above steps outline the method to obtain the required result using SQL queries and data manipulation..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
