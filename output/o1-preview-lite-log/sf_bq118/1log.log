Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

1. **DEATHRECORDS."Race"**: Used to identify the race of the decedent; needed to filter records for white people.
2. **DEATHRECORDS."Age"**: Used to group deaths by age; necessary for averaging across different ages.
3. **DEATHRECORDS."Icd10Code"**: Used to identify the cause of death; needed to filter deaths due to discharges and vehicle-related incidents, and to exclude certain discharges.
4. **RACE."Code"**: Race code to join with DEATHRECORDS."Race".
5. **RACE."Description"**: Provides race description; used to find the code corresponding to "White".
6. **ICD10CODE."Code"**: ICD-10 code to match with DEATHRECORDS."Icd10Code".
7. **ICD10CODE."Description"**: Description of cause of death; used to identify codes related to discharges and vehicle-related incidents, and to exclude specific discharges.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter for white individuals: `RACE."Description" = 'White'`.
- Filter for deaths due to discharges: `ICD10CODE."Description" ILIKE '%discharge%'`.
- Exclude specific discharges: `ICD10CODE."Description" NOT ILIKE '%urethral discharge%'` and similar.
- Filter for vehicle-related incidents: `ICD10CODE."Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'`.
- Group by age: to calculate averages across different ages.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Find the race code for 'White':**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Code", "Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACE
   WHERE "Description" = 'White'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List unique race codes from death records:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Race"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List unique ICD-10 codes related to discharges:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
   WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%discharge%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List unique ICD-10 codes related to vehicle incidents:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
   WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Identify ICD-10 codes to exclude (specific discharges):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Code", "Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
   WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%urethral discharge%'
      OR "Description" ILIKE '%firework discharge%'
      OR "Description" ILIKE '%legal intervention involving firearm discharge%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count deaths of white individuals due to discharges (excluding specific types):**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Death_Count"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
   JOIN DEATH.DEATH.RACE r ON dr."Race" = r."Code"
   JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE icd ON dr."Icd10Code" = icd."Code"
   WHERE r."Description" = 'White'
     AND icd."Description" ILIKE '%discharge%'
     AND icd."Description" NOT ILIKE '%urethral discharge%'
     AND icd."Description" NOT ILIKE '%firework discharge%'
     AND icd."Description" NOT ILIKE '%legal intervention involving firearm discharge%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count deaths of white individuals due to vehicle-related incidents:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Death_Count"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
   JOIN DEATH.DEATH.RACE r ON dr."Race" = r."Code"
   JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE icd ON dr."Icd10Code" = icd."Code"
   WHERE r."Description" = 'White'
     AND icd."Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate deaths per age group for discharges (excluding specific types):**
   ```sql
   SELECT dr."Age", COUNT(*) AS "Death_Count"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
   JOIN DEATH.DEATH.RACE r ON dr."Race" = r."Code"
   JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE icd ON dr."Icd10Code" = icd."Code"

Task: How much higher is the average number of white people dying from discharges (excluding urethral discharge, firework discharge, and legal intervention involving firearm discharge) compared to vehicle-related incidents averaged across different ages?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Difference_in_average_deaths
difference:float > 0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This value represents how much higher the average number of deaths among white people from discharges (excluding urethral discharge, firework discharge, and legal intervention involving firearm discharge) is compared to vehicle-related incidents, averaged across different ages..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'DEATH': {'DEATH': ['ACTIVITYCODE', 'AGERECODE12', 'AGERECODE27', 'AGERECODE52', 'AGETYPE', 'BRIDGEDRACEFLAG', 'DAYOFWEEKOFDEATH', 'DEATHRECORDS', 'EDUCATION1989REVISION', 'EDUCATION2003REVISION', 'EDUCATIONREPORTINGFLAG', 'ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS', 'HISPANICORIGIN', 'HISPANICORIGINRACERECODE', 'ICD10CODE', 'INFANTAGERECODE22', 'MANNEROFDEATH', 'MARITALSTATUS', 'METHODOFDISPOSITION', 'PLACEOFDEATHANDDECEDENTSSTATUS', 'PLACEOFINJURY', 'RACE', 'RACEIMPUTATIONFLAG', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE5', 'RECORDAXISCONDITIONS', 'RESIDENTSTATUS', 'TEMP_DEATHS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 13:14:58 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How much higher is the average number of white people dying from discharges (excluding urethral discharge, firework discharge, and legal intervention involving firearm discharge) compared to vehicle-related incidents averaged across different ages?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Difference_in_average_deaths
difference:float > 0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This value represents how much higher the average number of deaths among white people from discharges (excluding urethral discharge, firework discharge, and legal intervention involving firearm discharge) is compared to vehicle-related incidents, averaged across different ages. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
