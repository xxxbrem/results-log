After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct and more efficient answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Efficiency and Scalability**:
   - **`0result.sql`** uses table wildcards with `_TABLE_SUFFIX` to query multiple daily tables efficiently. This approach is more scalable when dealing with multiple date-partitioned tables, as it simplifies the selection of date ranges without manually listing each table.
   - **`1result.sql`** uses `UNION ALL` to combine individual daily tables. This method is less efficient and becomes cumbersome as the number of tables increases. It also increases the risk of errors if tables are missed or mislisted.

2. **Simplicity and Maintainability**:
   - In **`0result.sql`**, adjusting the date range requires changing only the `_TABLE_SUFFIX` conditions, making the query easier to maintain and adapt for different time periods.
   - In **`1result.sql`**, adjusting the date range necessitates adding or removing individual table references in the `UNION ALL` statements, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

3. **Consistent Results**:
   - Both queries produce the same retention rates, but **`0result.sql`** achieves this with cleaner and more optimized code.

**Conclusion:**

For calculating the weekly customer retention rate efficiently and maintainably, **`0result.sql`** is the preferred solution.
