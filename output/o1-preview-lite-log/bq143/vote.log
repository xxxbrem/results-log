After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL that accurately implements the task. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Joins on Sample Submitter IDs and Gene Symbols:**
   - **`1result.sql`** correctly joins the RNAseq and proteomics datasets using the sample submitter IDs (`r.sample_barcode = m.sample_submitter_id`) and gene symbols (`UPPER(r.gene_name) = UPPER(p.gene_symbol)`), ensuring accurate matching even if there are case differences in gene symbols.

2. **Selects 'Primary Tumor' and 'Solid Tissue Normal' Samples:**
   - It filters the samples based on `r.sample_type_name IN ('Primary Tumor', 'Solid Tissue Normal')`, which aligns with the requirement to select these specific sample types.

3. **Calculates Correlation for Each Gene and Sample Type:**
   - The query computes the correlation between `log_expression` and `protein_abundance` for each gene and sample type group (`GROUP BY Sample_Type, Gene_Symbol`).

4. **Filters Out Correlations with Absolute Value â‰¤ 0.5:**
   - It includes a `HAVING` clause that filters correlations with `ABS(CORR(log_expression, protein_abundance)) > 0.5`, adhering to the task's requirement.

5. **Ensures Sufficient Data Points for Correlation:**
   - The `HAVING` clause also includes `COUNT(*) >= 3`, ensuring that the correlation is calculated only when there are at least three data points. This adds statistical reliability to the correlation coefficients.

6. **Computes Average Correlation for Each Sample Type:**
   - Finally, it calculates the average correlation for each sample type using `ROUND(AVG(Correlation), 4)`, providing the desired summary statistics.

**In contrast**, while **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** perform similar operations, they lack certain critical elements:

- **`0result.sql`** does not handle potential case differences in gene symbols, which may lead to mismatches.
- **`2result.sql`** does not ensure a minimum number of data points when calculating correlations, potentially including unreliable correlations based on few observations.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the most robust and accurate query for the task.
