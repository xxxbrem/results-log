After comparing both SQL queries and their results, the **first SQL query (`0result.sql`)** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Date Filtering Precision:**
  - **`0result.sql`** uses:
    ```sql
    WHERE hsm."date" BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
    ```
    This explicitly includes all dates from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021, ensuring that only data from the calendar year 2021 is considered.
  - **`2result.sql`** uses:
    ```sql
    WHERE sfm."date" LIKE '2021-%'
    ```
    While this also aims to filter dates from 2021, it relies on the date format starting with `'2021-'`. If the date format varies or if there are any anomalies in the data, this method might include unintended records or exclude valid ones.

- **Clarity and Maintainability:**
  - **`0result.sql`** provides a clear and precise method for date filtering, which is critical for accurate data analysis. It also uses well-structured Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with meaningful names, making the query more readable and maintainable.
  - **`2result.sql`** is functionally similar but uses a less precise date filtering method, which could lead to potential errors in different environments or datasets.

- **Consistency with Data Types:**
  - Using `BETWEEN` with explicit date boundaries ensures compatibility with date data types and leverages the database's ability to handle date comparisons efficiently.
  - Using `LIKE` on dates treats the date as a string, which might not perform as well and could be affected by formatting issues.

**Conclusion:**

Due to the precise date filtering and better practice in handling date comparisons, **`0result.sql`** is the more correct and reliable SQL query for calculating the required average quantities.
