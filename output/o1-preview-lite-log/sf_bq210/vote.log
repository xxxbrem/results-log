```plain
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

I have compared the three SQL queries (`0result.sql`, `1result.sql`, and `2result.sql`) and their respective outputs. Based on the comparison, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that accurately addresses the task.

**Explanation:**

**Task Objective:** 
Count the number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 where **none of the claims** include the word "claim".

---

**Analysis of the SQL Queries:**

1. **`0result.sql`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "number_of_patents"
   FROM (
       SELECT t."publication_number"
       FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
            LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
       WHERE t."country_code" = 'US'
           AND t."kind_code" = 'B2'
           AND t."grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
       GROUP BY t."publication_number"
       HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN f.value:"text"::STRING ILIKE '%claim%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
   ) s;
   ```
   
   - **What it does:**
     - Filters US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018.
     - Flattens the `claims_localized` field to examine individual claims for each patent.
     - Groups by `publication_number` to aggregate claims per patent.
     - Uses the `HAVING` clause to filter patents **where none of the claims contain the word "claim"**.
     - Counts the number of such patents.
   - **Why it's correct:**
     - Directly checks for patents where **all** claims lack the word "claim".
     - Ensures that patents with **any** claim containing "claim" are excluded.
     - Correctly addresses the task's requirement.

2. **`1result.sql`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT t."publication_number") AS "number_of_patents"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
   WHERE t."country_code" = 'US'
     AND t."kind_code" = 'B2'
     AND TRY_TO_DATE(t."grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'
     AND f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'
     AND f.value:"text"::STRING IS NOT NULL
     AND f.value:"text"::STRING NOT ILIKE '%claim%';
   ```
   
   - **What it does:**
     - Filters US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018.
     - Flattens the `claims_localized` field.
     - Filters out claims that contain the word "claim".
     - Counts distinct `publication_number`s where at least one claim does not contain "claim".
   - **Why it's incorrect:**
     - It counts patents where **at least one claim** does not contain "claim".
     - Does **not** ensure that **none** of the claims contain "claim".
     - May include patents where other claims do contain "claim", thus not fulfilling the task's requirement.

3. **`2result.sql`:**

   ```sql
   WITH patents_with_claim_term AS (
     SELECT DISTINCT p."publication_number"
     FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS p,
          LATERAL FLATTEN(input => p."claims_localized") f
     WHERE p."country_code" = 'US'
       AND p."kind_code" = 'B2'
       AND p."grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
       AND f.value::STRING ILIKE '%claim%'
   )
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p."publication_number") AS num
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS p
   WHERE p."country_code" = 'US'
     AND p."kind_code" = 'B2'
     AND p."grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
     AND p."publication_number" NOT IN (SELECT "publication_number" FROM patents_with_claim_term);
   ```
   
   - **What it does:**
     - Creates a list (`patents_with_claim_term`) of patents where **any** claim contains "claim".
     - Selects patents **not** in that list.
     - Counts those patents.
   - **Why it's correct:**
     - Effectively excludes any patent that has at least one claim containing "claim".
     - The remaining patents are those where **none** of the claims contain "claim".
   - **Why `0result.sql` is preferred:**
     - Although `2result.sql` achieves the desired outcome, it utilizes a subquery and might be less efficient due to the `NOT IN` clause.
     - `0result.sql` is more direct and efficient by utilizing grouping and the `HAVING` clause.

---

**Conclusion:**

- **`0result.sql`** is the correct and most efficient query that fulfills the task's requirements.
- It accurately counts the number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 where **none of the claims** include the word "claim".
