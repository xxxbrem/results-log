This SQL query retrieves the necessary data to assess the relationship between county-level poverty rates and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity for the years 2016 to 2018. It performs the following steps:

1. **Poverty Data Subquery (`poverty_data`):**
   - For each year from 2015 to 2017 (corresponding to natality years 2016 to 2018), it selects:
     - **Year:** The natality year (`Year` column).
     - **County_FIPS:** Extracted from the census `geo_id` by removing the first 9 characters.
     - **Poverty_Rate:** Calculated as `(poverty / pop_determined_poverty_status) * 100`.
   - It ensures that `pop_determined_poverty_status` is greater than zero to avoid division by zero.
   - Combines the data using `UNION ALL` to create a complete dataset.

2. **Main Query:**
   - **Joins** the natality data with the poverty data on `County_FIPS` and `Year`.
   - **Filters** the natality data for years between 2016 and 2018.
   - **Calculates:**
     - **Total_Births:** Total number of births per county and year.
     - **Births_No_Morbidity:** Number of births without maternal morbidity.
     - **Percent_No_Morbidity:** The percentage of births without maternal morbidity, rounded to two decimal places.
   - **Groups** the data by `Year`, `County_FIPS`, and `Poverty_Rate`.
   - **Orders** the results by `Year` and `County_FIPS`.

**Notes:**

- **Handling Empty Columns:**
  - The query includes checks to ensure that divisions do not result in errors due to empty or zero values.
  - **NULLIF** is used to prevent division by zero in the poverty rate calculation.
  - The `Births` column is checked for `IS NOT NULL` to ensure accurate calculations.
  
- **Column Corrections:**
  - The `Percent_No_Morbidity` is calculated only if `Total_Births` is greater than zero.
  - Rounding is applied to present the percentage in a readable format.

This query provides a dataset that can be used to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between poverty rates and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity for each county and year from 2016 to 2018.

  CAST(n.County_of_Residence_FIPS AS STRING) = SUBSTR(c.geo_id, 10)
WHERE
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM n.Year) = 2016
GROUP BY
  Year, County_FIPS, Poverty_Rate
ORDER BY
  County_FIPS
LIMIT 100;
```

This simplified query retrieves data for the year 2016 and adjusts the join condition to ensure that the county FIPS codes match correctly between the natality and census data. The key adjustments made are:

- **Casting FIPS Codes:** Ensures that both `n.County_of_Residence_FIPS` and `SUBSTR(c.geo_id, 10)` are of the same data type (`STRING`) for accurate comparison.
- **Limiting to One Year:** Focuses on 2016 to simplify the query and ensure data retrieval.
- **Calculating Poverty Rate and Percentage of Births Without Maternal Morbidity:**
  - **Poverty_Rate:** Calculated as `(poverty / pop_determined_poverty_status) * 100`, rounded to two decimal places.
  - **Percent_No_Morbidity:** Calculated as `(Births_No_Morbidity / Total_Births) * 100`, rounded to two decimal places.

By simplifying the query and adjusting the join condition, we increase the likelihood of retrieving data to assess the relationship between poverty rates and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity in 2016.

Task: Could you assess the relationship between the poverty rates from the previous year's census data and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity for the years 2016 to 2018? Use only data for births where no maternal morbidity was reported and for each year, use the 5-year census data from the year before to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Pearson_Correlation_Coefficient
2016,value1:float
2017,value2:float
2018,value3:float
```

For each year from 2016 to 2018, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the poverty rates from the previous year's 5-year census data and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity. The poverty rates were obtained from the census data of the preceding year, and the percentages were calculated using birth data where no maternal morbidity was reported. This analysis assesses the relationship between poverty levels and maternal health outcomes over the specified years..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-22 22:54:18 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you assess the relationship between the poverty rates from the previous year's census data and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity for the years 2016 to 2018? Use only data for births where no maternal morbidity was reported and for each year, use the 5-year census data from the year before to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Pearson_Correlation_Coefficient
2016,value1:float
2017,value2:float
2018,value3:float
```

For each year from 2016 to 2018, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the poverty rates from the previous year's 5-year census data and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity. The poverty rates were obtained from the census data of the preceding year, and the percentages were calculated using birth data where no maternal morbidity was reported. This analysis assesses the relationship between poverty levels and maternal health outcomes over the specified years. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-22 22:55:41 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you assess the relationship between the poverty rates from the previous year's census data and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity for the years 2016 to 2018? Use only data for births where no maternal morbidity was reported and for each year, use the 5-year census data from the year before to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Pearson_Correlation_Coefficient
2016,value1:float
2017,value2:float
2018,value3:float
```

For each year from 2016 to 2018, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the poverty rates from the previous year's 5-year census data and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity. The poverty rates were obtained from the census data of the preceding year, and the percentages were calculated using birth data where no maternal morbidity was reported. This analysis assesses the relationship between poverty levels and maternal health outcomes over the specified years. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
