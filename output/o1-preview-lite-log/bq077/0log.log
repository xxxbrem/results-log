   SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date`) AS year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date`) AS month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count motor vehicle thefts per month and year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date`) AS year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date`) AS month, COUNT(*) AS theft_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
   GROUP BY year, month
   ORDER BY year, month
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List descriptions of motor vehicle thefts to understand incident details:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `description`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find motor vehicle thefts in specific community areas between 2010 and 2016:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `community_area`, COUNT(*) AS thefts_in_area
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT` AND `year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
   GROUP BY `community_area`
   ORDER BY thefts_in_area DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Retrieve the number of arrests made for motor vehicle thefts between 2010 and 2016:**

   GROUP BY `year`
   ORDER BY `year`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Identify the top locations where motor vehicle thefts occurred:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `location_description`, COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
   GROUP BY `location_description`
   ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

Task: For each year from 2010 to 2016, what is the highest number of motor thefts in one month?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the highest number of motor thefts in one month for each year from 2010 to 2016, you would analyze the data from the `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime` table. By filtering for motor vehicle thefts and aggregating the counts by month and year, the results can be presented in the following format:

```csv
Year,Highest_Number_of_Motor_Thefts_in_One_Month
2010,num:int
2011,num:int
2012,num:int
2013,num:int
2014,num:int
2015,num:int
2016,num:int
(Attention: answer in seven rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'chicago_crime': ['crime'], 'chicago_taxi_trips': ['taxi_trips']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
