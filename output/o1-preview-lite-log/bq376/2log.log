**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`**

   - `station_id`: To uniquely identify each bike share station; used to count stations.
   - `lat`, `lon`: Latitude and longitude of bike share stations; necessary for spatial joins.
   - `station_geom`: Geographical point of the station; used for spatial operations with neighborhoods.

2. **`bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents`**

   - `unique_key`: Unique identifier for each crime incident; used to count incidents.
   - `latitude`, `longitude`: Geographic coordinates of crime incidents; used for spatial joins.
   - `category`: Type of crime incident; useful for categorizing incidents.

3. **`bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries`**

   - `neighborhood`: Name of the neighborhood; used for grouping results.
   - `neighborhood_geom`: Geographical polygon of the neighborhood; used for spatial operations with points.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Spatial Joins:** Use `ST_CONTAINS` to determine if a point (bike station or crime incident) is within a neighborhood polygon.
  - Example: `ST_CONTAINS(neighborhood_geom, ST_GEOGPOINT(lon, lat))`

Task: For each neighborhood in San Francisco, list the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Neighborhood,Number_of_Bike_Share_Stations,Total_Number_of_Crime_Incidents
neighborhood1:str,num_stations1:int,num_incidents1:int
neighborhood2:str,num_stations2:int,num_incidents2:int
...
```

This table lists, for each neighborhood in San Francisco, the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'san_francisco_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'san_francisco_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_regions', 'bikeshare_station_info', 'bikeshare_station_status', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'san_francisco_film_locations': ['film_locations'], 'san_francisco_neighborhoods': ['boundaries'], 'san_francisco_sffd_service_calls': ['sffd_service_calls'], 'san_francisco_sfpd_incidents': ['sfpd_incidents'], 'san_francisco_transit_muni': ['calendar', 'fares', 'routes', 'shapes', 'stop_monitoring', 'stop_times', 'stops', 'trips', 'vehicle_monitoring'], 'san_francisco_trees': ['street_trees']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Neighborhood,Number_of_Bike_Share_Stations,Total_Number_of_Crime_Incidents
neighborhood1:str,num_stations1:int,num_incidents1:int
neighborhood2:str,num_stations2:int,num_incidents2:int
...
```
