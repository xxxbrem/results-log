After comparing the two SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **`2result.sql`** accurately fulfills the requirement by:
  - Identifying each user's **first non-cancelled order** using a subquery that selects the minimum `created_at` date where the order status is not 'Cancelled'.
  - Selecting **order items** from these first orders where the item status is **neither 'Returned' nor 'Cancelled'**, ensuring that only valid purchases are considered.
  - Calculating the **number of unique customers** per product category based on these order items.
  - Determining the **product category with the highest number of first-time purchasers**.
  - Computing the **total revenue** from the order items in the first orders for the identified category.

- The SQL script is methodically structured with clear **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
  - **`first_orders`**: Captures the first non-cancelled order for each user.
  - **`first_order_items`**: Retrieves the non-returned and non-cancelled items from these orders and associates them with their product categories.
  - **`category_customer_counts`**: Counts the number of unique customers per category.
  - **`max_category`**: Identifies the category with the highest customer count.
  - **`category_revenue`**: Calculates the total revenue for the identified category.

- By excluding **'Returned'** and **'Cancelled'** items upfront in the **`first_order_items`** CTE, the script ensures that all subsequent calculations are based on valid order items.

- The query is efficient, clear, and aligns precisely with the task requirements.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

2result.sql
