Upon comparing the SQL queries and their results, **Option 0 (`0result.sql`)** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Option 0** first calculates the **start and end positions of the BRCA1 gene** using the dataset where `vep1.SYMBOL` is 'brca1'. It selects the minimum `start_position` and maximum `end_position` to define the gene region.
  
- It then retrieves **missense variants** (`'missense_variant'`) within this BRCA1 gene region. By using the calculated `brca1_gene_start` and `brca1_gene_end`, it ensures that only variants within the BRCA1 gene are selected.
  
- The query extracts the `Protein_Position` by splitting and casting it as `INT64`, allowing for accurate ordering based on protein position.
  
- Results are **ordered by `Protein_Position`**, effectively retrieving the first missense variants based on their position within the protein sequence.

**Option 1** and **Option 2** do not calculate the BRCA1 gene's start and end positions. They directly query based on a preset genomic range or simply filter by `vep.SYMBOL = 'BRCA1'`, which may not accurately represent the gene's exact boundaries in the dataset.

Therefore, **Option 0** is the SQL query that fulfills all the requirements specified in the task.
