Task: I would like to merge NCAA basketball historical tournament games outcomes with additional pace and efficiency performance metrics to enable comprehensive analysis of team and opponent dynamics from the 2014 season onwards (2018 included). Please refer to the Query Variable Guide to provide all the data.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Sure! Here's the merged data in CSV format:

```csv
season,label,seed,school_ncaa,opponent_seed,opponent_school_ncaa,pace_rank,poss_40min,pace_rating,efficiency_rank,pts_100poss,efficiency_rating,opp_pace_rank,opp_poss_40min,opp_pace_rating,opp_efficiency_rank,opp_pts_100poss,opp_efficiency_rating,pace_rank_diff,pace_stat_diff,pace_rating_diff,eff_rank_diff,eff_stat_diff,eff_rating_diff
season:int,label:str (win/loss),seed:str,school_ncaa:str,opponent_seed:str,opponent_school_ncaa:str,pace_rank:int,poss_40min:float,pace_rating:float,efficiency_rank:int,pts_100poss:float,efficiency_rating:float,opp_pace_rank:int,opp_poss_40min:float,opp_pace_rating:float,opp_efficiency_rank:int,opp_pts_100poss:float,opp_efficiency_rating:float,pace_rank_diff:int,pace_stat_diff:float,pace_rating_diff:float,eff_rank_diff:int,eff_stat_diff:float,eff_rating_diff:float
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Columns:**
  - **season**: Year of the NCAA tournament season.
  - **label**: Outcome of the game for the team ("win" or "loss").
  - **seed**: Seed ranking of the team.
  - **school_ncaa**: NCAA school/team of the team.
  - **opponent_seed**: Seed ranking of the opponent team.
  - **opponent_school_ncaa**: NCAA school/team of the opponent.
  - **pace_rank**: Team's rank in pace (possessions over time).
  - **poss_40min**: Average number of possessions over a 40-minute game for the team.
  - **pace_rating**: Team's pace performance rating.
  - **efficiency_rank**: Team's rank in scoring efficiency.
  - **pts_100poss**: Points scored per 100 possessions by the team.
  - **efficiency_rating**: Team's overall efficiency rating.
  - **opp_pace_rank**: Opponent's pace rank.
  - **opp_poss_40min**: Opponent's possessions over 40 minutes.
  - **opp_pace_rating**: Opponent's pace rating.
  - **opp_efficiency_rank**: Opponent's efficiency rank.
  - **opp_pts_100poss**: Opponent's points per 100 possessions.
  - **opp_efficiency_rating**: Opponent's efficiency rating.
  - **pace_rank_diff**: Difference between opponent's and team's pace ranks.
  - **pace_stat_diff**: Difference in possessions per 40 minutes.
  - **pace_rating_diff**: Difference in pace ratings.
  - **eff_rank_diff**: Difference between opponent's and team's efficiency ranks.
  - **eff_stat_diff**: Difference in points per 100 possessions.
  - **eff_rating_diff**: Difference in efficiency ratings.

- **Rows:**
  - Each row represents a team in a tournament game from 2014 to 2018.
  - Includes both the team's and the opponent's performance metrics.
  - Differences are calculated as opponent's metric minus team's metric.

**Note:** The `...` indicates that there are multiple records in the dataset. Actual data values would be filled in based on the datasets for the specified seasons..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'data-to-insights': {'ncaa': ['2018_tournament_results', '2019_tournament_seeds', 'adjusted_metrics', 'feature_engineering', 'mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'metric_names', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

```

**Explanation:**

- **Common Table Expression (CTE) `games`:**
  - Combines the tournament games data from 2014 to 2018.
  - Creates two rows per game: one for the winning team labeled 'win' and one for the losing team labeled 'loss'.
  - Columns include season, label, seed, school_ncaa, opponent_seed, and opponent_school_ncaa.

- **Main SELECT Statement:**
  - Joins the `games` CTE with the `feature_engineering` table twice:
    - Once to get the team's metrics (`tm`).
    - Once to get the opponent's metrics (`om`).
  - Calculates the differences between the opponent's and team's metrics.
  - Uses `SAFE_CAST` to ensure that any null values in rankings do not cause errors during subtraction.

- **Columns Selected:**
  - **Game and Team Information:**
    - `season`, `label`, `seed`, `school_ncaa`, `opponent_seed`, `opponent_school_ncaa`.
  - **Team Performance Metrics:**
    - `tm.pace_rank`, `tm.poss_40min`, `tm.pace_rating`, `tm.efficiency_rank`, `tm.pts_100poss`, `tm.efficiency_rating`.
  - **Opponent Performance Metrics:**
    - `om.pace_rank AS opp_pace_rank`, `om.poss_40min AS opp_poss_40min`, `om.pace_rating AS opp_pace_rating`, `om.efficiency_rank AS opp_efficiency_rank`, `om.pts_100poss AS opp_pts_100poss`, `om.efficiency_rating AS opp_efficiency_rating`.
  - **Differences in Metrics:**
    - `pace_rank_diff`, `pace_stat_diff`, `pace_rating_diff`, `eff_rank_diff`, `eff_stat_diff`, `eff_rating_diff`.

This query will produce a comprehensive dataset that includes game outcomes along with pace and efficiency metrics for both teams, enabling an in-depth analysis of team dynamics during NCAA basketball tournaments from 2014 to 2018.
