Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve this task, we need to identify the driver and constructor who scored the most points in each year. 

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **races**
   - **"race_id"**: Used to join with other tables.
   - **"year"**: The year the race took place.
   
2. **results**
   - **"race_id"**: To join with the "races" table to get the year.
   - **"driver_id"**: Identifies the driver in each race.
   - **"constructor_id"**: Identifies the constructor in each race.
   - **"points"**: Points earned by the driver (and constructor) in that race.
   
3. **drivers**
   - **"driver_id"**: Used to join with the "results" table.
   - **"forename"**: Driver's first name.
   - **"surname"**: Driver's last name.
   - **"full_name"**: Full name of the driver (combination of forename and surname).

4. **constructors**
   - **"constructor_id"**: Used to join with the "results" table.
   - **"name"**: Name of the constructor.

**Potential Usage:**

- Use **"results.points"** to calculate the total points per driver and constructor.
- Use **"races.year"** to group the points by year.
- Use **"drivers.full_name"** to get the full name of each driver.
- Use **"constructors.name"** to get the name of each constructor.

**Conditions:**

- Join **"results"** with **"races"** on **"race_id"** to get the corresponding year for each result.
- Join **"results"** with **"drivers"** and **"constructors"** to get their names.
- Group by **"year"** and **"driver_id"** or **"constructor_id"** to sum the points per year.
- Identify the driver and constructor with the maximum total points per year.

---

**Sample SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **List all distinct years in which races took place:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year" FROM "races" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve the full names of all drivers:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "full_name" FROM "drivers" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all constructor names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name" FROM "constructors" LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get the points earned by each driver in a specific race (e.g., race_id = 1):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "points" 
   FROM "results" 
   WHERE "race_id" = 1 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate the total points for each driver across all races:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM "results"
   GROUP BY "driver_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate the total points for each constructor across all races:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM "results"
   GROUP BY "constructor_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get the total points earned by each driver per year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT r."driver_id", ra."year", SUM(r."points") AS "total_points"
   FROM "results" r
   JOIN "races" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
   GROUP BY ra."year", r."driver_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get the total points earned by each constructor per year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT r."constructor_id", ra."year", SUM(r."points") AS "total_points"
   FROM "results" r
   JOIN "races" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
   GROUP BY ra."year", r."constructor_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve the full name of drivers along with their total points per year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ra."year", d."full_name", SUM(r."points") AS "total_points"
   FROM "results" r
   JOIN "races" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
   JOIN "drivers" d ON r."driver_id" = d."driver_id"
   GROUP BY ra."year", d."full_name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve the name of constructors along with their total points per year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT ra."year", c."name", SUM(r."points") AS "total_points"
    FROM "results" r
    JOIN "races" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
    JOIN "constructors" c ON r."constructor_id" = c."constructor_id"
    GROUP BY ra."year", c."name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Find the driver with the most points in each year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT t."year", t."driver_id", t."total_points"
    FROM (
      SELECT ra."year", r."driver_id", SUM(r."points") AS "total_points"
      FROM "results" r
      JOIN "races" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
      GROUP BY ra."year", r."driver_id"
    ) t
    WHERE t."total_points" = (

13. **List the top 3 drivers with the most points in a specific year (e.g., 2019):**
    ```sql
    SELECT d."full_name", SUM(r."points") AS "total_points"
    FROM "results" r
    JOIN "races" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
    JOIN "drivers" d ON r."driver_id" = d."driver_id"
    WHERE ra."year" = 2019
    GROUP BY d."full_name"
    ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

14. **List the top 3 constructors with the most points in a specific year (e.g., 2019):**
    ```sql
    SELECT c."name", SUM(r."points") AS "total_points"
    FROM "results" r
    JOIN "races" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
    JOIN "constructors" c ON r."constructor_id" = c."constructor_id"
    WHERE ra."year" = 2019
    GROUP BY c."name"
    ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

15. **Get the total number of races each year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "year", COUNT("race_id") AS "number_of_races"
    FROM "races"
    GROUP BY "year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

16. **Retrieve the full name of drivers along with the number of races they participated in each year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT ra."year", d."full_name", COUNT(DISTINCT r."race_id") AS "races_participated"
    FROM "results" r
    JOIN "races" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
    JOIN "drivers" d ON r."driver_id" = d."driver_id"
    GROUP BY ra."year", d."full_name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

17. **Calculate the average points per race for each driver in a specific year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT d."full_name", AVG(r."points") AS "average_points"
    FROM "results" r
    JOIN "races" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
    JOIN "drivers" d ON r."driver_id" = d."driver_id"
    WHERE ra."year" = 2019
    GROUP BY d."full_name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

18. **Get the greatest number of wins by a driver in a single year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT d."full_name", ra."year", COUNT(r."position") AS "wins"
    FROM "results" r
    JOIN "races" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
    JOIN "drivers" d ON r."driver_id" = d."driver_id"
    WHERE r."position" = 1
    GROUP BY d."full_name", ra."year"
    ORDER BY "wins" DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

19. **List drivers who have won at least one race in a given year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT d."full_name"
    FROM "results" r
    JOIN "races" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
    JOIN "drivers" d ON r."driver_id" = d."driver_id"
    WHERE ra."year" = 2019 AND r."position" = 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

20. **Retrieve constructors and the number of races they won in each year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT c."name", ra."year", COUNT(r."position") AS "wins"
    FROM "results" r
    JOIN "races" ra ON r."race_id" = ra."race_id"
    JOIN "constructors" c ON r."constructor_id" = c."constructor_id"
    WHERE r."position" = 1
    GROUP BY c."name", ra."year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries explore different aspects of the data related to drivers, constructors, races, and points, which are essential to determine the drivers and constructors with the most points each year.

---

Now, using the insights gained from these queries, we can proceed to identify, for each year, the driver and constructor who scored the most points, including the full name of each driver.

```csv
Year,Driver_Name,Constructor_Name
year1:int,driver_name1:str,constructor_name1:str
year2:int,driver_name2:str,constructor_name2:str
...
```

**(Attention: answer in multiple rows, one for each year)**

This format will provide, for each year, the full name of the driver and the name of the constructor who scored the most points.Query:

Task: For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the driver and constructor who scored the most points each year, we aggregate the total points for each driver and constructor per year and then identify the ones with the highest points.

```csv
Year,Driver_Name,Constructor_Name
year1:int,driver_name1:str,constructor_name1:str
year2:int,driver_name2:str,constructor_name2:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 19:55:08 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the driver and constructor who scored the most points each year, we aggregate the total points for each driver and constructor per year and then identify the ones with the highest points.

```csv
Year,Driver_Name,Constructor_Name
year1:int,driver_name1:str,constructor_name1:str
