After reviewing the provided SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct query for calculating the percentage of traffic accidents from January to August 2015 that involved multiple people and had multiple instances of severe injuries (injury severity 4). Here's the reasoning:

### Reasoning:

1. **Accurate Identification of Unique Accidents:**

   - **`1result.sql`** uses `CONCAT(state_number, '-', consecutive_number)` to uniquely identify each accident. This is crucial because `consecutive_number` alone may not be unique across different states.
   - By combining `state_number` and `consecutive_number`, we ensure that each accident is counted accurately without duplication.
   - **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** only use `consecutive_number` to identify accidents, which may lead to incorrect counts due to possible overlaps of `consecutive_number` in different states.

2. **Consistent Calculation Across All Steps:**

   - Both the total number of accidents and the number of accidents meeting the criteria are calculated using the same unique identifier (`CONCAT(state_number, '-', consecutive_number)`) in **`1result.sql`**.
   - This consistency ensures that the percentage is calculated accurately.

3. **Accurate Grouping and Aggregation:**

   - The grouping by `state_number` and `consecutive_number` in **`1result.sql`** correctly aggregates data per unique accident.
   - This enables accurate counting of persons involved and severe injuries per accident, which is essential for the criteria specified.

4. **Final Percentage Calculation:**

   - The calculated percentage in **`1result.sql`** reflects the accurate proportion of accidents that meet the specified conditions out of the total number of unique accidents from January to August 2015.

### Conclusion:

Due to the accurate identification of unique accidents and consistent methodology throughout the query, **`1result.sql`** provides the correct calculation for the percentage in question.
