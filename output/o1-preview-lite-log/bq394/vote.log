Comparing the two SQL queries and their results, both produce the same output. However, **`1result.sql`** is more organized and readable because it uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the monthly averages first before computing the sum of absolute differences. This modular approach enhances clarity and maintainability of the code. Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.
