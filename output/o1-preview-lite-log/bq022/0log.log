Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`

  - **Columns:**
    - `trip_seconds`: **Potential Usage** - Represents the trip duration in seconds. We'll use this to calculate trip duration in minutes, which is needed for grouping trips into quantiles.
    - `fare`: **Potential Usage** - The fare for each trip. This is required to calculate the average fare for each quantile group.
    - `trip_total`: **Potential Usage** - Total cost of the trip, including fare, tips, tolls, and extras. Could be used to analyze overall cost if needed.
    - `trip_start_timestamp`, `trip_end_timestamp`: **Potential Usage** - Timestamps for when the trip started and ended. Not directly needed since `trip_seconds` provides trip duration, but could be used for additional time-based analyses.
    - `payment_type`: **Potential Usage** - Information about payment methods. Could be useful for understanding fare patterns or anomalies.
  
- **Conditions:**
  - **Trip Duration Filter:** `trip_seconds > 0 AND trip_seconds <= 3600` - To consider only trips between 0 and 60 minutes (since 60 minutes * 60 seconds = 3600 seconds).
  - **Data Quality Checks:** Exclude trips with `NULL` or negative `trip_seconds` values.

---

**BigQuery SQL Queries:**

1. **Query 1:** Retrieve sample `trip_seconds` and corresponding `fare` values for trips between 0 and 60 minutes.

   ```sql
   SELECT trip_seconds, fare
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds > 0 AND trip_seconds <= 3600
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Query 2:** Get distinct `trip_seconds` values to understand the distribution of trip durations.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT trip_seconds
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY trip_seconds ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Query 3:** Convert `trip_seconds` to rounded minutes for trips between 0 and 60 minutes.

   ```sql
   SELECT ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS trip_minutes
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds > 0 AND trip_seconds <= 3600
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Query 4:** Calculate the average fare for trips of different durations within the specified range.

   ```sql
   SELECT ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) AS trip_minutes, AVG(fare) AS average_fare
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds > 0 AND trip_seconds <= 3600
   GROUP BY trip_minutes
   ORDER BY trip_minutes ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Query 5:** Find the minimum and maximum `trip_seconds` to understand the range of trip durations.

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(trip_seconds) AS min_trip_seconds, MAX(trip_seconds) AS max_trip_seconds
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds IS NOT NULL;
   ```

6. **Query 6:** Count the total number of trips between 0 and 60 minutes.

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_trips
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds > 0 AND trip_seconds <= 3600;
   ```

7. **Query 7:** Examine trips with `NULL` or zero `trip_seconds` to assess data quality.

   ```sql
   SELECT trip_seconds, fare
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds IS NULL OR trip_seconds = 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Query 8:** Retrieve sample `fare` and `trip_total` values to compare fare components.

   ```sql
   SELECT fare, trip_total
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE fare IS NOT NULL AND trip_total IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Query 9:** Get the payment types used for trips between 0 and 60 minutes.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT payment_type
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE trip_seconds > 0 AND trip_seconds <= 3600
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Query 10:** Identify trips longer than 60 minutes to understand distributions beyond the specified range.

    ```sql
    SELECT trip_seconds, fare
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE trip_seconds > 3600
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Query 11:** Analyze the distribution of `fare` amounts for trips between 0 and 60 minutes.

    ```sql
    SELECT fare
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE trip_seconds > 0 AND trip_seconds <= 3600
    ORDER BY fare DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Query 12:** Get the average `trip_total` for each payment type.

    ```sql
    SELECT payment_type, AVG(trip_total) AS average_total
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE trip_seconds > 0 AND trip_seconds <= 3600
    GROUP BY payment_type
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Query 13:** Find the number of trips per `taxi_id` to see if certain taxis have more trips.

    ```sql
    SELECT taxi_id, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    GROUP BY taxi_id
    ORDER BY trip_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    SELECT trip_miles, trip_seconds
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE trip_seconds > 0 AND trip_miles > 0
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Query 15:** List trips with unusually high fares for their duration.

Task: Calculate the minimum and maximum trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number), total number of trips, and average fare for each of six equal quantile groups based on trip duration, considering only trips between 0 and 60 minutes.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Quantile_Group,Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Total_Number_of_Trips,Average_Fare
1,min_duration1:int,max_duration1:int,total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float
2,min_duration2:int,max_duration2:int,total_trips2:int,average_fare2:float
3,min_duration3:int,max_duration3:int,total_trips3:int,average_fare3:float
4,min_duration4:int,max_duration4:int,total_trips4:int,average_fare4:float
5,min_duration5:int,max_duration5:int,total_trips5:int,average_fare5:float
6,min_duration6:int,max_duration6:int,total_trips6:int,average_fare6:float
```

**Explanation:**

The table above represents six equal quantile groups based on trip duration for taxi trips between 0 and 60 minutes. For each quantile group, it displays:

- **Quantile_Group**: The group number (from 1 to 6).
- **Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes**: The minimum trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number) within the quantile.
- **Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes**: The maximum trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number) within the quantile.
- **Total_Number_of_Trips**: The total number of trips within the quantile.
- **Average_Fare**: The average fare for trips within the quantile..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'chicago_crime': ['crime'], 'chicago_taxi_trips': ['taxi_trips']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-29 19:25:31 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Calculate the minimum and maximum trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number), total number of trips, and average fare for each of six equal quantile groups based on trip duration, considering only trips between 0 and 60 minutes., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Quantile_Group,Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Total_Number_of_Trips,Average_Fare

**Explanation:**

The table above represents six equal quantile groups based on trip duration for taxi trips between 0 and 60 minutes. For each quantile group, it displays:

- **Quantile_Group**: The group number (from 1 to 6).
- **Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes**: The minimum trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number) within the quantile.
- **Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes**: The maximum trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number) within the quantile.
- **Total_Number_of_Trips**: The total number of trips within the quantile.
- **Average_Fare**: The average fare for trips within the quantile. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
