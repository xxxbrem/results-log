After comparing both SQL queries, the correct SQL for the task is **`0result.sql`**.

**Reason:**

The task requires us to:

- **Group trips into six equal quantile groups based on trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number)**.
- **Calculate the minimum and maximum trip duration in minutes**, total number of trips, and average fare for each quantile group.
- **Consider only trips between 0 and 60 minutes**.

The **`0result.sql`** query correctly accomplishes this by:

1. **Calculating `trip_minutes`** as `ROUND(trip_seconds / 60)` to get the trip duration in minutes, rounded to the nearest whole number.
2. **Using `NTILE(6) OVER (ORDER BY trip_minutes)`** to partition the data into six equal quantile groups based on the rounded trip duration in minutes.
3. **Grouping and aggregating** the data to find the minimum and maximum trip durations, total number of trips, and average fare for each quantile group.

In contrast, the **`2result.sql`** query:

- Uses `NTILE(6) OVER (ORDER BY trip_seconds)`, which partitions the data based on trip duration in seconds, not in rounded minutes.
- This does not align with the requirement of grouping trips based on **trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number)**.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that precisely meets the task requirements.
