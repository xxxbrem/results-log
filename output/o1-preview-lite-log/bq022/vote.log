After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I recommend choosing `1result.sql` as the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Null Checks:** The first query (`1result.sql`) includes an explicit check for `fare IS NOT NULL` in the WHERE clause. While `fare > 0` will exclude NULL values since NULL comparisons result in NULL (which is treated as false in WHERE clauses), explicitly checking for NULL values is a good practice for code clarity and maintenance.

- **Calculation Consistency:** In `1result.sql`, `trip_duration_minutes` is calculated once in the inner subquery and then used consistently throughout the query. This enhances readability and ensures that the same rounded trip duration is used in both the NTILE calculation and the grouping.

- **Rounding Method:** Both queries use `ROUND(trip_seconds / 60)`, but `1result.sql` performs this calculation in a subquery, which can prevent potential discrepancies or misalignments during the NTILE partitioning.

- **Results Comparison:** The differences in average fares between the two queries are minimal and likely due to slight variations in data handling or rounding. However, the first query's approach is more precise due to its explicit handling of NULL values and consistent calculation methods.
