I choose `1result.sql` as the correct answer because it properly selects the longest route distance without unnecessary quotation marks around the alias. Since the alias `Longest_route_distance_km` does not contain any special characters or spaces, quotes are not required. Using quotes when they are not needed can be considered less conventional in SQL syntax.

**Selected SQL file:**
