This query finds the state with the highest total acreage in the latest evaluations for both timberland and forestland categories. It provides the `state_code`, `evaluation_group`, `state_name` (placeholder), `total_acres`, and the `category` (Timberland or Forestland) for the top state in each category.

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- Replaced the use of `SUM(ps.expansion_factor)` with `SUM(peu.land_area_within_the_estimation_unit)` to accurately calculate total acres.
- Simplified the query to avoid complex `ORDER BY` expressions that could cause errors.
- Ensured that we select the latest evaluation per state and category by using row numbering (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER`).
- Provided a single query in the required `sql` format without additional analysis or multiple SQL statements.

**Note:** Replace `'State Name'` with the actual state name if you have a mapping from `state_code` to state names.

  current_diameter FLOAT64  of the sample tree at the point of diameter measurement. DIA is measured at either breast height (DBH) or at root collar (DRC). DBH is usually measured at 4.5 feet above the ground line on the uphill side of the tree. DRC is measured on woodland species (often multi-stemmed) at the ground line or at the stem root collar, whichever is higher. DRC is computed using the following formula: DRC = SQRT [SUM (stem diameter2)] For additional information about where the tree diameter is measured, see Diameter height code or Height to diameter measurement point.

Reserved land is permanently prohibited from being managed for the production of wood products through statute or agency mandate; the prohibition cannot be changed through decision of the land manager. Logging may occur to meet protected area objectives. Examples include designated federal Wilderness areas, National Parks and Monuments, and most State Parks. Private land cannot be reserved. RESERVCD differs from RESERVCD_5, which stores reserved status based on the previous definition. See appendix N for applications of RESERVCD by FIA region and State.

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'usfs_fia': ['condition', 'plot', 'plot_tree', 'population', 'population_estimation_unit', 'population_evaluation', 'population_evaluation_group', 'population_evaluation_type', 'population_stratum', 'population_stratum_assign', 'tree']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure, let's start by identifying the relevant tables, columns, and potential conditions for the task.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`population_evaluation`**
   - **`evaluation_sequence_number`**: Identifies each evaluation; needed to join with other tables.
   - **`evaluation_group_sequence_number`**: Groups evaluations; required to get the evaluation group.
   - **`state_code`**: Identifies the state; needed to group by state.
   - **`state_code_name`**: Provides the state name; if available.
   - **`timberland_only`**: Indicates if the evaluation is for timberland; used to filter timberland evaluations.
   - **`land_only`**: Indicates if the evaluation is for forestland; used to filter forestland evaluations.
   - **`end_inventory_year`**: Ending year of the evaluation; used to select the latest evaluations.

2. **`population_estimation_unit`**
   - **`evaluation_sequence_number`**: Links to `population_evaluation`; used in JOIN operations.
   - **`estimation_unit_sequence_number`**: Identifies the estimation unit.
   - **`state_code`**: Identifies the state.
   - **`land_area_within_the_estimation_unit`**: Total land area; used to calculate total acres.

3. **`population_evaluation_group`**
   - **`evaluation_group_sequence_number`**: Identifies the evaluation group.
   - **`evaluation_group_description`**: Describes the evaluation group.

4. **State Name Mapping** (External or within the dataset)
   - **`state_code`** to **`state_name`**: Needed to display state names.

**Potential Conditions:**

- **For the Latest Evaluations:**
  - Use the maximum `end_inventory_year` per state and category (timberland and forestland).
- **For Timberland Evaluations:**
  - **`timberland_only = 'Y'`**
- **For Forestland Evaluations:**
  - **`land_only = 'Y'`**

Task: Given the latest evaluations of timberland and forestland plots, which state within each category has the highest total acreage? Please provide the state code, the evaluation group, the state name, and the total acres for the top state in each category.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
state_code,evaluation_group,state_name,total_acres
state_code:int,evaluation_group:int,state_name:str,total_acres:float
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

The table above provides the state code, evaluation group, state name, and total acres for the states with the highest total acreage in each category (timberland and forestland). Since specific data values are not provided, the metanames and their data types are listed..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'usfs_fia': ['condition', 'plot', 'plot_tree', 'population', 'population_estimation_unit', 'population_evaluation', 'population_evaluation_group', 'population_evaluation_type', 'population_stratum', 'population_stratum_assign', 'tree']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 11:25:28 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Given the latest evaluations of timberland and forestland plots, which state within each category has the highest total acreage? Please provide the state code, the evaluation group, the state name, and the total acres for the top state in each category., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

```

The table above provides the state code, evaluation group, state name, and total acres for the states with the highest total acreage in each category (timberland and forestland). Since specific data values are not provided, the metanames and their data types are listed. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
