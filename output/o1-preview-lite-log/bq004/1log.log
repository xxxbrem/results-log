2025-01-28 05:10:34 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-28 05:10:34 - root - INFO - I apologize for the error in the SQL query. The issue arises because, in BigQuery, the `STRING()` function is not used to convert an `INT64` to a `STRING`. Instead, you should use `CAST()` to perform this conversion.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT product.v2ProductName
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS sessions,
  UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
  UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
WHERE CONCAT(fullVisitorId, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(fullVisitorId, CAST(visitId AS STRING))
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`,
    UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
    UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
  WHERE LOWER(product.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
    AND hits.eCommerceAction.action_type = "6"
)
  AND hits.eCommerceAction.action_type = "6"
LIMIT 100
```

**Explanation:**

- **Issue:** The `STRING()` function in BigQuery is used to convert specific data types such as `TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, or `JSON` to a string. It does not accept an `INT64` type as an argument, which is why you received the error.

- **Solution:** Use `CAST(visitId AS STRING)` instead of `STRING(visitId)` to convert the integer `visitId` to a string.

**Updated Queries with Corrections:**

1. **List all products purchased in July 2017:**

   )
     AND hits.eCommerceAction.action_type = "6"
   LIMIT 100
   ```

5. **Find other products purchased with YouTube products (excluding YouTube products):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT product.v2ProductName
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS sessions,
     UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
     UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
   WHERE CONCAT(fullVisitorId, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(fullVisitorId, CAST(visitId AS STRING))
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`,
       UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
       UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
     WHERE LOWER(product.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
       AND hits.eCommerceAction.action_type = "6"
   )
     AND LOWER(product.v2ProductName) NOT LIKE '%youtube%'
     AND hits.eCommerceAction.action_type = "6"
   LIMIT 100
   ```

6. **Count of other products purchased with YouTube products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT product.v2ProductName, COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Purchases
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS sessions,
     UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
     UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
   WHERE CONCAT(fullVisitorId, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(fullVisitorId, CAST(visitId AS STRING))
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`,
       UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
       UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
     WHERE LOWER(product.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
       AND hits.eCommerceAction.action_type = "6"
   )
     AND LOWER(product.v2ProductName) NOT LIKE '%youtube%'
     AND hits.eCommerceAction.action_type = "6"
   GROUP BY product.v2ProductName
   ORDER BY Number_of_Purchases DESC
   LIMIT 100
   ```

7. **Identify the most popular other product purchased with YouTube products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT product.v2ProductName, COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Purchases
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS sessions,
     UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
     UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
   WHERE CONCAT(fullVisitorId, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(fullVisitorId, CAST(visitId AS STRING))
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`,
       UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
       UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
     WHERE LOWER(product.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
       AND hits.eCommerceAction.action_type = "6"
   )
     AND LOWER(product.v2ProductName) NOT LIKE '%youtube%'
     AND hits.eCommerceAction.action_type = "6"
   GROUP BY product.v2ProductName
   ORDER BY Number_of_Purchases DESC
   LIMIT 1
   ```

---

**Final Answer:**

```csv
Product_Name,Number_of_Purchases
[Most_Popular_Product], [Number_of_Purchases]
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected SQL query (Query #7 above) will retrieve the most popular other product purchased in July 2017 by consumers who bought products relevant to YouTube. Replace `[Most_Popular_Product]` and `[Number_of_Purchases]` with the actual product name and the number of times it was purchased, based on the query results.

**Note:** Since I cannot execute the query to obtain actual values, please run the corrected query to get the specific product name and purchase count.

## Documents about Google Analytics Sample - ga_sessions

This article explains the format and schema of the data that is imported into BigQuery.

## Datasets

For each Analytics view that is enabled for BigQuery integration, a dataset is added using the view ID as the name.

## Tables

Within each dataset, a table is imported for each day of export. Daily tables have the format "ga\_sessions\_YYYYMMDD".

Intraday data is imported at least three times a day. Intraday tables have the format "ga\_sessions\_intraday\_YYYYMMDD". During the same day, each import of intraday data overwrites the previous import in the same table.

When the daily import is complete, the intraday table from the previous day is deleted. For the current day, until the first intraday import, there is no intraday table. If an intraday-table write fails, then the previous day's intraday table is preserved.

Data for the current day is not final until the daily import is complete. You may notice differences between intraday and daily data based on active user sessions that cross the time boundary of last intraday import.

## Rows

Each row within a table corresponds to a session in Analytics 360.

## Columns

The columns within the export are listed below. In BigQuery, some columns may have nested fields and messages within them.

Task: What's the most popular other purchased product in July 2017 with consumers who bought products relevant to YouTube?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name,Number_of_Purchases
[Most_Popular_Product], [Number_of_Purchases]
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:** The table above shows the most popular other product purchased in July 2017 by consumers who bought products relevant to YouTube. The `Product_Name` represents the name of the product, and `Number_of_Purchases` indicates how many times it was purchased by these consumers during that period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-28 05:11:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What's the most popular other purchased product in July 2017 with consumers who bought products relevant to YouTube?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product_Name,Number_of_Purchases
[Most_Popular_Product], [Number_of_Purchases]
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:** The table above shows the most popular other product purchased in July 2017 by consumers who bought products relevant to YouTube. The `Product_Name` represents the name of the product, and `Number_of_Purchases` indicates how many times it was purchased by these consumers during that period. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
