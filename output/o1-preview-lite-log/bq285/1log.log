  description=""The legal/statistical area description (LSAD) codes describe the particular typology for each geographic entity. For legal entities, the LSAD reflects the term that appears in legal documentation pertaining to the entity, such as a treaty, charter, legislation, resolution, or ordinance. For statistical entities, the LSAD is the term assigned by the Census Bureau or other agency defining the entity. The LSAD code is a two-character field that corresponds to a description of the legal or statistical type of entity and identifies whether the LSAD term should be capitalized and should precede or follow the name of the geographic entity. Note that the same LSAD code is assigned to entities at different levels of the geographic hierarchy when they share the same LSAD. For example, the Census Bureau assigns the same LSAD code (\""21\"") to boroughs in New York and Connecticut, although they are county subdivisions in the former and incorporated places in the latter.\n\nThese codes can be found in the TIGER/Line products, gazetteer files, and other products.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine the zip code in Florida with the highest number of bank institutions, we need to consider relevant tables, columns, and conditions.

**Relevant Table:**

- `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `state`: Used to filter records for Florida (`state = 'FL'`).
- `zip_code`: Used to group branches by zip code.
- `fdic_certificate_number`: Unique identifier for each bank institution; used to count unique institutions in each zip code.
- `institution_name`: Name of the bank institution.
- `branch_name`: Name of the branch; could be used to count branches.
- `branch_city`: City where the branch is located; could be used for additional filtering or grouping.
- `branch_county`: County where the branch is located; could be used for additional analysis.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `WHERE state = 'FL'`: To filter for branches located in Florida.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all zip codes in the `locations` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT zip_code
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all distinct states in the `locations` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT state
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all bank branches in Florida:**

   ```sql
   SELECT institution_name, branch_name, branch_city, zip_code
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List all distinct zip codes in Florida:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT zip_code
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count the number of branches per zip code in Florida:**

   ```sql
   SELECT zip_code, COUNT(*) AS branch_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   GROUP BY zip_code
   ORDER BY branch_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count the number of unique bank institutions per zip code in Florida:**

   ```sql
   SELECT zip_code, COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) AS institution_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   GROUP BY zip_code
   ORDER BY institution_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find the zip code with the highest number of bank institutions in Florida:**

   ```sql
   SELECT zip_code, COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) AS institution_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   GROUP BY zip_code
   ORDER BY institution_count DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

8. **List bank institutions in the top zip code in Florida:**

   (Assuming the top zip code is '33131' based on previous analysis.)

   ```sql
   SELECT institution_name, branch_name, branch_city, zip_code
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL' AND zip_code = '33131'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List zip codes and cities in Florida with more than 10 bank institutions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT zip_code, branch_city, COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) AS institution_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   GROUP BY zip_code, branch_city
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) > 10
   ORDER BY institution_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count the number of branches per bank institution in Florida:**

    ```sql
    SELECT institution_name, COUNT(*) AS branch_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
    WHERE state = 'FL'
    GROUP BY institution_name
    ORDER BY branch_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **List counties in Florida with the highest number of bank institutions:**

    ```sql
    SELECT branch_county, COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) AS institution_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
    WHERE state = 'FL'
    GROUP BY branch_county
    ORDER BY institution_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Count the total number of unique bank institutions in Florida:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) AS total_institutions
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
    WHERE state = 'FL';
    ```

13. **Find the top 5 cities in Florida with the highest number of bank institutions:**

    ```sql
    SELECT branch_city, COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) AS institution_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
    WHERE state = 'FL'
    GROUP BY branch_city
    ORDER BY institution_count DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

14. **List bank institutions headquartered in Florida:**

    ```sql
    SELECT institution_name, city, zip_code
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
    WHERE state = 'FL'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Count the number of bank institutions headquartered per zip code in Florida:**

    ```sql
    SELECT zip_code, COUNT(*) AS institution_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
    WHERE state = 'FL'
    GROUP BY zip_code
    ORDER BY institution_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries explore the relevant data to identify the zip code in Florida with the highest number of bank institutions. By examining the `fdic_banks.locations` table and utilizing the columns and conditions specified, we can analyze the distribution of bank institutions across different zip codes within Florida.

Task: Could you provide me with the zip code of the location that has the highest number of bank institutions in Florida?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The zip code with the highest number of bank institutions in Florida is **33131**, located in Miami's financial district.

```csv
Zip_Code,Number_of_Bank_Institutions
33131,25
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This result is based on counting the number of unique bank institutions in each zip code within Florida from the `fdic_banks.locations` table, and identifying the zip code with the highest count..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...)

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 10:41:59 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide me with the zip code of the location that has the highest number of bank institutions in Florida?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The zip code with the highest number of bank institutions in Florida is **33131**, located in Miami's financial district.

```csv
Zip_Code,Number_of_Bank_Institutions
33131,25
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This result is based on counting the number of unique bank institutions in each zip code within Florida from the `fdic_banks.locations` table, and identifying the zip code with the highest count. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
