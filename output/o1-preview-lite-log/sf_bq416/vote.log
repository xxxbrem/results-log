After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Simplicity and Efficiency:** The SQL query in `2result.sql` is simpler and more efficient. It avoids unnecessary use of `REPLACE` and `LOWER` functions, which are not needed if the data is already in the correct format.
  
- **Data Matching:**
  - The `ADDRESS` and `EVENT_HASH` values used in the `WHERE` clause are already in lowercase in the data, so applying `LOWER()` is redundant.
  - The `ARGS` field does not contain extra quotation marks, so using `REPLACE` to remove them is unnecessary.

- **Direct Parsing of `ARGS`:** The query directly parses the `ARGS` JSON array to extract the `Source_Address`, `Destination_Address`, and `Transfer_Amount`, and then converts the `Transfer_Amount` to a numeric value for ordering.

- **Correct Ordering:** It orders the results by the `Transfer_Amount` in descending order using `ORDER BY (PARSE_JSON("ARGS")[2])::NUMBER DESC`, ensuring that the largest transactions are listed first.

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** provides a cleaner and more accurate query that efficiently retrieves the desired information without superfluous operations.
