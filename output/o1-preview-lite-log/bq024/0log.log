This query selects the top 10 evaluation groups from the year 2012 with the largest subplot acres, considering only the condition with the largest subplot acres within each group. It includes the evaluation group, evaluation type, condition status code, evaluation description, state code, macroplot acres, and subplot acres as requested.

- **Calculations**:
  - **Subplot Acres**: Calculated using the formula:
    ```
    subplot_acres = expansion_factor * condition_proportion_unadjusted * adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
    ```
  - **Macroplot Acres**: Calculated using the formula:
    ```
    macroplot_acres = expansion_factor * condition_proportion_unadjusted * adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
    ```
  - Used `COALESCE` to handle `NULL` values in the adjustment factors by defaulting them to `1` when `NULL`.

- **Logic**:
  - **Filtered** the data to include only records from the year 2012.
  - **Joined** the `population`, `condition`, and `population_evaluation` tables to gather all necessary information.
  - **Ranked** the conditions within each evaluation group based on the `subplot_acres` in descending order.
  - **Selected** the condition with the largest `subplot_acres` within each evaluation group (i.e., where `rn = 1`).
  - **Ordered** the results to get the top 10 evaluation groups with the largest `subplot_acres`.

- **Notes**:
  - Ensured that all columns (`macroplot_acres`, `subplot_acres`, etc.) are properly populated by handling `NULL` values.
  - Excluded records where necessary values are `NULL` to prevent empty columns in the results.
  - The query is designed to provide accurate results based on the available data, correcting any issues with empty or zero values in the columns.

Run this query in BigQuery to obtain the desired results.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we'll first identify the relevant tables and columns, map them to their potential usage, and note any conditions that may be used. Then we'll write at least 10 BigQuery SQL queries to explore the data and understand the values in the related columns.

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

1. **`condition` Table**:
   - `plot_sequence_number`: To join with the `population` table.
   - `inventory_year`: To filter records for the year 2012.
   - `condition_class_number`: Identifies the condition within a plot.
   - `condition_status_code`: Included in the output.
   - `condition_proportion_unadjusted`: Used to calculate subplot and macroplot acres.
   - `subplot_proportion_unadjusted`: May be used in acreage calculations.
   - `macroplot_proportion_unadjusted`: May be used in acreage calculations.
   - `proportion_basis`: Indicates whether the proportions are based on subplot or macroplot.

2. **`population` Table**:
   - `plot_sequence_number`: To join with the `condition` table.
   - `evaluation_group`: Included in the output.
   - `evaluation_type`: Included in the output.
   - `evaluation_description`: Included in the output.
   - `state_code`: Included in the output.
   - `expansion_factor`: Used to calculate acres.
   - `adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot`: Used in calculating subplot acres.
   - `adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot`: Used in calculating macroplot acres.
   - `evaluation_sequence_number`: To join with `population_evaluation`.

3. **`population_evaluation` Table**:
   - `evaluation_sequence_number`: To join with the `population` table.
   - `start_inventory_year`: To filter evaluations that include the year 2012.
   - `end_inventory_year`: To filter evaluations that include the year 2012.

4. **`population_evaluation_type` Table**:
   - `evaluation_sequence_number`: To join with the `population` table.
   - `evaluation_type`: Included in the output.

### Conditions to be Used:

- Filter records where `inventory_year = 2012` in the `condition` table.
- Filter evaluations where `start_inventory_year = '2012'` or `end_inventory_year = '2012'` in the `population_evaluation` table.
- Calculate subplot acres using: `subplot_acres = expansion_factor * condition_proportion_unadjusted * adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot`.
- Consider only the condition with the largest subplot acres within each evaluation group.

GROUP BY p.evaluation_group
ORDER BY plot_count DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**14. List the condition status codes with their counts for 2012:**

```sql
SELECT condition_status_code, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition`
WHERE inventory_year = 2012
GROUP BY condition_status_code
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**15. Identify the state codes represented in the evaluations for 2012:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT state_code
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population`
WHERE evaluation_sequence_number IN (
    SELECT evaluation_sequence_number
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation`
    WHERE start_inventory_year = '2012' OR end_inventory_year = '2012'
)
LIMIT 100;
```

**16. Retrieve evaluation descriptions and their corresponding evaluation types for 2012:**

```sql
SELECT pe.evaluation_sequence_number, pe.evaluation_description, pet.evaluation_type
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation_type` AS pet
ON pe.evaluation_sequence_number = pet.evaluation_sequence_number
WHERE pe.start_inventory_year = '2012' OR pe.end_inventory_year = '2012'
LIMIT 100;
```

**17. Calculate the average subplot acres per evaluation group for 2012:**

```sql
SELECT p.evaluation_group, AVG(p.expansion_factor * c.condition_proportion_unadjusted * p.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot) AS average_subplot_acres
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
ON p.plot_sequence_number = c.plot_sequence_number
WHERE c.inventory_year = 2012
GROUP BY p.evaluation_group
ORDER BY average_subplot_acres DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**18. Find conditions with the largest condition proportion unadjusted for 2012:**

```sql
SELECT plot_sequence_number, condition_class_number, condition_proportion_unadjusted
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition`
WHERE inventory_year = 2012
ORDER BY condition_proportion_unadjusted DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**19. List evaluation groups with their evaluation descriptions for 2012:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p.evaluation_group, pe.evaluation_description
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
ON p.evaluation_sequence_number = pe.evaluation_sequence_number
WHERE pe.start_inventory_year = '2012' OR pe.end_inventory_year = '2012'
LIMIT 100;
```

**20. Identify the top 10 evaluation groups with the highest maximum subplot acres:**

```sql
SELECT evaluation_group, evaluation_type, condition_status_code, evaluation_description, state_code, MAX(subplot_acres) AS max_subplot_acres
FROM (
    SELECT p.evaluation_group, p.evaluation_type, c.condition_status_code, p.evaluation_description, p.state_code,
           (p.expansion_factor * c.condition_proportion_unadjusted * p.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot) AS subplot_acres
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
    ON p.plot_sequence_number = c.plot_sequence_number
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
    ON p.evaluation_sequence_number = pe.evaluation_sequence_number
    WHERE c.inventory_year = 2012 AND (pe.start_inventory_year = '2012' OR pe.end_inventory_year = '2012')
) AS subquery
GROUP BY evaluation_group, evaluation_type, condition_status_code, evaluation_description, state_code
ORDER BY max_subplot_acres DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Task: For the year 2012, which top 10 evaluation groups have the largest subplot acres when considering only the condition with the largest subplot acres within each group? Please include the evaluation group, evaluation type, condition status code, evaluation description, state code, macroplot acres, and subplot acres.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: For the year 2012, we identified the top 10 evaluation groups with the largest subplot acres by considering only the condition with the largest subplot acres within each group. The subplot acres were calculated using the expansion factor, condition proportion unadjusted, and adjustment factor for the subplot.

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'usfs_fia': ['condition', 'plot', 'plot_tree', 'population', 'population_estimation_unit', 'population_evaluation', 'population_evaluation_group', 'population_evaluation_type', 'population_stratum', 'population_stratum_assign', 'tree']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
