To analyze the sales performance around mid-June for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, we'll consider the following table and columns:

**Relevant Table:**
- `"cleaned_weekly_sales"`

**Columns and their potential usage:**

- `"week_date"`: Used to identify the exact week dates, which helps in selecting the weeks around June 15.
- `"calendar_year"`: Used to filter data for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.
- `"sales"`: Represents the sales amount for each week; necessary for calculating total sales.
- `"week_number"`: May help in identifying the specific weeks before and after June 15.
- `"month_number"`: Used to filter data for the month of June.
- `"week_date_formatted"`: Provides a standardized date format for easier comparison and filtering.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter `"calendar_year"` to include only 2018, 2019, or 2020.
- Select weeks where `"week_date"` is within the four weeks before or after June 15.
- Use `"week_number"` and `"month_number"` to identify relevant weeks.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct years available in the data:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "calendar_year" FROM "cleaned_weekly_sales" LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **List all distinct week dates around mid-June across all years:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "week_date" FROM "cleaned_weekly_sales" WHERE "month_number" = 6 LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **Get sales data for the weeks in June 2018:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "week_date", "sales" FROM "cleaned_weekly_sales" WHERE "calendar_year" = 2018 AND "month_number" = 6 LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Retrieve the week numbers for weeks in June 2019:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "week_number" FROM "cleaned_weekly_sales" WHERE "calendar_year" = 2019 AND "month_number" = 6 LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **List sales data for the four weeks leading up to June 15, 2020:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "week_date", "sales" FROM "cleaned_weekly_sales" WHERE "calendar_year" = 2020 AND "week_date" < '2020-06-15' ORDER BY "week_date" DESC LIMIT 4;
    ```

6. **List sales data for the four weeks following June 15, 2020:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "week_date", "sales" FROM "cleaned_weekly_sales" WHERE "calendar_year" = 2020 AND "week_date" > '2020-06-15' ORDER BY "week_date" ASC LIMIT 4;
    ```

7. **Get total sales before and after June 15, 2018:**

    ```sql
    SELECT SUM("sales") AS "total_sales_before" FROM (SELECT "sales" FROM "cleaned_weekly_sales" WHERE "calendar_year" = 2018 AND "week_date" < '2018-06-15' ORDER BY "week_date" DESC LIMIT 4);
    ```

    ```sql
    SELECT SUM("sales") AS "total_sales_after" FROM (SELECT "sales" FROM "cleaned_weekly_sales" WHERE "calendar_year" = 2018 AND "week_date" > '2018-06-15' ORDER BY "week_date" ASC LIMIT 4);
    ```

8. **Retrieve average sales for the month of June across all years:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "calendar_year", AVG("sales") AS "average_sales" FROM "cleaned_weekly_sales" WHERE "month_number" = 6 GROUP BY "calendar_year" LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **List all distinct regions present in the sales data:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "region" FROM "cleaned_weekly_sales" LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **Get sales data grouped by customer type for June 2019:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customer_type", SUM("sales") AS "total_sales" FROM "cleaned_weekly_sales" WHERE "calendar_year" = 2019 AND "month_number" = 6 GROUP BY "customer_type" LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: For weekly-sales data, I need an analysis of our sales performance around mid-June for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Specifically, calculate the percentage change in sales between the four weeks leading up to June 15 and the four weeks following June 15 for each year.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Percentage_Change_Sales
2018,pc1:float
2019,pc2:float
2020,pc3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

The table above presents the percentage change in sales between the four weeks before June 15 and the four weeks after June 15 for each of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 19:49:13 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For weekly-sales data, I need an analysis of our sales performance around mid-June for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Specifically, calculate the percentage change in sales between the four weeks leading up to June 15 and the four weeks following June 15 for each year., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Percentage_Change_Sales
2018,pc1:float
2019,pc2:float
2020,pc3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

The table above presents the percentage change in sales between the four weeks before June 15 and the four weeks after June 15 for each of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
