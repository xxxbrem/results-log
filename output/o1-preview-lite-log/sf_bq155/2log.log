2025-01-23 02:34:46 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to mismatched quotation marks in the condition:

```sql
"disease_code" = 'BRCA"
```

You started the string literal with a single quote (`'`), but ended it with a double quote (`"`). SQL requires string literals to be enclosed within matching single quotes.

Additionally, based on the results you provided earlier, the `"age_at_diagnosis"` values seem to be in **years** (e.g., 55, 50, 62), not days. Therefore, you should **not multiply by 365**.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode"
FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0"."CLINICAL"
WHERE "disease_code" = 'BRCA'
  AND "age_at_diagnosis" <= 80
  AND "pathologic_stage" IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA')
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Fixed Quotation Marks:**
   - Changed `'BRCA"` to `'BRCA'` to use matching single quotes.

2. **Adjusted Age Condition:**
   - Removed multiplication by 365 since ages are in years:
     ```sql
     "age_at_diagnosis" <= 80
     ```
   
3. **Ensured Correct Use of Quotes:**
   - Confirmed that all string literals are enclosed in single quotes.
   - All column and table names remain enclosed in double quotes.

**Note:** Always ensure that:

- **String Literals:** Enclosed in single quotes (`'`).
- **Identifiers (e.g., Column Names):** Enclosed in double quotes (`"`), if needed.

With these corrections, your query should run without syntax errors.

2025-01-23 02:35:25 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks and possibly the use of double quotes around identifiers. Let's address the issues step by step.

### **Issues Identified:**

1. **Mismatched Quotation Marks in String Literal:**

   - In your `WHERE` clause, the condition:

     ```sql
     "disease_code" = 'BRCA"
     ```

     starts with a single quote `'` and ends with a double quote `"`. This results in a mismatched string literal, causing a syntax error.

2. **Double Quotes Around Identifiers:**

   - The error message indicates an unexpected `"disease_code"` at line 1, position 0:

     ```
     syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected '"disease_code"'.
     ```

   - This suggests that the SQL parser might not expect identifiers (like column names) to be enclosed in double quotes.

3. **Multiplication in Age Condition:**

   - You've used `age_at_diagnosis <= 80 * 365`, but based on the data you provided earlier, `age_at_diagnosis` appears to be in **years**, not days. Therefore, multiplying by 365 is unnecessary.

### **Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected SQL query addressing all the issues:

```sql
SELECT case_barcode
FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0.CLINICAL
WHERE disease_code = 'BRCA'
  AND age_at_diagnosis <= 80
  AND pathologic_stage IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA')
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Fixed Quotation Marks in String Literal:**

   - Changed `'BRCA"` to `'BRCA'` to ensure matching single quotes.

     ```sql
     disease_code = 'BRCA'
     ```

2. **Removed Double Quotes Around Identifiers:**

   - Removed double quotes (`"`) around table names and column names.

     - **Identifiers** like `case_barcode`, `disease_code`, `age_at_diagnosis`, and `pathologic_stage` are now unquoted.
     - Depending on your SQL dialect, unquoted identifiers are acceptable if they don't contain special characters or reserved keywords.

3. **Adjusted Age Condition:**

   - Since `age_at_diagnosis` is in **years**, removed the multiplication by 365.

     ```sql
     age_at_diagnosis <= 80
     ```

4. **Consistent Use of Single Quotes in IN Clause:**

   - Ensured that the `IN` clause uses single quotes for each string literal.

     ```sql
     pathologic_stage IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA')
     ```

### **Notes:**

- **Identifiers and Quotation Marks:**

  - In many SQL dialects, identifiers (like column and table names) do **not** require quotation marks unless they contain spaces, special characters, or are case-sensitive.
  - If your database requires identifiers to be enclosed or if they are case-sensitive, consider using backticks (\`) or square brackets ([]), depending on the SQL dialect.

    - **Example with Backticks:**

      ```sql
      SELECT `case_barcode`
      FROM `TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0`.`TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0`.`CLINICAL`
      WHERE `disease_code` = 'BRCA'
        AND `age_at_diagnosis` <= 80
        AND `pathologic_stage` IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA')
      LIMIT 100;
      ```

- **SQL Dialect Compatibility:**

  - Ensure that your SQL syntax matches the dialect of your database (e.g., Snowflake, MySQL, PostgreSQL). Some databases have specific requirements for quoting identifiers.

### **Testing the Corrected Query:**

To verify that the syntax works in your environment, you can start by running a simplified query:

```sql
SELECT case_barcode
FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0.CLINICAL
LIMIT 10;
```

If this executes without errors, then the issue was with the quotation marks in your original query.

### **Final Recommendations:**

- **Always Match Quotation Marks:**

  - Ensure that all opening quotation marks have a corresponding closing quotation mark of the same type.

- **Use Single Quotes for String Literals:**

  - String values should be enclosed in single quotes `'`.

- **Check Database Documentation:**

  - Refer to your database's documentation regarding the use of quotation marks for identifiers and string literals, as conventions may vary.

### **Summary:**

By correcting the mismatched quotation marks and adjusting the query to match your database's syntax conventions, the query should execute successfully, allowing you to retrieve the desired `case_barcode` values for BRCA patients who are 80 years old or younger at diagnosis and have a pathological stage of I, II, or IIA.

2025-01-23 02:36:03 - root - INFO - It appears that the syntax error in your SQL query is caused by the use of double quotes around identifiers and mismatched quotation marks in a string literal. The error message indicates an unexpected `'"disease_code"'` at line 1, position 0.

### **Issues Identified:**

1. **Mismatched Quotation Marks in String Literal:**

   - In your `WHERE` clause, the condition:

     ```sql
     "disease_code" = 'BRCA"
     ```

     starts with a single quote `'` and ends with a double quote `"`. This mismatch causes a syntax error.

2. **Double Quotes Around Identifiers:**

   - The error message suggests that the SQL parser does not expect double quotes around identifiers (column names and table names) in your SQL dialect.

3. **Multiplication in Age Condition:**

   - Based on the data you provided earlier, the `age_at_diagnosis` values are in **years**, not days. Therefore, multiplying by 365 is unnecessary.

### **Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected SQL query addressing all the issues:

```sql
SELECT case_barcode
FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0.CLINICAL
WHERE disease_code = 'BRCA'
  AND age_at_diagnosis <= 80
  AND pathologic_stage IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA')
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Fixed Quotation Marks in String Literal:**

   - Changed `'BRCA"` to `'BRCA'` to ensure matching single quotes.

     ```sql
     disease_code = 'BRCA'
     ```

2. **Removed Double Quotes Around Identifiers:**

   - Removed double quotes (`"`) around column names and table names. Identifiers without special characters or spaces typically do not require quotation marks.

     ```sql
     SELECT case_barcode
     FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0.CLINICAL
     ```

3. **Adjusted Age Condition:**

   - Since `age_at_diagnosis` is in **years**, removed the multiplication by 365.

     ```sql
     age_at_diagnosis <= 80
     ```

4. **Consistent Use of Single Quotes in IN Clause:**

   - Ensured that the `IN` clause uses single quotes for each string literal.

     ```sql
     pathologic_stage IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA')
     ```

### **Notes:**

- **Identifiers and Quotation Marks:**

  - In many SQL dialects, identifiers (like column and table names) do **not** require quotation marks unless they contain spaces, special characters, or are case-sensitive.
  - If your database requires identifiers to be enclosed or if they are case-sensitive, consider using backticks (\`) or square brackets ([ ]), depending on the SQL dialect.

    - **Example with Backticks:**

      ```sql
      SELECT `case_barcode`
      FROM `TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0`.`TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0`.`CLINICAL`
      WHERE `disease_code` = 'BRCA'
        AND `age_at_diagnosis` <= 80
        AND `pathologic_stage` IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA')
      LIMIT 100;
      ```

- **SQL Dialect Compatibility:**

  - Ensure that your SQL syntax matches the dialect of your database (e.g., Snowflake, MySQL, PostgreSQL). Some databases have specific requirements for quoting identifiers.
  - Since your error message references `SQL compilation error`, it's possible you're using Snowflake, which allows identifiers without quotation marks unless they are case-sensitive or contain special characters.

### **Next Steps:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:**

  Try running the corrected SQL query without double quotes around identifiers and with properly matched single quotes in string literals.

- **Verify Identifier Quoting Requirements:**

  If the query still results in an error, check your database's documentation to see if identifiers need to be enclosed in specific quotation marks or if they are case-sensitive.

- **Test a Simple Query:**

  To verify if identifiers need quotation marks, you can run a simple query:

  ```sql
  SELECT case_barcode
  FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0.CLINICAL
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

  - If this query runs successfully, then identifiers do not need to be enclosed in quotation marks in your SQL dialect.

### **Summary:**

By correcting the mismatched quotation marks and adjusting the query to match your database's syntax conventions, the query should execute successfully. This should allow you to retrieve the desired `case_barcode` values for BRCA patients who are 80 years old or younger at diagnosis and have a pathological stage of I, II, or IIA.

2025-01-23 02:36:41 - root - INFO - I see that you're encountering an error when trying to use the `LOG10` function in your SQL query. The error message indicates:

```
SQL compilation error:
Unknown function LOG10
```

**Explanation:**

In Snowflake SQL, the `LOG10` function may not be available or recognized. Instead, Snowflake provides the `LOG` function, which can compute logarithms with a specified base.

The `LOG` function in Snowflake can be used in two forms:

1. **Natural Logarithm (base *e*):**

   ```sql
   LOG(x)
   ```

2. **Logarithm with a specified base:**

   ```sql
   LOG(base, x)
   ```

To calculate the logarithm base 10 of a number, you can use:

```sql
LOG(10, x)
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected SQL query using `LOG(10, x)`:

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", LOG(10, "HTSeq__FPKM" + 1) AS "Log_HTSeq_FPKM"
FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION"
WHERE "gene_name" = 'SNORA31'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **Using `LOG(10, x)` Instead of `LOG10(x)`:**

  - Replaces `LOG10("HTSeq__FPKM" + 1)` with `LOG(10, "HTSeq__FPKM" + 1)` to compute the base 10 logarithm.
  
- **Avoiding Logarithm of Zero:**

  - Adding `1` to `"HTSeq__FPKM"` ensures that we don't attempt to compute the logarithm of zero, which is undefined.
  
- **Correct Function Syntax:**

  - Ensures compatibility with Snowflake's function definitions.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Verifying Available Functions:**

  - You can check the available mathematical functions in Snowflake's documentation or by running:
  
    ```sql
    SHOW FUNCTIONS LIKE 'LOG%';
    ```
  
    This will display functions that start with `LOG`.

- **Understanding the Data:**

  - Ensure that `"HTSeq__FPKM"` values are numeric and appropriate for logarithmic transformation.

- **Consistent Quotation Marks:**

  - Use double quotes (`"`) around identifiers (e.g., column names) if they contain uppercase letters or special characters.
  
  - Use single quotes (`'`) around string literals (e.g., `'SNORA31'`).

**Testing the Query:**

Please execute the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", LOG(10, "HTSeq__FPKM" + 1) AS "Log_HTSeq_FPKM"
FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION"
WHERE "gene_name" = 'SNORA31'
LIMIT 100;
```

This should resolve the `Unknown function LOG10` error.

2025-01-23 02:37:27 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering an error when trying to use the `LOG10` function in your SQL query. The error message indicates:

```
SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'LOG'.
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Function Not Recognized:**
   - Snowflake SQL does **not** support the `LOG10` function. Instead, you should use the `LOG` function to calculate logarithms with a specified base.
   - Moreover, the error message suggests that the SQL parser is encountering an unexpected `LOG` at the very beginning of your query, which might be due to syntax issues or incorrect use of double quotes.

2. **Use of Double Quotes:**
   - In Snowflake, identifiers (like column and table names) are **case-insensitive** and do **not** require double quotes unless they contain special characters or are case-sensitive.
   - Using unnecessary double quotes can sometimes lead to syntax errors, especially if there are mismatches or conflicts.

### **Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected SQL query with the appropriate function and without unnecessary double quotes:

```sql
SELECT case_barcode, LOG(10, HTSeq__FPKM + 1) AS Log_HTSeq_FPKM
FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION
WHERE gene_name = 'SNORA31'
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Replaced `LOG10` with `LOG(10, x)`:**

   - Since `LOG10` is not supported, use `LOG(10, x)` to calculate the base 10 logarithm.
     ```sql
     LOG(10, HTSeq__FPKM + 1)
     ```

2. **Removed Double Quotes from Identifiers:**

   - Removed double quotes around `case_barcode`, `HTSeq__FPKM`, `Log_HTSeq_FPKM`, `gene_name`, and table names.
   - In Snowflake, unquoted identifiers are automatically converted to uppercase. If your column names are already uppercase in the database, this should work correctly.

3. **Ensured Correct Use of Quotes:**

   - String literals like `'SNORA31'` remain enclosed in single quotes.
   - Identifiers (column names and table names) are unquoted unless necessary.

### **Additional Notes:**

- **Function Names:**
  - Function names in Snowflake are **case-insensitive**, but it's good practice to use uppercase for clarity.
  - Ensure you're using `LOG` instead of `LOG10`.

- **Testing the Query:**
  - Run the corrected query as is.
  - If you still encounter errors, try running a simpler version to test if the `LOG` function works:
    ```sql
    SELECT LOG(10, 100) AS log_value;
    ```
  - If this simple query fails, there might be an issue with the availability of the `LOG` function in your environment.

### **Alternative if `LOG` Function is Unavailable:**

If you find that the `LOG` function is still causing issues, it's possible that your SQL environment does not support logarithmic functions directly. In such a case, you might consider retrieving the raw `HTSeq__FPKM` values and performing the logarithmic transformation outside SQL, e.g., in a programming language like Python or R.

### **Summary:**

- Use `LOG(10, x)` instead of `LOG10(x)` to calculate base 10 logarithms in Snowflake SQL.
- Remove unnecessary double quotes from identifiers to prevent syntax errors.
- Ensure all string literals are enclosed in single quotes.
- Test your queries incrementally to isolate any issues.

2025-01-23 02:38:00 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering an error with your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", LOG10("HTSeq__FPKM" + 1) AS "Log_HTSeq_FPKM"
FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION"
WHERE "gene_name" = 'SNORA31'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Error Message:**

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7 invalid identifier 'CASE_BARCODE'
```

---

### **Explanation of the Error:**

1. **Case Sensitivity with Quoted Identifiers:**

   - In Snowflake SQL, when you enclose identifiers (like column names) in double quotes (`"`), they become case-sensitive. This means that `"case_barcode"` refers **exactly** to a column named `case_barcode` in lowercase.
   - Snowflake stores unquoted identifiers in uppercase by default. So, if the column was created without quotes, it is stored as `CASE_BARCODE` in uppercase.
   - Therefore, referencing it as `"case_barcode"` (all lowercase) will result in an "invalid identifier" error because it doesn't match the actual column name `CASE_BARCODE`.

2. **Inconsistent Use of Quotation Marks:**

   - Using double quotes around identifiers when not necessary can lead to such issues.
   - Additionally, the function `LOG10` may not be supported in Snowflake.

---

### **Solution:**

1. **Remove Double Quotes or Use Correct Case:**

   - **Option 1:** Use unquoted identifiers (recommended if your column names are in uppercase):

     ```sql
     SELECT CASE_BARCODE, LOG(10, HTSEQ__FPKM + 1) AS LOG_HTSEQ_FPKM
     FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION
     WHERE GENE_NAME = 'SNORA31'
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

   - **Option 2:** Use double quotes with exact case (if your column names are indeed lowercase):

     ```sql
     SELECT "CASE_BARCODE", LOG(10, "HTSEQ__FPKM" + 1) AS "LOG_HTSEQ_FPKM"
     FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION"
     WHERE "GENE_NAME" = 'SNORA31'
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

   - **Option 3:** Use double quotes with uppercase column names:

     ```sql
     SELECT "CASE_BARCODE", LOG(10, "HTSEQ__FPKM" + 1) AS "LOG_HTSEQ_FPKM"
     FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION"
     WHERE "GENE_NAME" = 'SNORA31'
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

2. **Use the Correct Logarithm Function:**

   - As previously noted, **Snowflake uses `LOG( <base> , <value> )`** for logarithmic calculations.
   - Replace `LOG10` with `LOG(10, ...)`.

---

### **Corrected SQL Query:**

Assuming that your column names are stored in uppercase (which is the default in Snowflake when identifiers are unquoted), the corrected query would be:

```sql
SELECT CASE_BARCODE, LOG(10, HTSEQ__FPKM + 1) AS LOG_HTSEQ_FPKM
FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION
WHERE GENE_NAME = 'SNORA31'
LIMIT 100;
```

**If you prefer to use double quotes and your column names are in uppercase:**

```sql
SELECT "CASE_BARCODE", LOG(10, "HTSEQ__FPKM" + 1) AS "LOG_HTSEQ_FPKM"
FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION"
WHERE "GENE_NAME" = 'SNORA31'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Why This Works:**

- **Identifiers Without Quotes:**

  - When you **do not use double quotes**, Snowflake treats identifiers as case-insensitive and converts them to uppercase internally.
  - So, `case_barcode` becomes `CASE_BARCODE`, matching the column names stored in the database.

- **Identifiers With Quotes:**

  - When you **use double quotes**, you must match the exact case of the identifiers as they are stored in the database.
  - If your column names are stored in uppercase (e.g., `CASE_BARCODE`), you must reference them as `"CASE_BARCODE"`.

- **Using the Correct Function:**

  - Replacing `LOG10` with `LOG(10, ...)` ensures that the logarithm function is recognized by Snowflake.

---

### **Additional Recommendations:**

1. **Check Column Names:**

   - Verify the exact case of your column names in the `RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION` table.
   - You can do this by running:

     ```sql
     DESC TABLE TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION;
     ```

     or

     ```sql
     SHOW COLUMNS IN TABLE TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION;
     ```

2. **Consistent Identifier Usage:**

   - Decide whether to use double quotes based on your database naming conventions.
   - If all your identifiers are in uppercase and you prefer not to worry about case sensitivity, omit the double quotes.

3. **Testing the Query:**

   - Run the corrected query to ensure it executes without errors.
   - If you encounter further issues, consider simplifying the query to isolate the problem.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Error Cause:** The error occurs because the identifier `"case_barcode"` does not match the actual column name due to case sensitivity introduced by double quotes.
- **Solution:** Use identifiers without quotes or ensure the case matches exactly when using double quotes.
- **Corrected Query:** Use `LOG(10, ...)` for the logarithm and reference identifiers appropriately.

2025-01-23 02:39:52 - root - INFO - I see you're encountering an error when executing your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT gene_name
FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION
LIMIT 100
```

**Error Message:**

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 16
invalid identifier 'GENE_NAME'
```

---

### **Explanation of the Error:**

The error indicates that the column `GENE_NAME` is not recognized in the table `RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION`. This issue likely arises due to case sensitivity and the use of quotation marks in Snowflake SQL.

- **Identifier Case Sensitivity:**
  - In Snowflake, **unquoted identifiers** are automatically converted to **uppercase**.
  - **Quoted identifiers** (identifiers enclosed in double quotes) are **case-sensitive** and must match the exact case used when the objects were created.

Given that, if the column `gene_name` was created without quotes, it's stored as `GENE_NAME` in uppercase. If you reference it in lowercase without quotes, Snowflake converts it to uppercase internally, so it matches.

However, if you reference the column using double quotes and in lowercase (e.g., `"gene_name"`), Snowflake treats it as case-sensitive and looks for a column named exactly `gene_name` in lowercase, which doesn't exist if the column is actually `GENE_NAME` in uppercase.

---

### **Solution:**

#### **Option 1: Use Unquoted Identifiers in Uppercase**

Assuming the column is `GENE_NAME` (uppercase and unquoted), you can modify your query to:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GENE_NAME
FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **Option 2: Use Quoted Identifiers with Correct Case**

If the column was created as `"gene_name"` (lowercase and quoted), you need to reference it exactly, including case and quotes:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "gene_name"
FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Determine the Correct Column Name:**

To verify the exact column names and their cases in your table, you can run:

```sql
DESC TABLE TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION;
```

This will list all columns with their exact names and help you identify whether they are in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case.

---

### **Examples:**

1. **Using Uppercase without Quotes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT GENE_NAME
   FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Using Double Quotes with Uppercase (if columns are uppercase and you prefer quoting):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "GENE_NAME"
   FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Using Double Quotes with Exact Case (if columns are lowercase):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "gene_name"
   FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

### **Recommendation:**

Based on standard practices and the likelihood that the column names are stored in uppercase, I recommend using the first option:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GENE_NAME
FROM TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0.RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Additional Note on the LIMIT Clause:**

Ensure that the `LIMIT` clause is properly placed and that your SQL syntax is correct. The corrected query should work as intended without errors.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Issue:** The column name `gene_name` is not recognized due to case sensitivity and the use of quotations.
- **Solution:** Adjust the query to use the correct case and quotation marks based on how the column is stored in the database.
- **Action:** Modify your query to use `GENE_NAME` without quotes or with quotes and the exact case as per your table definition.

---

**Please try the corrected query and let me know if it resolves the issue or if you need further assistance.**

Task: Help me calculate the t-statistic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between all possible pairs of gene `SNORA31` in the RNAseq data (Log10 transformation) and unique identifiers in the microRNA data available in TCGA. The cohort for this analysis consists of BRCA patients that are 80 years old or younger at the time of diagnosis and Stage I,II,IIA as pathological state. And only consider samples of size more than 25 and with absolute Pearson correlation at least 0.3, and less than 1.0.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
miRNA_ID,Pearson_Correlation,t_statistic,Sample_Size
miRNA1:str,r_value1:float,t_value1:float,n1:int
miRNA2:str,r_value2:float,t_value2:float,n2:int
...
```

**Explanation**:

- **miRNA_ID**: The unique identifier of each microRNA.
- **Pearson_Correlation**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the Log10-transformed expression of `SNORA31` and each microRNA expression.
- **t_statistic**: The t-statistic calculated from the Pearson correlation coefficient using the formula:

  \[ t = r \times \sqrt{\frac{n - 2}{1 - r^2}} \]

  where:
  - \( r \) is the Pearson correlation coefficient.
  - \( n \) is the sample size.

- **Sample_Size**: The number of samples used in the calculation (greater than 25).

**Note**: The results include only those microRNAs where the absolute Pearson correlation is between 0.3 and less than 1.0..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...)

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 02:41:39 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Help me calculate the t-statistic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between all possible pairs of gene `SNORA31` in the RNAseq data (Log10 transformation) and unique identifiers in the microRNA data available in TCGA. The cohort for this analysis consists of BRCA patients that are 80 years old or younger at the time of diagnosis and Stage I,II,IIA as pathological state. And only consider samples of size more than 25 and with absolute Pearson correlation at least 0.3, and less than 1.0., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
miRNA_ID,Pearson_Correlation,t_statistic,Sample_Size
miRNA1:str,r_value1:float,t_value1:float,n1:int
miRNA2:str,r_value2:float,t_value2:float,n2:int
...
```

**Explanation**:

- **miRNA_ID**: The unique identifier of each microRNA.
- **Pearson_Correlation**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the Log10-transformed expression of `SNORA31` and each microRNA expression.
- **t_statistic**: The t-statistic calculated from the Pearson correlation coefficient using the formula:

  \[ t = r \times \sqrt{\frac{n - 2}{1 - r^2}} \]

  where:
  - \( r \) is the Pearson correlation coefficient.
  - \( n \) is the sample size.

- **Sample_Size**: The number of samples used in the calculation (greater than 25).

**Note**: The results include only those microRNAs where the absolute Pearson correlation is between 0.3 and less than 1.0. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
