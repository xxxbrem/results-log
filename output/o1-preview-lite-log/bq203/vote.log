After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the most accurate and appropriate script for calculating the percentage of subway stations in each New York borough that have at least one ADA-compliant entrance.

**Reasons:**

- **Case-Insensitive Matching:** The script uses `LOWER(s.station_name) = LOWER(e.station_name)` in the `JOIN` condition to ensure that station names are matched correctly regardless of case differences. This improves the accuracy of the join between the `stations` and `station_entrances` tables.

  ```sql
  ON
    LOWER(s.station_name) = LOWER(e.station_name)
  ```

- **Handling Division by Zero:** It utilizes `SAFE_DIVIDE` to prevent any potential division by zero errors, ensuring robustness in the calculation.

  ```sql
  ROUND(
    SAFE_DIVIDE(
      COUNT(DISTINCT IF(e.ada_compliant = TRUE, s.station_id, NULL)),
      COUNT(DISTINCT s.station_id)
    ) * 100, 4
  ) AS percentage_of_ada_stations
  ```

- **Accurate Aggregation:** By using `COUNT(DISTINCT s.station_id)`, it accurately counts unique stations, preventing duplicates that may arise from multiple entrances per station.

- **Consistent Results:** The script produces the correct percentages for each borough, matching the expected results based on the dataset.

**Therefore, the correct SQL script is:**
