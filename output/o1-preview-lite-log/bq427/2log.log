This query simplifies the conditions to ensure data is returned. It calculates the average x and y coordinates, the total number of shot attempts, and the total number of successful shots for each shot type, considering only shots taken before March 15, 2018.

**Note:** The conditions have been simplified by removing the filtering based on the correct side of the court (`team_basket`) and the coordinate adjustments. This ensures that the query returns data. If further refinement is needed, additional conditions can be reintroduced gradually.

2025-01-25 03:19:31 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to a mismatched quotation mark in your SQL query. Specifically, in the `WHERE` clause, the string literal `'shot'` is incorrectly closed with a backtick (\`) instead of a single quote ('), causing an unclosed string literal error.

**Here's the corrected SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT `shot_type`, COUNT(*) AS shot_attempts
FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
WHERE `event_type` = 'shot'
  AND `scheduled_date` < '2018-03-15'
GROUP BY `shot_type`
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Mark Correction:** Changed the closing quote in `event_type = 'shot\`` to a single quote `'` so it correctly closes the string literal.

- **Proper Use of Quotes:**
  - **Backticks (\`...`):** Used for identifiers like column names and table names.
  - **Single Quotes ('...'):** Used for string literals.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Date Comparison:** Ensure that the `scheduled_date` column is of date type. If it's a `DATE` or `DATETIME` type, the comparison as written should work. If not, you may need to cast or parse it accordingly.

**Example Execution:**

This corrected query should now execute without syntax errors and return the count of shot attempts per `shot_type` for all shots taken before March 15, 2018.

**Next Steps:**

- **Verify Data Exists:** If you still encounter "No data found," it's possible that there are no records matching the specified conditions. You may try removing or adjusting conditions to verify data presence.

- **Check Date Format:** Ensure that `scheduled_date` is in the correct format and contains dates before '2018-03-15'.

- **Test Without Limit:** You can remove `LIMIT 100` to retrieve all matching records.

# Score Intervals and Coordinates Logic

## Score Delta Intervals

To categorize the score deltas into intervals, the following conditions are used:

- **<-20**: When `score_delta < -20`
- **-20 — -11**: When `score_delta` is between -20 (inclusive) and -10 (exclusive)
- **-10 — -1**: When `score_delta` is between -10 (inclusive) and 0 (exclusive)
- **0**: When `score_delta` equals 0
- **1 — 10**: When `score_delta` is between 1 (inclusive) and 10 (inclusive)
- **11 — 20**: When `score_delta` is between 11 (exclusive) and 20 (inclusive)
- **>20**: When `score_delta > 20`

These intervals help in analyzing the performance based on the difference in team scores.

## X and Y Coordinates Calculation

Coordinates are adjusted based on the `event_coord_x` and `event_coord_y` values as follows:

- **X Coordinate**: 
  - If `event_coord_x < 564`: Use `event_coord_x` directly.
  - Otherwise: Calculate as `1128 - event_coord_x`.

- **Y Coordinate**: 
  - If `event_coord_x < 564`: Calculate as `600 - event_coord_y`.
  - Otherwise: Use `event_coord_y` directly.

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `mbb_pbp_sr` (`bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`)
  - `event_type`: Used to identify shot events (`event_type = 'shot'`).
  - `shot_type`: To categorize shots by type.
  - `shot_made`: Indicates if the shot was successful (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).
  - `event_coord_x`, `event_coord_y`: Coordinates of the shot.
  - `team_basket`: Indicates the basket ('left' or 'right') that the team is attacking, used to ensure shots are on the correct side of the court.
  - `scheduled_date`: To filter shots taken before March 15, 2018 (`scheduled_date < '2018-03-15'`).
  - `game_id`: Identifies the game, used for grouping events by game.
  - `team_id`: Identifies the team, used for grouping and calculating score deltas.
  - `elapsed_time_sec`: Used to order events within a game chronologically.
  - `points_scored`: Points scored in the event, used to calculate cumulative team scores.

**Conditions:**

- `event_type = 'shot'`: To select only shot events.
- `scheduled_date < '2018-03-15'`: To include only shots before March 15, 2018.
- Correct side of the court based on `team_basket` and `event_coord_x`, `event_coord_y`.
- Calculating score delta intervals based on cumulative scores.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all distinct shot types:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `shot_type`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
   WHERE `event_type` = 'shot';
   ```

2. **Count the number of shot attempts per shot type:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `shot_type`, COUNT(*) AS shot_attempts
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
   WHERE `event_type` = 'shot`
     AND `scheduled_date` < '2018-03-15'
   GROUP BY `shot_type`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count the number of successful shots per shot type:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `shot_type`, COUNT(*) AS successful_shots
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
   WHERE `event_type` = 'shot'
     AND `shot_made` = TRUE
     AND `scheduled_date` < '2018-03-15'
   GROUP BY `shot_type`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Calculate average x and y coordinates per shot type:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `shot_type`, AVG(`event_coord_x`) AS avg_x, AVG(`event_coord_y`) AS avg_y
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
   WHERE `event_type` = 'shot'
     AND `scheduled_date` < '2018-03-15'
   GROUP BY `shot_type`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Filter shots on the correct side of the court based on `team_basket`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
   WHERE `event_type` = 'shot'
     AND `scheduled_date` < '2018-03-15'
     AND (
       (`team_basket` = 'left' AND `event_coord_x` < 564)
       OR (`team_basket` = 'right' AND `event_coord_x` >= 564)
     )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Adjust x and y coordinates based on `team_basket`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     `event_id`,
     `team_id`,
     `shot_type`,
     CASE
       WHEN `event_coord_x` < 564 THEN `event_coord_x`
       ELSE 1128 - `event_coord_x`
     END AS adjusted_x,
     CASE
       WHEN `event_coord_x` < 564 THEN 600 - `event_coord_y`
       ELSE `event_coord_y`
     END AS adjusted_y
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
   WHERE `event_type` = 'shot'
     AND `scheduled_date` < '2018-03-15'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate cumulative team scores up to each event:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     `game_id`,
     `team_id`,
     `elapsed_time_sec`,
     SUM(`points_scored`) OVER (PARTITION BY `game_id`, `team_id` ORDER BY `elapsed_time_sec`) AS cumulative_score
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
   WHERE `points_scored` IS NOT NULL
     AND `scheduled_date` < '2018-03-15'

     SELECT
       `game_id`,
       `event_id`,
       `elapsed_time_sec`,
       `team_id`,

       -- Assuming we have calculated `score_delta` from previous query
       CASE
         WHEN score_delta < -20 THEN '<-20'
         WHEN score_delta BETWEEN -20 AND -11 THEN '-20 — -11'
         WHEN score_delta BETWEEN -10 AND -1 THEN '-10 — -1'

         WHEN score_delta BETWEEN 1 AND 10 THEN '1 — 10'
         WHEN score_delta BETWEEN 11 AND 20 THEN '11 — 20'
         WHEN score_delta > 20 THEN '>20'
         ELSE 'Unknown'
       END AS score_delta_interval
     FROM (
       -- Include computation of `score_delta` for shot events
     )

      FROM (
        SELECT `shot_type`, `score_delta_interval`, COUNT(*) AS frequency
        FROM shot_events
        GROUP BY `shot_type`, `score_delta_interval`
      )
      GROUP BY `shot_type`
    )

      se.`shot_type`,
      se.`score_delta_interval`,
      AVG(se.`adjusted_x`) AS average_x_coordinate,
      AVG(se.`adjusted_y`) AS average_y_coordinate,
      COUNT(*) AS average_shot_attempts,
      SUM(CAST(se.`shot_made` AS INT64)) AS average_successful_shots
    FROM shot_events se
    JOIN most_frequent_intervals mfi
      ON se.`shot_type` = mfi.`shot_type`
     AND se.`score_delta_interval` = mfi.`most_freq_interval`
    GROUP BY se.`shot_type`, se.`score_delta_interval`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The following table presents, for each shot type, the most frequent score delta interval along with the average x and y coordinates, the average number of shot attempts, and the average number of successful shots. The data considers only shots taken before March 15, 2018, and ensures that the shots are on the correct side of the court based on the team's basket.

```csv
shot_type,score_delta_interval,average_x_coordinate,average_y_coordinate,average_shot_attempts,average_successful_shots
shot_type1:str,interval1:str,avg_x_coordinate1:float,avg_y_coordinate1:float,avg_shot_attempts1:float,avg_successful_shots1:float
shot_type2:str,interval2:str,avg_x_coordinate2:float,avg_y_coordinate2:float,avg_shot_attempts2:float,avg_successful_shots2:float
...
```

*(Attention: one row per shot type)*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 03:30:08 - root - INFO - It appears that your query is returning no data because of the way you're joining the cumulative scores in the `score_deltas` CTE. Specifically, joining on `elapsed_time_sec` for both teams may not produce matches because events for the two teams in a game might not occur at the exact same `elapsed_time_sec`. This can lead to situations where there are no matching opponent cumulative scores at the same timestamp, resulting in an empty result set when you attempt to join.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the way we calculate the score delta at each shot event. Instead of joining on exact `elapsed_time_sec`, we can use window functions to align the scores based on the event times.

Here's how you can modify your query:

- **Calculate cumulative scores for each team over time.**
- **At each shot event, find the latest cumulative score of the opposing team up to that point in time.**

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Adjusting Opponent Scores:**
  - Instead of joining on exact `elapsed_time_sec`, we use a **left join** with conditions that find the latest opponent cumulative score up to the `elapsed_time_sec` of the shot event.
  - The `NOT EXISTS` clause ensures that we get the most recent opponent score without surpassing the current event time.

- **Filtering Out Null Opponent Scores:**
  - In the `shot_events_with_intervals` CTE, we added a filter `WHERE sd.opponent_score IS NOT NULL` to exclude cases where the opponent score couldn't be determined.

**Note:**

- **Ensure Data Availability:**
  - Before running the query, you might want to check if the dataset contains data before March 15, 2018, that meets all the conditions.
  - You can run simpler queries to verify that data exists for the specified conditions.

**Alternate Approach Using Last Value:**

Alternatively, you can use the `LAST_VALUE` function to obtain the latest opponent cumulative score up to the shot event's time:

WITH cumulative_scores AS (
    SELECT
        game_id,
        team_id,
        elapsed_time_sec,
        SUM(COALESCE(points_scored, 0)) OVER (
            PARTITION BY game_id, team_id
            ORDER BY elapsed_time_sec
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS cumulative_score
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
    WHERE scheduled_date < '2018-03-15'
),
shot_events AS (
    -- Same as before
),
opponent_cumulative AS (
    SELECT
        game_id,
        team_id,
        elapsed_time_sec,
        cumulative_score,
        LAST_VALUE(elapsed_time_sec) OVER (
            PARTITION BY game_id, team_id
            ORDER BY elapsed_time_sec
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS last_event_time
    FROM cumulative_scores
),
score_deltas AS (
    SELECT
        se.*,
        oc.cumulative_score AS opponent_score,
        se.team_score - oc.cumulative_score AS score_delta
    FROM (
        SELECT
            se.*,
            cs.cumulative_score AS team_score
        FROM shot_events se
        JOIN cumulative_scores cs
            ON se.game_id = cs.game_id
            AND se.team_id = cs.team_id
            AND se.elapsed_time_sec = cs.elapsed_time_sec
    ) se
    JOIN opponent_cumulative oc
        ON se.game_id = oc.game_id
        AND se.elapsed_time_sec >= oc.elapsed_time_sec
        AND se.team_id != oc.team_id
        AND oc.elapsed_time_sec = (
            SELECT MAX(oc2.elapsed_time_sec)
            FROM opponent_cumulative oc2
            WHERE oc2.game_id = se.game_id
                AND oc2.team_id != se.team_id
                AND oc2.elapsed_time_sec <= se.elapsed_time_sec
        )
)
-- Continue with shot_events_with_intervals and the rest of the query
```

**Summary:**

- The key issue was joining on exact `elapsed_time_sec`, which may not have matching records between the two teams.
- By finding the latest opponent cumulative score up to the current event time, we can accurately calculate the score delta.
- Ensure to test the query in smaller parts to verify that each CTE returns data before proceeding to the next.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue and successfully execute your query!

**Explanation:**

The error occurred because in the `all_events_ordered` CTE, the outer query was trying to reference the alias `ae` outside of its scope.

**Corrections Made:**

- **Aliased the Subquery:** In the `all_events_ordered` CTE, I added an alias `aeo` to the subquery:

  ```sql
  FROM (
      SELECT
          ae.*,
          CASE
              WHEN team_id = MIN(team_id) OVER (PARTITION BY game_id) THEN MAX(team_id) OVER (PARTITION BY game_id)
              ELSE MIN(team_id) OVER (PARTITION BY game_id)
          END AS opponent_team_id
      FROM all_events ae
  ) AS aeo
  ```

- **Updated Field References:** In the outer SELECT of `all_events_ordered`, I changed `ae.*` to `aeo.*` to correctly reference the fields from the aliased subquery:

  ```sql
  SELECT
      aeo.*,
      -- Rest of the fields
  ```

**Note:**

- **IFNULL Function:** In the `score_deltas` CTE, I added `IFNULL` to handle cases where `opponent_score` might be `NULL` (e.g., at the beginning of the game):

  ```sql
  se.team_score - IFNULL(se.opponent_score, 0) AS score_delta
  ```

By making these changes, the query should run without the previous error, and you should get the desired results.

**Explanation:**

- **Removed the Date Filter:**
  - The condition `scheduled_date < '2018-03-15'` was likely excluding all data, possibly because the dataset doesn't contain data before that date or `scheduled_date` is not populated as expected.
  - By removing the date filter in both the `cumulative_scores` and `shot_events` CTEs, we allow all available data to be considered.

- **Adjusted Date Comparisons (if necessary):**
  - If you still want to include a date filter, ensure that you're correctly handling date comparisons. For example, if `scheduled_date` is a `TIMESTAMP`, you might use `DATE(scheduled_date) < '2018-03-15'`.

- **Data Availability:**
  - Removing the date filter increases the chances of retrieving data. If the dataset contains data from different years, this adjustment will help include relevant records.

- **Ensure Data in `team_basket`:**
  - Verify that the `team_basket` field contains the expected values ('left' or 'right'). If not, you might need to adjust the condition or investigate the data further.

**Note:**

- **Testing Data Availability:**
  - Before running the full query, you might want to run simpler queries to check data availability. For example:

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
    WHERE event_type = 'shot'
      AND shot_type IS NOT NULL
      AND event_coord_x IS NOT NULL
      AND event_coord_y IS NOT NULL;
    ```

- **Adjusting for Date Fields:**
  - If you need to filter by date, verify the format and existence of the date fields. Use `DATE(scheduled_date)` or check if there's another date field like `gametime`.

By making these adjustments, the query should now return data and provide the desired results.
