2025-01-23 12:39:06 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-23 12:39:06 - root - INFO - I apologize for the confusion earlier. It seems that the column `day_of_week_name` does not exist in the `accident_2016` table. My previous assumption was incorrect. Let's address this error and adjust the queries accordingly.

**Explanation:**

- The `day_of_week` column contains numeric codes representing days of the week.
- We can create a mapping from these numeric codes to their respective day names using a `CASE` statement.
- Similarly, if `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` and `atmospheric_conditions_2_name` do not exist, we'll need to map the codes in `atmospheric_conditions_1` and `atmospheric_conditions_2` to their corresponding weather condition names.

---

**Updated Queries:**

1. **List distinct `day_of_week` values with their corresponding names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     day_of_week,
     CASE day_of_week
       WHEN 1 THEN 'Sunday'
       WHEN 2 THEN 'Monday'
       WHEN 3 THEN 'Tuesday'
       WHEN 4 THEN 'Wednesday'
       WHEN 5 THEN 'Thursday'
       WHEN 6 THEN 'Friday'
       WHEN 7 THEN 'Saturday'
       ELSE 'Unknown'
     END AS day_of_week_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct atmospheric condition codes and their names:**

   Since the `atmospheric_conditions_1_name` field does not exist, we'll map the codes in `atmospheric_conditions_1` to their corresponding condition names.

   **First, find the distinct atmospheric condition codes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT atmospheric_conditions_1
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Assuming the following mapping based on FARS documentation (you might need to verify these codes for accuracy):**

   - 0: No Adverse Atmospheric Conditions (Clear)
   - 1: Rain
   - 2: Sleet or Hail
   - 3: Snow
   - 4: Fog, Smog, Smoke
   - 5: Severe Crosswinds
   - 6: Blowing Sand, Soil, Dirt
   - 7: Blowing Snow
   - 8: Other
   - 10: Cloudy
   - 11: Blowing Debris
   - 12: Freezing Rain or Drizzle
   - 98: Not Reported
   - 99: Unknown

   **Map the codes to condition names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     atmospheric_conditions_1,
     CASE atmospheric_conditions_1
       WHEN 0 THEN 'Clear'
       WHEN 1 THEN 'Rain'
       WHEN 2 THEN 'Sleet or Hail'
       WHEN 3 THEN 'Snow'
       WHEN 4 THEN 'Fog, Smog, Smoke'
       WHEN 5 THEN 'Severe Crosswinds'
       WHEN 6 THEN 'Blowing Sand, Soil, Dirt'
       WHEN 7 THEN 'Blowing Snow'
       WHEN 8 THEN 'Other'
       WHEN 10 THEN 'Cloudy'
       WHEN 11 THEN 'Blowing Debris'
       WHEN 12 THEN 'Freezing Rain or Drizzle'
       WHEN 98 THEN 'Not Reported'
       WHEN 99 THEN 'Unknown'
       ELSE 'Unknown'
     END AS atmospheric_conditions_1_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count accidents during weekends under clear weather per state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     state_name,
     COUNT(*) AS clear_weather_accidents
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE day_of_week IN (1, 7)  -- Sunday and Saturday
     AND atmospheric_conditions_1 = 0  -- Clear weather
   GROUP BY state_name
   ORDER BY clear_weather_accidents DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count accidents during weekends under rainy weather per state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     state_name,
     COUNT(*) AS rainy_weather_accidents
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE day_of_week IN (1, 7)
     AND atmospheric_conditions_1 = 1  -- Rainy weather
   GROUP BY state_name
   ORDER BY rainy_weather_accidents DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate the difference in the number of accidents between rainy and clear weather during weekends per state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     state_name,
     ABS(SUM(CASE WHEN atmospheric_conditions_1 = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)  -- Rainy weather
       - SUM(CASE WHEN atmospheric_conditions_1 = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) AS difference_in_accidents
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE day_of_week IN (1, 7)
   GROUP BY state_name
   ORDER BY difference_in_accidents DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

6. **Retrieve the top 3 states with the largest differences:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     state_name,
     SUM(CASE WHEN atmospheric_conditions_1 = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS rainy_weather_accidents,
     SUM(CASE WHEN atmospheric_conditions_1 = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS clear_weather_accidents,
     ABS(SUM(CASE WHEN atmospheric_conditions_1 = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
       - SUM(CASE WHEN atmospheric_conditions_1 = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) AS difference_in_accidents
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE day_of_week IN (1, 7)
   GROUP BY state_name
   ORDER BY difference_in_accidents DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

---

**Sample Output Explanation:**

The corrected queries now map the numeric codes to meaningful names using `CASE` statements. By doing so, we can accurately filter and count accidents based on weather conditions.

- **Weekend Days:**
  - `day_of_week` codes 1 and 7 represent Sunday and Saturday, respectively.

- **Weather Conditions:**
  - **Rainy Weather:** `atmospheric_conditions_1 = 1`
  - **Clear Weather:** `atmospheric_conditions_1 = 0`

---

**Final Result:**

Using the corrected queries, you can obtain the top 3 states with the largest differences in the number of traffic accidents between rainy and clear weather during weekends in 2016, along with the respective differences.

```csv
State,Difference
state1_name:str,difference1:int
state2_name:str,difference2:int
state3_name:str,difference3:int
```

---

**Note:** Please ensure that you verify the actual code mappings for `atmospheric_conditions_1` based on the official FARS documentation or data dictionary for 2016. The mappings provided above are common but may vary slightly in the dataset.

    ORDER BY accident_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Identify the days with the highest number of accidents during weekends:**
    ```sql
    SELECT day_of_week_name, COUNT(*) AS accident_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
    WHERE day_of_week IN (1, 7)
    GROUP BY day_of_week_name
    ORDER BY accident_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **List atmospheric conditions with the highest accident counts during weekends:**
    ```sql
    SELECT atmospheric_conditions_1_name, COUNT(*) AS accident_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
    WHERE day_of_week IN (1, 7)
    GROUP BY atmospheric_conditions_1_name
    ORDER BY accident_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Which top 3 states had the largest differences in the number of traffic accidents between rainy and clear weather during weekends in 2016? Please also provide the respective differences for each state.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
State,Difference
state1_name:str,difference1:int
state2_name:str,difference2:int
state3_name:str,difference3:int
```

The top 3 states with the largest differences in the number of traffic accidents between rainy and clear weather during weekends in 2016 are listed above, along with the respective differences for each state..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 12:41:56 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which top 3 states had the largest differences in the number of traffic accidents between rainy and clear weather during weekends in 2016? Please also provide the respective differences for each state., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
State,Difference
state1_name:str,difference1:int
