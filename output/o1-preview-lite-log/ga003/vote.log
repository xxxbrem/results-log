After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, **2result.sql** is the correct choice for the following reasons:

1. **Event Filtering**:
   - **0result.sql** filters events where `event_name = 'level_complete'`.
   - **2result.sql** filters events where `event_name = 'level_complete_quickplay'`.

   Since we are interested in quick play mode completions, **2result.sql** correctly filters for the relevant events.

2. **Board Type Extraction**:
   - **0result.sql** extracts `level_name` as `board_type`, which represents different levels (e.g., `level_1`, `level_2`).
   - **2result.sql** extracts `board` as `board_type`, which corresponds to board sizes (`'S'`, `'M'`, `'L'`).

   Board sizes (`'S'`, `'M'`, `'L'`) are the actual board types we want to evaluate for effectiveness, not individual levels.

3. **Score Extraction**:
   - Both queries extract the `score` from the `value` parameter, but **2result.sql** does so within the context of quick play mode completions.

4. **Results Interpretation**:
   - **0result.sql** provides average scores per level, which doesn't directly address the effectiveness of board types.
   - **2result.sql** provides average scores per board size, giving clear insight into which board types were most effective.

**Therefore, 2result.sql is the correct SQL query to use.**
