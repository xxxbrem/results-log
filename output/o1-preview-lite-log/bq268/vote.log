After comparing both SQL queries, the correct SQL to use is `1result.sql`.

**Reason:**

The first query (`0result.sql`) uses `IFNULL(first_transaction_time, last_visit)` to determine the last recorded event time. This approach assumes that if a user has a transaction, the first transaction time is the last event, without considering if there were subsequent visits after the transaction. It does not account for cases where the last visit may occur after the first transaction.

The second query (`1result.sql`) correctly identifies the last recorded event by taking the later of the last visit time and the first transaction time using the `GREATEST` function:

```sql
GREATEST(uflv.last_visit_time, IFNULL(uft.first_transaction_time, uflv.last_visit_time)) AS last_recorded_event_time
```

This ensures that the last recorded event is accurately determined as the most recent of either the last visit or the first transaction. It addresses scenarios where a user might have continued to visit after making a transaction, thus providing a more accurate calculation of the days between the first visit and the last recorded event.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

1result.sql
