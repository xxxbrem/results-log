After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- The SQL script in `1result.sql` accurately performs the required steps:

  - **Groups users by the week of their first session start**: It uses `DATE_TRUNC` to group users into cohorts based on the first session week starting from July 2, 2018.

  - **Calculates retention in the fourth week**: It correctly identifies users who returned in the fourth week (between 21 to 27 days after the cohort week) by comparing event dates.

  - **Computes retention rates**: It calculates the retention rate by dividing the number of users who returned in the fourth week by the total number of users in the cohort.

  - **Identifies the cohort with the highest retention rate**: It orders the cohorts by retention rate and selects the one with the highest value.

- The result aligns with the task's requirement, providing the cohort week in the "YYYY-MM-DD" format.
