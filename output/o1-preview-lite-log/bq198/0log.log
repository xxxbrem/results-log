   ORDER BY wins DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find the maximum number of wins in each season between 1900 and 2000:**

   SELECT season, market, wins
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000 AND wins >= 30
   ORDER BY season, wins DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   ORDER BY wins DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   SELECT t.season, t.market, t.wins
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` AS t
   WHERE t.season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000

       WHERE season = t.season
     )
   ORDER BY t.season
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count the number of times each team had the maximum wins in a season (1900-2000):**

   ```sql
   SELECT market, COUNT(*) AS num_max_wins
   FROM (
     SELECT t.season, t.market
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` AS t

10. **Retrieve the top 5 most successful teams based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season (1900-2000):**

    ```sql
    SELECT market, COUNT(*) AS num_max_wins
    FROM (
      SELECT t.season, t.market
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` AS t
      WHERE t.season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
        AND t.wins = (
          SELECT MAX(wins)
          FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
          WHERE season = t.season
        )
    )
    GROUP BY market
    ORDER BY num_max_wins DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Queries 1 & 2:** Retrieve unique seasons and teams to understand the data scope.
- **Queries 3 & 4:** Examine team performance in specific boundary years (1900 and 2000).
- **Query 5:** Find the maximum wins in each season to identify peak performance.
- **Query 6:** Identify teams with exceptional performance (wins >= 30).
- **Query 7:** List teams with the highest wins across all seasons for an overall view.
- **Query 8:** Find teams that achieved the maximum wins in their respective seasons.
- **Query 9:** Count how many times each team had the maximum wins across the seasons.
- **Query 10:** Extract the top 5 teams based on the number of times they had the maximum wins.

---

**Final Answer Format:**

After executing **Query 10**, the results should be presented in the following format:

```csv
market,num_max_wins
Team A,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team B,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team C,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team D,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team E,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

- **`market`**: The school name of the college basketball team.
- **`num_max_wins`**: The number of seasons between 1900 and 2000 in which the team had the maximum number of wins.

**Note:** Since we are not executing the queries here, specific team names and counts are not provided. By running **Query 10** on the dataset, you will obtain the actual top 5 teams.

---

**Summary:**

We identified the relevant table and columns needed to solve the task. By constructing a series of SQL queries, we progressively explored the data to understand team performances over the seasons from 1900 to 2000. The final query (Query 10) provides the solution to the task by listing the top 5 most successful college basketball teams based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season during that period.Query:

Task: What are the top 5 most successful college basketball teams over the seasons from 1900 to 2000, based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the **top 5 most successful college basketball teams** over the seasons from **1900 to 2000**, based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season, we would perform the following steps using the `mbb_historical_teams_seasons` table from the `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball` dataset:

1. **Filter** the data for seasons between 1900 and 2000.
2. **Identify** the maximum number of wins for each season.
3. **Find** the teams that achieved this maximum number of wins in each season.
4. **Count** the number of times each team had the maximum wins over all seasons in the range.
5. **Sort** the teams in descending order of these counts.
6. **Select** the top 5 teams.

The results would be presented in the following format:

```csv
market,num_max_wins
Team A,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team B,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team C,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team D,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
Team E,number_of_seasons_with_max_wins
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

**Explanation:**

- **market**: The school name of the college basketball team.
- **num_max_wins**: The number of seasons between 1900 and 2000 in which the team had the maximum number of wins.

*Note:* Without access to execute the SQL query on the actual dataset, specific team names and counts cannot be provided here. However, following the above steps on the dataset will yield the desired top 5 teams..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
