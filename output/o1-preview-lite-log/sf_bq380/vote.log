After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that `1result.sql` is the correct answer.

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reason:**

Both SQL queries aim to find the usernames of the top three users with the most upvotes received in the Kaggle forum, along with the number of upvotes they received and the number they gave to others. They both produce the same correct results:

```
UserName    UpvotesReceived    UpvotesGiven
cdeotte     54855              17256
cpmpml      40201              13103
hengck23    34219              396
```

However, `1result.sql` is structured in a way that is more efficient and easier to understand:

1. **Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** The query utilizes CTEs (`WITH` clauses) to separately calculate upvotes received and upvotes given. This improves readability by breaking down the query into logical sections.

2. **Efficient Joins:** By starting with the `UpvotesReceived` CTE, the query focuses on users who have actually received upvotes. It then left joins the `UpvotesGiven` CTE to include upvotes given. This approach reduces the amount of data processed, as it doesn't start from the entire `USERS` table.

3. **Proper Handling of Null Values:** The use of `COALESCE` ensures that users who haven't given any upvotes are still included, with `0` displayed for `UpvotesGiven`.

4. **Clear Ordering:** The query explicitly orders the results by `UpvotesReceived` in descending order, ensuring that the top users are correctly identified.

In contrast, `0result.sql` starts from the entire `USERS` table and performs left joins with subqueries. This means it processes all users, even those who haven't received any upvotes, which is unnecessary for this specific task. While it still produces the correct result, it's less efficient and slightly less readable due to the nested subqueries within the `LEFT JOIN`s.

Therefore, `1result.sql` is the preferred and correct SQL query for this task.
