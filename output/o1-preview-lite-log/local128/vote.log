After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that fulfills the task requirements.

**Explanation:**

- **`0result.sql`**:
  - **Selects** the bowler's first and last name concatenated as "BowlerName", match number, game number, handicap score labeled as "HandicapScore", tournament date labeled as "TournamentDate", and location.
  - **Applies all required conditions**:
    - Filters for bowlers who **won their game** (`bs."WonGame" = 1`).
    - Filters for **handicap scores of 190 or less** (`bs."HandiCapScore" <= 190`).
    - Filters for tournaments held at **Thunderbird Lanes, Totem Lanes, or Bolero Lanes** (`t."TourneyLocation" IN ('Thunderbird Lanes', 'Totem Lanes', 'Bolero Lanes')`).
  - **Orders the results** by match number and game number, which aligns with the task's focus on listing specific games and matches.

- **`1result.sql`**:
  - Similar to `0result.sql`, but it orders the results by handicap score ascending. While this is acceptable, the task doesn't specify ordering by handicap score. The ordering in `0result.sql` is more appropriate for listing matches and games sequentially.

- **`2result.sql`**:
  - Lacks any ordering of the results. While this doesn't violate the task requirements, having an ordered list enhances readability and usefulness.

**Conclusion:**

The SQL query in **`0result.sql`** best meets all the specified requirements and presents the data in a logical and organized manner.
