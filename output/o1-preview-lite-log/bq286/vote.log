After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I conclude that all three SQL scripts correctly compute the name of the most popular female baby in Wyoming for the year 2021, based on the proportion of occurrences compared to the total in the US. Each script calculates the proportion for each name and orders them in descending order to find the name with the highest proportion.

However, **`1result.sql`** is slightly more precise because it explicitly casts the numerator to `FLOAT64`, ensuring accurate floating-point division. This prevents any potential integer division issues that might arise during the calculation of the proportion.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
