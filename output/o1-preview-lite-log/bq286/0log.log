Task: Can you tell me the name of the most popular female baby in Wyoming for the year 2021, based on the proportion of female babies given that name compared to the total number of female babies given the same name across all states?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Name
[Data Unavailable]:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

I apologize, but I cannot provide the exact name because the specific data for female baby names in Wyoming for the year 2021 is not available. To determine the most popular female baby name based on the specified proportion, you would need to analyze the `usa_1910_current` table by:

1. Filtering records where `state` is `'WY'`, `gender` is `'F'`, and `year` is `2021`.
2. Summing the `number` of occurrences for each `name` in Wyoming.
3. Calculating the total occurrences of each `name` across all states for the year 2021.
4. Computing the proportion of each `name` by dividing its occurrences in Wyoming by its total occurrences nationwide.
5. Identifying the `name` with the highest proportion..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'usa_names': ['usa_1910_2013', 'usa_1910_current']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
