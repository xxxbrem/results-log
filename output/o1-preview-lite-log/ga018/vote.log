**Reason:**

The task is to calculate the percentage of times users go from browsing product listing pages (PLPs) to clicking into product detail pages (PDPs) during a single session on January 2nd, 2021.

**Comparison of the Two SQL Queries:**

1. **First SQL (`1result.sql`):**
   - **Approach:**
     - Identifies PLPs based on the presence of category keywords in the `page_title` for `page_view` events.
     - Identifies PDPs based on `event_name` = `'view_item'`.
     - Calculates the percentage of sessions where users transition from PLP to PDP by comparing timestamps.
   - **Potential Issues:**
     - **Limited Identification of PDPs:** Relying solely on `event_name` = `'view_item'` may miss PDP page views that do not trigger a `'view_item'` event.
     - **Inaccuracy in PLP Identification:** Using `page_title` may not reliably distinguish PLPs from other pages, as titles can be inconsistent or may not contain category keywords.
   - **Result:** Percentage = **8.7783%**

2. **Second SQL (`2result.sql`):**
   - **Approach:**
     - Analyzes the structure of the `page_location` (URL) to classify pages as PLPs or PDPs.
     - **PLP Identification:** Based on specific URL patterns where the last segment matches category names.
     - **PDP Identification:** Identifies PDPs when the URL contains product details beyond the category level.
     - Calculates the percentage of sessions where users viewed both PLPs and PDPs within the same session.
   - **Advantages:**
     - **Accurate Page Classification:** Utilizing URL structures provides a more precise method to distinguish between PLPs and PDPs.
     - **Comprehensive Data:** By examining all `page_view` events and URLs, the query captures more instances of user transitions.
   - **Result:** Percentage = **20.4372%**

**Conclusion:**

The **second SQL query (`2result.sql`)** is the correct choice because it provides a more accurate and reliable method for identifying PLPs and PDPs by analyzing the URL structures in the `page_location`. This approach ensures that all relevant page views are considered, leading to a more precise calculation of the percentage of sessions where users transition from PLPs to PDPs.
