After analyzing both SQL queries and their respective results, the first query `0result.sql` is the correct one for calculating the percentage of times users go from browsing product list pages (PLPs) to clicking into product detail pages (PDPs) during a single session on January 2nd, 2021.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Objective:**
   - We need to calculate the percentage of sessions where users viewed PLPs and then proceeded to view PDPs within the same session.

2. **Analysis of `0result.sql`:**

   - **PLP Sessions:**
     - The `plp_sessions` CTE identifies sessions where users viewed pages related to product listings (PLPs).
     - It filters `page_view` events where the `page_location` contains `'apparel'`, indicating a PLP.
     - It constructs a unique `session_id` by combining `user_pseudo_id` and `ga_session_id`.

   - **PDP Sessions:**
     - The `pdp_sessions` CTE identifies sessions where users viewed product detail pages (PDPs).
     - It selects sessions where the event name is `'view_item'`, which corresponds to viewing a product detail.
     - It constructs the same unique `session_id`.

   - **Sessions with Both PLP and PDP:**
     - The `plp_pdp_sessions` CTE finds the intersection of `plp_sessions` and `pdp_sessions`, identifying sessions where both PLPs and PDPs were viewed.

   - **Calculating the Percentage:**
     - The final `SELECT` statement calculates the percentage of `plp_pdp_sessions` over all `plp_sessions`.
     - It uses `COUNT(DISTINCT session_id)` to get unique sessions and computes the percentage accordingly.

   - **Result:**
     - The query results in approximately **19.26%**, indicating that in 19.26% of sessions where users viewed PLPs, they also viewed PDPs.

3. **Analysis of `2result.sql`:**

   - **Complexity and Strict Criteria:**
     - The query attempts to classify pages as PLPs or PDPs based on URL structure, which may be overly complex and potentially exclude valid pages.
     - It relies on specific patterns in the URL segments and may miss pages that don't fit precisely into those patterns.

   - **Low Percentage Result:**
     - It calculates a percentage of **0.3454%**, which seems unrealistically low.
     - This suggests that the criteria used to identify PLPs and PDPs might be too restrictive, causing the undercounting of sessions.

4. **Conclusion:**

   - The first query (`0result.sql`) aligns better with the objective by using event names (`'page_view'` and `'view_item'`) and known parameters (`'page_location'`) to identify PLPs and PDPs.
   - It provides a more plausible result, indicating a reasonable percentage of users transitioning from PLPs to PDPs.

Therefore, the correct SQL query to use is:

0result.sql
