After carefully analyzing the three candidate SQL queries and their results, I believe that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL that accurately computes the required bowling statistics. Here's the reasoning:

### **Reasoning:**

1. **Exclusion of 'run out' dismissals:**
   - The task specifies that we should **exclude dismissals not credited to the bowler (e.g., 'run out')** when counting wickets.
   - In **`1result.sql`**, the `wickets` CTE includes a **`WHERE` clause**:
     ```sql
     WHERE wt."kind_out" != 'run out'
     ```
     This ensures that only wickets credited to the bowler are counted.
   - In **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`**, there is no explicit exclusion of 'run out' dismissals when counting wickets. This means that they might incorrectly include 'run out' wickets in the bowler's wicket tally.

2. **Accurate Calculation of Best Performance:**
   - **`1result.sql`** calculates the best performance by:
     - Identifying matches where the bowler took the maximum number of wickets.
     - Selecting the match where the bowler conceded the least runs among those matches.
   - It ensures that the best performance is in the correct **"wickets-runs"** format.

3. **Correct Calculation of Economy Rate and Strike Rate:**
   - **`1result.sql`** computes:
     - **Economy Rate** as `(total_runs_conceded * 1.0) / (total_balls_bowled / 6.0)`
     - **Strike Rate** as `(total_balls_bowled * 1.0) / total_wickets`
   - These calculations align with cricket standards and the task requirements.

4. **Ignoring Extra Runs:**
   - All three SQL queries join with the `batsman_scored` table to calculate runs conceded, which means they are **excluding extra runs** (like wides and no-balls) as per the task's instructions.
   - However, since **`1result.sql`** already excels in correctly counting wickets, it maintains an overall accurate calculation.

### **Conclusion:**

Given the accurate exclusion of 'run out' dismissals and correct calculations aligned with the task requirements, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL.
