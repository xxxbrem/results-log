**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **`channelGrouping`**: Used to group data by different marketing channels.
- **`country`**: Identifies the country associated with each transaction.
- **`transactions`**: Represents the number of transactions in a session; used to calculate total transactions.
- **`fullVisitorId`**: Can be used to identify unique visitors (sessions).
- **`date`**: May be useful for filtering data by specific dates or date ranges.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- Channels that include transactions from more than one country.
- Sessions where the number of transactions is greater than zero.
- Grouping data to calculate the total transactions per country within each channel grouping.
- Filtering channels based on the count of distinct countries associated with them.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct channel groupings:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT channelGrouping
   FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct countries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT country
   FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count the number of transactions per country:**

   ```sql
   SELECT country, SUM(transactions) AS total_transactions
   FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
   GROUP BY country
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count the number of transactions per channel grouping:**

   ```sql
   SELECT channelGrouping, SUM(transactions) AS total_transactions
   FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
   GROUP BY channelGrouping
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find channels that have transactions from more than one country:**

   ```sql
   SELECT channelGrouping, COUNT(DISTINCT country) AS country_count
   FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
   GROUP BY channelGrouping
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT country) > 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List total transactions per country within each channel grouping:**

   ```sql
   SELECT channelGrouping, country, SUM(transactions) AS total_transactions
   FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
   GROUP BY channelGrouping, country
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Identify the top country by transactions within each channel grouping:**

   ```sql
   SELECT channelGrouping, country, SUM(transactions) AS total_transactions
   FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
   GROUP BY channelGrouping, country
   ORDER BY channelGrouping, total_transactions DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Filter to channels with transactions from multiple countries and list their countries and transactions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT channelGrouping, country, SUM(transactions) AS total_transactions
   FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
   WHERE channelGrouping IN (
     SELECT channelGrouping
     FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
     GROUP BY channelGrouping
     HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT country) > 1
   )
   GROUP BY channelGrouping, country
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Aggregate total transactions only for sessions with transactions greater than zero:**

   ```sql
   SELECT channelGrouping, country, SUM(transactions) AS total_transactions
   FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
   WHERE transactions > 0
   GROUP BY channelGrouping, country
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Get the country with the highest transactions within each channel grouping for channels with transactions from multiple countries:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      channelGrouping,
      country,
      total_transactions
    FROM (
      SELECT
        channelGrouping,
        country,
        SUM(transactions) AS total_transactions,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY channelGrouping ORDER BY SUM(transactions) DESC) AS rn
      FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
      WHERE channelGrouping IN (
        SELECT channelGrouping
        FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
        GROUP BY channelGrouping
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT country) > 1
      )
      GROUP BY channelGrouping, country
    )
    WHERE rn = 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, provided that the channel includes transactions from more than one country. What is the transaction total for that country?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, considering only those channels that include transactions from more than one country, we can aggregate the transaction data accordingly.

```csv
ChannelGrouping,Country,TotalTransactions
channel_grouping1:str,country1:str,total_transactions1:int
channel_grouping2:str,country2:str,total_transactions2:int
...
```
*(Attention: answer includes one row for each qualifying channel grouping.)*

**Explanation:**

The table above displays, for each channel grouping that has transactions from multiple countries, the country with the highest total transactions along with the transaction total for that country..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'data-to-insights': {'ecommerce': ['all_sessions', 'all_sessions_raw', 'categories', 'checkout_nudge', 'classification_model_2_results', 'days_with_rain', 'partition_by_day', 'partitions', 'product_list', 'products', 'rev_transactions', 'sales_by_sku', 'sales_report', 'site_wide_promotion', 'web_analytics']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-28 05:54:00 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-28 05:54:00 - root - INFO - To identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, considering only those channels that include transactions from more than one country, we can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  channelGrouping AS ChannelGrouping,
  country AS Country,
  SUM(transactions) AS TotalTransactions
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
WHERE transactions > 0
GROUP BY channelGrouping, country
HAVING channelGrouping IN (
  SELECT channelGrouping
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
  WHERE transactions > 0
  GROUP BY channelGrouping
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT country) > 1
)
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
  PARTITION BY channelGrouping
  ORDER BY SUM(transactions) DESC
) = 1
```

**Explanation:**

This query performs the following steps:

1. Filters the data to include only sessions where `transactions > 0`.
2. Groups the data by `channelGrouping` and `country` to calculate the total transactions for each combination.
3. Identifies channel groupings that have transactions from more than one country.
4. Uses the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function with `QUALIFY` to select the country with the highest total transactions within each qualifying channel grouping.

2025-01-28 05:54:02 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, provided that the channel includes transactions from more than one country. What is the transaction total for that country?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, considering only those channels that include transactions from more than one country, we can aggregate the transaction data accordingly.

```csv
ChannelGrouping,Country,TotalTransactions
channel_grouping1:str,country1:str,total_transactions1:int
channel_grouping2:str,country2:str,total_transactions2:int
...
```
*(Attention: answer includes one row for each qualifying channel grouping.)*

**Explanation:**

The table above displays, for each channel grouping that has transactions from multiple countries, the country with the highest total transactions along with the transaction total for that country. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
