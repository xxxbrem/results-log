After comparing the three SQL queries, **2result.sql** is the correct choice for the following reasons:

1. **Explicit NULL Checks**: This query includes explicit checks for NULL values on both the `"age"` and `"gender"` columns using `IS NOT NULL`. This ensures that only valid and complete data is considered in the calculations, which is important for accurate results.

2. **Correct Age Extremes Calculation**: It accurately computes the youngest and oldest ages per gender within the specified date range by using a common table expression (CTE) named `gender_ages`. This CTE filters out any NULL values and groups the data by `"gender"`, finding the `MIN("age")` and `MAX("age")` for each gender.

3. **Proper Data Filtering**: The query correctly filters users based on the `"created_at"` timestamp between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022, ensuring that only users created within this period are included.

4. **Accurate Counting and Grouping**: It accurately counts the total number of youngest and oldest users separately for each gender by joining the main users table with the `gender_ages` CTE and grouping by `"gender"` and `"Age_Type"`.

5. **Clear and Maintainable Structure**: The use of CTEs and the structure of the query make it clear and maintainable, which is beneficial for future modifications or understanding by other developers.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:
