After comparing both SQL queries and their respective outputs, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query.

**Reason:**

The main difference between the two SQL queries is how they calculate **`Actual_Purchases`** and **`Left_in_Cart`**:

- **`0result.sql`**:
  - **Approach**: Counts **`Actual_Purchases`** for a product by checking if the **`cookie_id`** associated with an **`Add_to_Cart`** event ever made a **`Purchase`** event, regardless of the product or session.
  - **Issue**: This method may inaccurately attribute purchases to products that were not actually purchased in the same session or not purchased at all. It doesn't confirm that the **`Purchase`** event is related to the same **`visit_id`** or product, leading to potential overcounting of **`Actual_Purchases`**.

- **`1result.sql`**:
  - **Approach**: Calculates **`Actual_Purchases`** by grouping **`Add_to_Cart`** events per **`visit_id`** and **`product_id`**, then checks whether that **`visit_id`** had a **`Purchase`** event. This method assumes that if a purchase occurs in a session, the products added to the cart in that session are the ones purchased.
  - **Advantage**: This approach more accurately associates purchases with the specific products added to the cart within the same session. It recognizes that **`Purchase`** events may not have a direct association with specific products (due to missing **`page_id`** mappings) and compensates by using session-level data.

Given that **`Purchase`** events occur on pages that are filtered out (**`page_id`** in (1, 2, 12, 13)), and there is no direct mapping of **`Purchase`** events to specific products via **`page_id`**, using **`visit_id`** provides a logical approach to link purchases to products.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** provides a more accurate and reliable calculation of **`Actual_Purchases`** and **`Left_in_Cart`** per product, aligning better with the data structure and the task requirements.
