Task: Could you provide the total number of 'Other Theft' incidents within the 'Theft and Handling' category for each year in the Westminster borough?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Certainly! Here is the total number of 'Other Theft' incidents within the 'Theft and Handling' category for each year in the Westminster borough:

```csv
Year,Total_Incidents
year1:int,incidents1:int
year2:int,incidents2:int
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: The year in which the incidents occurred.
- **Total_Incidents**: The total number of 'Other Theft' incidents in the Westminster borough for that year.

Each row represents a specific year and the corresponding total number of 'Other Theft' incidents recorded under the 'Theft and Handling' category in Westminster..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'london_crime': ['crime_by_lsoa'], 'london_fire_brigade': ['fire_brigade_service_calls']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 00:59:45 - root - INFO - Certainly! Here is the SQL query to obtain the total number of 'Other Theft' incidents within the 'Theft and Handling' category for each year in the Westminster borough:

```sql
SELECT
  year,
  SUM(value) AS Total_Incidents
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
WHERE
  borough = 'Westminster'
  AND major_category = 'Theft and Handling'
  AND minor_category = 'Other Theft'
GROUP BY
  year
ORDER BY
  year;
```

**Explanation:**

- **year**: The year in which the incidents occurred.
- **Total_Incidents**: The total number of 'Other Theft' incidents in the Westminster borough for that year.

This query selects the year and calculates the sum of the `value` field (which represents the number of incidents) for records that meet the specified conditions:
- **borough** is 'Westminster'
- **major_category** is 'Theft and Handling'
- **minor_category** is 'Other Theft'

The results are grouped by year and ordered chronologically.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Certainly! Here is the total number of 'Other Theft' incidents within the 'Theft and Handling' category for each year in the Westminster borough:

```csv
Year,Total_Incidents
year1:int,incidents1:int
year2:int,incidents2:int
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: The year in which the incidents occurred.
- **Total_Incidents**: The total number of 'Other Theft' incidents in the Westminster borough for that year.

Each row represents a specific year and the corresponding total number of 'Other Theft' incidents recorded under the 'Theft and Handling' category in Westminster. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
