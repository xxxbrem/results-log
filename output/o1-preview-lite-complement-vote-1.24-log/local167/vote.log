After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Functionality:**
  Both SQL queries are designed to find the state with the highest number of female legislators whose term end dates fall on December 31st.

- **Handling of Ties:**
  - **`0result.sql`:**
    - Uses the `ORDER BY` clause with two criteria:
      - `Number_of_female_legislators_with_term_end_on_December_31st DESC` to sort by the count in descending order.
      - `t."state" ASC` to sort state abbreviations alphabetically in ascending order when counts are equal.
    - This ensures a deterministic result in case of ties by consistently selecting the state that comes first alphabetically.
  - **`1result.sql`:**
    - Orders only by `Number_of_female_legislators_with_term_end_on_December_31st DESC`.
    - Does not specify a secondary sort for ties, leading to non-deterministic results when multiple states share the highest count.

- **Results:**
  - Both queries return a count of `1` for their respective states (`MI` in `0result.sql` and `NM` in `1result.sql`).
  - Since both states have the same count, the correct query should handle this tie explicitly, which `0result.sql` does.

**Conclusion:**

By explicitly handling ties through the secondary sorting of state abbreviations, **`0result.sql`** provides a consistent and deterministic result, making it the correct choice.
