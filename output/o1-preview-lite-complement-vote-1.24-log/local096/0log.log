It addresses the issue of missing data by accounting for actors with unspecified gender (NULL values) and considers them as non-female actors to ensure accuracy.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Movie** table:
   - `"MID"`: Movie ID, used to identify movies.
   - `"title"`: The title of the movie.
   - `"year"`: The release year of the movie.

2. **M_Cast** table:
   - `"MID"`: Movie ID, linking movies to cast members.
   - `"PID"`: Person ID, representing actors/actresses in each movie.

3. **Person** table:
   - `"PID"`: Person ID, identifying individuals in the database.
   - `"Name"`: The name of the person.
   - `"Gender"`: The gender of the person.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Filtering by Gender:** To select only female actors: `Person."Gender" = 'Female'`.
- **Excluding Movies with Male Actors:** To find movies without male actors.
- **Joining Tables:** To associate movies with their cast members and cast members with their genders.
- **Grouping Data:** To aggregate data by year.
- **Calculating Proportions:** To compute the proportion of female-actor-only films per year.

---

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. **List all movies with their IDs, titles, and years:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "MID", "title", "year"
   FROM "Movie"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all cast relationships between movies and persons:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "MID", "PID"
   FROM "M_Cast"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all persons with their IDs, names, and genders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "PID", "Name", "Gender"
   FROM "Person"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find all female actors and their IDs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "PID", "Name"
   FROM "Person"
   WHERE "Gender" = 'Female'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List all movies along with their cast members' names and genders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT m."MID", m."title", p."Name", p."Gender"
   FROM "Movie" m
   JOIN "M_Cast" mc ON m."MID" = mc."MID"
   JOIN "Person" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find movies that have male actors:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT m."MID", m."title"
   FROM "Movie" m
   JOIN "M_Cast" mc ON m."MID" = mc."MID"
   JOIN "Person" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
   WHERE p."Gender" = 'Male'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List movies that have only female actors:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT m."MID", m."title"
   FROM "Movie" m
   WHERE m."MID" NOT IN (
       SELECT mc."MID"
       FROM "M_Cast" mc
       JOIN "Person" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
       WHERE p."Gender" = 'Male'
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count the total number of films for each year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "year", COUNT(DISTINCT "MID") AS TotalFilms
   FROM "Movie"
   GROUP BY "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count the number of female-actor-only films for each year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT m."year", COUNT(DISTINCT m."MID") AS FemaleOnlyFilms
   FROM "Movie" m
   WHERE m."MID" NOT IN (
       SELECT mc."MID"
       FROM "M_Cast" mc
       JOIN "Person" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
       WHERE p."Gender" = 'Male'
   )
   GROUP BY m."year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate the proportion of films with exclusively female actors for each year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        t."year",
        (f.FemaleOnlyFilms * 1.0) / t.TotalFilms AS FemaleOnlyFilmProportion,
        t.TotalFilms
    FROM (
        SELECT "year", COUNT(DISTINCT "MID") AS TotalFilms
        FROM "Movie"
        GROUP BY "year"
    ) t
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT m."year", COUNT(DISTINCT m."MID") AS FemaleOnlyFilms
        FROM "Movie" m
        WHERE m."MID" NOT IN (
            SELECT mc."MID"
            FROM "M_Cast" mc
            JOIN "Person" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
            WHERE p."Gender" = 'Male'
        )
        GROUP BY m."year"
    ) f ON t."year" = f."year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progress from simple data retrieval to more complex aggregations and calculations. They help in understanding the data distribution and relationships among the tables, which is essential for computing the desired proportions.Query:

Task: I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,FemaleOnlyFilmProportion,TotalFilms
year1:int,proportion1:float,total1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float,total2:int
...
```

This table displays, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors (`FemaleOnlyFilmProportion`) and the total number of all films released in that year (`TotalFilms`)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 09:26:54 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,FemaleOnlyFilmProportion,TotalFilms
year1:int,proportion1:float,total1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float,total2:int
...
```

This table displays, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors (`FemaleOnlyFilmProportion`) and the total number of all films released in that year (`TotalFilms`). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 09:31:59 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,FemaleOnlyFilmProportion,TotalFilms
year1:int,proportion1:float,total1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float,total2:int
...
```

This table displays, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors (`FemaleOnlyFilmProportion`) and the total number of all films released in that year (`TotalFilms`). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 09:32:47 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,FemaleOnlyFilmProportion,TotalFilms
year1:int,proportion1:float,total1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float,total2:int
...
```

This table displays, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors (`FemaleOnlyFilmProportion`) and the total number of all films released in that year (`TotalFilms`). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
