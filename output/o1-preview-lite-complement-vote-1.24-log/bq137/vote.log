I have compared the two SQL queries provided and determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct query for the task.

**Reason:**

- **Proper Filtering Before Join:** In `2result.sql`, the population data is pre-filtered in a subquery to include only the total population records where `minimum_age`, `maximum_age`, and `gender` are `NULL`. This ensures that only relevant population data is joined.

  ```sql
  LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT zipcode, population
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_usa.population_by_zip_2010`
    WHERE minimum_age IS NULL AND maximum_age IS NULL AND gender IS NULL
  ) AS p
  ON z.zipcode = p.zipcode
  ```

- **Preserving Left Join Integrity:** By filtering the population data before the `LEFT JOIN`, we prevent the join from turning into an `INNER JOIN`. This means all ZIP code areas within 10 kilometers of the specified coordinates are included in the results, even if there is no corresponding population data.

- **Correct Use of `ST_DWithin` Function:** The query correctly uses the `ST_DWithin` function to find ZIP code areas within 10 kilometers of the coordinates (-122.3321, 47.6062):

  ```sql
  WHERE ST_DWithin(
    ST_GeogFromText(z.zipcode_geom),
    ST_GeogPoint(-122.3321, 47.6062),
    10000
  )
  ```

- **Selection of Required Columns:** The query retrieves all the necessary details, including geographic polygons, land and water area, latitude and longitude, state code and name, city, county, and population.

In contrast, **`1result.sql`** applies the filters on the population data **after** the `LEFT JOIN` in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
AND (p.gender IS NULL OR p.gender = '')
AND p.minimum_age IS NULL;
```

This can inadvertently convert the `LEFT JOIN` into an `INNER JOIN`, excluding ZIP code areas that lack population data from the results, which is not desired.

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query as it accurately retrieves all ZIP code areas within the specified distance, along with their respective details and population data where available.
