**Reasoning:**

After carefully comparing the SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct and most accurate script for calculating the number of times each type of overtake has occurred in Formula 1. Here's why:

1. **Logical Implementation:**
   - **`2result.sql`** correctly identifies overtakes by comparing drivers' positions across consecutive laps.
   - It distinguishes between different types of overtakes based on whether another driver ahead pitted or retired.
   - The script systematically excludes pit stop overtakes and overtakes due to retirements from the total overtakes to calculate on-track overtakes.

2. **Accurate Definitions:**
   - **On-Track Overtakes:** Instances where a driver improves position between laps without the influence of pit stops or retirements of other drivers.
   - **Pit Stop Overtakes:** Occur when a driver gains positions because competitors ahead pitted.
   - **Overtakes Due to Retirements:** When a driver gains positions because competitors ahead retired.
   - **Overtakes Due to Penalties:** Not accounted for due to data limitations, set to zero.

3. **Correct Logic for Overtakes Due to Pit Stops and Retirements:**
   - The script checks if any driver ahead in the previous lap pitted or retired in the current lap.
   - This ensures that gains in position are correctly attributed to pit stops or retirements of other drivers.

4. **Avoids Overcounting:**
   - **`2result.sql`** carefully excludes overtakes already counted as pit stop or retirement overtakes when calculating on-track overtakes.
   - This methodology prevents double-counting and provides a more accurate count.

5. **Comparison with Other Scripts:**
   - **`0result.sql`:**
     - The logic for pit stop overtakes is flawed. It counts cases where the driver themselves pitted and gained positions, which is unlikely since pit stops typically result in lost positions.
     - The count for overtakes due to retirements is significantly higher (17,508), suggesting possible overcounting without proper checks to ensure the retired driver was ahead.
   - **`1result.sql`:**
     - The pit stop overtakes count is unrealistically high (37,040), indicating potential overcounting or incorrect logic.
     - The method may include overtakes where any pit stop occurred, not necessarily those affecting the driver's position.

6. **Results Alignment with Expected Behavior:**
   - The counts in **`2result.sql`** are reasonable:
     - **On-Track Overtakes:** 74,719
     - **Pit Stop Overtakes:** 2,194
     - **Overtakes Due to Retirements:** 1,040
   - These figures align with the understanding that on-track overtakes are the most common, while overtakes due to pit stops and retirements are less frequent.

By thoroughly filtering and categorizing overtakes based on the events affecting them, **`2result.sql`** provides an accurate and reliable calculation of each type of overtake in Formula 1 races. Its methodology adheres closely to the definitions and avoids the pitfalls found in the other scripts.
