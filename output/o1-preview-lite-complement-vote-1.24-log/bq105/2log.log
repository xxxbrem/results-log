2025-01-27 04:33:20 - root - INFO - I apologize for the confusion earlier. The error occurs because the `state_name` column does not exist in the `distract_2015` or `distract_2016` tables. Instead, these tables contain a `state_number` column, which is a numeric code representing each state.

To map `state_number` to the actual state names, we can use the `state_fips_code` and `state_name` columns from the `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.us_states_area` table. Here's how we can proceed:

---

**Tables and Columns Relevant to the Task:**

1. **Accident Data:**

   - **`distract_2015` and `distract_2016` tables:**
     - `state_number` (INT64): Numeric code for each state where the accident occurred.
     - `consecutive_number` (INT64): Unique identifier for each accident.
     - `driver_distracted_by_name` (STRING): Description of the driver's distraction status.

2. **State Mapping:**

   - **`us_states_area` table:**
     - `state_fips_code` (STRING): FIPS code for each state (as a string, e.g., '01' for Alabama).
     - `state_name` (STRING): Full name of the state.

3. **Population Data:**

   - **`population_by_zip_2010` table:**
     - `zipcode` (STRING): ZIP code identifier.
     - `population` (INT64): Population count per ZIP code.

   - **`zipcode_area` table:**
     - `zipcode` (STRING): ZIP code identifier.
     - `state_name` (STRING): Name of the state corresponding to the ZIP code.

**Conditions Applied:**

- Exclude accidents where `driver_distracted_by_name` is 'Not Distracted,' 'Unknown if Distracted,' or 'Not Reported.'

---

**Revised SQL Queries:**

1. **List Distinct `state_number` Values in `distract_2015`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT state_number
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.distract_2015`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Map `state_number` to `state_name` Using `us_states_area`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     CAST(state_fips_code AS INT64) AS state_number,
     state_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.us_states_area`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count Accidents Involving Driver Distraction per State in 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     s.state_name,
     COUNT(DISTINCT d.consecutive_number) AS accident_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.distract_2015` AS d
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.us_states_area` AS s
     ON d.state_number = CAST(s.state_fips_code AS INT64)
   WHERE LOWER(d.driver_distracted_by_name) NOT IN ('not distracted', 'unknown if distracted', 'not reported')
   GROUP BY s.state_name
   ORDER BY accident_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count Accidents Involving Driver Distraction per State in 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     s.state_name,
     COUNT(DISTINCT d.consecutive_number) AS accident_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.distract_2016` AS d
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.us_states_area` AS s
     ON d.state_number = CAST(s.state_fips_code AS INT64)
   WHERE LOWER(d.driver_distracted_by_name) NOT IN ('not distracted', 'unknown if distracted', 'not reported')
   GROUP BY s.state_name
   ORDER BY accident_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Aggregate Total Population per State Using `population_by_zip_2010` and `zipcode_area`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     z.state_name,
     SUM(p.population) AS total_population
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_usa.population_by_zip_2010` AS p
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.zipcode_area` AS z
     ON p.zipcode = z.zipcode
   GROUP BY z.state_name
   ORDER BY total_population DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate Accident Rates per 100,000 People for Each State in 2015:**

   ```sql
   WITH accidents AS (
     SELECT
       d.state_number,
       COUNT(DISTINCT d.consecutive_number) AS accident_count
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.distract_2015` AS d
     WHERE LOWER(d.driver_distracted_by_name) NOT IN ('not distracted', 'unknown if distracted', 'not reported')
     GROUP BY d.state_number
   ),
   states AS (
     SELECT
       CAST(state_fips_code AS INT64) AS state_number,
       state_name
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.us_states_area`
   ),
   population AS (
     SELECT
       z.state_name,
       SUM(p.population) AS total_population
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_usa.population_by_zip_2010` AS p
     JOIN `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.zipcode_area` AS z
       ON p.zipcode = z.zipcode
     GROUP BY z.state_name
   )
   SELECT
     s.state_name,
     a.accident_count,
     p.total_population,
     (a.accident_count * 100000.0) / p.total_population AS accidents_per_100000_people
   FROM accidents a
   JOIN states s ON a.state_number = s.state_number
   JOIN population p ON s.state_name = p.state_name
   ORDER BY accidents_per_100000_people DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

7. **Calculate Accident Rates per 100,000 People for Each State in 2016:**

   ```sql
   WITH accidents AS (
     SELECT
       d.state_number,
       COUNT(DISTINCT d.consecutive_number) AS accident_count
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.distract_2016` AS d
     WHERE LOWER(d.driver_distracted_by_name) NOT IN ('not distracted', 'unknown if distracted', 'not reported')
     GROUP BY d.state_number
   ),
   states AS (
     SELECT
       CAST(state_fips_code AS INT64) AS state_number,
       state_name
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.us_states_area`
   ),
   population AS (
     SELECT
       z.state_name,
       SUM(p.population) AS total_population
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_usa.population_by_zip_2010` AS p
     JOIN `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.zipcode_area` AS z
       ON p.zipcode = z.zipcode
     GROUP BY z.state_name
   )
   SELECT
     s.state_name,
     a.accident_count,
     p.total_population,
     (a.accident_count * 100000.0) / p.total_population AS accidents_per_100000_people
   FROM accidents a
   JOIN states s ON a.state_number = s.state_number
   JOIN population p ON s.state_name = p.state_name
   ORDER BY accidents_per_100000_people DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

8. **Identify Top Five States Each Year with Highest Accident Rates:**

   The queries above already limit the results to the top five states (`LIMIT 5`) ordered by `accidents_per_100000_people` in descending order.

---

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **Using `state_number` and `state_fips_code`:** Since `state_name` is not present in the `distract_2015` and `distract_2016` tables, we use `state_number` to represent states. The `state_fips_code` in `us_states_area` corresponds to `state_number` when cast to `INT64`.

- **Casting `state_fips_code` to `INT64`:** The `state_fips_code` is stored as a string (e.g., '01' for Alabama). We cast it to `INT64` to match with `state_number` in the `distract` tables.

- **Joining Tables:** We join the accident data with the `us_states_area` table to get the state names. We also join with the population data to calculate accident rates.

- **Excluding Specified Distraction Statuses:** We use the `LOWER()` function to ensure case-insensitive matching when excluding 'Not Distracted,' 'Unknown if Distracted,' and 'Not Reported.'

- **Calculating Accident Rates:** We compute the number of accidents per 100,000 people by using the formula:

  \[
  \text{Accidents per 100,000 people} = \left( \frac{\text{accident\_count} \times 100,000}{\text{total\_population}} \right)
  \]

---

By executing these queries, you will obtain the number of traffic accidents per 100,000 people due to driver distraction for each state in the years 2015 and 2016. The results will identify the top five states each year with the highest rates.

**Note:** Ensure that you have access to all the mentioned tables and that the necessary permissions are in place to execute these queries on the BigQuery platform.

**Explanation:**

In this corrected query, we've added a `WHERE` clause to ensure that only rows where the `population` column is not `NULL` are included in the aggregation. This addresses the issue of empty or missing values in the `population` column. Here's what each part does:

- **SELECT Clause:**
  - `z.state_name`: Selects the state name from the `zipcode_area` table.
  - `SUM(p.population) AS total_population`: Sums the population for each state.

- **FROM Clause:**
  - Specifies the `population_by_zip_2010` table aliased as `p`.

- **JOIN Clause:**
  - Joins the `zipcode_area` table (`z`) on the `zipcode` field to map ZIP codes to state names.

- **WHERE Clause:**
  - `p.population IS NOT NULL`: Filters out rows where the population is `NULL`.

- **GROUP BY Clause:**
  - Groups the results by `z.state_name` to aggregate population totals per state.

- **ORDER BY Clause:**
  - Orders the results by `total_population` in descending order.

- **LIMIT Clause:**
  - Limits the output to the top 100 states (though there are only 50 states plus territories, so this effectively includes all).

This query will provide the total population per state based on the ZIP code populations from the 2010 census data, excluding any entries where the population data is missing.
