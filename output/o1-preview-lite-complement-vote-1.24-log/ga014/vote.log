Upon comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct query for the following reasons:

1. **Use of COALESCE and LOWER Functions**: `2result.sql` utilizes the `COALESCE` function to handle `NULL` values and defaults for `medium`, `source`, and `campaign_name`. It also applies the `LOWER` function to ensure case-insensitive comparisons, which is essential when matching text values against a list of predefined channel definitions.

2. **Accurate Extraction of `ga_session_id`**: The query extracts `ga_session_id` by performing a `LEFT JOIN` with an `UNNEST` of `event_params` and filters where `ep.key = 'ga_session_id'` and `ep.value.int_value IS NOT NULL`. This method ensures that all session IDs are accurately captured, including those where the `event_params` array might be empty or `ga_session_id` might be missing.

3. **Proper Channel Mapping Logic**: The `CASE` statement in `2result.sql` is well-structured and aligns closely with the provided channel definitions. It systematically categorizes the sessions into the appropriate channels based on `medium`, `source`, and `campaign_name`.

4. **Clean and Readable Structure**: By using Common Table Expressions (CTEs), the query enhances readability and maintainability. The separation of data extraction (`session_data`) and channel mapping allows for easier debugging and future modifications.

5. **Consistent Results**: Both queries yield the same session counts per channel, indicating that `2result.sql` is functionally correct. However, the improvements in data handling and query structure make `2result.sql` the preferable choice.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**
