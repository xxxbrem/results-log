After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **2result.sql** is the correct script.

**Reasoning:**

- **Comprehensive Grouping:** The `2result.sql` script groups initial terms by legislator ID, state, and gender. This ensures that legislators who have served in multiple states are accurately accounted for in each state they served.

- **Accurate Interval Checks:** It systematically checks whether legislators are serving at each interval date by generating checkpoints and verifying service status at those dates. This method ensures that the calculations for retention rates are precise.

- **Aggregation Over States and Genders:** The script aggregates serving status to determine if each state has at least one legislator of each gender serving at all specified intervals. This aligns perfectly with the requirement of having a consistently non-zero retention rate for each gender across every two-year interval during the first 10 years.

- **Consistent Results:** The results from `2result.sql` include states like HI (Hawaii) and WA (Washington), which are correctly identified as meeting the criteria but are missing from the `0result.sql` output. This indicates that `2result.sql` provides a more accurate and comprehensive answer.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:
