After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have chosen **`1result.sql`** as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Clarity and Structure:** The query in `1result.sql` is well-structured and easy to follow. It clearly separates the calculation of rainy days for 2023 and 2022 into subqueries (`rd2023` and `rd2022`), making the logic transparent.
  
- **Accurate Filtering:**
  - It correctly filters stations located in Washington State using `stations.state = 'WA'`.
  - It counts rainy days by checking `prcp > 0` and excludes missing data with `prcp != 99.99`.
  
- **Correct Conditions:**
  - It selects stations with more than 150 rainy days in 2023 using `rd2023.rainy_days_2023 > 150`.
  - It ensures the number of rainy days in 2023 is fewer than in 2022 with `rd2023.rainy_days_2023 < rd2022.rainy_days_2022`.
  
- **Consistent Results:** The output matches the expected results, correctly identifying the stations that meet the criteria.
