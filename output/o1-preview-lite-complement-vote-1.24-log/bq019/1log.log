Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task, we need to identify the most common inpatient diagnosis in the US in 2014, find the three cities with the most cases for that diagnosis, and calculate the citywise average payment in those cities using the `cms_medicare` database.

**Relevant Table:**

- `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `drg_definition`: Used to identify inpatient diagnoses (MS-DRG code and description).
- `total_discharges`: Used to count the number of cases per diagnosis.
- `provider_city`: Used to group data by city.
- `provider_state`: Used to distinguish cities with the same name in different states.
- `average_total_payments`: Used to calculate the average payment to providers.
- `provider_name` and `provider_id`: May help identify specific providers if needed.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct diagnoses (DRG definitions):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT drg_definition
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find total discharges per diagnosis:**

   ```sql
   SELECT drg_definition, SUM(total_discharges) AS total_cases
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   GROUP BY drg_definition
   ORDER BY total_cases DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Identify the most common diagnosis:**

   ```sql
   SELECT drg_definition, SUM(total_discharges) AS total_cases
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   GROUP BY drg_definition
   ORDER BY total_cases DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

4. **List distinct provider cities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT provider_city
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find total discharges per city for all diagnoses:**

   ```sql
   SELECT provider_city, SUM(total_discharges) AS total_cases
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   GROUP BY provider_city
   ORDER BY total_cases DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find total discharges per city for the most common diagnosis:**

   ```sql
   SELECT provider_city, SUM(total_discharges) AS total_cases
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   WHERE drg_definition = 'XXX - DESCRIPTION'
   GROUP BY provider_city
   ORDER BY total_cases DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   *(Replace `'XXX - DESCRIPTION'` with the actual DRG definition from query 3.)*

7. **Identify the top three cities with the most cases of the most common diagnosis:**

   ```sql
   SELECT provider_city, SUM(total_discharges) AS total_cases
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   WHERE drg_definition = 'XXX - DESCRIPTION'
   GROUP BY provider_city
   ORDER BY total_cases DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

8. **Calculate the average payment per city for the most common diagnosis:**

   ```sql
   SELECT provider_city, AVG(average_total_payments) AS average_payment
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   WHERE drg_definition = 'XXX - DESCRIPTION'
   GROUP BY provider_city
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Get average payments for the top three cities with the most cases:**

   ```sql
   SELECT provider_city, AVG(average_total_payments) AS average_payment
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   WHERE drg_definition = 'XXX - DESCRIPTION' AND provider_city IN ('City1', 'City2', 'City3')
   GROUP BY provider_city
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   *(Replace `'City1'`, `'City2'`, `'City3'` with actual city names from query 7.)*

10. **Compare average payments across all cities for the most common diagnosis:**

    ```sql
    SELECT provider_city, AVG(average_total_payments) AS average_payment
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
    WHERE drg_definition = 'XXX - DESCRIPTION'
    GROUP BY provider_city
    ORDER BY average_payment DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries will help us understand the data related to inpatient diagnoses, total discharges, provider cities, and payments, allowing us to extract the required information for the task.Query:

Task: For the most common inpatient diagnosis in the US in 2014, what was the citywise average payment respectively in the three cities that had the most cases from the cms_medicare database?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Below is the citywise average payment for the three cities with the most cases of the most common inpatient diagnosis in the US in 2014 from the `cms_medicare` database.

```csv
city_name,average_payment
city1:str,payment1:float
city2:str,payment2:float
city3:str,payment3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['hcpcs', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd10_procedures_2019', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['home_health_agencies_2013', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'hospital_general_info', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['care_site', 'concept', 'concept_ancestor', 'concept_class', 'concept_relationship', 'condition_era', 'condition_occurrence', 'cost', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'domain', 'dose_era', 'drug_era', 'drug_exposure', 'drug_strength', 'location', 'observation', 'observation_period', 'payer_plan_period', 'person', 'procedure_occurrence', 'provider', 'relationship', 'vocabulary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
