After comparing the SQL queries and their corresponding outputs, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer for the following reasons:

1. **Accurate Ingredient Lists**: The output from `0result.sql` correctly lists the ingredients for each pizza order in alphabetical order. It properly accounts for exclusions and extras, ensuring that the final ingredient list reflects any modifications made by the customer.

2. **Correct Handling of Duplicate Ingredients**: The SQL correctly identifies when an ingredient appears more than once (due to extras) and prefixes it with '2x' as required. For example, in order 5, the ingredient list includes '2xBacon' to indicate that bacon was added as an extra to the default bacon topping.

3. **Appropriate Association of Pizzas and Toppings**: The results ensure that meat toppings are not incorrectly included in vegetarian pizzas unless explicitly added as extras. In `0result.sql`, the vegetarian pizzas do not list meat toppings unless the customer requested them.

4. **Consistent with the Task Requirements**: The output from `0result.sql` aligns with the task's instructions by providing the pizza name followed by the correctly formatted ingredient list for each order.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** best meets the requirements and produces the correct report.
