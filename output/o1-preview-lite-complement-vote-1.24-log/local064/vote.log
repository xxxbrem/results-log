After carefully comparing both SQL queries and their results, we conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for the following reasons:

### 1. Accurate Calculation of Month-End Balances

- **`2result.sql`** calculates the cumulative balance for each customer up to each transaction date within 2020. It does this using a window function that orders transactions by date per customer:

  ```sql
  SUM("txn_amount") OVER (
      PARTITION BY "customer_id"
      ORDER BY "txn_date"
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS "cumulative_balance"
  ```

- It then determines the **month-end balance** for each customer by selecting the **maximum cumulative balance** within each month:

  ```sql
  SELECT
      "customer_id",
      "year_month",
      MAX("cumulative_balance") AS "month_end_balance"
  FROM customer_txns_ordered
  GROUP BY "customer_id", "year_month"
  ```

- This approach accurately captures the balance at the end of each month for every customer by considering all transactions up to that point in time.

### 2. Correct Identification of Positive Balance Customers

- The query then filters customers who have a positive month-end balance:

  ```sql
  WHERE "month_end_balance" > 0
  ```

- It counts the number of customers with positive balances for each month and calculates the average month-end balance among these customers.

### 3. Proper Selection of Months for Comparison

- **`2result.sql`** identifies the months with the **most** and **fewest** customers having a positive balance by ordering the counts:

  ```sql
  ORDER BY "positive_balance_customers" DESC -- For the month with the most customers
  ORDER BY "positive_balance_customers" ASC  -- For the month with the fewest customers
  ```

- It then computes the difference in average month-end balances between these two months.

### 4. Handling of Transaction Dates and Balances Over Time

- By calculating cumulative balances per transaction date, **`2result.sql`** ensures that the timing and sequence of transactions are accurately accounted for in the balance calculations.

In contrast, **`0result.sql`** aggregates transactions at a monthly level and calculates cumulative balances over months, which might lead to less precise month-end balances due to not considering the order of transactions within each month.

### Conclusion

Given the reasons above, **`2result.sql`** provides a more precise and accurate calculation aligned with the requirements of determining the difference in average month-end balance between the specified months in 2020.
