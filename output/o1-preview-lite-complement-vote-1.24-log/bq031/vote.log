After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Data Selection:** The query in `2result.sql` specifically selects data from the station with `stn = '725290'` and `wban = '14768'`, which corresponds to the **Greater Rochester International Airport** in Rochester, NY. This ensures that the data is solely from Rochester and not mixed with other locations.

- **Correct Date Range:** It filters the data for dates starting from `'2019-01-09'` to `'2019-03-31'`, covering the first season of 2019 as required.

- **Proper Unit Conversions:** The query correctly converts:
  - Temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
  - Precipitation from inches to centimeters.
  - Wind speed from knots to meters per second.
  
- **Calculation of Moving Averages and Differences:**
  - It computes the 8-day moving averages for temperature, precipitation, and wind speed.
  - It calculates the differences between the current moving averages and those from 8 days prior.
  
- **Rounding and Sorting:**
  - All values are rounded to one decimal place as specified.
  - The results are sorted by date in ascending order.
  
- **Meets All Requirements:** The query fulfills all the specified criteria, including data selection, date range, unit conversions, calculations, rounding, and sorting.

**Therefore,**
