### Relevant Tables and Columns

- **Table**: `collisions`
    - **collision_date**: Potential usage - to filter collisions that occurred in specific years (e.g., 2011 and 2021).
    - **primary_collision_factor**: Potential usage - identifies the primary cause of each collision.
    - **pcf_violation_category**: Potential usage - categorizes the violation associated with the collision, useful for grouping causes.
    - **pcf_violation_code**: Potential usage - specific code of the violation, may help identify the most common specific violation.

### Conditions that may be used

- **Year Filtering**: Extract the year from `collision_date` to filter data for 2011 and 2021.
- **Grouping and Counting**: Group by `primary_collision_factor` or `pcf_violation_category` to count occurrences and identify the most common causes.
- **Calculating Percentages**: Calculate the share of a particular cause relative to the total number of collisions in that year.

### SQL Queries

1. **Display sample collision dates to understand the date format**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "collision_date" FROM "collisions" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct years present in the data**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT substr("collision_date", -4) AS "Year" FROM "collisions" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List distinct primary collision factors**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "primary_collision_factor" FROM "collisions" LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List distinct pcf_violation_categories**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "pcf_violation_category" FROM "collisions" LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count total collisions in 2011**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total_Collisions_2011"
   FROM "collisions"
   WHERE substr("collision_date", -4) = '2011'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count total collisions in 2021**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total_Collisions_2021"
   FROM "collisions"
   WHERE substr("collision_date", -4) = '2021'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count collisions by primary collision factor in 2011**

   ```sql
   SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
   FROM "collisions"
   WHERE substr("collision_date", -4) = '2011'
   GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "Count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count collisions by primary collision factor in 2021**

   ```sql
   SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
   FROM "collisions"
   WHERE substr("collision_date", -4) = '2021'
   GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "Count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find the most common pcf_violation_category in 2011**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pcf_violation_category", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
   FROM "collisions"
   WHERE substr("collision_date", -4) = '2011'
   GROUP BY "pcf_violation_category"
   ORDER BY "Count" DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

10. **Find the most common pcf_violation_category in 2021**

    ```sql
    SELECT "pcf_violation_category", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
    FROM "collisions"
    WHERE substr("collision_date", -4) = '2021'
    GROUP BY "pcf_violation_category"
    ORDER BY "Count" DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

11. **Calculate the percentage share of the most common cause in 2011**

    *(Assuming the most common `pcf_violation_category` from query 9 is known, replace 'Most_Common_Cause' with the actual category)*

    ```sql
    SELECT
        ("Cause_Count" * 100.0) / "Total_Collisions" AS "Percentage_Share"
    FROM (
        SELECT
            (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "collisions" WHERE substr("collision_date", -4) = '2011' AND "pcf_violation_category" = 'Most_Common_Cause') AS "Cause_Count",
            (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "collisions" WHERE substr("collision_date", -4) = '2011') AS "Total_Collisions"
    ) LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Calculate the percentage share of the most common cause in 2021**

    *(Assuming the most common `pcf_violation_category` from query 10 is known, replace 'Most_Common_Cause' with the actual category)*

    ```sql
    SELECT
        ("Cause_Count" * 100.0) / "Total_Collisions" AS "Percentage_Share"
    FROM (
        SELECT

            (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "collisions" WHERE substr("collision_date", -4) = '2021') AS "Total_Collisions"
    ) LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List distinct pcf_violation_codes**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "pcf_violation_code" FROM "collisions" LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Count collisions per pcf_violation_code in 2021**

    ```sql
    SELECT "pcf_violation_code", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
    FROM "collisions"
    WHERE substr("collision_date", -4) = '2021'
    GROUP BY "pcf_violation_code"
    ORDER BY "Count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find the most common pcf_violation_code in 2011**

    ```sql
    SELECT "pcf_violation_code", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
    FROM "collisions"
    WHERE substr("collision_date", -4) = '2011'
    GROUP BY "pcf_violation_code"
    ORDER BY "Count" DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

These queries will help in understanding the data related to collision causes, frequencies, and how they have changed between 2011 and 2021. By analyzing the outputs, you can determine the most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021, calculate its share of total incidents for both years, and then compute the percentage decrease over the 10-year period.Query:

Task: For the most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021, how much did its share (percentage in the annual roal incidents) decrease compared to 10 years earlier?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine how much the share of the most common cause of traffic accidents decreased from 2011 to 2021, we calculate the percentage difference in its occurrence relative to the total annual incidents for both years.

```csv
Percentage_decrease
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
