**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Tables:**

   - `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2011` to `inpatient_charges_2015`: Contains inpatient charges data from 2011 to 2015.
   - `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2011` to `outpatient_charges_2015`: Contains outpatient charges data from 2011 to 2015.

2. **Columns:**

   - `provider_id`: Unique identifier for providers. Used to identify and aggregate data per provider.
   - `provider_name`: Name of the provider. Useful for displaying and verifying provider information.
   - `total_discharges` (in inpatient tables): The number of inpatient cases. Used to compute total inpatient volume.
   - `average_total_payments` (in inpatient and outpatient tables): Average total payments per discharge (inpatient) or service (outpatient). Used to calculate total revenue.
   - `outpatient_services` (in outpatient tables): The number of outpatient services provided. Used to compute total outpatient volume.
   - `_TABLE_SUFFIX`: Suffix indicating the year of the data when querying across multiple tables using wildcards.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filtering data between years 2011 and 2015 using `_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2011' AND '2015'`.
- Grouping by `provider_id` and `provider_name` to aggregate revenues per provider.
- Ordering results to find the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost.
- Filtering by a specific `provider_id` to calculate annual revenues for that provider.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct providers in inpatient data for 2011:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `provider_id`, `provider_name`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2011`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct providers in outpatient data for 2011:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `provider_id`, `provider_name`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2011`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Calculate total inpatient payments per provider for 2011:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `provider_id`, `provider_name`,
          SUM(`total_discharges` * `average_total_payments`) AS `total_inpatient_payments_2011`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2011`
   GROUP BY `provider_id`, `provider_name`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Calculate total inpatient payments per provider for 2012:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `provider_id`, `provider_name`,
          SUM(`total_discharges` * `average_total_payments`) AS `total_inpatient_payments_2012`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2012`
   GROUP BY `provider_id`, `provider_name`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate total inpatient payments per provider from 2011 to 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `provider_id`, `provider_name`,
          SUM(`total_discharges` * `average_total_payments`) AS `total_inpatient_payments`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_*`
   WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2011' AND '2015'
   GROUP BY `provider_id`, `provider_name`
   ORDER BY `total_inpatient_payments` DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Identify the provider with the highest total inpatient payments from 2011 to 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `provider_id`, `provider_name`,
          SUM(`total_discharges` * `average_total_payments`) AS `total_inpatient_payments`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_*`
   WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2011' AND '2015'
   GROUP BY `provider_id`, `provider_name`
   ORDER BY `total_inpatient_payments` DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```
   *(Attention: answer in one row)*

7. **Compute annual average inpatient revenue per case for the identified provider:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `_TABLE_SUFFIX` AS `year`, `provider_id`, `provider_name`,
          SUM(`total_discharges` * `average_total_payments`) / SUM(`total_discharges`) AS `avg_inpatient_revenue_per_case`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_*`
   WHERE `provider_id` = 'PROVIDER_ID'
     AND _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2011' AND '2015'
   GROUP BY `year`, `provider_id`, `provider_name`
   ORDER BY `year`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *(Replace 'PROVIDER_ID' with the actual `provider_id` from query 6.)*

8. **Compute annual average outpatient revenue per case for the identified provider:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `_TABLE_SUFFIX` AS `year`, `provider_id`, `provider_name`,

**Note:** In queries where `'PROVIDER_ID'` is mentioned, replace it with the actual `provider_id` obtained from query 6, which identifies the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011 to 2015.

These queries will help you identify the provider in question and compute its annual inpatient and outpatient revenues averaged by case for each year during the period from 2011 to 2015.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT `provider_id`, `provider_name`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2011`

Task: For the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015, tell me its annual inpatient and outpatient revenues averaged by case for each year during that period.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: I apologize, but I don't have access to the specific data in the `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare` database to provide the exact revenues for the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015. However, I can provide you with a format and guide on how you can retrieve and calculate this information.

**Format:**

```csv
Year,Average_Inpatient_Revenue_per_Case,Average_Outpatient_Revenue_per_Case
2011,inpatient_avg_revenue_2011:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2011:float
2012,inpatient_avg_revenue_2012:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2012:float
2013,inpatient_avg_revenue_2013:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2013:float
2014,inpatient_avg_revenue_2014:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2014:float
2015,inpatient_avg_revenue_2015:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2015:float
```

*(Attention: answer in five rows)*

**Explanation:**

- **Year:** Each year from 2011 to 2015.
- **Average_Inpatient_Revenue_per_Case:** The provider's annual total inpatient revenue divided by the number of inpatient cases (discharges) for that year.
- **Average_Outpatient_Revenue_per_Case:** The provider's annual total outpatient revenue divided by the number of outpatient cases (services) for that year.

**How to Calculate:**

1. **Identify the Provider:**
   - Use the `inpatient_charges_*` tables from 2011 to 2015 to calculate the total inpatient service cost for each provider.
   - Sum the product of `average_total_payments` and `total_discharges` for each provider across all years.
   - Identify the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost over the five years.

2. **Calculate Annual Revenues:**
   - **Inpatient Revenue per Case:**
     - For each year, multiply `average_total_payments` by `total_discharges` to get the total inpatient revenue.
     - Divide the total inpatient revenue by `total_discharges` to get the average revenue per case.
   - **Outpatient Revenue per Case:**
     - Use the `outpatient_charges_*` tables for each year.
     - Multiply `average_total_payments` by `outpatient_services` to get the total outpatient revenue.
     - Divide the total outpatient revenue by `outpatient_services` to get the average revenue per case.

3. **Populate the CSV:**
   - Fill in the calculated average revenues for each year in the CSV format provided above.

**Note:** Replace `inpatient_avg_revenue_YYYY` and `outpatient_avg_revenue_YYYY` with the actual calculated float values for each year from 2011 to 2015.

**Example Entry:**

```csv
Year,Average_Inpatient_Revenue_per_Case,Average_Outpatient_Revenue_per_Case
2011,15000.50,1200.75
...
```

*(This is just an illustrative example with placeholder values)*

**Summary:**

By calculating the average inpatient and outpatient revenues per case for the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015, you can analyze the provider's revenue trends over those years. This requires aggregating data from the relevant inpatient and outpatient charge datasets and performing calculations as outlined above..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['hcpcs', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd10_procedures_2019', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['home_health_agencies_2013', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'hospital_general_info', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['care_site', 'concept', 'concept_ancestor', 'concept_class', 'concept_relationship', 'condition_era', 'condition_occurrence', 'cost', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'domain', 'dose_era', 'drug_era', 'drug_exposure', 'drug_strength', 'location', 'observation', 'observation_period', 'payer_plan_period', 'person', 'procedure_occurrence', 'provider', 'relationship', 'vocabulary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 05:48:24 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015, tell me its annual inpatient and outpatient revenues averaged by case for each year during that period., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: I apologize, but I don't have access to the specific data in the `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare` database to provide the exact revenues for the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015. However, I can provide you with a format and guide on how you can retrieve and calculate this information.

**Format:**

```csv
Year,Average_Inpatient_Revenue_per_Case,Average_Outpatient_Revenue_per_Case
2011,inpatient_avg_revenue_2011:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2011:float
2012,inpatient_avg_revenue_2012:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2012:float
2013,inpatient_avg_revenue_2013:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2013:float
2014,inpatient_avg_revenue_2014:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2014:float
2015,inpatient_avg_revenue_2015:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2015:float
```

*(Attention: answer in five rows)*

**Explanation:**

- **Year:** Each year from 2011 to 2015.
- **Average_Inpatient_Revenue_per_Case:** The provider's annual total inpatient revenue divided by the number of inpatient cases (discharges) for that year.
- **Average_Outpatient_Revenue_per_Case:** The provider's annual total outpatient revenue divided by the number of outpatient cases (services) for that year.

**How to Calculate:**

1. **Identify the Provider:**
   - Use the `inpatient_charges_*` tables from 2011 to 2015 to calculate the total inpatient service cost for each provider.
   - Sum the product of `average_total_payments` and `total_discharges` for each provider across all years.
   - Identify the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost over the five years.

2. **Calculate Annual Revenues:**
   - **Inpatient Revenue per Case:**
     - For each year, multiply `average_total_payments` by `total_discharges` to get the total inpatient revenue.
     - Divide the total inpatient revenue by `total_discharges` to get the average revenue per case.
   - **Outpatient Revenue per Case:**
     - Use the `outpatient_charges_*` tables for each year.
     - Multiply `average_total_payments` by `outpatient_services` to get the total outpatient revenue.
     - Divide the total outpatient revenue by `outpatient_services` to get the average revenue per case.

3. **Populate the CSV:**
   - Fill in the calculated average revenues for each year in the CSV format provided above.

**Note:** Replace `inpatient_avg_revenue_YYYY` and `outpatient_avg_revenue_YYYY` with the actual calculated float values for each year from 2011 to 2015.

**Example Entry:**

```csv
Year,Average_Inpatient_Revenue_per_Case,Average_Outpatient_Revenue_per_Case
2011,15000.50,1200.75
...
```

*(This is just an illustrative example with placeholder values)*

**Summary:**

By calculating the average inpatient and outpatient revenues per case for the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015, you can analyze the provider's revenue trends over those years. This requires aggregating data from the relevant inpatient and outpatient charge datasets and performing calculations as outlined above. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
