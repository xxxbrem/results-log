This query calculates the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations by considering the quantities of all items contained within each combination up to two levels deep. It does so by:

- Identifying final packaging combinations (those not contained in any other packaging).
- Joining the packaging relations to account for nested items.
- Calculating the total quantity for each final packaging by summing the quantities of items at both levels.
- Computing the average of these total quantities.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **`packaging`**
  - `id`: Identifier for each packaging item; used to identify packages.
  - `name`: Name of the packaging item; useful for understanding the packaging combinations.

- **`packaging_relations`**
  - `packaging_id`: The packaging that contains other packages or items; used to establish the hierarchy of packaging.
  - `contains_id`: The packaging or item that is contained within another packaging; helps in traversing nested contents.
  - `qty`: Quantity of the `contains_id` within the `packaging_id`; essential for calculating total quantities.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Identifying final packaging combinations: `packaging.id` not present in `packaging_relations.contains_id`.
- Calculating total quantities, including nested quantities (though limited without recursive queries).
- Avoiding the use of CTEs and focusing on immediate relationships due to the constraints.

**SQLite Queries:**

1. **List all packaging items:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "packaging" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all packaging relations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "packaging_relations" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find all final packaging combinations (packaging not contained within any other packaging):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p.id, p.name
   FROM "packaging" p
   WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT pr.contains_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find all packaging items that are contained within other packagings (sub-packaging items):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p.id, p.name
   FROM "packaging" p
   WHERE p.id IN (SELECT pr.contains_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **View the relationships between packaging items and their contents:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pr.packaging_id, p1.name AS packaging_name, pr.contains_id, p2.name AS contains_name, pr.qty
   FROM "packaging_relations" pr
   JOIN "packaging" p1 ON pr.packaging_id = p1.id
   JOIN "packaging" p2 ON pr.contains_id = p2.id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find the immediate contents of each final packaging combination:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pr.packaging_id, p1.name AS packaging_name, pr.contains_id, p2.name AS contains_name, pr.qty
   FROM "packaging_relations" pr
   JOIN "packaging" p1 ON pr.packaging_id = p1.id
   JOIN "packaging" p2 ON pr.contains_id = p2.id
   WHERE pr.packaging_id IN (
       SELECT p.id FROM "packaging" p
       WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT pr.contains_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count the number of final packaging combinations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) AS total_final_packagings
   FROM "packaging" p
   WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT pr.contains_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr);
   ```

8. **List packaging items that do not contain any other items (leaf packaging items):**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.id, p.name
   FROM "packaging" p
   WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT pr.packaging_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Compute the total immediate quantity of items in each final packaging combination:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pr.packaging_id, p1.name AS packaging_name, SUM(pr.qty) AS total_qty
   FROM "packaging_relations" pr
   JOIN "packaging" p1 ON pr.packaging_id = p1.id
   WHERE pr.packaging_id IN (
       SELECT p.id FROM "packaging" p
       WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT pr.contains_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
   )
   GROUP BY pr.packaging_id, p1.name
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate the average total immediate quantity across all final packaging combinations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(total_qty) AS average_total_quantity
    FROM (
        SELECT pr.packaging_id, SUM(pr.qty) AS total_qty
        FROM "packaging_relations" pr
        WHERE pr.packaging_id IN (
            SELECT p.id FROM "packaging" p
            WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT pr.contains_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
        )
        GROUP BY pr.packaging_id
    ) sub;
    ```

    *Note: This query calculates the average of the total immediate quantities in final packaging combinations. It does not account for nested quantities beyond one level due to the limitation of not using recursive queries.*

11. **Identify packaging items with multiple containing relationships (items contained in multiple packagings):**

    ```sql
    SELECT pr.contains_id, p.name AS contains_name, COUNT(*) AS count_of_packagings
    FROM "packaging_relations" pr
    JOIN "packaging" p ON pr.contains_id = p.id
    GROUP BY pr.contains_id, p.name
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Find packaging items that both contain others and are contained within others (intermediate packaging items):**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT p.id, p.name
    FROM "packaging" p
    WHERE p.id IN (SELECT pr.packaging_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
      AND p.id IN (SELECT pr.contains_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List the quantities of items for all packagings that are directly contained within a specific final packaging (e.g., packaging_id = 1):**

    ```sql
    SELECT pr.contains_id, p.name AS contains_name, pr.qty
    FROM "packaging_relations" pr
    JOIN "packaging" p ON pr.contains_id = p.id
    WHERE pr.packaging_id = 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Determine the total quantities for packagings up to two levels deep (immediate contents and their contents):**

    ```sql
    SELECT
        pr1.packaging_id AS final_packaging_id,
        p1.name AS final_packaging_name,
        SUM(pr2.qty * pr1.qty) AS total_nested_qty
    FROM "packaging_relations" pr1
    JOIN "packaging_relations" pr2 ON pr1.contains_id = pr2.packaging_id
    JOIN "packaging" p1 ON pr1.packaging_id = p1.id
    WHERE pr1.packaging_id IN (
        SELECT p.id FROM "packaging" p
        WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT pr.contains_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
    )
    GROUP BY pr1.packaging_id, p1.name
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    *Note: This query attempts to calculate nested quantities up to two levels deep by multiplying the quantities at each level.*

15. **Find packaging items that are not contained within any packaging and do not contain any items (standalone items):**

    ```sql
    SELECT p.id, p.name
    FROM "packaging" p
    WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT pr.packaging_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
      AND p.id NOT IN (SELECT pr.contains_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

*Due to the constraints of not using CTEs or recursive queries, calculating the total quantities including all nested items beyond two levels is challenging. The above queries focus on immediate relationships and attempt to explore the data within the given limitations.*

Task: What is the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering all items contained within each combination?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering all items contained within each combination, we need to calculate the total quantity of items in each final packaging (including all nested items) and then compute the average of these totals.

```csv
average_total_quantity
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
