2025-01-27 06:55:56 - root - INFO - Apologies for the error in the previous query. The issue arises because the table `mbb_historical_tournament_games` does not contain a column named `game_id`. Therefore, joining on `game_id` results in an error.

**Explanation:**

- **Error Details:**
  - The table `mbb_historical_tournament_games` lacks the column `game_id`.
  - The error message indicates that `game_id` is not found in table `g` at line 4.

**Solution:**

To obtain the top scoring players in championship games since 2015, we'll adjust the query to join the tables based on matching dates and team identifiers instead of `game_id`.

**Revised Approach:**

1. **Identify Championship Games Since 2015:**

   From previous data, the championship games (round = 2) since 2015 are:

   - **2017-04-03**: North Carolina vs Gonzaga
   - **2016-04-04**: Villanova vs North Carolina
   - **2015-04-06**: Duke vs Wisconsin

2. **Extract Player Data for These Games:**

   We'll select player records from `mbb_players_games_sr` for these dates and teams.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  p.`full_name`,
  p.`team_market`,
  p.`points`,
  DATE(p.`gametime`) AS `game_date`
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_players_games_sr` AS p
WHERE
  DATE(p.`gametime`) IN ('2017-04-03', '2016-04-04', '2015-04-06')
  AND p.`team_market` IN ('North Carolina', 'Gonzaga', 'Villanova', 'Duke', 'Wisconsin')
  AND p.`points` IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
  p.`points` DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **DATE(p.`gametime`) IN ('...')**:
  - Filters games played on the championship dates.
- **p.`team_market` IN ('...')**:
  - Ensures we consider only the teams that played in those championship games.
- **AND p.`points` IS NOT NULL**:
  - Excludes records where the player's points are not available.
- **ORDER BY p.`points` DESC**:
  - Orders the results to show players with the highest points first.

**Results Format:**

```csv
full_name,team_market,points,game_date
Player Name 1:str,Team Name 1:str,Points 1:int,Date 1:date
Player Name 2:str,Team Name 2:str,Points 2:int,Date 2:date
...
```

**Note:**

- Since there are only a few championship games since 2015, the number of records will be limited.
- This approach avoids the issue of missing `game_id` and correctly retrieves the desired player statistics.

---

**Additional Information:**

- **Why Can't We Join on `game_id`?**
  - The table `mbb_historical_tournament_games` does not contain a `game_id` column, so any attempt to use `g.game_id` will result in an error.
  - Alternative join methods require common columns, such as `team_id` and `scheduled_date`.

- **Alternative Join Using Team IDs and Dates:**

  If we had matching `team_id` and exact `scheduled_date` or `gametime`, we could attempt a more precise join. However, due to potential discrepancies in data (e.g., time zones, data granularity), filtering using dates and team names is a practical solution.

---

By adjusting the query as shown, you should be able to retrieve the top scoring players in championship games since 2015 without encountering the error.

    GROUP BY `team_market`
    ORDER BY `total_three_pointers` DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Explanation:**

These queries explore the data across various tables to identify the relevant records for each category:

- **Largest Venues:** Queries 1, 5, 6, and 7 focus on venue capacities to identify and analyze the largest venues.
  
- **Biggest Championship Margins Since 2015:** Query 2 specifically targets championship games since 2015 to find the biggest margins.
  
- **Highest Scoring Games Since 2010:** Queries 3 and 8 extract games with the highest combined scores since 2010.
  
- **Most Three-Pointers in a Matchup:** Queries 4 and 10 look at games with the highest collective three-pointers made or attempted.
  
- Additional queries (9, 11-15) provide further insights into the data, such as high-scoring players, teams with most wins, and venue details, which contribute to understanding the context and verifying the key metrics.

Each query is different, uses relevant columns, and includes conditions to filter the data appropriately. The use of `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` helps in refining the results to meet the requirements of the task.

**Notes:**

- All queries are constructed using only the specified tables and columns.
- The queries avoid complex constructs like CTEs as per instructions.
- Date formats and conditions are carefully applied to match the data types.
- Column and table names are enclosed in backticks as required.
- These queries can be run in BigQuery to extract data for analysis and to eventually build the final table with the top five records in each category.Query:

Task: Please provide the top five records since 2010 for NCAA basketball in four categories: largest venues (Date N/A), biggest championship margins since 2015, highest scoring games, and most three-pointers in a matchup ("Team A vs Team B"). Organize the results into a table with columns for Category, Date, Matchup or Venue, and Key Metric.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To provide the top five records since 2010 for NCAA basketball in the four specified categories, the results are organized into a table with columns for **Category**, **Date**, **Matchup or Venue**, and **Key Metric**.

```csv

**(Attention: answer in five rows per category)**

**Explanation:**

- **Largest Venues**: Lists the top five venues with the largest capacities (Date N/A as it's not applicable).
  - *Key Metric*: Venue capacity in integer values.

- **Biggest Championship Margins**: Shows the top five championship games since 2015 with the largest margins of victory.
  - *Date*: The date when the championship game was played.
  - *Matchup*: The teams that played in the championship game.
  - *Key Metric*: Margin of victory (must be a positive integer).

- **Highest Scoring Games**: Includes the top five games since 2010 with the highest combined total points scored by both teams.
  - *Date*: The date when the game was played.
  - *Matchup*: The teams involved in the game.
  - *Key Metric*: Total points scored in the game.

- **Most Three-Pointers in a Matchup**: Lists the top five games since 2010 where the highest number of three-pointers were made collectively by both teams.
  - *Date*: The date when the game was played.
  - *Matchup*: The teams involved in the game.
  - *Key Metric*: Total number of three-pointers made (must be a non-negative integer).

*Note: The actual data values are placeholders indicating the expected data types and constraints.*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
