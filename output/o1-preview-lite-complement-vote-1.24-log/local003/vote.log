After examining the three provided SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **the second SQL query (`1result.sql`)** best addresses the task of calculating the average sales per order for each customer within distinct RFM segments, considering only 'delivered' orders. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Comprehensive RFM Segmentation**:
   - The query utilizes the `NTILE(5)` function to assign scores for Recency (`R_score`), Frequency (`F_score`), and Monetary (`M_score`) based on quintiles. This method ensures a balanced segmentation by dividing the customers into equal-sized groups for each metric.
   - By combining these scores into an `RFM_Segment`, it creates distinct segments that reflect variations in customer behavior across all three dimensions.

2. **Accurate Calculation of Average Sales per Order**:
   - The query calculates the average sales per order (`avg_sales_per_order`) for each customer by dividing the total monetary value (`monetary`) by the frequency (`frequency`).
   - By grouping the data by `RFM_Segment` and calculating the average of `avg_sales_per_order` within each segment, it provides insights into the differences in average sales across the segments.

3. **Alignment with the Task Requirements**:
   - The query focuses exclusively on 'delivered' orders, as specified in the task.
   - It effectively ranks customers into segments based on their RFM scores and analyzes the differences in average sales per order across these segments.
   - The results offer a clear comparison of average sales per order among different RFM segments, which aids in understanding customer value and behavior.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**
