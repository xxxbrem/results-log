After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, **query `2result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here's why:

1. **Calculates Toy Sales Counts, Not Sales Amounts**: The task specifically asks for the predicted number of toy sales (i.e., the quantity of toys sold), not the total sales amount in currency. Query `2result.sql` correctly counts the number of toys sold per day using `COUNT(*) AS y`. In contrast, `0result.sql` calculates the total sales amount (`SUM(oi."price") AS yi`), which does not align with the task requirement.

2. **Accurate Linear Regression Implementation**: Query `2result.sql` performs linear regression on the daily sales counts (`y`) against the number of days since the starting date (`x`). This approach models the trend in toy sales over time accurately. It computes the regression coefficients (`slope` and `intercept`) using standard formulas.

3. **Precise Moving Average Calculation**: The query calculates the 5-day symmetric moving average using the predicted sales values, which may include fractional parts due to the regression prediction. This provides a more precise average compared to rounding values to integers prematurely. Query `1result.sql` results in an integer total moving average (28.0), suggesting possible rounding and less precision.

4. **Plausible Total Moving Average**: The total moving average obtained from `2result.sql` is approximately **35.31**. Given the historical daily sales data and the upward trend often observed in sales towards the end of the year (approaching December), this value is more plausible. It suggests an average of about 8.8 predicted toy sales per day over the four days, which is consistent with the dataset provided.

5. **Consistency with Historical Data**: By using counts and accurate statistical methods, `2result.sql` ensures that the predictions and subsequent moving averages are consistent with historical sales patterns, leading to a reliable total moving average for the specified dates.

**Conclusion**: Query `2result.sql` correctly addresses the task by predicting the number of toys sold, using an appropriate regression model, and calculating the moving averages accurately. Therefore, it provides the correct SQL implementation to calculate the total of the 5-day symmetric moving averages for December 5 to 8, 2018.
