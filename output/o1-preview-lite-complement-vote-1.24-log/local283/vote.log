After comparing both SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for the task.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Filtering of Matches with Valid Scores:**
   - In `1result.sql`, there is a crucial condition in both SELECT statements within the `team_points` CTE:
     ```sql
     WHERE
         M.home_team_goal IS NOT NULL AND M.away_team_goal IS NOT NULL
     ```
     This ensures that only matches where both teams have valid goal scores are considered. It filters out any matches that may not have been played yet or have missing data, leading to accurate calculations of points.

   - In contrast, `2result.sql` lacks this filtering condition. Without excluding matches with `NULL` values in the goal columns, the calculations may include incomplete or invalid matches, potentially resulting in incorrect total points.

2. **Accuracy of Points Calculation:**
   - By including only matches with valid goal data, `1result.sql` accurately calculates the points earned by each team. This accuracy is critical when determining the champion teams for each season based on total points.

   - The presence of incomplete matches in `2result.sql` might lead to discrepancies in the total points, as matches without results could affect the sum of points.

3. **Consistency with Data Analysis Requirements:**
   - The initial analysis highlighted the importance of excluding matches where goals are `NULL`:
     > **Conditions:**
     > - Exclude matches where goals are `NULL` to ensure only completed matches are considered.

   - `1result.sql` adheres to this condition, aligning with the data analysis requirements and ensuring the results are based on complete and reliable data.

**Conclusion:**

For these reasons, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query as it provides an accurate calculation of total points by considering only completed matches with valid scores.
