After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I recommend using **`0result.sql`** as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Comprehensive Coverage:** The `0result.sql` query aggregates data from both Google's workforce representation and BLS reports for the specified technology sectors in 2021. It includes both industries: `'Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals'` and `'Computer systems design and related services'`, as per the task requirement.

- **Weighted Averages in BLS Data:** This query calculates weighted averages for racial and gender percentages in the BLS data based on the total employment numbers. This approach provides a more accurate comparison by accounting for the size of each industry's workforce.

- **Alignment with Task Objectives:** The query effectively consolidates the racial and gender distribution data across the various data sources, focusing on the overall workforce for the year 2021, as specified in the task.

- **Handling of Missing Data:** While the output shows missing values for the BLS data, this indicates that the BLS data for the specified industries may have incomplete information. However, the SQL structure is correctly set up to handle and display the available data.
