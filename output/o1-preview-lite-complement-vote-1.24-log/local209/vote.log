After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, here's the analysis:

### **0result.sql**

```sql
SELECT
  "store_id",
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN "order_status" = 'FINISHED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*), 4) AS "ratio_completed_orders"
FROM "orders"
GROUP BY "store_id"
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

- **Approach:**
  - Calculates the completion ratio for **all stores**.
  - Uses `GROUP BY "store_id"` to group all stores.
  - Orders the results by total orders descending.
  - Limits the output to the top store with `LIMIT 1`.
- **Result:**
  - Returns the `store_id` and `ratio_completed_orders` for the store with the highest number of orders.

### **1result.sql**

```sql
SELECT
  "store_id",
  ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN "order_status" = 'FINISHED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*),
    4
  ) AS ratio_completed_orders
FROM "orders"
WHERE "store_id" = (
  SELECT "store_id"
  FROM "orders"
  GROUP BY "store_id"
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
  LIMIT 1
)
GROUP BY "store_id";
```

- **Approach:**
  - **First**, identifies the `store_id` with the highest number of orders using a subquery.
    - The subquery:
      ```sql
      SELECT "store_id"
      FROM "orders"
      GROUP BY "store_id"
      ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
      LIMIT 1
      ```
  - **Then**, calculates the completion ratio **only for that store**.
  - Uses `WHERE "store_id" = (subquery)` to filter orders for the top store.
  - Groups by `store_id` (though only one store is involved).
- **Result:**
  - Returns the `store_id` and `ratio_completed_orders` specifically for the store with the highest number of orders.

### **2result.sql**

```sql
SELECT "store_id",
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN "order_status" = 'FINISHED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*), 4) AS "ratio_completed_orders"
FROM "orders"
WHERE "store_id" = (
    SELECT "store_id"
    FROM "orders"
    GROUP BY "store_id"
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
GROUP BY "store_id";
```

- **Approach:**
  - This query is functionally **identical to 1result.sql** but with slight formatting differences.
  - It also first identifies the top `store_id` and then calculates the ratio for it.
- **Result:**
  - Returns the same as `1result.sql`.

### **Comparison and Recommendation**

- **Performance:**
  - **1result.sql** and **2result.sql** are more efficient than **0result.sql** because they filter the data **before** calculating the ratio, limiting the computation to only the top store.
  - **0result.sql** computes the ratio for **all stores**, then selects the top one, which is less efficient.
- **Clarity and Readability:**
  - **1result.sql** provides better readability due to clear formatting and indentation, making it easier to understand the logic.
- **Result Consistency:**
  - All queries return the same result:  
    `store_id: 53, ratio_completed_orders: 0.9928`
- **Best Practice:**
  - Filtering data early in the query (as in **1result.sql** and **2result.sql**) is a good practice for performance optimization.
  - Using subqueries to narrow down the dataset can make queries more efficient.

### **Conclusion**

Based on the comparison, **`1result.sql`** is the recommended query because it efficiently calculates the ratio specifically for the store with the highest number of orders and has better readability.
