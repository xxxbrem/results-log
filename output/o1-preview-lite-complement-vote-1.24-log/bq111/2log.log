# Correlations between Mitelman and TCGA datasets

- **Title:** Correlations between Mitelman DB and TCGA datasets
- **Author:** Boris Aguilar
- **Created:** 04-23-2022
- **Purpose:** Compare Mitelman DB and TCGA datasets
- **URL:**

This notebook demonstrates how to compute correlations between Mitelman DB and TCGa datasets. The Mitelman DB is hosted by ISB-CGC and can be accessed at this URL: https://mitelmandatabase.isb-cgc.org/. This notebook replicates some of the analyses from the paper by Denomy et al: https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/79/20/5181. Note, however that results are not replicated exactly as some of the underlying data has changed since publication.



# Calculate Frequency of Gains and Losses of breast cancer samples in Mitelman DB

We can use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of samples, e.g., across all breast cancer samples.

In [ ]:

```
# Set parameters for this query
cancer_type = 'BRCA' # Cancer type for TCGA
bq_project = 'mitelman-db'  # project name of Mitelman-DB BigQuery table
bq_dataset = 'prod' # Name of the dataset containing Mitelman-DB BigQuery tables
morphology = '3111' # Breast cancer
topology = '0401' # Adenocarcinoma
```

First, we identify all Mitelman DB cases related to the morphology and topology of interest.

This query was copied from the new feature of the MitelmanDB interface: View Overall Gain/Loss in chromosome.

```
case_query = """
# sql here
"""

# Run the query and put results in a data frame
mysql = ( "WITH " + case_query + """
SELECT *
FROM mitelman
""" )
final_mitelman = client.query(mysql).result().to_dataframe()
```

# Calculate Frequency of TCGA Copy Number Gains and Losses in breast cancer samples.

As a comparison to Mitelman DB gain and loss frequency, we can calculate similar frequencies using TCGA Copy Number data.

```
cnv_query = """
# sql here
"""

# Execute query and put results into a data frame
mysql = ( "WITH " + cnv_query + """
SELECT *
FROM tcga
""" )
cnv = client.query(mysql).result().to_dataframe()
```

# Compute Pearson correlation and p-values

The following query compute Pearson correlation for each chromosome comparing Mitelman DB frequencies with those computed from TCGA. Moreover, for each correlation values, its respective p-values is computed by using the BigQuery function `isb-cgc-bq.functions.corr_pvalue_current`. The minimum number of cases for correlation computation was 5.

```
mysql = ( "WITH " + case_query + "," + cnv_query + """
# sql here
""")
```

The non a value results (NaN) represent cases in which the computed frequencies of TCGA are zero for all the cytobands.

# Conclusion

This notebook demonstrated usage of the Mitelman BigQuery dataset, which includes CytoConverter chromosomal coordinate data, in combination with TCGA BigQuery tables for a comparative analysis. Specifically, the notebook computes correlation (Pearson) coefficients between gains and losses obtained with Mitelam DB and TCGA datasets.

We observed that the mayority (but not all) of the significan correlation shown in Denomy et al. paper (Table 1, https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0585) are also significan in this analysis.

    LIMIT 100;
    ```

18. **Retrieve the list of chromosomes with the highest number of losses across all cancer types:**

    ```sql
    SELECT Chr, COUNT(*) AS loss_count
    FROM `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted`
    WHERE Type = 'Loss'
    GROUP BY Chr
    ORDER BY loss_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

19. **Retrieve all chromosomal abnormalities for cases with prior tumor history:**

    ```sql
    SELECT cc.RefNo, cc.CaseNo, cc.Chr, cc.Type
    FROM `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` AS c
    JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` AS cc
    ON c.RefNo = cc.RefNo AND c.CaseNo = cc.CaseNo
    WHERE c.PrevTum = 'Y'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

20. **Retrieve chromosomal abnormalities grouped by race for breast cancer cases:**

    ```sql
    SELECT c.Race, cc.Chr, cc.Type, COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` AS c
    JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` AS cc
    ON c.RefNo = cc.RefNo AND c.CaseNo = cc.CaseNo
    WHERE c.Morph = '3111' AND c.Topo = '0401'
    GROUP BY c.Race, cc.Chr, cc.Type
    ORDER BY c.Race, count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help to explore the relevant data and understand the distribution of chromosomal gains and losses in the Mitelman Database, specifically for breast cancer cases (morphology code `'3111'` and topography code `'0401'`). By analyzing this data, we can prepare to compute the Pearson correlation coefficients comparing the frequencies of gains and losses with those computed from TCGA datasets for each chromosome.Query:

Task: Follow the instruction documentation guide, please help me compute Pearson correlation for each chromosome comparing Mitelman DB frequencies with those computed from TCGA.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Chromosome,Pearson_correlation_coefficient,p-value
chromosome1:str,r_value1:float,p_value1:float
chromosome2:str,r_value2:float,p_value2:float
...
```

In this table, for each chromosome, we provide the Pearson correlation coefficient and its corresponding p-value, comparing the frequencies of gains and losses between Mitelman DB and TCGA datasets. The chromosomes are listed in the 'Chromosome' column, the correlation coefficients are in the 'Pearson_correlation_coefficient' column as float values, and the p-values are in the 'p-value' column as float values..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'mitelman-db': {'prod': ['AuthorReference', 'CytoBands_hg38', 'CytoConverted', 'CytoConvertedLog', 'Cytogen', 'CytogenInv', 'CytogenInvValid', 'KaryAbnorm', 'KaryBit', 'KaryBreak', 'KaryClone', 'Koder', 'MolBiolClinAssoc', 'MolClinAbnorm', 'MolClinBreak', 'MolClinGene', 'RecurrentData', 'RecurrentNumData', 'Reference']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
