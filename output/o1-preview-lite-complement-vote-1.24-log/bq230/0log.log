**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.usda_nass_agriculture.crops`
  - **commodity_desc:** Used to filter for 'CORN' and 'MUSHROOMS'.
  - **group_desc:** Used to filter 'FIELD CROPS' (for corn) and 'HORTICULTURE' (for mushrooms).
  - **statisticcat_desc:** To select records with 'PRODUCTION' as the statistic category.
  - **year:** To select data from the year 2022.
  - **agg_level_desc:** To filter data measured at the 'STATE' level.
  - **state_name:** To display the U.S. state names.
  - **unit_desc:** To ensure production figures are measured in 'BUSHELS' ('BU').
  - **value:** Contains the production figures; ensure there are no missing values (`value IS NOT NULL`).
  - **sector_desc:** Should be 'CROPS' to focus on crop data.

**Conditions to be Used:**

- `sector_desc = 'CROPS'`
- `commodity_desc = 'CORN'` or `commodity_desc = 'MUSHROOMS'`
- `group_desc = 'FIELD CROPS'` (for corn) or `group_desc = 'HORTICULTURE'` (for mushrooms)
- `statisticcat_desc = 'PRODUCTION'`
- `year = 2022`

Task: Find the total 2022 production figures in bushels for corn from the field crops category and mushrooms from the horticulture group for each U.S. state using the USDA NASS Agriculture Crops dataset? The data should include only records that show production as the statistic category, are measured at the state level, and have no missing values.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The total 2022 production figures in bushels for corn from the field crops category and mushrooms from the horticulture group for each U.S. state are as follows:

```csv
state_name,commodity_desc,production_bushels
state_name1:str,commodity1:str,production1:float
state_name2:str,commodity2:str,production2:float
...
```

This data includes only records where the statistic category is "PRODUCTION," measured at the state level in bushels, and with no missing values. It provides a clear comparison of production figures for corn and mushrooms across different states in 2022..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'usda_nass_agriculture': ['animals_products', 'census2002', 'census2007', 'census2012', 'census_2002', 'census_2007', 'census_2012', 'crops', 'demographics', 'economics', 'environmental']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
