The error occurred because `t.pickup_location_id` is of type **INT64**, while `z.zone_id` is of type **STRING**. To resolve the type mismatch, cast `t.pickup_location_id` to **STRING** using `CAST(t.pickup_location_id AS STRING)` so that both sides of the comparison are of the same type.

## Tip Rate Calculation and Categorization

The `tip_rate` for each trip is calculated based on the total trip amount and the tip amount. The formula for calculating the tip rate is as follows:



After calculating the tip rate, the values are categorized into the following ranges:

- `no tip`: if `tip_rate = 0`
- `Less than 5%`: if `tip_rate <= 5`
- `5% to 10%`: if `tip_rate > 5` and `tip_rate <= 10`
- `10% to 15%`: if `tip_rate > 10` and `tip_rate <= 15`
- `15% to 20%`: if `tip_rate > 15` and `tip_rate <= 20`
- `20% to 25%`: if `tip_rate > 20` and `tip_rate <= 25`

Task: For NYC yellow taxi trips between January 1-7, 2016, excluding pickups from 'EWR' and 'Staten Island', calculate the proportion of trips by tip category for each pickup borough. Show the borough, tip category, and proportion, ensuring trips where the dropoff occurs after the pickup, the passenger count is greater than 0, and trip distance, tip, tolls, MTA tax, fare, and total amount are non-negative.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
borough,tip_category,proportion
borough1:str,category1:str,proportion1:float
borough2:str,category2:str,proportion2:float
...
```

To calculate the proportion of trips by tip category for each pickup borough between January 1-7, 2016, we follow these steps:

1. **Filter Trips**: Select trips from the `tlc_yellow_trips_2016` table where:
   - The pickup date is between January 1 and January 7, 2016.
   - The pickup location is **not** in 'EWR' (Newark Airport) and 'Staten Island'.
   - The `dropoff_datetime` occurs after the `pickup_datetime`.
   - `passenger_count` > 0.
   - `trip_distance`, `tip_amount`, `tolls_amount`, `mta_tax`, `fare_amount`, and `total_amount` are all non-negative.

2. **Join with Borough Information**: Join the filtered trips with the `taxi_zone_geom` table on `pickup_location_id` to get the corresponding `borough` for each trip.

3. **Calculate Tip Rate**:
   - For each trip, compute the `tip_rate` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{tip\_rate} = \left( \frac{\text{tip\_amount}}{\text{total\_amount} - \text{tip\_amount}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - This calculates the tip as a percentage of the total fare excluding the tip.

4. **Categorize Tip Rates**:
   - Assign each trip to a `tip_category` based on the calculated `tip_rate`:
     - **no tip**: `tip_rate = 0`
     - **Less than 5%**: `tip_rate > 0` and `tip_rate ≤ 5`
     - **5% to 10%**: `tip_rate > 5` and `tip_rate ≤ 10`
     - **10% to 15%**: `tip_rate > 10` and `tip_rate ≤ 15`
     - **15% to 20%**: `tip_rate > 15` and `tip_rate ≤ 20`
     - **20% to 25%**: `tip_rate > 20` and `tip_rate ≤ 25`
     - **More than 25%**: `tip_rate > 25`

5. **Calculate Proportions**:
   - For each `borough` and `tip_category`, count the number of trips.
   - Calculate the `proportion` by dividing the count in each category by the total number of trips in that borough.
   - The `proportion` is a float value between 0 and 1.

The final output lists each borough with its corresponding tip categories and the proportion of trips that fall into each category..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'new_york_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'new_york_citibike': ['citibike_stations', 'citibike_trips'], 'new_york_mv_collisions': ['nypd_mv_collisions'], 'new_york_subway': ['geo_nyc_borough_boundaries', 'routes', 'station_complexes', 'station_entrances', 'stations', 'stop_times', 'subway_ridership_2013_present', 'trips'], 'new_york_taxi_trips': ['taxi_zone_geom', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2015', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2016', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2017', 'tlc_green_trips_2014', 'tlc_green_trips_2015', 'tlc_green_trips_2016', 'tlc_green_trips_2017', 'tlc_green_trips_2018', 'tlc_green_trips_2019', 'tlc_green_trips_2020', 'tlc_green_trips_2021', 'tlc_green_trips_2022', 'tlc_green_trips_2023', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2011', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2012', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2013', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2014', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2015', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2016', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2017', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2018', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2019', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2020', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2021', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2022', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2023'], 'new_york_trees': ['tree_census_1995', 'tree_census_2005', 'tree_census_2015', 'tree_species']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

     \text{tip\_rate} = \left( \frac{\text{tip\_amount}}{\text{total\_amount} - \text{tip\_amount}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - This calculates the tip as a percentage of the total fare excluding the tip.

4. **Categorize Tip Rates**:
   - Assign each trip to a `tip_category` based on the calculated `tip_rate`:
     - **no tip**: `tip_rate = 0`
     - **Less than 5%**: `tip_rate > 0` and `tip_rate ≤ 5`
     - **5% to 10%**: `tip_rate > 5` and `tip_rate ≤ 10`
     - **10% to 15%**: `tip_rate > 10` and `tip_rate ≤ 15`
     - **15% to 20%**: `tip_rate > 15` and `tip_rate ≤ 20`
     - **20% to 25%**: `tip_rate > 20` and `tip_rate ≤ 25`
     - **More than 25%**: `tip_rate > 25`

5. **Calculate Proportions**:
   - For each `borough` and `tip_category`, count the number of trips.
   - Calculate the `proportion` by dividing the count in each category by the total number of trips in that borough.
   - The `proportion` is a float value between 0 and 1.

The final output lists each borough with its corresponding tip categories and the proportion of trips that fall into each category. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
