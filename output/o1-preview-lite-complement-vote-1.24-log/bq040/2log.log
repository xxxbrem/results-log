2025-01-27 09:10:44 - root - INFO - I apologize for the confusion and the error in the previous SQL query. The error message `"Unrecognized name: z at [7:5]"` occurs because the aliases `t` and `z` were incorrectly referenced in the middle subquery where they are not visible. I've corrected the SQL query by properly referencing the aliases and ensuring all columns are correctly specified.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  borough,
  tip_category,
  COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY borough) AS proportion
FROM (
  SELECT
    sub.borough,
    CASE
      WHEN sub.tip_amount = 0 THEN 'no tip'
      WHEN sub.tip_rate > 0 AND sub.tip_rate <= 5 THEN 'Less than 5%'
      WHEN sub.tip_rate > 5 AND sub.tip_rate <= 10 THEN '5% to 10%'
      WHEN sub.tip_rate > 10 AND sub.tip_rate <= 15 THEN '10% to 15%'
      WHEN sub.tip_rate > 15 AND sub.tip_rate <= 20 THEN '15% to 20%'
      WHEN sub.tip_rate > 20 AND sub.tip_rate <= 25 THEN '20% to 25%'
      WHEN sub.tip_rate > 25 THEN 'More than 25%'
      ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS tip_category
  FROM (
    SELECT
      t.tip_amount,
      t.total_amount,
      z.borough,
      -- Calculate tip_rate
      (t.tip_amount / NULLIF(t.total_amount - t.tip_amount, 0)) * 100 AS tip_rate
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016` AS t
    JOIN
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.taxi_zone_geom` AS z
    ON
      t.pickup_location_id = z.zone_id
    WHERE
      DATE(t.pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2016-01-07'
      AND z.borough NOT IN ('EWR', 'Staten Island')
      AND t.dropoff_datetime > t.pickup_datetime
      AND t.passenger_count > 0
      AND t.trip_distance >= 0
      AND t.tip_amount >= 0
      AND t.tolls_amount >= 0
      AND t.mta_tax >= 0
      AND t.fare_amount >= 0
      AND t.total_amount >= 0
  ) AS sub
)
GROUP BY
  borough,
  tip_category
ORDER BY
  borough,
  tip_category;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Alias Corrections:**
  - In the middle subquery, I replaced references to `t` and `z` with `sub`, as only `sub` is available in that scope.
  - For example, `sub.tip_amount` instead of `t.tip_amount`, and `sub.borough` instead of `z.borough`.

- **Column Selection:**
  - In the innermost subquery (`sub`), I selected only the necessary columns needed for the calculations (`tip_amount`, `total_amount`, `borough`, and `tip_rate`).
  - This ensures that we don't have ambiguous column references and reduces the amount of data processed.

- **JOIN Conditions:**
  - Removed unnecessary type casting on `pickup_location_id` since both `t.pickup_location_id` and `z.zone_id` are of the same type (`STRING`), based on the table schema.

- **Condition Checks:**
  - Ensured that all conditions in the `WHERE` clause are accurate and that we are comparing values correctly.

This corrected query should resolve the error and provide you with the proportion of trips by tip category for each pickup borough, as per your initial task.

**Note:** When running this query in BigQuery, make sure that you have access to the tables and that they are correctly referenced.

If you encounter any further issues or have additional questions, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help!

## Tip Rate Calculation and Categorization

The `tip_rate` for each trip is calculated based on the total trip amount and the tip amount. The formula for calculating the tip rate is as follows:



After calculating the tip rate, the values are categorized into the following ranges:

- `no tip`: if `tip_rate = 0`
- `Less than 5%`: if `tip_rate <= 5`
- `5% to 10%`: if `tip_rate > 5` and `tip_rate <= 10`
- `10% to 15%`: if `tip_rate > 10` and `tip_rate <= 15`
- `15% to 20%`: if `tip_rate > 15` and `tip_rate <= 20`
- `20% to 25%`: if `tip_rate > 20` and `tip_rate <= 25`
- `More than 25%`: if `tip_rate > 25`

      trip_distance > 0
      AND passenger_count > 0
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

17. **Check for Trips with Negative Tolls Amount:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      tolls_amount,
      pickup_datetime
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
    WHERE
      tolls_amount < 0
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

18. **Calculate Average Tip Amount by Payment Type:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      payment_type,
      AVG(tip_amount) AS average_tip
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
    GROUP BY
      payment_type
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

19. **Sample Trips with MTA Tax and Improvement Surcharge:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      mta_tax,
      imp_surcharge,
      total_amount
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
    WHERE
      mta_tax >= 0
      AND imp_surcharge >= 0
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

20. **Sample Trips with Payment Type and Tip Amount:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      payment_type,
      tip_amount
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries explore various aspects of the data, such as ensuring data quality by checking for negative values, understanding the distribution of payment types, joining trips with zone data to get borough information, and calculating tip rates. This exploration helps in preparing the data for the final analysis required by the task.Query:

Task: For NYC yellow taxi trips between January 1-7, 2016, excluding pickups from 'EWR' and 'Staten Island', calculate the proportion of trips by tip category for each pickup borough. Show the borough, tip category, and proportion, ensuring trips where the dropoff occurs after the pickup, the passenger count is greater than 0, and trip distance, tip, tolls, MTA tax, fare, and total amount are non-negative.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
borough,tip_category,proportion
borough1:str,category1:str,proportion1:float
borough2:str,category2:str,proportion2:float
...
```

To calculate the proportion of trips by tip category for each pickup borough between January 1-7, 2016, we follow these steps:

1. **Filter Trips**: Select trips from the `tlc_yellow_trips_2016` table where:
   - The pickup date is between January 1 and January 7, 2016.
   - The pickup location is **not** in 'EWR' (Newark Airport) and 'Staten Island'.
   - The `dropoff_datetime` occurs after the `pickup_datetime`.
   - `passenger_count` > 0.
   - `trip_distance`, `tip_amount`, `tolls_amount`, `mta_tax`, `fare_amount`, and `total_amount` are all non-negative.

2. **Join with Borough Information**: Join the filtered trips with the `taxi_zone_geom` table on `pickup_location_id` to get the corresponding `borough` for each trip.

3. **Calculate Tip Rate**:
   - For each trip, compute the `tip_rate` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{tip\_rate} = \left( \frac{\text{tip\_amount}}{\text{total\_amount} - \text{tip\_amount}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - This calculates the tip as a percentage of the total fare excluding the tip.

4. **Categorize Tip Rates**:
   - Assign each trip to a `tip_category` based on the calculated `tip_rate`:
     - **no tip**: `tip_rate = 0`
     - **Less than 5%**: `tip_rate > 0` and `tip_rate ≤ 5`
     - **5% to 10%**: `tip_rate > 5` and `tip_rate ≤ 10`
     - **10% to 15%**: `tip_rate > 10` and `tip_rate ≤ 15`
     - **15% to 20%**: `tip_rate > 15` and `tip_rate ≤ 20`
     - **20% to 25%**: `tip_rate > 20` and `tip_rate ≤ 25`
     - **More than 25%**: `tip_rate > 25`

5. **Calculate Proportions**:
   - For each `borough` and `tip_category`, count the number of trips.
   - Calculate the `proportion` by dividing the count in each category by the total number of trips in that borough.
   - The `proportion` is a float value between 0 and 1.

The final output lists each borough with its corresponding tip categories and the proportion of trips that fall into each category..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'new_york_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'new_york_citibike': ['citibike_stations', 'citibike_trips'], 'new_york_mv_collisions': ['nypd_mv_collisions'], 'new_york_subway': ['geo_nyc_borough_boundaries', 'routes', 'station_complexes', 'station_entrances', 'stations', 'stop_times', 'subway_ridership_2013_present', 'trips'], 'new_york_taxi_trips': ['taxi_zone_geom', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2015', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2016', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2017', 'tlc_green_trips_2014', 'tlc_green_trips_2015', 'tlc_green_trips_2016', 'tlc_green_trips_2017', 'tlc_green_trips_2018', 'tlc_green_trips_2019', 'tlc_green_trips_2020', 'tlc_green_trips_2021', 'tlc_green_trips_2022', 'tlc_green_trips_2023', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2011', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2012', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2013', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2014', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2015', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2016', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2017', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2018', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2019', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2020', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2021', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2022', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2023'], 'new_york_trees': ['tree_census_1995', 'tree_census_2005', 'tree_census_2015', 'tree_species']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Show the borough, tip category, and proportion, ensuring trips where the dropoff occurs after the pickup, the passenger count is greater than 0, and trip distance, tip, tolls, MTA tax, fare, and total amount are non-negative., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.

The answer format should be like: ```csv
borough,tip_category,proportion

borough2:str,category2:str,proportion2:float
...
```

To calculate the proportion of trips by tip category for each pickup borough between January 1-7, 2016, we follow these steps:

1. **Filter Trips**: Select trips from the `tlc_yellow_trips_2016` table where:
   - The pickup date is between January 1 and January 7, 2016.
   - The pickup location is **not** in 'EWR' (Newark Airport) and 'Staten Island'.
   - The `dropoff_datetime` occurs after the `pickup_datetime`.
   - `passenger_count` > 0.
   - `trip_distance`, `tip_amount`, `tolls_amount`, `mta_tax`, `fare_amount`, and `total_amount` are all non-negative.

2. **Join with Borough Information**: Join the filtered trips with the `taxi_zone_geom` table on `pickup_location_id` to get the corresponding `borough` for each trip.

3. **Calculate Tip Rate**:
   - For each trip, compute the `tip_rate` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{tip\_rate} = \left( \frac{\text{tip\_amount}}{\text{total\_amount} - \text{tip\_amount}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - This calculates the tip as a percentage of the total fare excluding the tip.

4. **Categorize Tip Rates**:
   - Assign each trip to a `tip_category` based on the calculated `tip_rate`:
     - **no tip**: `tip_rate = 0`
     - **Less than 5%**: `tip_rate > 0` and `tip_rate ≤ 5`
     - **5% to 10%**: `tip_rate > 5` and `tip_rate ≤ 10`
     - **10% to 15%**: `tip_rate > 10` and `tip_rate ≤ 15`
     - **15% to 20%**: `tip_rate > 15` and `tip_rate ≤ 20`
     - **20% to 25%**: `tip_rate > 20` and `tip_rate ≤ 25`
     - **More than 25%**: `tip_rate > 25`

5. **Calculate Proportions**:
   - For each `borough` and `tip_category`, count the number of trips.
   - Calculate the `proportion` by dividing the count in each category by the total number of trips in that borough.
   - The `proportion` is a float value between 0 and 1.

The final output lists each borough with its corresponding tip categories and the proportion of trips that fall into each category. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
