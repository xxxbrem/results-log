After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **`0result.sql`** aligns closely with the task's requirement by attempting to match individual trees that were alive in both 1995 and 2015. It does this by matching trees based on both species and approximate location (using rounded latitude and longitude). This approach aims to identify the same trees across the two datasets, ensuring that only trees alive in both years are considered. By grouping the matched trees by their fall color, it accurately reflects how the number of trees of each fall color has changed, considering only those trees that survived from 1995 to 2015.

- **`1result.sql`** assumes that if a species is alive in 2015, all trees of that species alive in 1995 are considered alive in both years. This approach does not account for individual tree survival and may include trees that died between 1995 and 2015 or new trees planted after 1995. Therefore, it does not accurately reflect the changes in tree counts for trees that were alive in both years.

- **`2result.sql`** focuses on species present in both years but, like `1result.sql`, it doesn't attempt to match individual trees. It counts all trees of species that are present in both datasets, regardless of whether specific trees survived from 1995 to 2015. This method overlooks the importance of tracking individual tree survival and may misrepresent the changes in tree counts.

**Conclusion:**

- **`0result.sql`** is the most appropriate SQL script as it carefully matches individual trees based on species and location, adhering to the task's criteria of considering only trees that were alive in both 1995 and 2015. It provides a more accurate representation of how the number of trees of each fall color has changed over the 20-year period, focusing on tree survival.
