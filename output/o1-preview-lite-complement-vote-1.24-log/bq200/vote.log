After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Candidate SQL 1 (`1result.sql`)** correctly retrieves the fastest pitcher on each team using both regular and post-season data.
- It properly associates pitchers with their respective teams based on the `inningHalf` column.
  - When `inningHalf` is `'top'`, the pitcher is on the **home team** (`homeTeamName`).
  - When `inningHalf` is `'bottom'`, the pitcher is on the **away team** (`awayTeamName`).
- It excludes records where the `teamName` is `NULL` or in `('American League', 'National League')`, ensuring only valid team names are considered.
- It handles ties in `MaxPitchSpeed` by ordering additionally by `PitcherName`, ensuring consistent results.
- The use of `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY teamName ORDER BY MaxPitchSpeed DESC, PitcherName` selects the fastest pitcher for each team.
- The results in `1result.csv` make sense, with each team listing its fastest pitcher and their maximum valid pitch speed.
- Compared to the other candidates:
  - **Candidate SQL 0 (`0result.sql`)** includes `'American League'` as a team, which is incorrect.
  - **Candidate SQL 2 (`2result.sql`)** shows the same pitcher (`Albertin Chapman`) as the fastest pitcher for multiple teams, which is unlikely and suggests an error in associating pitchers with teams.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct query that accurately fulfills the task: showing the full name of the fastest pitcher on each team with their maximum valid pitch speed, using both regular and post-season data.
