After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is `2result.sql`.

**Reasoning:**

- **Session Identification:** `2result.sql` accurately identifies sessions by using both `user_pseudo_id` and `ga_session_id`. This ensures that each session is uniquely identified, avoiding any overlap of events from different sessions of the same user.
  
- **First Event Per Session:** It correctly captures the first event of each session by finding the minimum `event_timestamp` for each combination of `user_pseudo_id` and `ga_session_id`.

- **Home Page Landing Sessions:** The query filters sessions where the first event is a `page_view` and the `first_page_title` is 'Home'. This accurately represents sessions where users landed on the Home page.

- **Sessions Reaching Checkout Confirmation:** It identifies sessions where users viewed the 'Checkout Confirmation' page, ensuring these sessions met the conversion criteria.

- **Conversion Rate Calculation:** The conversion rate is calculated by dividing the number of sessions that started on the Home page and reached the Checkout Confirmation page by the total number of sessions that started on the Home page, multiplied by 100.

- **Comparison with Other SQLs:**
  - `0result.sql` also uses `ga_session_id` but may not accurately identify the first event per session, potentially including sessions that did not start on the Home page.
  - `1result.sql` relies solely on `user_pseudo_id` to define sessions. Since a user can have multiple sessions, this might group events from different sessions together, leading to inaccurate conversion rate calculations.

Therefore, `2result.sql` provides the most precise and accurate calculation of the user session conversion rate by properly identifying sessions and correctly applying the conversion criteria.
