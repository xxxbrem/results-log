2025-01-27 20:46:42 - root - INFO - I see that you're encountering an error when running the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
     `consecutive_number`, 
     `work_zone`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
WHERE `work_zone` = 1
LIMIT 100
```

**Error Message:**

```
400 No matching signature for operator = for argument types: STRING, INT64
```

---

**Explanation of the Error:**

- The error occurs because you're trying to compare a **STRING** column (`work_zone`) with an **integer** value (`1`).
- In SQL, comparing a string to an integer without explicit casting results in a type mismatch error.

**How to Fix the Error:**

- Since `work_zone` is a **STRING** column, you need to compare it to a **string literal**.
- Enclose the value `1` in single quotes to make it a string: `'1'`.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT 
     `consecutive_number`, 
     `work_zone`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
WHERE `work_zone` = '1'
LIMIT 100
```

---

**Additional Information:**

- Let's verify the distinct values present in the `work_zone` column to better understand the data.

**Query to Check Distinct `work_zone` Values:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `work_zone`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
```

**Possible Results:**

```
work_zone
'0'
'1'
'2'
'3'
'4'
'8'
'9'
```

**Meaning of `work_zone` Codes:**

Based on the FARS Coding and Validation Manual, the `work_zone` codes typically represent:

- `'0'` - No
- `'1'` - Yes
- `'2'` - Yes, Construction
- `'3'` - Yes, Maintenance
- `'4'` - Yes, Utility
- `'8'` - Not Reported
- `'9'` - Unknown

**Note:**

- You can adjust your query to include all work zone-related crashes by checking for all relevant codes.
- For example, to select all crashes that occurred in a work zone (regardless of type), you can use:

  ```sql
  WHERE `work_zone` IN ('1', '2', '3', '4')
  ```

---

**Revised Query Examples:**

1. **Select Crashes Occurring in Any Work Zone:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
        `consecutive_number`, 
        `work_zone`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE `work_zone` IN ('1', '2', '3', '4')
   LIMIT 100
   ```

2. **Select Crashes Not in Work Zones:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
        `consecutive_number`, 
        `work_zone`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE `work_zone` = '0'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

---

**Summary:**

- Always ensure that data types match when performing comparisons in SQL.
- Enclose string literals in single quotes `'...'`.
- When in doubt, check the data types of the columns and the possible values they can take.
- Use `CAST` or `SAFE_CAST` functions if you need to convert between data types.

**Example with Casting (Not Necessary Here, but for Demonstration):**

```sql
SELECT 
     `consecutive_number`, 
     `work_zone`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
WHERE CAST(`work_zone` AS INT64) = 1
LIMIT 100
```

However, since `work_zone` contains non-numeric codes like `'8'` and `'9'`, casting may result in errors or unintended behavior. It's safer to compare using string literals.

---

**Proceeding with Your Task:**

- Adjust the other queries if needed, ensuring data type compatibility.
- When constructing your dataset, remember to:

  - Use string comparisons where appropriate.
  - Verify the data types of all columns involved.
  - Handle any special codes or values as per the data documentation.

2025-01-27 20:47:22 - root - INFO - It seems that you're still encountering the same error when running your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
     `consecutive_number`, 
     `work_zone`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
WHERE `work_zone` = 1
LIMIT 100
```

**Error Message:**

```
400 No matching signature for operator = for argument types: STRING, INT64
```

---

**Explanation:**

The error occurs because you're trying to compare a **STRING** column (`work_zone`) to an **integer** value (`1`) without converting data types or matching them. In SQL, you cannot directly compare a string to an integer; both sides of the comparison must be of the same or compatible data types.

In your query, the value `1` is treated as an integer (`INT64`), but the `work_zone` column contains string values. Therefore, comparing `work_zone` (STRING) to `1` (INT64) results in a type mismatch.

**Solution:**

To fix the error, you need to ensure that both sides of the comparison are of the same data type. There are two main ways to do this:

1. **Convert the Integer to a String Literal:**

   Enclose the `1` in single quotes to make it a string literal. This way, you're comparing a string to a string.

   **Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
        `consecutive_number`, 
        `work_zone`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE `work_zone` = '1'
   LIMIT 100
   ```
   
2. **Convert the Column to an Integer:**

   Use the `CAST` function to convert the `work_zone` column to an integer. However, this method is not recommended here because if `work_zone` contains non-numeric values (e.g., '8', '9', or other codes that may not convert cleanly to integers), the cast will fail or produce unintended results.

   **Alternative Query (Not Recommended in This Case):**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
        `consecutive_number`, 
        `work_zone`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE CAST(`work_zone` AS INT64) = 1
   LIMIT 100
   ```
   
   Given the potential issues, **it's safer to compare strings to strings by enclosing the value in quotes**.

---

**Checking the Data Types and Values:**

To better understand the `work_zone` column, let's check its data type and the distinct values it contains.

**1. Verify Data Type:**

```sql
SELECT
  column_name,
  data_type
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE
  table_name = 'accident_2016'
  AND column_name = 'work_zone'
```

**Expected Result:**

```
column_name  | data_type
-------------|-----------
work_zone    | STRING
```

**2. Inspect Distinct Values:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `work_zone`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
```

**Possible Values:**

```
work_zone
---------
'0'
'1'
'2'
'3'
'4'
'8'
'9'
```

**Meaning of `work_zone` Codes:**

- `'0'` - No
- `'1'` - Yes, Work Zone
- `'2'` - Yes, Construction
- `'3'` - Yes, Maintenance
- `'4'` - Yes, Utility
- `'8'` - Not Reported
- `'9'` - Unknown

---

**Recommendation:**

Modify your query by enclosing the `1` in single quotes to match the data type of the `work_zone` column:

```sql
SELECT 
     `consecutive_number`, 
     `work_zone`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
WHERE `work_zone` = '1'
LIMIT 100
```

**Alternatively**, if you want to select all crashes that occurred in any type of work zone, you can use the `IN` operator with all relevant codes:

```sql
SELECT 
     `consecutive_number`, 
     `work_zone`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
WHERE `work_zone` IN ('1', '2', '3', '4')
LIMIT 100
```

This will include all types of work zones in your results.

---

**Ensure Correct Use of Quotes:**

- Use **single quotes** `'...'` for string literals in SQL.
- Avoid using double quotes `"..."` as they might be interpreted differently depending on the SQL dialect.
- Confirm that you're not using any special characters or curly quotes, which can cause syntax errors.

**Example of Incorrect vs. Correct Usage:**

- Incorrect: `WHERE work_zone = “1”` (uses curly quotes)
- Correct: `WHERE work_zone = '1'` (uses straight single quotes)

---

**Summary:**

- The error is due to a data type mismatch between a string column and an integer value.
- Enclose the integer value in single quotes to make it a string literal.
- Use the corrected query to retrieve the desired results without errors.

---

**Next Steps:**

- Run the corrected query with the value `'1'` enclosed in single quotes.
- If you need to include multiple work zone types, adjust the query accordingly.
- Continue building your dataset using the corrected queries.

     `consecutive_number`, 
     `work_zone`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`

```

**Error Message:**

    Unable to find common supertype for templated argument <T1>
      Input types for <T1>: {INT64, STRING} at [5:7]
```

---

**Explanation of the Error:**

- The error occurs because you're comparing a **STRING** column (`work_zone`) to an **integer** value (`1`).
- In SQL, both sides of the comparison operator `=` must be of the same data type.
- The `work_zone` column in the `accident_2016` table is of type **STRING**.

**How to Fix the Error:**

- Enclose the numeric value `1` in single quotes to make it a **string literal**: `'1'`.
- This ensures both sides of the comparison are strings.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT 
     `consecutive_number`, 
     `work_zone`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
WHERE `work_zone` = '1'
LIMIT 100
```

---

**Additional Steps to Ensure Success:**

1. **Use Straight Single Quotes:**
   - Ensure you're using straight single quotes `'` and not curly quotes `‘` or `’`.
   - Sometimes, copying and pasting from certain sources can replace straight quotes with curly ones, which can cause errors.

2. **Copy and Paste the Corrected Query:**
   - To avoid any formatting issues, copy the corrected query directly from above into your SQL editor.

3. **Check for Leading or Trailing Spaces in `work_zone`:**
   - If `work_zone` values might have spaces, use the `TRIM` function:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
        `consecutive_number`, 
        `work_zone`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
   WHERE TRIM(`work_zone`) = '1'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

4. **Verify `work_zone` Possible Values:**
   - The `work_zone` field may contain different codes:
     - `'0'` - No
     - `'1'` - Yes
     - `'2'` - Construction
     - `'3'` - Maintenance
     - `'4'` - Utility
     - `'8'` - Not Reported
     - `'9'` - Unknown
   - To include all work zone-related crashes, adjust your `WHERE` clause:
   ```sql
   WHERE `work_zone` IN ('1', '2', '3', '4')
   ```

---

**Example with Multiple Work Zone Types:**

```sql
SELECT 
     `consecutive_number`, 
     `work_zone`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
WHERE `work_zone` IN ('1', '2', '3', '4')
LIMIT 100
```

---

**Alternative Solution Using CAST (Proceed with Caution):**

- If you prefer to work with numeric values, you can attempt to cast the `work_zone` column to an integer.
- **Note:** This method is only safe if all values in `work_zone` can be converted to integers without errors.

```sql
SELECT 
     `consecutive_number`, 
     `work_zone`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
WHERE CAST(`work_zone` AS INT64) = 1
LIMIT 100
```

- **Potential Issues with Casting:**
  - If `work_zone` contains non-numeric strings (e.g., '8', '9'), the `CAST` function may fail.
  - It's safer to compare strings to strings unless you're certain all values are numeric.

---

**Confirming the Data Type of `work_zone`:**

If you're still experiencing issues, let's confirm the data type of the `work_zone` column.

**Query to Check Data Type:**

```sql
SELECT
  column_name,
  data_type
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE
  table_name = 'accident_2016'
  AND column_name = 'work_zone'
```

**Expected Result:**

```
column_name   | data_type
--------------|-----------
work_zone     | STRING
```

---

**Ensure Proper Syntax and Formatting:**

- **No Extra Spaces:** Check that there are no unexpected spaces or hidden characters in your query.
- **Correct Line Number:** The error references `[5:7]`, which points to line 5, character 7. Ensure that line 5 corresponds to the `WHERE` clause and that the syntax there is correct.

---

**Final Tips:**

- **Use Standard SQL:** Ensure that your SQL editor is set to use Standard SQL syntax, as BigQuery supports both Standard and Legacy SQL.
- **Test with a Simple Query:**

  Try running a simple query to fetch `work_zone` values and see what data you're working with:

  ```sql
  SELECT 
       `work_zone`, 
       COUNT(*) as count
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`
  GROUP BY `work_zone`
  ```

- **Check for Null Values:**

  If `work_zone` might contain null values, you can add a condition to exclude them:

  ```sql
  WHERE `work_zone` IS NOT NULL AND `work_zone` = '1'
  ```

---

**Conclusion:**

By ensuring that you're comparing the same data types and using proper syntax, the error should be resolved. Please try the corrected query, and let me know if you continue to experience issues or if you have any other questions. I'm here to help!

### Overview 

Within the nhtsa_traffic_fatalities dataset there are 40 different tables. Interestingly, each table has a suffix of either _2015 or _2016 denoting the year the events in the table occured in. Essentially, there are then only 20 tables. We decided for this project to use only the tables with the _2016 suffix in order to take into account the most recent data. 

Within all tables there are columns for state_number and consecutive_number. State_number identifies the state in which the crash occured. Consecutive_number is a unique case number that is assigned to each crash.

In general here are each table and the information that the table contains.

* accident_2016 - one record per a crash, contains details on crash characteristics and environmental conditions
* cevent_2016 - one record per event, contains a description of the event or object contacted, vehicles involved, and where the vehicle was impacted
* damage_2016 - one record per damaged area, contains details on the areas on a vehicle that were damaged in the crash
* distract_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each distraction is a seperate record, contains details on driver distractions
* drimpair_2016 - at least one record for each driver of an in-transport motor vehicle, one record per impairment, contains details on physical impairments of drivers of motor vehicles
* factor_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each factor is a seperate record, contains details about vehicle circumstances which may have contributed to the crash
* maneuver_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each maneuver is a seperate record, contains details regarding actions taken by the driver to avoid something/someone in the road
* nmcrash_2016 - at least one record for each person who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle, one record per action, contains details about any contributing circumstances or improper actions of people who are not occupants of motor vehicles
* nmimpair_2016 - at least one record for each person who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle, one record per impairment, contains details about physical impairements of people who are not occupants of motor vehicles
* nmprior_2016 - at least one record for each person who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle, one record per action, contains details about the actions of people who are not occupants of motor vehicles at the time of their involvment in the crash
* parkwork_2016 - one record per parked/working vehicle, contains details about parked or working vehicles involved in FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System) crashes
* pbtype_2016 - one record for each pedestrian, bicyclist or person on a personal conveyance, contains details about crashes between motor vehicles and pedestrians, people on personal conveyances and bicyclists.
* person_2016 - one record per person, contains details describing all persons involved in the crash like age, sex, vehicle occupant restraint use, and injury severity

### Redundant Data/Tables

There is redundant data. For example, vsoe_2016 is an abridged version of vevent_2016. We can see that both tables have one record for each event for each in-transport motor vehicle and contains details on the sequence of events for each intransport motor vehicle. Furthermore, we can go another layer and see that vevent_2016 has redundant data with cevent_2016 as vevent_2016 has the same data elements but also record the VIN as an identifier for data. 

If we compare vehicle_2016 and accident_2016 we can see many redundant columns such as: timestamp_of_crash, first_harmful_event, first_harmful_event_name, and (day/month/hour/minute)_of_crash, etc. This is interesting as vehicle_2016 contains one record per in-transport motor vehicle and accident_2016 contains one record per crash which may contain multiple in-transport motor vehicles. Therefore, this data could be redundant multiple times. 

Moreover, many tables include the raw timestamp as well as year, month, day, hour, minute columns which is redundant as timestamp tells all this information.

In general we see some redundant data, and we believe the purpose is to make querying easier for the user. So for example, if they want to determine the hour of events they do not need to manually calculate the hour from the timestamp, or if they want information about the first_harmful_event in a specific vehicle now they don't need to join accident_2016 to get the data. 

### Edge Cases

- The dataset we choose only contains accidents in which there is at least 1 fatality;
- When you use `travel_speed`, its value should be constrained because certain codes represent speeds beyond a threshold or unknown values, e.g.,
    - 997 indicates speeds greater than 96
    - 998 indicates speeds greater than 151
    - 999 represents unknown speeds
- When you use `speed_limit`, it should be similarly constrained because certain codes indicate that:
    - the speed limit was not reported (98), or
    - the value is unknown (99)
The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'nhtsa_traffic_fatalities': [' accident_2020', ' cevent_2017', ' cevent_2019', ' distract_2015', ' drimpair_2017', ' drimpair_2019', ' factor_2020', ' maneuver_2018', ' nmcrash_2018', ' nmcrash_2019', ' nmimpair_2015', ' nmimpair_2016', ' nmimpair_2018', ' safetyeq_2016', ' vsoe_2015', 'accident_2016', 'damage_2016', 'factor_2016', 'nmcrash_2016', 'person_2015']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
Firstly, let's identify the relevant tables and columns based on the available data:

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

- **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2016`

  - **Columns**:
    - `state_number`: **State** where the crash occurred.
    - `number_of_fatalities`: Used to determine if **more than one fatality** occurred (Label).
    - `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit`: Number of people in motor vehicles.
    - `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit`: Number of people not in motor vehicles.
    - `number_of_drunk_drivers`: **Number of drunk drivers** involved.
    - `day_of_week`: **Day of the week** when the crash occurred.
    - `hour_of_crash`: **Hour of the day** when the crash occurred.
    - `work_zone`: Indicates **whether the crash occurred in a work zone**.

### Potential Usage and Conditions:

- **Label**:
  - Determine crashes with **more than one fatality** (`number_of_fatalities` > 1).
- **Crashes involving 2 or more people**:
  - Sum of `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` should be **2 or more**.
- **Predictors**:
  - **State**: `state_number`
  - **Number of drunk drivers**: `number_of_drunk_drivers`
  - **Day of the week**: `day_of_week`
  - **Hour of the day**: `hour_of_crash`
  - **Work zone**: `work_zone`

**Note**: Unfortunately, the available tables do not contain data for **vehicle type**, **travel speed**, or **speed limit**, so we cannot include those predictors.

**Explanation**:

- **Query 1**: Retrieves a list of distinct state numbers where crashes occurred.
- **Query 2**: Shows the total number of persons involved in each crash.
- **Query 3**: Filters crashes involving 2 or more people.
- **Query 4**: Displays the number of fatalities in crashes involving 2 or more people.
- **Query 5**: Provides a sample of how many drunk drivers were involved in crashes.
- **Query 6**: Counts the number of crashes for each day of the week.
- **Query 7**: Counts the number of crashes for each hour of the day.
- **Query 8**: Selects crashes that occurred in work zones.
- **Query 9**: Counts the number of crashes that involved more than one fatality among crashes with 2 or more people.
- **Query 10**: Combines key predictors and calculates the label for the model.

---

**Note**:

- Since **vehicle type**, **travel speed**, and **speed limit** data are not available in the specified tables, we cannot include those predictors or calculate the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit.
- All queries are limited to the available data and tables as per the instructions.
- The queries use basic SQL constructs to explore the data and understand the values in related columns.
- The `LIMIT 100` clause is used in each query to restrict the output to 100 rows, as requested.

By running these queries, we can gain insights into the dataset and prepare the available data for building the ML model with the predictors that are accessible.Query:

Task: I want to build a ML model which can predict whether there will be more than one fatality in a crash invloving 2 or more people. Construct a labelled (0 or 1) dataset for me, and the predictors include the state, vehicle type, the number of drunk drivers, day of the week, hour of the day and another two engineered features, whether the accident happened in the work zone and the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit. Please use numeric value for each predictor and categorize the speed difference into levels 0 to 4 based on 20MPH increments (lower bound inclusive while upper exclusive).

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To construct the labelled dataset for your ML model, here is the data format with the required predictors and label:

```csv
Label,State,Vehicle_type,Number_of_drunk_drivers,Day_of_week,Hour_of_day,Work_zone,Speed_diff_level
label:int in {0,1},state:int,vehicle_type:int,num_drunk_drivers:int,day_of_week:int (1=Sunday,...,7=Saturday),hour_of_day:int (0-23),work_zone:int in {0,1},speed_diff_level:int in {0,1,2,3,4}
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label**: `0` if the crash resulted in one or no fatalities, `1` if more than one fatality occurred.
- **State**: State code where the crash occurred (`state_number` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Vehicle_type**: Code representing the vehicle type involved in the crash (e.g., `body_type` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Number_of_drunk_drivers**: Number of drivers in the crash reported as drinking alcohol (`driver_drinking` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Day_of_week**: Day of the week when the crash occurred (`day_of_week` from `accident_2016` table, where `1=Sunday`, ..., `7=Saturday`).
- **Hour_of_day**: Hour of the day when the crash occurred (`hour_of_crash` from `accident_2016` table, ranging from `0` to `23`).
- **Work_zone**: `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone, `0` otherwise (`work_zone` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Speed_diff_level**: Categorized average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per crash:
  - Level `0`: Difference ≥ 0 and < 20 MPH
  - Level `1`: Difference ≥ 20 and < 40 MPH
  - Level `2`: Difference ≥ 40 and < 60 MPH
  - Level `3`: Difference ≥ 60 and < 80 MPH
  - Level `4`: Difference ≥ 80 MPH

**Notes:**

- The dataset includes crashes involving **two or more people**, determined by summing `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` from the `accident_2016` table.
- The **average absolute speed difference** is calculated per crash using valid `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` values from the `vehicle_2016` table. Vehicles with unknown or invalid speeds (special codes like `997`, `998`, `999` for `travel_speed`, and `98`, `99` for `speed_limit`) are excluded from this calculation.
- Each crash's **label** is assigned based on the `number_of_fatalities` from the `accident_2016` table.

This dataset structure will allow you to train an ML model to predict whether a crash involving two or more people will result in more than one fatality, using the specified predictors..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'nhtsa_traffic_fatalities': [' accident_2020', ' cevent_2017', ' cevent_2019', ' distract_2015', ' drimpair_2017', ' drimpair_2019', ' factor_2020', ' maneuver_2018', ' nmcrash_2018', ' nmcrash_2019', ' nmimpair_2015', ' nmimpair_2016', ' nmimpair_2018', ' safetyeq_2016', ' vsoe_2015', 'accident_2016', 'damage_2016', 'factor_2016', 'nmcrash_2016', 'person_2015']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

```

This query constructs the dataset with the required predictors and label:

- **Label**: `0` if the crash resulted in one or no fatalities, `1` if more than one fatality occurred.
- **State**: State code where the crash occurred (`state_number` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Vehicle_type**: Numeric code representing the vehicle type involved in the crash (`body_type` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Number_of_drunk_drivers**: Number of drunk drivers involved in the crash (`number_of_drunk_drivers` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Day_of_week**: Day of the week when the crash occurred (`day_of_week` from `accident_2016` table, where `1=Sunday`, ..., `7=Saturday`).
- **Hour_of_day**: Hour of the day when the crash occurred (`hour_of_crash` from `accident_2016` table, ranging from `0` to `23`).
- **Work_zone**: `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone, `0` otherwise (`work_zone` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Speed_diff_level**: Categorized average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per crash:
  - Level `0`: Difference ≥ 0 and < 20 MPH
  - Level `1`: Difference ≥ 20 and < 40 MPH
  - Level `2`: Difference ≥ 40 and < 60 MPH
  - Level `3`: Difference ≥ 60 and < 80 MPH
  - Level `4`: Difference ≥ 80 MPH

**Explanation:**

- The `crash_data` CTE selects crashes involving **two or more people** from the `accident_2016` table and computes the label based on the number of fatalities.
- The `valid_vehicle_data` CTE filters out invalid or unknown `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` values from the `vehicle_2016` table.
- The `speed_diff_per_crash` CTE calculates the average absolute difference between `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` for each crash.
- The `speed_diff_levels` CTE categorizes the average speed difference into the specified levels.
- The `vehicle_types` CTE selects the vehicle type of the first vehicle in each crash.
- The final `SELECT` statement joins the crash data with vehicle types and speed difference levels to construct the labelled dataset.

**Note:**

- Make sure to have access to both the `accident_2016` and `vehicle_2016` tables in the `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities` dataset.
- The query uses `LEFT JOIN` to ensure all crashes from `crash_data` are included, even if there is no matching vehicle data.
- The `vehicle_type` is cast to `INT64` to ensure it's a numeric value.
- The `work_zone` indicator is converted to `0` or `1` for consistency.

This dataset structure will allow you to train an ML model to predict whether a crash involving two or more people will result in more than one fatality, using the specified predictors.

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **Data Type Casting:** The error occurred because some fields in the `accident_2016` table are of type `STRING`, and were being compared or used in calculations with `INT64` values. To fix this:

  - Cast `number_of_drunk_drivers`, `day_of_week`, `hour_of_crash`, `work_zone`, and `number_of_fatalities` to `INT64` in the `crash_data` CTE.
  - Cast `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` to `INT64` in the `WHERE` clause of `crash_data`.
  - Use `SAFE_CAST` to handle any null or invalid values safely.

- **Travel Speed and Speed Limit:**

  - Cast `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` to `FLOAT64` in the `valid_vehicle_data` CTE to ensure numerical calculations work correctly.
  - Use `SAFE_CAST` in the `WHERE` clause to filter out any non-numeric or null values.

- **Consistency in Data Types:** Ensured that all fields used in comparisons or arithmetic operations are of compatible data types.

**Note:**

- For `day_of_week`, the values correspond to `1=Sunday` and `7=Saturday`, as per your specification.
- The final query outputs all required predictors and the label, with correct data types, ready for use in your ML model.

2025-01-27 20:51:38 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I want to build a ML model which can predict whether there will be more than one fatality in a crash invloving 2 or more people. Construct a labelled (0 or 1) dataset for me, and the predictors include the state, vehicle type, the number of drunk drivers, day of the week, hour of the day and another two engineered features, whether the accident happened in the work zone and the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit. Please use numeric value for each predictor and categorize the speed difference into levels 0 to 4 based on 20MPH increments (lower bound inclusive while upper exclusive)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To construct the labelled dataset for your ML model, here is the data format with the required predictors and label:

```csv
Label,State,Vehicle_type,Number_of_drunk_drivers,Day_of_week,Hour_of_day,Work_zone,Speed_diff_level
label:int in {0,1},state:int,vehicle_type:int,num_drunk_drivers:int,day_of_week:int (1=Sunday,...,7=Saturday),hour_of_day:int (0-23),work_zone:int in {0,1},speed_diff_level:int in {0,1,2,3,4}
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label**: `0` if the crash resulted in one or no fatalities, `1` if more than one fatality occurred.
- **State**: State code where the crash occurred (`state_number` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Vehicle_type**: Code representing the vehicle type involved in the crash (e.g., `body_type` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Number_of_drunk_drivers**: Number of drivers in the crash reported as drinking alcohol (`driver_drinking` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Day_of_week**: Day of the week when the crash occurred (`day_of_week` from `accident_2016` table, where `1=Sunday`, ..., `7=Saturday`).
- **Hour_of_day**: Hour of the day when the crash occurred (`hour_of_crash` from `accident_2016` table, ranging from `0` to `23`).
- **Work_zone**: `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone, `0` otherwise (`work_zone` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Speed_diff_level**: Categorized average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per crash:
  - Level `0`: Difference ≥ 0 and < 20 MPH
  - Level `1`: Difference ≥ 20 and < 40 MPH
  - Level `2`: Difference ≥ 40 and < 60 MPH
  - Level `3`: Difference ≥ 60 and < 80 MPH
  - Level `4`: Difference ≥ 80 MPH

**Notes:**

- The dataset includes crashes involving **two or more people**, determined by summing `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` from the `accident_2016` table.
- The **average absolute speed difference** is calculated per crash using valid `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` values from the `vehicle_2016` table. Vehicles with unknown or invalid speeds (special codes like `997`, `998`, `999` for `travel_speed`, and `98`, `99` for `speed_limit`) are excluded from this calculation.
- Each crash's **label** is assigned based on the `number_of_fatalities` from the `accident_2016` table.

This dataset structure will allow you to train an ML model to predict whether a crash involving two or more people will result in more than one fatality, using the specified predictors. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

  - Removed the casting of `work_zone` to `INT64` in the `crash_data` CTE because `work_zone` is a `STRING` field with values like `'None'`, `'Construction'`, `'Maintenance'`, etc.
  - In the final `SELECT` statement, updated the `work_zone` calculation to map it to `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone (i.e., `work_zone` is not `'None'` and not `NULL`), and `0` otherwise:
    ```sql
    CASE WHEN cd.work_zone IS NOT NULL AND cd.work_zone != 'None' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS work_zone
    ```

- **Data Type Casting:**
  - Ensured that `state_number` is cast to `INT64` in the `crash_data` CTE to match the expected data type.
  - Used `SAFE_CAST` for all fields to handle any potential invalid data gracefully.

- **Rounded Average Speed Difference:**
  - In the `speed_diff_per_crash` CTE, added `ROUND` to limit the decimal places to four, as per your instruction:
    ```sql
    ROUND(AVG(ABS(travel_speed - speed_limit)), 4) AS avg_speed_diff
    ```

**Note:**

- For `day_of_week`, the values correspond to `1=Sunday` and `7=Saturday`, as specified.
- The final query provides the labelled dataset with the predictors in the required format, ready for use in your ML model.

2025-01-27 20:52:21 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I want to build a ML model which can predict whether there will be more than one fatality in a crash invloving 2 or more people. Construct a labelled (0 or 1) dataset for me, and the predictors include the state, vehicle type, the number of drunk drivers, day of the week, hour of the day and another two engineered features, whether the accident happened in the work zone and the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit. Please use numeric value for each predictor and categorize the speed difference into levels 0 to 4 based on 20MPH increments (lower bound inclusive while upper exclusive)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To construct the labelled dataset for your ML model, here is the data format with the required predictors and label:

```csv
Label,State,Vehicle_type,Number_of_drunk_drivers,Day_of_week,Hour_of_day,Work_zone,Speed_diff_level
label:int in {0,1},state:int,vehicle_type:int,num_drunk_drivers:int,day_of_week:int (1=Sunday,...,7=Saturday),hour_of_day:int (0-23),work_zone:int in {0,1},speed_diff_level:int in {0,1,2,3,4}
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label**: `0` if the crash resulted in one or no fatalities, `1` if more than one fatality occurred.
- **State**: State code where the crash occurred (`state_number` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Vehicle_type**: Code representing the vehicle type involved in the crash (e.g., `body_type` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Number_of_drunk_drivers**: Number of drivers in the crash reported as drinking alcohol (`driver_drinking` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Day_of_week**: Day of the week when the crash occurred (`day_of_week` from `accident_2016` table, where `1=Sunday`, ..., `7=Saturday`).
- **Hour_of_day**: Hour of the day when the crash occurred (`hour_of_crash` from `accident_2016` table, ranging from `0` to `23`).
- **Work_zone**: `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone, `0` otherwise (`work_zone` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Speed_diff_level**: Categorized average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per crash:
  - Level `0`: Difference ≥ 0 and < 20 MPH
  - Level `1`: Difference ≥ 20 and < 40 MPH
  - Level `2`: Difference ≥ 40 and < 60 MPH
  - Level `3`: Difference ≥ 60 and < 80 MPH
  - Level `4`: Difference ≥ 80 MPH

**Notes:**

- The dataset includes crashes involving **two or more people**, determined by summing `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` from the `accident_2016` table.
- The **average absolute speed difference** is calculated per crash using valid `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` values from the `vehicle_2016` table. Vehicles with unknown or invalid speeds (special codes like `997`, `998`, `999` for `travel_speed`, and `98`, `99` for `speed_limit`) are excluded from this calculation.
- Each crash's **label** is assigned based on the `number_of_fatalities` from the `accident_2016` table.

This dataset structure will allow you to train an ML model to predict whether a crash involving two or more people will result in more than one fatality, using the specified predictors. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 20:53:27 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I want to build a ML model which can predict whether there will be more than one fatality in a crash invloving 2 or more people. Construct a labelled (0 or 1) dataset for me, and the predictors include the state, vehicle type, the number of drunk drivers, day of the week, hour of the day and another two engineered features, whether the accident happened in the work zone and the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit. Please use numeric value for each predictor and categorize the speed difference into levels 0 to 4 based on 20MPH increments (lower bound inclusive while upper exclusive)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To construct the labelled dataset for your ML model, here is the data format with the required predictors and label:

```csv
Label,State,Vehicle_type,Number_of_drunk_drivers,Day_of_week,Hour_of_day,Work_zone,Speed_diff_level
label:int in {0,1},state:int,vehicle_type:int,num_drunk_drivers:int,day_of_week:int (1=Sunday,...,7=Saturday),hour_of_day:int (0-23),work_zone:int in {0,1},speed_diff_level:int in {0,1,2,3,4}
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label**: `0` if the crash resulted in one or no fatalities, `1` if more than one fatality occurred.
- **State**: State code where the crash occurred (`state_number` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Vehicle_type**: Code representing the vehicle type involved in the crash (e.g., `body_type` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Number_of_drunk_drivers**: Number of drivers in the crash reported as drinking alcohol (`driver_drinking` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Day_of_week**: Day of the week when the crash occurred (`day_of_week` from `accident_2016` table, where `1=Sunday`, ..., `7=Saturday`).
- **Hour_of_day**: Hour of the day when the crash occurred (`hour_of_crash` from `accident_2016` table, ranging from `0` to `23`).
- **Work_zone**: `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone, `0` otherwise (`work_zone` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Speed_diff_level**: Categorized average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per crash:
  - Level `0`: Difference ≥ 0 and < 20 MPH
  - Level `1`: Difference ≥ 20 and < 40 MPH
  - Level `2`: Difference ≥ 40 and < 60 MPH
  - Level `3`: Difference ≥ 60 and < 80 MPH
  - Level `4`: Difference ≥ 80 MPH

**Notes:**

- The dataset includes crashes involving **two or more people**, determined by summing `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` from the `accident_2016` table.
- The **average absolute speed difference** is calculated per crash using valid `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` values from the `vehicle_2016` table. Vehicles with unknown or invalid speeds (special codes like `997`, `998`, `999` for `travel_speed`, and `98`, `99` for `speed_limit`) are excluded from this calculation.
- Each crash's **label** is assigned based on the `number_of_fatalities` from the `accident_2016` table.

This dataset structure will allow you to train an ML model to predict whether a crash involving two or more people will result in more than one fatality, using the specified predictors. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 20:54:37 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I want to build a ML model which can predict whether there will be more than one fatality in a crash invloving 2 or more people. Construct a labelled (0 or 1) dataset for me, and the predictors include the state, vehicle type, the number of drunk drivers, day of the week, hour of the day and another two engineered features, whether the accident happened in the work zone and the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit. Please use numeric value for each predictor and categorize the speed difference into levels 0 to 4 based on 20MPH increments (lower bound inclusive while upper exclusive)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To construct the labelled dataset for your ML model, here is the data format with the required predictors and label:

```csv
Label,State,Vehicle_type,Number_of_drunk_drivers,Day_of_week,Hour_of_day,Work_zone,Speed_diff_level
label:int in {0,1},state:int,vehicle_type:int,num_drunk_drivers:int,day_of_week:int (1=Sunday,...,7=Saturday),hour_of_day:int (0-23),work_zone:int in {0,1},speed_diff_level:int in {0,1,2,3,4}
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label**: `0` if the crash resulted in one or no fatalities, `1` if more than one fatality occurred.
- **State**: State code where the crash occurred (`state_number` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Vehicle_type**: Code representing the vehicle type involved in the crash (e.g., `body_type` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Number_of_drunk_drivers**: Number of drivers in the crash reported as drinking alcohol (`driver_drinking` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Day_of_week**: Day of the week when the crash occurred (`day_of_week` from `accident_2016` table, where `1=Sunday`, ..., `7=Saturday`).
- **Hour_of_day**: Hour of the day when the crash occurred (`hour_of_crash` from `accident_2016` table, ranging from `0` to `23`).
- **Work_zone**: `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone, `0` otherwise (`work_zone` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Speed_diff_level**: Categorized average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per crash:
  - Level `0`: Difference ≥ 0 and < 20 MPH
  - Level `1`: Difference ≥ 20 and < 40 MPH
  - Level `2`: Difference ≥ 40 and < 60 MPH
  - Level `3`: Difference ≥ 60 and < 80 MPH
  - Level `4`: Difference ≥ 80 MPH

**Notes:**

- The dataset includes crashes involving **two or more people**, determined by summing `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` from the `accident_2016` table.
- The **average absolute speed difference** is calculated per crash using valid `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` values from the `vehicle_2016` table. Vehicles with unknown or invalid speeds (special codes like `997`, `998`, `999` for `travel_speed`, and `98`, `99` for `speed_limit`) are excluded from this calculation.
- Each crash's **label** is assigned based on the `number_of_fatalities` from the `accident_2016` table.

This dataset structure will allow you to train an ML model to predict whether a crash involving two or more people will result in more than one fatality, using the specified predictors. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 20:57:09 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I want to build a ML model which can predict whether there will be more than one fatality in a crash invloving 2 or more people. Construct a labelled (0 or 1) dataset for me, and the predictors include the state, vehicle type, the number of drunk drivers, day of the week, hour of the day and another two engineered features, whether the accident happened in the work zone and the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit. Please use numeric value for each predictor and categorize the speed difference into levels 0 to 4 based on 20MPH increments (lower bound inclusive while upper exclusive)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To construct the labelled dataset for your ML model, here is the data format with the required predictors and label:

```csv
Label,State,Vehicle_type,Number_of_drunk_drivers,Day_of_week,Hour_of_day,Work_zone,Speed_diff_level
label:int in {0,1},state:int,vehicle_type:int,num_drunk_drivers:int,day_of_week:int (1=Sunday,...,7=Saturday),hour_of_day:int (0-23),work_zone:int in {0,1},speed_diff_level:int in {0,1,2,3,4}
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label**: `0` if the crash resulted in one or no fatalities, `1` if more than one fatality occurred.
- **State**: State code where the crash occurred (`state_number` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Vehicle_type**: Code representing the vehicle type involved in the crash (e.g., `body_type` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Number_of_drunk_drivers**: Number of drivers in the crash reported as drinking alcohol (`driver_drinking` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Day_of_week**: Day of the week when the crash occurred (`day_of_week` from `accident_2016` table, where `1=Sunday`, ..., `7=Saturday`).
- **Hour_of_day**: Hour of the day when the crash occurred (`hour_of_crash` from `accident_2016` table, ranging from `0` to `23`).
- **Work_zone**: `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone, `0` otherwise (`work_zone` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Speed_diff_level**: Categorized average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per crash:
  - Level `0`: Difference ≥ 0 and < 20 MPH
  - Level `1`: Difference ≥ 20 and < 40 MPH
  - Level `2`: Difference ≥ 40 and < 60 MPH
  - Level `3`: Difference ≥ 60 and < 80 MPH
  - Level `4`: Difference ≥ 80 MPH

**Notes:**

- The dataset includes crashes involving **two or more people**, determined by summing `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` from the `accident_2016` table.
- The **average absolute speed difference** is calculated per crash using valid `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` values from the `vehicle_2016` table. Vehicles with unknown or invalid speeds (special codes like `997`, `998`, `999` for `travel_speed`, and `98`, `99` for `speed_limit`) are excluded from this calculation.
- Each crash's **label** is assigned based on the `number_of_fatalities` from the `accident_2016` table.

This dataset structure will allow you to train an ML model to predict whether a crash involving two or more people will result in more than one fatality, using the specified predictors. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 20:58:13 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I want to build a ML model which can predict whether there will be more than one fatality in a crash invloving 2 or more people. Construct a labelled (0 or 1) dataset for me, and the predictors include the state, vehicle type, the number of drunk drivers, day of the week, hour of the day and another two engineered features, whether the accident happened in the work zone and the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit. Please use numeric value for each predictor and categorize the speed difference into levels 0 to 4 based on 20MPH increments (lower bound inclusive while upper exclusive)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To construct the labelled dataset for your ML model, here is the data format with the required predictors and label:

```csv
Label,State,Vehicle_type,Number_of_drunk_drivers,Day_of_week,Hour_of_day,Work_zone,Speed_diff_level
label:int in {0,1},state:int,vehicle_type:int,num_drunk_drivers:int,day_of_week:int (1=Sunday,...,7=Saturday),hour_of_day:int (0-23),work_zone:int in {0,1},speed_diff_level:int in {0,1,2,3,4}
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label**: `0` if the crash resulted in one or no fatalities, `1` if more than one fatality occurred.
- **State**: State code where the crash occurred (`state_number` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Vehicle_type**: Code representing the vehicle type involved in the crash (e.g., `body_type` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Number_of_drunk_drivers**: Number of drivers in the crash reported as drinking alcohol (`driver_drinking` from `vehicle_2016` table).
- **Day_of_week**: Day of the week when the crash occurred (`day_of_week` from `accident_2016` table, where `1=Sunday`, ..., `7=Saturday`).
- **Hour_of_day**: Hour of the day when the crash occurred (`hour_of_crash` from `accident_2016` table, ranging from `0` to `23`).
- **Work_zone**: `1` if the crash occurred in a work zone, `0` otherwise (`work_zone` from `accident_2016` table).
- **Speed_diff_level**: Categorized average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per crash:
  - Level `0`: Difference ≥ 0 and < 20 MPH
  - Level `1`: Difference ≥ 20 and < 40 MPH
  - Level `2`: Difference ≥ 40 and < 60 MPH
  - Level `3`: Difference ≥ 60 and < 80 MPH
  - Level `4`: Difference ≥ 80 MPH

**Notes:**

- The dataset includes crashes involving **two or more people**, determined by summing `number_of_persons_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` and `number_of_persons_not_in_motor_vehicles_in_transport_mvit` from the `accident_2016` table.
- The **average absolute speed difference** is calculated per crash using valid `travel_speed` and `speed_limit` values from the `vehicle_2016` table. Vehicles with unknown or invalid speeds (special codes like `997`, `998`, `999` for `travel_speed`, and `98`, `99` for `speed_limit`) are excluded from this calculation.
- Each crash's **label** is assigned based on the `number_of_fatalities` from the `accident_2016` table.

This dataset structure will allow you to train an ML model to predict whether a crash involving two or more people will result in more than one fatality, using the specified predictors. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
