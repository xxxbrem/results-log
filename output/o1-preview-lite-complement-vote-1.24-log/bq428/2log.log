15. **Find the average points scored by players in the second period:**

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(total_points) AS average_points
    FROM (
      SELECT `player_id`, SUM(`points_scored`) AS total_points
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
      WHERE `period` = 2 AND `season` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2018
      GROUP BY `player_id`, `game_id`
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

These queries help understand the data and identify the top five team markets based on the number of distinct players who scored at least 15 points during the second period of games between 2010 and 2018. With this information, we can extract the details of each game these teams played in NCAA basketball historical tournament matches during the same period.Query:

Task: For the top five team markets with the highest number of distinct players who scored at least 15 points during the second period of games between 2010 and 2018, provide details of each game they played in NCAA basketball historical tournament matches during the same period, as specified in the data model document.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the top five team markets, we counted the number of distinct players who scored at least 15 points during the second period of games between 2010 and 2018. We then provided details of each game these teams played in NCAA basketball historical tournament matches during that period.

```csv
season,game_date,team_market,team_name,opponent_market,opponent_name,win_pts,lose_pts,num_ot
season:int,game_date:date,team_market:str,team_name:str,opponent_market:str,opponent_name:str,win_pts:int,lose_pts:int,num_ot:int
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 01:06:48 - root - INFO - To determine the top five team markets, we counted the number of distinct players who scored at least 15 points during the second period of games between 2010 and 2018. We then provided details of each game these teams played in NCAA basketball historical tournament matches during that period.
