**Explanation:**

- **Handling Empty or Null Values:**

  - Used `COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(column), ''), 'Fallback Value')` to handle cases where `column` might be empty strings or null.
  - For `win_market` and `lose_market`, if they are empty or null, we fall back to `win_school_ncaa` or `lose_school_ncaa`. If those are also null, we use `'Unknown'`.

- **Ensuring Non-Null Values in Conditions:**

  - Removed explicit `IS NOT NULL` checks since `COALESCE` will ensure a non-null value.
  - This handles situations where columns might be empty, ensuring our conditions are robust against missing data.

- **Subqueries for Top Five Team Markets:**

  - In the subqueries to get the top five team markets, ensured that `team_market` is handled similarly with `COALESCE` to account for empty or null values.
  - This ensures that teams with missing `team_market` values are included appropriately as `'Unknown'` or excluded based on the context.

- **Overall Structure:**

  - The query selects tournament game details (`season`, `game_date`, `win_team_market`, etc.) for games where either the winning or losing team is among the top five teams with the highest number of distinct players who scored at least 15 points during the second period between 2010 and 2018.
  - Adjustments have been made to handle empty or null values in the relevant team market columns.

**Note:**

- By properly handling empty or null values, this query should now return more complete and accurate results, even when some columns have missing data.
- Ensure that when you run this query, you replace any placeholder values and double-check column names and table references based on the actual schema.

Task: For the top five team markets with the highest number of distinct players who scored at least 15 points during the second period of games between 2010 and 2018, provide details of each game they played in NCAA basketball historical tournament matches during the same period, as specified in the data model document.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the top five team markets, we counted the number of distinct players who scored at least 15 points during the second period of games between 2010 and 2018. We then provided details of each game these teams played in NCAA basketball historical tournament matches during that period.

```csv
season,game_date,team_market,team_name,opponent_market,opponent_name,win_pts,lose_pts,num_ot
season:int,game_date:date,team_market:str,team_name:str,opponent_market:str,opponent_name:str,win_pts:int,lose_pts:int,num_ot:int
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the top five team markets, we counted the number of distinct players who scored at least 15 points during the second period of games between 2010 and 2018. We then provided details of each game these teams played in NCAA basketball historical tournament matches during that period.

2025-01-27 01:14:07 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For the top five team markets with the highest number of distinct players who scored at least 15 points during the second period of games between 2010 and 2018, provide details of each game they played in NCAA basketball historical tournament matches during the same period, as specified in the data model document., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the top five team markets, we counted the number of distinct players who scored at least 15 points during the second period of games between 2010 and 2018. We then provided details of each game these teams played in NCAA basketball historical tournament matches during that period.
