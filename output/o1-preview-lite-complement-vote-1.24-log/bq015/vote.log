After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here is the reasoning:

### Comparison and Reasoning

1. **Inclusiveness of Data:**

   - **`1result.sql`** filters Hacker News posts to include only those of type `'story'`. This excludes comments and other post types that might also contain links to Stack Overflow questions.
   - **`2result.sql`** does not restrict the `type` of Hacker News posts, potentially including all posts (`'story'`, `'comment'`, etc.) that link to Stack Overflow questions. This aligns better with the task, which is to find all mentions of Stack Overflow questions on Hacker News since 2014, regardless of post type.

2. **Regular Expression Precision:**

   - **`1result.sql`** uses `REGEXP_EXTRACT(url, r'questions/(\d+)/')`, which might miss URLs due to variations in URL patterns (e.g., missing trailing slashes or additional query parameters).
   - **`2result.sql`** uses `REGEXP_EXTRACT(url, r'stackoverflow\.com/questions/([0-9]+)')`, which is more precise in capturing question IDs from URLs, ensuring that all relevant Stack Overflow question links are considered.

3. **Result Differences:**

   - In **`1result.csv`**, the top tags are:

     ```
     Tag,Count
     javascript,10
     python,6
     clojure,5
     regex,4
     c,4
     functional-programming,3
     go,3
     haskell,3
     language-agnostic,3
     rust,3
     ```

   - In **`2result.csv`**, the top tags are:

     ```
     tag,Count
     javascript,10
     python,6
     clojure,5
     regex,4
     c,4
     rust,3
     go,3
     language-agnostic,3
     git,3
     haskell,3
     ```

   - The inclusion of the `'git'` tag in **`2result.csv`** suggests that **`2result.sql`** captures a broader set of data, which is important for accurately ranking the most discussed tags.

4. **Alignment with the Task:**

   - The task specifies ranking the top 10 most discussed tags on Stack Overflow questions mentioned on Hacker News since 2014.
   - **`2result.sql`** provides a more comprehensive dataset by including all post types and using a precise regex, leading to a more accurate ranking of the most discussed tags.

### Conclusion

**`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query because it better aligns with the task requirements by:

- Including all relevant Hacker News posts (not just `'story'` types).
- Using a precise regular expression to extract question IDs.
- Providing a more accurate and comprehensive set of results for the top 10 most discussed tags.
