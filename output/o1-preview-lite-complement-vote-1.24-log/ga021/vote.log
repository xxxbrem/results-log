After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct choice for calculating the retention rate as specified.

**Reasoning:**

- **Retention Window Accuracy:** `0result.sql` correctly calculates the retention rate for users who returned between 14 and 21 days after their initial quickplay event, aligning precisely with "two weeks after their initial quickplay event."

- **Data Range Coverage:** It considers initial events between July 2, 2018, and July 16, 2018, and checks for user activity in the subsequent period up to August 6, 2018, which covers the required retention window.

- **Event Type Separation:** The query calculates retention separately for each quickplay event type by grouping on `quickplay_event_type`, fulfilling the requirement to calculate retention rates per event type.

- **Correct Logic Implementation:** It uses a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure all users are accounted for, including those who did not return, and employs `CASE` with `COUNTIF` to accurately mark users as retained or not.

- **Result Consistency:** The retention rates produced are reasonable and consistent with expected user behavior patterns, enhancing the credibility of the query.
