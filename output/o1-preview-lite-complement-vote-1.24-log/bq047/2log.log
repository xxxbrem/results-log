    GROUP BY complaint_date, complaint_type
    ORDER BY complaint_date
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

19. **Check available data for the station IDs found (validate station IDs):**
    ```sql
    SELECT stn, year, mo, da, temp
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2008`
    WHERE stn IN ('725030', '744860')  -- Replace with actual station IDs
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

20. **Retrieve the list of station names and their IDs for all stations in New York:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT usaf, wban, name, lat, lon
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
    WHERE country = 'US' AND state = 'NY'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Note:** In the above queries, please replace `'725030'` and `'744860'` with the actual station IDs for LaGuardia and JFK airports found from queries 1 and 2.

These queries collectively help in:

- Identifying the relevant weather stations for LaGuardia and JFK airports.
- Extracting temperature data for these stations over the desired time period.
- Retrieving and analyzing complaint data near these airports.
- Preparing the necessary data to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficients between temperature and complaint counts.Query:

Task: Could you help me analyze the relationship between each complaint type and daily temperature in New York city, focusing on data in airports LaGuardia and JFK over the 10 years starting from 2008? Calculate the total complaint count, the total day count, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (rounded to 4 decimals) between temperature and both the count and percentage of each common (>5000 occurrences) and strongly correlated (absolute value > 0.5) complaint type.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Complaint_Type,Total_Complaint_Count,Total_Day_Count,Pearson_Correlation_Count,Pearson_Correlation_Percentage
```

**Explanation:**

The table above is designed to present the analysis of the relationship between each complaint type and daily temperature in New York City, focusing on data from LaGuardia and JFK airports over the 10 years starting from 2008. For each complaint type that is both common (with more than 5,000 occurrences) and strongly correlated with temperature (absolute correlation coefficient greater than 0.5), the table includes:

- **Complaint_Type**: The specific type of complaint reported.
- **Total_Complaint_Count**: The total number of complaints recorded for that type over the 10-year period.
- **Total_Day_Count**: The total number of days on which complaints of that type were recorded.
- **Pearson_Correlation_Count**: The Pearson correlation coefficient (rounded to 4 decimals) between daily temperature and the daily count of complaints for that type.
- **Pearson_Correlation_Percentage**: The Pearson correlation coefficient (rounded to 4 decimals) between daily temperature and the percentage of that complaint type relative to total complaints each day.

This analysis helps identify which types of complaints are influenced by temperature variations, providing insights into how weather conditions impact public concerns in areas surrounding LaGuardia and JFK airports..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

**Explanation:**

The table above is designed to present the analysis of the relationship between each complaint type and daily temperature in New York City, focusing on data from LaGuardia and JFK airports over the 10 years starting from 2008. For each complaint type that is both common (with more than 5,000 occurrences) and strongly correlated with temperature (absolute correlation coefficient greater than 0.5), the table includes:

- **Complaint_Type**: The specific type of complaint reported.
- **Total_Complaint_Count**: The total number of complaints recorded for that type over the 10-year period.
- **Total_Day_Count**: The total number of days on which complaints of that type were recorded.
- **Pearson_Correlation_Count**: The Pearson correlation coefficient (rounded to 4 decimals) between daily temperature and the daily count of complaints for that type.
- **Pearson_Correlation_Percentage**: The Pearson correlation coefficient (rounded to 4 decimals) between daily temperature and the percentage of that complaint type relative to total complaints each day.

This analysis helps identify which types of complaints are influenced by temperature variations, providing insights into how weather conditions impact public concerns in areas surrounding LaGuardia and JFK airports. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
