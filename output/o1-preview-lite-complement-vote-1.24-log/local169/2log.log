2025-01-25 09:50:25 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-25 09:50:25 - root - INFO - It appears that there's a minor syntax error in your SQL query due to a mismatched quotation mark. Specifically, in your subquery, the closing quotation mark for the date `'1999-12-31"` is a double quote (`"`) instead of a single quote (`'`).

Here's the problematic part of your query:

```sql
AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31"
```

**Correction:**

Ensure that both quotation marks around the date are single quotes. The corrected line should be:

```sql
AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31'
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "id_bioguide", "term_number", "term_start", "term_end" 
FROM "legislators_terms" 
WHERE "id_bioguide" IN (
  SELECT "id_bioguide" 
  FROM "legislators_terms" 
  WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
    AND "term_number" = 1 
    AND "term_start" >= '1917-01-01' 
    AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31'
) 
ORDER BY "id_bioguide", "term_number" 
LIMIT 100;
```

With this correction, your query should execute without the error.

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks:** Always ensure that the opening and closing quotation marks match. In SQL, string literals are enclosed in single quotes (`'...'`).
- **Date Comparison:** The corrected condition now properly compares the `"term_start"` date to `'1999-12-31'`.

**Additional Tip:**

It's good practice to consistently use single quotes for string and date literals in SQL to avoid such errors.

2025-01-25 09:51:03 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-25 09:51:03 - root - INFO - It appears that the syntax error in your SQL query is due to unmatched quotation marks in your date string within the subquery. Specifically, the date `'1999-12-31"` has mismatched quotation marks.

**Problematic Part of Your Query:**

```sql
AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31"
```

- The opening quote is a single quote `'`, but the closing quote is a double quote `"`.
- This mismatch causes the SQL parser to not recognize the end of the string, leading to a syntax error near `AND`.

**Correction:**

Ensure that both the opening and closing quotes around the date are single quotes `'`. The corrected line should be:

```sql
AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31'
```

**Full Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "id_bioguide", "term_number", "term_start", "term_end" 
FROM "legislators_terms" 
WHERE "id_bioguide" IN (
  SELECT "id_bioguide" 
  FROM "legislators_terms" 
  WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
    AND "term_number" = 1 
    AND "term_start" >= '1917-01-01' 
    AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31'
) 
ORDER BY "id_bioguide", "term_number" 
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks:** In SQL, string and date literals should be enclosed in matching single quotes `'...'`. Mismatched quotes can lead to the parser misinterpreting the query.
- **Error Near "AND":** When the closing quote is missing or mismatched, the parser includes the subsequent code as part of the string until it hits an unexpected keyword like `AND`, resulting in the syntax error.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Verify All Quotation Marks:**

   - Double-check all string literals in your query to ensure they have matching single quotes. For example:
     - `'1917-01-01'` is correct.
     - `'1999-12-31'` is correct.
     - `'1999-12-31"` is incorrect.

2. **Check for Other Syntax Errors:**

   - Ensure parentheses `(` and `)` are properly matched.
   - Verify that all column and table names are correctly spelled and, if they contain special characters, are enclosed in double quotes `"..."`.

3. **Copying Code:**

   - Be cautious when copying code from documents or emails, as some formats may alter quotation marks (e.g., converting straight quotes to curly quotes).
   - It's often helpful to type out the quotation marks manually to ensure they're correct.

**Next Steps:**

- Try running the corrected query above.
- If you encounter any more errors, please share the exact error message so I can assist you further.

**Example Execution:**

Assuming the corrected query is executed successfully, it should return the `id_bioguide`, `term_number`, `term_start`, and `term_end` for legislators from Colorado who started their first term between 1917 and 1999, along with their subsequent terms, up to the first 100 records.

2025-01-25 09:51:31 - root - INFO - It appears that your SQL query has a syntax error due to mismatched quotation marks around the date `'1999-12-31"`. This causes the SQL parser to misinterpret the string, leading to the error near `AND`.

**Problematic Part of Your Query:**

```sql
AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31"
```

Here, the opening quote is a single quote `'`, but the closing quote is a double quote `"`. This mismatch causes the SQL engine to not recognize the end of the string literal.

---

**Correction:**

Ensure that both the opening and closing quotes around the date are **single quotes** `'`. The corrected line should be:

```sql
AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31'
```

---

**Full Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "id_bioguide", "term_number", "term_start", "term_end" 
FROM "legislators_terms" 
WHERE "id_bioguide" IN (
  SELECT "id_bioguide" 
  FROM "legislators_terms" 
  WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
    AND "term_number" = 1 
    AND "term_start" >= '1917-01-01' 
    AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31'
) 
ORDER BY "id_bioguide", "term_number" 
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks:** In SQL, string and date literals should be enclosed in **matching single quotes** `'...'`. Mismatched or incorrect quotation marks can lead to syntax errors because the SQL parser cannot properly identify the beginning and end of the string.
  
- **Error Message:** The error `near "AND": syntax error` occurs because the SQL engine is expecting a closing single quote for the string starting with `'1999-12-31`, but encounters `AND` instead. This confuses the parser, resulting in the syntax error.

---

**Tips to Avoid This Error:**

1. **Consistent Use of Quotes:**
   - Always use single quotes `'` for string and date literals in SQL.
   - Use double quotes `"` for identifiers (like column and table names) if necessary (e.g., if they contain spaces or are reserved words).

2. **Be Cautious with Copy-Paste:**
   - When copying SQL queries from documents, emails, or PDFs, be aware that quotation marks may be altered (e.g., converted to curly quotes `‘` or `’`).
   - It's often best to retype the quotation marks to ensure they are correctly recognized by the SQL engine.

3. **Validate Your Query Syntax:**
   - Before running the query, quickly scan your code to check for matching quotes and parentheses.
   - Many SQL editors highlight matching quotes and can help you spot mismatches.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Copy and Paste Carefully:**
  - Copy the corrected query above into your SQL editor.
  - Ensure that all quotation marks are straight single quotes `'` and not curly or mismatched quotes.

- **Run the Corrected Query:**
  - Execute the corrected query.
  - It should now run without the syntax error and return the desired results.

---

**If You Still Encounter Errors:**

- **Double-Check Quotations:**
  - Verify that there are no other mismatched quotes in the query.

- **Check for Hidden Characters:**
  - Sometimes invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces) can cause issues. Deleting and retyping the affected lines can help.

- **Copy the Query Directly:**
  - To avoid formatting issues, type the query directly into your SQL editor rather than copying it.

---

**Assistance with the Task:**

Once the syntax error is resolved, the query will:

- Retrieve all terms served by Colorado legislators who started their **first term** between **1917 and 1999**.
- This data can then be used to calculate the **annual retention rate** by analyzing how many legislators continued to serve in subsequent terms over a period of up to **20 years**.

---

**Sample Data Retrieval:**

- You will get a list of `id_bioguide`, `term_number`, `term_start`, and `term_end` for each term served by the selected legislators.
- Use this data to determine how many legislators from the initial cohort remained in office each subsequent year.

1. **Copy the Corrected Query:**

   Ensure you copy the corrected query exactly as shown, paying special attention to the quotation marks.

   ```sql
   SELECT "id_bioguide" 
       FROM "legislators_terms" 
       WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
       GROUP BY "id_bioguide" 
       HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 
       LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Run the Query:**

   - Paste the corrected query into your SQL editor or command-line interface.
   - Execute the query.

3. **Verify Results:**

   - The query should now run without syntax errors.
   - It will return the `id_bioguide` of Colorado legislators who have served more than one term.

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Beware of Copy-Paste Issues:**

  - When copying queries from documents or chat interfaces, quotation marks may sometimes be altered.
  - It's a good practice to retype quotation marks to ensure they're correctly recognized by your SQL environment.

- **Consistent Use of Quotation Marks:**

  - Always use **single quotes** for string literals in SQL.
  - Use **double quotes** for identifiers if necessary.

- **Check for Other Potential Errors:**

  - Ensure that all parentheses `(` and `)` are properly matched.
  - Verify that all column and table names are correctly spelled and quoted if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

From **"legislators_terms"**:

- `"id_bioguide"`: Unique identifier for each legislator; used to track legislators across terms.
- `"term_number"`: Indicates the sequence of terms; used to identify legislators in their first term (`"term_number" = 1`).
- `"term_start"`: Start date of a term; used to select legislators who started between 1917 and 1999.
- `"term_end"`: End date of a term; used to determine when a legislator's service ended.
- `"state"`: State abbreviation; used to filter for Colorado legislators (`"state" = 'CO'`).
- `"party"`: Political party; may be useful for additional analysis.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `"state" = 'CO'` to select legislators from Colorado.
- `"term_number" = 1` to select legislators starting their first term.
- `"term_start" >= '1917-01-01' AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31'` to select those who began between 1917 and 1999.
- Dates and durations to calculate retention up to 20 years later.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List all states represented in the dataset:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "state" FROM "legislators_terms" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find all unique term numbers (to understand term sequencing):**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "term_number" FROM "legislators_terms" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve term details for Colorado legislators:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id_bioguide", "term_number", "term_start", "term_end" 
   FROM "legislators_terms" 
   WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Identify Colorado legislators who started their first term between 1917 and 1999:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id_bioguide", "term_start", "term_end" 
   FROM "legislators_terms" 
   WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
     AND "term_number" = 1 
     AND "term_start" >= '1917-01-01' 
     AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31' 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Check the different term types (e.g., Senate or House):**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "term_type" FROM "legislators_terms" LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find the total number of terms served by each Colorado legislator:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id_bioguide", COUNT(*) AS "total_terms" 
   FROM "legislators_terms" 
   WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
   GROUP BY "id_bioguide" 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get the party affiliations of Colorado legislators:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "party" FROM "legislators_terms" WHERE "state" = 'CO' LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List term start years for first-term Colorado legislators between 1917 and 1999:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTR("term_start", 1, 4) AS "start_year" 
   FROM "legislators_terms" 
   WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
     AND "term_number" = 1 
     AND "term_start" >= '1917-01-01' 
     AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31' 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve full term history of selected legislators (to track retention):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id_bioguide", "term_number", "term_start", "term_end" 
   FROM "legislators_terms" 
   WHERE "id_bioguide" IN (
     SELECT "id_bioguide" 
     FROM "legislators_terms" 
     WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
       AND "term_number" = 1 
       AND "term_start" >= '1917-01-01' 
       AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31"
   ) 
   ORDER BY "id_bioguide", "term_number" 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Determine the number of first-term legislators starting each year in Colorado:**
    ```sql
    SELECT SUBSTR("term_start", 1, 4) AS "start_year", COUNT(*) AS "number_of_legislators" 
    FROM "legislators_terms" 
    WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
      AND "term_number" = 1 
      AND "term_start" >= '1917-01-01' 
      AND "term_start" <= '1999-12-31' 
    GROUP BY "start_year" 
    ORDER BY "start_year" 
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Find legislators who served more than one term (indicating retention):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "id_bioguide" 
    FROM "legislators_terms" 
    WHERE "state" = 'CO" 
    GROUP BY "id_bioguide" 
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Check the duration of each term for Colorado legislators:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "id_bioguide", "term_number", "term_start", "term_end", 
           JULIANDAY("term_end") - JULIANDAY("term_start") AS "term_duration_days" 
    FROM "legislators_terms" 
    WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List contact information for Colorado legislators (if needed for further analysis):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "id_bioguide", "address", "phone" 
    FROM "legislators_terms" 
    WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Explore the "how" column to understand how legislators entered office (e.g., election, appointment):**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "how" FROM "legislators_terms" LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Get the end dates for terms to help calculate if a legislator was in office after a certain number of years:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "id_bioguide", "term_number", "term_end" 
    FROM "legislators_terms" 
    WHERE "state" = 'CO' 
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the dataset and extracting the necessary information to calculate the annual retention rates for Colorado legislators who started their first term between 1917 and 1999, tracked up to 20 years later.Query:

Task: What is the annual retention rate for Colorado legislators who started their first term between 1917 and 1999, tracked up to 20 years later?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Retention_Rate
year:int,rate:0<=float<=100

The table displays the annual retention rate for Colorado legislators who began their first term between 1917 and 1999, tracked for up to 20 years. Each row represents a year, and the retention rate is the percentage of the original cohort still serving in office during that year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 09:53:34 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the annual retention rate for Colorado legislators who started their first term between 1917 and 1999, tracked up to 20 years later?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Retention_Rate
year:int,rate:0<=float<=100
...
```

The table displays the annual retention rate for Colorado legislators who began their first term between 1917 and 1999, tracked for up to 20 years. Each row represents a year, and the retention rate is the percentage of the original cohort still serving in office during that year. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
