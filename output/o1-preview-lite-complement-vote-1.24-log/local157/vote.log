After reviewing the provided SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script for the following reasons:

1. **Correct Data Source**: The task specifies to use the *Bitcoin transaction data* from the `"bitcoin_transactions"` table. `1result.sql` correctly utilizes this table to calculate the daily trading volumes.

2. **Computation of Percentage Change**: It accurately calculates the daily percentage change in trading volume by comparing each day's volume with the previous day's volume for each ticker. This includes the calculation for August 1, 2021, by accessing data from July 31, 2021.

3. **Inclusion of Previous Day's Data**: By extending the date range to include `'2021-07-31'`, it ensures that the percentage change for August 1, 2021, is computed. This provides a complete set of percentage changes for all dates in the specified range.

4. **Accurate Date Formatting**: It correctly reformats the `"txn_date"` from `DD-MM-YYYY` to `YYYY-MM-DD`, enabling proper date comparisons and filtering.

5. **Consistent and Accurate Results**: The output in `1result.csv` shows logical and consistent percentage changes that align with the expected fluctuations in trading volumes over the given dates.

In contrast:

- **`0result.sql`** does not calculate the percentage change for August 1, 2021, because it lacks previous day data, leading to a `NULL` value. This results in incomplete analysis for the specified date range.
  
- **`2result.sql`** utilizes the `"bitcoin_prices"` table instead of the required `"bitcoin_transactions"` table. Therefore, it does not align with the task's instructions to use the Bitcoin transaction data. Additionally, it calculates percentage changes based on price data, not transaction volumes from the transactions table.

**Therefore, `1result.sql` is the correct SQL script that fulfills the task requirements.**
