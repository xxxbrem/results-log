2025-01-28 03:50:32 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering an access error when trying to execute your SQL query on the `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` table. The error message indicates that you do not have permission to query this table, or it might not exist.

**Error Message:**

```
403 Access Denied: Table spider2-public-data:1000_genomes.variants: User does not have permission to query table spider2-public-data:1000_genomes.variants, or perhaps it does not exist.
```

**Possible Reasons and Solutions:**

1. **Incorrect Project or Dataset Name:**

   - **Issue:** The project or dataset name might be misspelled or incorrect.
   - **Solution:** Verify that the project, dataset, and table names are correct. For publicly available datasets, the correct project is often `bigquery-public-data`.

   **Try updating your query to use the `bigquery-public-data` project:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `reference_name`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Access Permissions:**

   - **Issue:** The `spider2-public-data` project might not be publicly accessible, or your account lacks the necessary permissions to access it.
   - **Solution:** Use a publicly accessible dataset, such as those in `bigquery-public-data`.

3. **Dataset Availability:**

   - **Issue:** The `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes` dataset might not exist or be deprecated.
   - **Solution:** Use the `1000_genomes` dataset available in `bigquery-public-data`.

4. **Location Mismatch:**

   - **Issue:** Your projectâ€™s data location might not match the dataset's location.
   - **Solution:** Ensure that your BigQuery project is set to the same location as the dataset (`US` in this case).

5. **Account Restrictions:**

   - **Issue:** If you're part of an organization, there might be restrictions on accessing external datasets.
   - **Solution:** Contact your system administrator to adjust your permissions or confirm if access is allowed.

**Next Steps:**

- **Test with the Public Dataset:**

  Update your query to reference the public dataset:

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT `reference_name`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Verify Dataset Access:**

  - Open the BigQuery web console.
  - In the Explorer panel, expand `bigquery-public-data`.
  - Look for the `1000_genomes` dataset and confirm that the `variants` table exists.

- **Check Your Permissions:**

  Ensure that your Google Cloud account has access to `bigquery-public-data`. Most public datasets are freely accessible, but organizational policies can sometimes restrict access.

**Additional Information:**

- **Public Datasets Project:**

  The `bigquery-public-data` project hosts a variety of public datasets that are accessible to all users. Switching to this project often resolves access issues.

- **Location Consistency:**

  BigQuery datasets are location-specific. Your queries and datasets need to be in the same location (`US`, `EU`, etc.).

**Summary:**

The error indicates a permissions issue or a non-existent table in the `spider2-public-data` project. By switching to the `bigquery-public-data` project, you should be able to access the `1000_genomes` dataset and proceed with your queries.

**Revised Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `reference_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
LIMIT 100;
```

**Please try this updated query and let me know if you continue to encounter any issues or need further assistance.**
2025-01-28 03:50:56 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-28 03:50:56 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering access issues when trying to query the `1000_genomes` dataset. Let's work through this step by step to identify the cause and find a solution.

**Possible Reasons and Solutions:**

1. **Dataset Location and Accessibility:**

   - **Issue:** The `1000_genomes` dataset may not be available in the `bigquery-public-data` project or may have restricted access.
   - **Solution:** Use the `genomics-public-data` project, which hosts several genomic datasets, including `1000_genomes`, and is publicly accessible.

2. **Update Your Query to Use the Correct Project:**

   - **Revised Query:**

     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT `reference_name`
     FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

3. **Verify Dataset Availability:**

   - **Steps:**
     - Open the BigQuery web console.
     - In the Explorer panel, look for the `genomics-public-data` project.
     - Expand the project to see if the `1000_genomes` dataset and the `variants` table are listed.

4. **Check Your Permissions:**

   - **Issue:** Even if the dataset is public, your account may need specific permissions to access it.
   - **Solution:** Ensure that your Google Cloud account has the following IAM roles:
     - **BigQuery Data Viewer**: Grants read access to datasets.
     - **BigQuery User**: Allows running queries against datasets.
   - **How to Check:**
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console IAM page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam).
     - Verify that your user account has the necessary roles.

5. **Test Access with Another Public Dataset:**

   - **Purpose:** Confirm whether the issue is specific to the `1000_genomes` dataset or a broader access problem.
   - **Test Query:**

     ```sql
     SELECT
       name,
       gender,
       COUNT(*) AS name_count
     FROM
       `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013`
     GROUP BY
       name,
       gender
     ORDER BY
       name_count DESC
     LIMIT 10;
     ```

   - **Expected Outcome:** If this query runs successfully, it suggests that public dataset access is generally working, and the issue is specific to the `1000_genomes` dataset.

6. **Verify Project and Dataset Names:**

   - **Ensure Correct Project and Dataset Names:**
     - **Project:** `genomics-public-data`
     - **Dataset:** `1000_genomes`
     - **Table:** `variants`

2025-01-28 03:52:28 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the fact that BigQuery does not support direct equality comparison of arrays using the `=` operator. When you try to compare `call.genotype = [0, 0]`, it results in an error because you're attempting to compare an array to an array directly.

**Error Message:**

```
400 Equality is not defined for arguments of type ARRAY<INT64> at [4:7]
```

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, we need to compare the elements within the `call.genotype` array individually. Additionally, we must handle cases where the genotype array may have different lengths because, on chromosome X, male individuals may have only one allele (hemizygous), resulting in a genotype array of length 1.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT call.call_set_name AS sample_id, COUNT(*) AS homo_ref_count
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
UNNEST(`call`) AS call
WHERE `reference_name` = 'X`
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559
  AND LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
  AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
  AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[ORDINAL(1)]) = 1
  AND (
    (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 1 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] = 0)
    OR
    (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] = 0 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(1)] = 0)
  )
GROUP BY sample_id
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Genotype Array Length:** We check for the length of the `call.genotype` array using `ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype)`. If it's 1 (typical for males on chromosome X), we compare the single element. If it's 2 (typical for females), we compare both elements.
- **Element-wise Comparison:** We compare individual elements using `call.genotype[OFFSET(0)]` and `call.genotype[OFFSET(1)]`.
  - `OFFSET(0)` refers to the first element.
  - `OFFSET(1)` refers to the second element.
- **Homozygous Reference Alleles:** We check that all genotype elements are `0`, indicating homozygous reference.

**Updating Other Queries with Similar Issues:**

For consistency, we'll update the other queries where array comparisons are involved.

### Counting Homozygous Alternate Alleles

```sql
SELECT call.call_set_name AS sample_id, COUNT(*) AS homo_alt_count
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
UNNEST(`call`) AS call
WHERE `reference_name` = 'X`
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559
  AND LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
  AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
  AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[ORDINAL(1)]) = 1
  AND (
    (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 1 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0)
    OR
    (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] = call.genotype[OFFSET(1)] AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0)
  )
GROUP BY sample_id
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Homozygous Alternate Alleles:**
  - For arrays of length 1: The single genotype element is greater than 0.
  - For arrays of length 2: Both elements are equal and greater than 0.

---

### Counting Heterozygous Alternate Alleles

```sql
SELECT call.call_set_name AS sample_id, COUNT(*) AS het_alt_count
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
UNNEST(`call`) AS call
WHERE `reference_name` = 'X`
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559
  AND LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
  AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
  AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[ORDINAL(1)]) = 1
  AND ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2
  AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] != call.genotype[OFFSET(1)]
  AND (call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0 OR call.genotype[OFFSET(1)] > 0)
GROUP BY sample_id
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Heterozygous Alternate Alleles:**
  - We only consider genotype arrays of length 2.
  - The genotype elements are different.
  - At least one genotype element is greater than 0.

### Counting Total Callable Sites

```sql
SELECT call.call_set_name AS sample_id, COUNT(*) AS callable_sites
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
UNNEST(`call`) AS call
WHERE `reference_name` = 'X`
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559
  AND LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
  AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
  AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[ORDINAL(1)]) = 1
  AND call.genotype IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY sample_id
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- We count all sites where the genotype is not null, considering them as callable sites.

### Calculating Percentages of Heterozygous and Homozygous Alternate Alleles

```sql
SELECT sample_id,
  total_snvs,
  het_alt_count,
  homo_alt_count,
  (het_alt_count / total_snvs) * 100 AS perc_het_alt,
  (homo_alt_count / total_snvs) * 100 AS perc_homo_alt
FROM (
  SELECT call.call_set_name AS sample_id,
    COUNTIF(
      ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2
      AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] != call.genotype[OFFSET(1)]
      AND (call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0 OR call.genotype[OFFSET(1)] > 0)
    ) AS het_alt_count,
    COUNTIF(
      (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 1 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0)
      OR
      (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] = call.genotype[OFFSET(1)] AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0)
    ) AS homo_alt_count,
    COUNTIF(
      (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 1 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0)
      OR
      (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2 AND (call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0 OR call.genotype[OFFSET(1)] > 0))
    ) AS total_snvs
  FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
  UNNEST(`call`) AS call
  WHERE `reference_name` = 'X`
    AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519
    AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559
    AND LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
    AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
    AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[ORDINAL(1)]) = 1
  GROUP BY sample_id
)
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Total Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs):** We count all sites where at least one genotype allele is greater than 0.
- **Calculating Percentages:** We compute the percentages of heterozygous and homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs.

---

**Summary:**

- **Issue:** Arrays cannot be compared directly using `=` in BigQuery.
- **Solution:** Compare individual elements of the array.
- **Genotype Handling:** Consider the length of the genotype array to handle males (length 1) and females (length 2) on chromosome X.
- **Adjustments:** Apply the same logic to other queries where array comparisons are made.

---

**Note:** Always ensure that your queries account for variations in data structures, especially when dealing with genetic data where the number of alleles can vary due to biological differences.

**Let me know if you encounter any further issues or need additional clarification.**
2025-01-28 03:53:03 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-28 03:53:03 - root - INFO - You're encountering a syntax error due to an unclosed string literal in your SQL query. Specifically, in your `WHERE` clause, the single quote after `'X'` is not properly closed, and there may be backticks that are not properly matched.

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [4:26]
```

**Cause of the Error:**

- In the line `WHERE call.genotype = [0, 0] AND `reference_name` = 'X'`, the opening backtick before `reference_name` is not matched with a closing backtick.
- Similarly, the single quote after `'X'` is not properly closed.

**Corrected Query:**

Here's the corrected SQL query with properly matched quotes and backticks:

```sql
SELECT call.call_set_name AS sample_id, COUNT(*) AS homo_ref_count
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
UNNEST(`call`) AS call
WHERE `reference_name` = 'X'
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559
  AND LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
  AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
  AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[ORDINAL(1)]) = 1
  AND (
    (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 1 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] = 0)
    OR
    (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] = 0 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(1)] = 0)
  )
GROUP BY sample_id
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **Properly Closed Backticks and Quotes:**
  - Backticks `` ` `` are used to enclose identifiers (like table names and column names).
  - Single quotes `' '` are used to enclose string literals.
  - Ensured that all backticks and single quotes are properly opened and closed.

- **Specific Corrections:**
  - Changed `WHERE call.genotype = [0, 0] AND `reference_name` = 'X'` to `WHERE `reference_name` = 'X'`.
  - Ensured that `'X'` is enclosed within single quotes without any trailing backticks.

**Updating Other Queries with Similar Errors:**

I've reviewed the other SQL queries and corrected them where necessary.

### 1. Counting SNPs on Chromosome X

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS snp_count
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
WHERE `reference_name` = 'X'
  AND LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
  AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
  AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[ORDINAL(1)]) = 1
LIMIT 100;
```

**Correction:**

- Ensured backticks and single quotes are properly matched.

  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559
  AND LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
  AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
  AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[ORDINAL(1)]) = 1
LIMIT 100;
```

**Correction:**

- Verified the proper use of backticks and quotes.

WHERE `reference_name` = 'X'
  AND LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
  AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
  AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[ORDINAL(1)]) = 1
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### 5. Counting Homozygous Reference Alleles for Samples

```sql
SELECT call.call_set_name AS sample_id, COUNT(*) AS homo_ref_count
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
UNNEST(`call`) AS call
WHERE `reference_name` = 'X'
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519
  AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559
  AND LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
  AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
  AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[ORDINAL(1)]) = 1
  AND (
    (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 1 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] = 0)
    OR
    (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] = 0 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(1)] = 0)
  )
GROUP BY sample_id
LIMIT 100;
```

**Corrections:**

- Fixed unmatched backticks and quotes.
- Ensured that the `WHERE` clause conditions are properly written.

    AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
    AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[ORDINAL(1)]) = 1
  GROUP BY sample_id
)
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:**

- **Ensure All Quotes and Backticks Are Matched:**
  - Double-check that every opening backtick or quote has a corresponding closing backtick or quote.
  - This prevents syntax errors related to unclosed literals.

- **Genotype Handling on Chromosome X:**
  - Since chromosome X exhibits different inheritance patterns in males and females, genotype arrays can have lengths of 1 or 2.
  - The queries account for both hemizygous (single allele) and diploid (two alleles) genotypes.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Testing Queries:**
  - Before running complex queries, test smaller parts to ensure they work as expected.
  - Use `LIMIT` to avoid processing large amounts of data during testing.

- **Understanding Errors:**
  - Read error messages carefully; they often point directly to the issue (e.g., line and character number).
  - Syntax errors typically involve missing or extra characters like quotes, commas, or parentheses.

2025-01-28 03:55:09 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-28 03:55:09 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering indicates that an array index is out of bounds when attempting to access `call.genotype[OFFSET(1)]`. This happens because some `call.genotype` arrays have less than two elements, causing `OFFSET(1)` (which refers to the second element) to be invalid.

**Error Message:**

```
400 Array index 1 is out of bounds (overflow); reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Array index 1 is out of bounds (overflow)
```

---

## **Cause of the Error:**

- **Array Length Issue:** Some `call.genotype` arrays have a length of 1 (common for male samples on chromosome X due to hemizygosity), and you're trying to access the second element (`OFFSET(1)`), which doesn't exist in these cases.
- **Invalid Indexing:** Accessing an index that doesn't exist in an array causes a runtime error in BigQuery.

---

## **Solution:**

We need to modify the query to ensure we only access `call.genotype[OFFSET(1)]` when the array length is at least 2. We can achieve this by:

1. **Using `SAFE_OFFSET(n)`:** This function returns `NULL` instead of an error when the index is out of bounds.
2. **Adjusting Conditions:** Ensure that array elements are only accessed when they exist.
3. **Restructuring Logic:** Use `IF` statements or `CASE WHEN` to handle different cases safely.

---

## **Corrected Query:**

Here's the corrected query using `SAFE_OFFSET` and adjusted logic:

```sql
SELECT sample_id,
  het_alt_count,
  total_snvs,
  (het_alt_count / total_snvs) * 100 AS perc_het_alt
FROM (
  SELECT call.call_set_name AS sample_id,
    SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2
          AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] != call.genotype[OFFSET(1)]
          AND (call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0 OR call.genotype[OFFSET(1)] > 0)
        THEN 1
        ELSE 0
      END
    ) AS het_alt_count,
    SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 1 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0)
          OR (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2 AND (call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0 OR call.genotype[OFFSET(1)] > 0))
        THEN 1
        ELSE 0
      END
    ) AS total_snvs
  FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
  UNNEST(`call`) AS call
  WHERE `reference_name` = 'X'
    AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519
    AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559
    AND LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
    AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[OFFSET(0)]) = 1
  GROUP BY sample_id
)
LIMIT 100;
```

---

## **Explanation:**

- **Avoiding Invalid Indexing:**
  - We ensure that `call.genotype[OFFSET(1)]` is only accessed when `ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2`.
  - In cases where `ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 1`, we avoid accessing `OFFSET(1)`.

- **Using `CASE WHEN`:**
  - This structure allows us to conditionally compute values based on the array length.
  - It prevents accessing array elements that don't exist.

- **Calculating `het_alt_count`:**
  - We increment `het_alt_count` by 1 when:
    - `call.genotype` has a length of 2.
    - The two alleles are different (`call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] != call.genotype[OFFSET(1)]`).
    - At least one allele is an alternate allele (`> 0`).

- **Calculating `total_snvs`:**
  - We increment `total_snvs` by 1 when:
    - For arrays of length 1, the allele is an alternate allele (`call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0`).
    - For arrays of length 2, at least one allele is an alternate allele.

- **Calculating Percentage:**
  - We compute the percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs.

- **Adjusted Conditions in WHERE Clause:**
  - `LENGTH('reference_bases') = 1`: Ensures we are dealing with SNPs.
  - `LENGTH('alternate_bases'[OFFSET(0)]) = 1`: Confirms the alternate base is a single nucleotide.
  - Removed `ARRAY_LENGTH('alternate_bases') = 1` because accessing `alternate_bases[OFFSET(0)]` suffices and ensures the array has at least one element.

---

## **Alternative Query Using `SAFE_OFFSET`:**

If you prefer using `SAFE_OFFSET` to handle out-of-bounds access gracefully, here's how you can modify the query:

```sql
SELECT sample_id,
  het_alt_count,
  total_snvs,
  (het_alt_count / total_snvs) * 100 AS perc_het_alt
FROM (
  SELECT call.call_set_name AS sample_id,
    COUNTIF(
      ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2
      AND SAFE_LESS(call.genotype[OFFSET(0)], call.genotype[SAFE_OFFSET(1)])
      AND (call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0 OR call.genotype[SAFE_OFFSET(1)] > 0)
    ) AS het_alt_count,
    COUNTIF(
      (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 1 AND call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0)
      OR
      (ARRAY_LENGTH(call.genotype) = 2 AND (call.genotype[OFFSET(0)] > 0 OR call.genotype[SAFE_OFFSET(1)] > 0))
    ) AS total_snvs
  FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
  UNNEST(call) AS call
  WHERE `reference_name` = 'X'
    AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519
    AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559
    AND LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
    AND LENGTH(`alternate_bases`[OFFSET(0)]) = 1
  GROUP BY sample_id
)
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:** The use of `SAFE_LESS` or other safe comparison functions can prevent errors when comparing with `NULL`.

---

## **Additional Tips:**

- **Ensure Conditions Prevent Invalid Access:**
  - Always check the array length before accessing elements.
  - This is especially important when working with genetic data where arrays can have variable lengths.

- **Handling NULL Values:**
  - Be cautious when `SAFE_OFFSET` returns `NULL`.
  - Adjust your logical conditions to handle `NULL` appropriately.

---

## **Summary:**

- The error occurred because the query tried to access an array element (`call.genotype[OFFSET(1)]`) that doesn't exist for arrays of length 1.
- Adjusting the query to only access array elements when they exist resolves the error.
- Using `CASE WHEN` or `IF` statements ensures safe access and correct counting.
- The corrected query computes the required counts and percentages without encountering out-of-bounds errors.

---

**Please try running the corrected query. If you have further questions or encounter more issues, feel free to ask for additional assistance.**

# Explanation of Alleles Types

## homozygous reference alleles
- When both alleles are 0.

## homozygous alternate alleles
- When both alleles are identical and greater than 0.

## heterozygous alternate alleles
- When alleles are different or one is NULL with at least one greater than 0.

## callable sites
- Including homozygous reference, homozygous alternate, and heterozygous alleles.

## Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs)
- Including homozygous and heterozygous alternate alleles.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table**: `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
  - **reference_name**: To filter data for chromosome X.
  - **start**: To exclude specified position ranges.
  - **reference_bases**: To identify reference alleles.
  - **alternate_bases**: To identify alternate alleles (SNPs).
  - **call**: An array of structs containing genotype data for each sample.
    - **call.call_set_name**: The sample ID.
    - **call.genotype**: The genotype of the sample at the variant site.
    
- **Conditions to be used:**
  - `reference_name = 'X'`: Select data from chromosome X.
  - `start NOT BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519`: Exclude first region.
  - `start NOT BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559`: Exclude second region.
  - `ARRAY_LENGTH(reference_bases) = 1 AND ARRAY_LENGTH(alternate_bases) = 1`: Ensure variants are SNPs (single nucleotide in length).
  
**Sample BigQuery SQL Queries:**

1. **Select distinct reference names (chromosomes):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `reference_name`
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the number of SNPs on chromosome X:**

   SELECT COUNT(*) AS snp_count
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   WHERE `reference_name` = 'X'
     AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
     AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve variant positions on chromosome X excluding specified ranges:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `start`, `reference_bases`, `alternate_bases`
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   WHERE `reference_name` = 'X'
     AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519
     AND `start` NOT BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List sample IDs from the calls within variants:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT call.call_set_name AS sample_id
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
   UNNEST(`call`) AS call
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Inspect genotype data for samples on chromosome X SNPs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT call.call_set_name AS sample_id, call.genotype
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
   UNNEST(`call`) AS call
   WHERE `reference_name` = 'X'
     AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`reference_bases`) = 1
     AND ARRAY_LENGTH(`alternate_bases`) = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count homozygous reference alleles for samples:**

   ```sql
   SELECT call.call_set_name AS sample_id, COUNT(*) AS homo_ref_count
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
   UNNEST(`call`) AS call

Task: Extract genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from chromosome X , ensuring that the start positions are not between 59999 and 2699519 nor between 154931042 and 155260559.   Output the sample ID, counts of homozygous reference alleles, homozygous alternate alleles, heterozygous alternate alleles, the total number of callable sites, the total number of SNVs,  the percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs, and the percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
sample_id,homozygous_reference_alleles,homozygous_alternate_alleles,heterozygous_alternate_alleles,total_callable_sites,total_snvs,percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles,percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles
sample_id1:str,count_hr:int,count_ha:int,count_het:int,total_callable:int,total_snvs:int,perc_het:0<=float<=100,perc_ha:0<=float<=100
sample_id2:str,count_hr:int,count_ha:int,count_het:int,total_callable:int,total_snvs:int,perc_het:0<=float<=100,perc_ha:0<=float<=100
...
```

**Explanation:**

The table summarizes genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome X, excluding start positions between 59999 and 2699519 and between 154931042 and 155260559. For each `sample_id`, the table includes:

- `homozygous_reference_alleles`: Count of sites where both alleles are reference alleles (0).
- `homozygous_alternate_alleles`: Count of sites where both alleles are the same alternate allele (>0).
- `heterozygous_alternate_alleles`: Count of sites where alleles are different and at least one is an alternate allele (>0).
- `total_callable_sites`: Total number of callable sites (sum of homozygous reference, homozygous alternate, and heterozygous alternate alleles).
- `total_snvs`: Total number of single nucleotide variants (sum of homozygous alternate and heterozygous alternate alleles).
- `percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles`: Percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs.
- `percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles`: Percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'spider2-public-data': {'1000_genomes': ['pedigree', 'sample_info', 'variants']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-28 03:58:17 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Extract genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from chromosome X , ensuring that the start positions are not between 59999 and 2699519 nor between 154931042 and 155260559.   Output the sample ID, counts of homozygous reference alleles, homozygous alternate alleles, heterozygous alternate alleles, the total number of callable sites, the total number of SNVs,  the percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs, and the percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
sample_id,homozygous_reference_alleles,homozygous_alternate_alleles,heterozygous_alternate_alleles,total_callable_sites,total_snvs,percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles,percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles
sample_id1:str,count_hr:int,count_ha:int,count_het:int,total_callable:int,total_snvs:int,perc_het:0<=float<=100,perc_ha:0<=float<=100
sample_id2:str,count_hr:int,count_ha:int,count_het:int,total_callable:int,total_snvs:int,perc_het:0<=float<=100,perc_ha:0<=float<=100
...
```

**Explanation:**

The table summarizes genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome X, excluding start positions between 59999 and 2699519 and between 154931042 and 155260559. For each `sample_id`, the table includes:

- `homozygous_reference_alleles`: Count of sites where both alleles are reference alleles (0).
- `homozygous_alternate_alleles`: Count of sites where both alleles are the same alternate allele (>0).
- `heterozygous_alternate_alleles`: Count of sites where alleles are different and at least one is an alternate allele (>0).
- `total_callable_sites`: Total number of callable sites (sum of homozygous reference, homozygous alternate, and heterozygous alternate alleles).
- `total_snvs`: Total number of single nucleotide variants (sum of homozygous alternate and heterozygous alternate alleles).
- `percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles`: Percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs.
- `percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles`: Percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-28 03:58:57 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Extract genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from chromosome X , ensuring that the start positions are not between 59999 and 2699519 nor between 154931042 and 155260559.   Output the sample ID, counts of homozygous reference alleles, homozygous alternate alleles, heterozygous alternate alleles, the total number of callable sites, the total number of SNVs,  the percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs, and the percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
sample_id,homozygous_reference_alleles,homozygous_alternate_alleles,heterozygous_alternate_alleles,total_callable_sites,total_snvs,percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles,percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles
sample_id1:str,count_hr:int,count_ha:int,count_het:int,total_callable:int,total_snvs:int,perc_het:0<=float<=100,perc_ha:0<=float<=100
sample_id2:str,count_hr:int,count_ha:int,count_het:int,total_callable:int,total_snvs:int,perc_het:0<=float<=100,perc_ha:0<=float<=100
...
```

**Explanation:**

The table summarizes genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome X, excluding start positions between 59999 and 2699519 and between 154931042 and 155260559. For each `sample_id`, the table includes:

- `homozygous_reference_alleles`: Count of sites where both alleles are reference alleles (0).
- `homozygous_alternate_alleles`: Count of sites where both alleles are the same alternate allele (>0).
- `heterozygous_alternate_alleles`: Count of sites where alleles are different and at least one is an alternate allele (>0).
- `total_callable_sites`: Total number of callable sites (sum of homozygous reference, homozygous alternate, and heterozygous alternate alleles).
- `total_snvs`: Total number of single nucleotide variants (sum of homozygous alternate and heterozygous alternate alleles).
- `percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles`: Percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs.
- `percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles`: Percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

**Explanation:**

The SQL query extracts genotype data for SNPs on chromosome X, excluding the specified position ranges. It calculates the counts for homozygous reference alleles, homozygous alternate alleles, heterozygous alternate alleles, total callable sites, total SNVs, and the percentages of heterozygous and homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs for each sample.

- **homozygous_reference_alleles**: Sites where both alleles are reference alleles (0).
- **homozygous_alternate_alleles**: Sites where both alleles are the same alternate allele (>0).
- **heterozygous_alternate_alleles**: Sites where alleles are different, and at least one is an alternate allele (>0).
- **total_callable_sites**: Total number of sites with genotype data.
- **total_snvs**: Total number of sites where at least one allele is an alternate allele (>0).
- **percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles**: Percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs.
- **percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles**: Percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs.

All percentages are retained to four decimal places as per the requirement.

2025-01-28 04:00:14 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Extract genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from chromosome X , ensuring that the start positions are not between 59999 and 2699519 nor between 154931042 and 155260559.   Output the sample ID, counts of homozygous reference alleles, homozygous alternate alleles, heterozygous alternate alleles, the total number of callable sites, the total number of SNVs,  the percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs, and the percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
sample_id,homozygous_reference_alleles,homozygous_alternate_alleles,heterozygous_alternate_alleles,total_callable_sites,total_snvs,percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles,percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles
sample_id1:str,count_hr:int,count_ha:int,count_het:int,total_callable:int,total_snvs:int,perc_het:0<=float<=100,perc_ha:0<=float<=100
sample_id2:str,count_hr:int,count_ha:int,count_het:int,total_callable:int,total_snvs:int,perc_het:0<=float<=100,perc_ha:0<=float<=100
...
```

**Explanation:**

The table summarizes genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome X, excluding start positions between 59999 and 2699519 and between 154931042 and 155260559. For each `sample_id`, the table includes:

- `homozygous_reference_alleles`: Count of sites where both alleles are reference alleles (0).
- `homozygous_alternate_alleles`: Count of sites where both alleles are the same alternate allele (>0).
- `heterozygous_alternate_alleles`: Count of sites where alleles are different and at least one is an alternate allele (>0).
- `total_callable_sites`: Total number of callable sites (sum of homozygous reference, homozygous alternate, and heterozygous alternate alleles).
- `total_snvs`: Total number of single nucleotide variants (sum of homozygous alternate and heterozygous alternate alleles).
- `percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles`: Percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs.
- `percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles`: Percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
