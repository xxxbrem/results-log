After carefully analyzing both SQL scripts and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script that accurately fulfills the given task.

---

**Reasoning:**

1. **Accurate Identification of Qualified Drivers:**

   - Both scripts aim to identify drivers who missed fewer than three races in a year.
   - However, `1result.sql` ensures that only drivers who missed **exactly one or two races** are selected by verifying that the number of missed races is greater than 0 and less than 3.
   - This precise condition aligns with the requirement to include drivers who missed fewer than three races annually.

2. **Correct Detection of Team Switching:**

   - The key aspect of the task is to identify drivers who **switched teams between their first and last missed races**.
   - In `1result.sql`, the `constructors_before_after` CTE accurately captures the constructors a driver raced for **immediately before** and **immediately after** their missed races.
   - It does this by selecting the constructors from the races just before the first missed race and just after the last missed race.
   - The script then filters for drivers where these constructors are not equal, ensuring only drivers who **switched teams during their missed races** are included.

3. **Computation of Required Statistics:**

   - `1result.sql` computes the average of the first and last missed rounds per year for the qualified drivers.
   - The script groups the data by year and calculates the averages using the `AVG` function, which directly addresses the requirement to calculate the **average first and last rounds of races missed by drivers each year**.

4. **Clarity and Efficiency:**

   - The SQL in `1result.sql` is structured with clear and logical CTEs, making it easier to follow the data transformations at each step.
   - It avoids unnecessary joins and computations, focusing directly on the essential elements needed for the task.
   - This efficiency reduces the likelihood of errors and improves the accuracy of the results.

5. **Consistency of Results:**

   - The output of `1result.sql` matches the expected results, providing the correct average rounds for the specified years.
   - This consistency confirms that the script effectively captures the intended data and performs the calculations accurately.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above reasoning, **`1result.sql`** is the SQL script that correctly implements the task requirements by accurately identifying the drivers who missed fewer than three races, detecting team switches between their missed races, and calculating the average first and last missed rounds per year.
