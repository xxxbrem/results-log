Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task of listing, for each neighborhood in San Francisco, the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries`

   - **`neighborhood`**: The name of the neighborhood.
     - *Potential usage*: Grouping results by neighborhood.
   - **`neighborhood_geom`**: The geographic boundary of the neighborhood as a GEOGRAPHY object.
     - *Potential usage*: Spatially join with bike share stations and crime incidents to determine which neighborhood they are located in.

2. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`

   - **`station_id`**: Unique identifier for each bike share station.
     - *Potential usage*: Counting the number of stations.
   - **`station_geom`**: The geographic location of the bike share station as a GEOGRAPHY point.
     - *Potential usage*: Spatially join with neighborhood boundaries to determine which neighborhood each station is in.
   - **`lat`**, **`lon`**: Latitude and longitude of the station.
     - *Potential usage*: Alternative to `station_geom` for spatial operations.

3. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents`

   - **`unique_key`**: Unique identifier for each crime incident.
     - *Potential usage*: Counting the number of incidents.
   - **`latitude`**, **`longitude`**: Location of the crime incident.
     - *Potential usage*: Spatially join with neighborhood boundaries to determine which neighborhood each incident occurred in.
   - **`timestamp`**: Date and time of the incident.
     - *Potential usage*: Filtering incidents by date if needed.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Spatial joins**: Using spatial functions like `ST_CONTAINS` to determine if a point (station or incident) is within a neighborhood polygon.
- **Grouping**: Using `GROUP BY` on `neighborhood` to aggregate counts.
- **Filtering**: Applying conditions to include only relevant records if needed.

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **List all neighborhoods:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `neighborhood`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **View neighborhood geometries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `neighborhood`, `neighborhood_geom`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List bike share stations with their locations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `station_id`, `name`, `lat`, `lon`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **View bike share station geometries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `station_id`, `station_geom`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Sample crime incidents with locations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `unique_key`, `category`, `latitude`, `longitude`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List distinct crime categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `category`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count total number of bike share stations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_bike_stations
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`;
   ```

8. **Count total number of crime incidents:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_crime_incidents
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents`;
   ```

9. **List bike share stations with capacities:**

Task: For each neighborhood in San Francisco, list the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Neighborhood,Number_of_Bike_Share_Stations,Total_Number_of_Crime_Incidents
neighborhood1:str,num_stations1:int,num_incidents1:int
neighborhood2:str,num_stations2:int,num_incidents2:int
...
```

This table lists, for each neighborhood in San Francisco, the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'san_francisco_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'san_francisco_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_regions', 'bikeshare_station_info', 'bikeshare_station_status', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'san_francisco_film_locations': ['film_locations'], 'san_francisco_neighborhoods': ['boundaries'], 'san_francisco_sffd_service_calls': ['sffd_service_calls'], 'san_francisco_sfpd_incidents': ['sfpd_incidents'], 'san_francisco_transit_muni': ['calendar', 'fares', 'routes', 'shapes', 'stop_monitoring', 'stop_times', 'stops', 'trips', 'vehicle_monitoring'], 'san_francisco_trees': ['street_trees']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 06:21:57 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each neighborhood in San Francisco, list the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Neighborhood,Number_of_Bike_Share_Stations,Total_Number_of_Crime_Incidents
neighborhood1:str,num_stations1:int,num_incidents1:int
neighborhood2:str,num_stations2:int,num_incidents2:int
...
```

This table lists, for each neighborhood in San Francisco, the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
