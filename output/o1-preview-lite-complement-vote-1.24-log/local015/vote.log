After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script to calculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't.

**Explanation:**

- **Inclusive of All Riders:** `0result.sql` correctly considers both **drivers and passengers** (`v."victim_role" IN ('driver', 'passenger')`), ensuring all motorcycle riders are included in the analysis.

- **Accurate Helmet Usage Determination:** It accurately assesses helmet usage by checking for both **helmeted and unhelmeted statuses** in `v."victim_safety_equipment_1"` and `v."victim_safety_equipment_2"`, accounting for possible variations in data entry.

- **Proper Filtering of Fatalities in Motorcycle Collisions:**
  - Filters collisions involving motorcycles (`c."motorcycle_collision" = 1`).
  - Focuses on fatalities (`LOWER(v."victim_degree_of_injury") = 'killed'`).

- **Excludes Unknown Cases:** It excludes cases where helmet usage is unknown from the percentage calculation, which provides a more accurate representation of the data.

In contrast:

- **`1result.sql`:**
  - **Excludes Passengers:** Only considers **drivers** by filtering `v."victim_role" = 'DRIVER'`, thus omitting passengers from the analysis.
  - **Potentially Skips Relevant Data:** May miss cases where passengers were involved in fatalities, which are crucial for a comprehensive percentage calculation.

- **`2result.sql`:**
  - **Lacks Role Filtering:** Does **not filter by `victim_role`**, potentially including non-riders (e.g., pedestrians, bystanders), which could skew the results.
  - **Broader Scope:** While it assesses helmet usage, the lack of role filtering means it might not accurately reflect the percentage among motorcycle riders exclusively.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is the most appropriate choice as it provides an accurate and inclusive calculation of the percentages among motorcycle riders.
