After reviewing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct query for the task.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Calculation:** The query in `0result.sql` correctly calculates the percentage change in unsheltered homeless individuals from 2015 to 2018 for each state using `SAFE_DIVIDE` and `NULLIF` to handle any potential division by zero errors.
- **Comparison with National Average:** It computes the national percentage change and finds the absolute difference between each state's percentage change and the national average.
- **Correct Ordering and Selection:** By ordering the results based on the smallest absolute difference, it identifies the top 5 states whose percentage changes are closest to the national average.
- **Compliance with Requirements:** The query aligns with the task's requirements by providing the state abbreviations of the top 5 states, and the results match the expected output.

Here is the name of the correct SQL file:

0result.sql
