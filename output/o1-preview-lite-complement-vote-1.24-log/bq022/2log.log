Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we'll start by identifying the relevant tables and columns, along with their potential usage and any conditions that may be applied.

**Relevant Table:**

- **Database Name:** `bigquery-public-data`
- **Schema Name:** `chicago_taxi_trips`
- **Table Name:** `taxi_trips`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **`trip_seconds`:** Represents the duration of the trip in seconds. Used to filter trips lasting no more than 1 hour (3600 seconds) and to partition trips based on duration.

- **`fare`:** The fare for the trip. Used to calculate the average fare within each quantile.

- **`trip_total`:** Total cost of the trip, including fare, tips, tolls, and extras. Could be an alternative to `fare` for total cost analysis.

- **`trip_start_timestamp` / `trip_end_timestamp`:** Timestamps indicating when the trip started and ended. Could be used to verify trip durations or analyze trips over time.

- **`trip_miles`:** Distance of the trip in miles. Useful for analyzing the relationship between trip distance and duration.

- **`payment_type`:** Type of payment for the trip. May be used for additional analysis on fare types.

- **`taxi_id`:** Unique identifier for the taxi. Could be used if analyzing trips per taxi.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Filter trips lasting no more than 1 hour:**
  - `trip_seconds > 0 AND trip_seconds <= 3600`

- **Exclude trips with missing or invalid data:**
  - `trip_seconds IS NOT NULL`
  - `fare IS NOT NULL`

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

Below are 10 different BigQuery SQL queries, ranging from simple to more complex, to gain an understanding of the values in the related columns. Each query is limited to 100 rows.

1. **Query 1:** Select sample trip durations and fares.

    ```sql
    SELECT
      `trip_seconds`,
      `fare`
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **Query 2:** Select distinct trip durations (in minutes) for trips lasting no more than 1 hour.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT
      CAST(CEIL(`trip_seconds` / 60) AS INT64) AS trip_duration_minutes
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE
      `trip_seconds` > 0
      AND `trip_seconds` <= 3600
    ORDER BY
      trip_duration_minutes
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **Query 3:** Select trips with trip durations and fares for trips under 1 hour.

    ```sql
    SELECT
      `trip_seconds`,
      `fare`,
      `trip_start_timestamp`
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE
      `trip_seconds` > 0
      AND `trip_seconds` <= 3600
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Query 4:** Select trips with trip durations and total trip cost.

    ```sql
    SELECT
      `trip_seconds`,
      `trip_total`
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE
      `trip_seconds` > 0
      AND `trip_seconds` <= 3600
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **Query 5:** Select distinct fare amounts for trips under 1 hour.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT
      `fare`
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE
      `fare` IS NOT NULL
      AND `trip_seconds` > 0
      AND `trip_seconds` <= 3600
    ORDER BY
      `fare`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Query 6:** Select trips with trip duration in minutes and fare.

    ```sql
    SELECT
      CAST(CEIL(`trip_seconds` / 60) AS INT64) AS trip_duration_minutes,
      `fare`
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE
      `fare` IS NOT NULL
      AND `trip_seconds` > 0
      AND `trip_seconds` <= 3600
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Query 7:** Select trips with trip miles, trip duration, and fare.

    ```sql
    SELECT
      `trip_miles`,
      `trip_seconds`,
      `fare`
    FROM

      AND `trip_seconds` > 0
      AND `trip_seconds` <= 3600
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **Query 9:** Select trips with pickup and dropoff community areas, and trip duration.

    ```sql
    SELECT
      `pickup_community_area`,
      `dropoff_community_area`,
      `trip_seconds`
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE
      `pickup_community_area` IS NOT NULL
      AND `dropoff_community_area` IS NOT NULL
      AND `trip_seconds` > 0
      AND `trip_seconds` <= 3600
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **Query 10:** Select trips with taxi ID, trip duration, and fare.

    ```sql
    SELECT
      `taxi_id`,
      `trip_seconds`,
      `fare`
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE
      `taxi_id` IS NOT NULL
      AND `fare` IS NOT NULL
      AND `trip_seconds` > 0
      AND `trip_seconds` <= 3600
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution and values of the key columns related to trip duration and fare. By exploring the data using these queries, we can prepare to partition the trips into 6 quantiles based on trip duration and calculate the minimum/maximum trip duration, total trips, and average fare for each quantile.

---

**Note:** The actual calculation of the quantiles and the required statistics would involve more complex queries using window functions or analytic functions, which are not displayed here as per the instructions.Query:
SELECT
  quantile,
  MIN(trip_duration_minutes) AS Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes,
  MAX(trip_duration_minutes) AS Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes,
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Trips,
  AVG(fare) AS Average_Fare
FROM (
  SELECT
    CEIL(trip_seconds / 60) AS trip_duration_minutes,
    fare,
    NTILE(6) OVER (ORDER BY CEIL(trip_seconds / 60)) AS quantile
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
  WHERE
    trip_seconds > 0
    AND trip_seconds <= 3600
    AND trip_seconds IS NOT NULL
    AND fare IS NOT NULL
    AND fare > 0
  )
GROUP BY
  quantile
ORDER BY
  quantile;

Task: Given the taxi trip data in Chicago, partition the trips that last no more than 1 hour into 6 quantiles based on trip duration. Please provide the minimum/maximum trip duration (rounded-off to integer minutes), total trips, and average fare for each quantile.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To partition the Chicago taxi trips lasting no more than 1 hour into 6 quantiles based on trip duration, we would calculate the minimum and maximum trip durations (rounded to integer minutes), the total number of trips, and the average fare for each quantile.

Here is the expected format in CSV:

```csv
Quantile,Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Total_Trips,Average_Fare
1,min1:int,max1:int,total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float
2,min2:int,max2:int,total_trips2:int,average_fare2:float
3,min3:int,max3:int,total_trips3:int,average_fare3:float
4,min4:int,max4:int,total_trips4:int,average_fare4:float
5,min5:int,max5:int,total_trips5:int,average_fare5:float
6,min6:int,max6:int,total_trips6:int,average_fare6:float
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter the Data:**
   - Select trips where `trip_seconds` is less than or equal to 3600 seconds (1 hour).

2. **Calculate Trip Duration in Minutes:**
   - Convert `trip_seconds` to minutes by dividing by 60 and rounding to the nearest integer.

3. **Partition into Quantiles:**
   - Divide the filtered trips into 6 equal groups (quantiles) based on the trip duration in minutes.

4. **Compute Statistics for Each Quantile:**
   - **Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes:** The minimum trip duration in the quantile.
   - **Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes:** The maximum trip duration in the quantile.
   - **Total_Trips:** The total number of trips in the quantile.
   - **Average_Fare:** The average fare of trips in the quantile.

Please note that without access to the actual dataset, specific numerical values cannot be provided. The above CSV format outlines how the results should be presented..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'chicago_crime': ['crime'], 'chicago_taxi_trips': ['taxi_trips']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 20:07:02 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Given the taxi trip data in Chicago, partition the trips that last no more than 1 hour into 6 quantiles based on trip duration. Please provide the minimum/maximum trip duration (rounded-off to integer minutes), total trips, and average fare for each quantile., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To partition the Chicago taxi trips lasting no more than 1 hour into 6 quantiles based on trip duration, we would calculate the minimum and maximum trip durations (rounded to integer minutes), the total number of trips, and the average fare for each quantile.

Here is the expected format in CSV:

```csv
Quantile,Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Total_Trips,Average_Fare
1,min1:int,max1:int,total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float
2,min2:int,max2:int,total_trips2:int,average_fare2:float
3,min3:int,max3:int,total_trips3:int,average_fare3:float
4,min4:int,max4:int,total_trips4:int,average_fare4:float
5,min5:int,max5:int,total_trips5:int,average_fare5:float
6,min6:int,max6:int,total_trips6:int,average_fare6:float
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter the Data:**
   - Select trips where `trip_seconds` is less than or equal to 3600 seconds (1 hour).

2. **Calculate Trip Duration in Minutes:**
   - Convert `trip_seconds` to minutes by dividing by 60 and rounding to the nearest integer.

3. **Partition into Quantiles:**
   - Divide the filtered trips into 6 equal groups (quantiles) based on the trip duration in minutes.

4. **Compute Statistics for Each Quantile:**
   - **Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes:** The minimum trip duration in the quantile.
   - **Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes:** The maximum trip duration in the quantile.
   - **Total_Trips:** The total number of trips in the quantile.
   - **Average_Fare:** The average fare of trips in the quantile.

Please note that without access to the actual dataset, specific numerical values cannot be provided. The above CSV format outlines how the results should be presented. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 20:10:21 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Given the taxi trip data in Chicago, partition the trips that last no more than 1 hour into 6 quantiles based on trip duration. Please provide the minimum/maximum trip duration (rounded-off to integer minutes), total trips, and average fare for each quantile., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To partition the Chicago taxi trips lasting no more than 1 hour into 6 quantiles based on trip duration, we would calculate the minimum and maximum trip durations (rounded to integer minutes), the total number of trips, and the average fare for each quantile.

Here is the expected format in CSV:

```csv
Quantile,Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Total_Trips,Average_Fare
1,min1:int,max1:int,total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float
2,min2:int,max2:int,total_trips2:int,average_fare2:float
3,min3:int,max3:int,total_trips3:int,average_fare3:float
4,min4:int,max4:int,total_trips4:int,average_fare4:float
5,min5:int,max5:int,total_trips5:int,average_fare5:float
6,min6:int,max6:int,total_trips6:int,average_fare6:float
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter the Data:**
   - Select trips where `trip_seconds` is less than or equal to 3600 seconds (1 hour).

2. **Calculate Trip Duration in Minutes:**
   - Convert `trip_seconds` to minutes by dividing by 60 and rounding to the nearest integer.

3. **Partition into Quantiles:**
   - Divide the filtered trips into 6 equal groups (quantiles) based on the trip duration in minutes.

4. **Compute Statistics for Each Quantile:**
   - **Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes:** The minimum trip duration in the quantile.
   - **Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes:** The maximum trip duration in the quantile.
   - **Total_Trips:** The total number of trips in the quantile.
   - **Average_Fare:** The average fare of trips in the quantile.

Please note that without access to the actual dataset, specific numerical values cannot be provided. The above CSV format outlines how the results should be presented. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
