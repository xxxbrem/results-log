To determine the correct SQL query, let's compare the two provided SQL queries and their approaches.

---

**First SQL Query (`0result.sql`):**

This query calculates the average monthly projected sales in USD for France in 2021 by performing the following steps:

1. **Extract Monthly Total Sales for 2019 and 2020:**
   - Selects sales data where the customer is from France and the sale date is in 2019 or 2020.
   - Groups the sales by year and month, summing the `amount_sold` to get total sales per month.
   - Uses `strftime` functions to extract the year and month from the `time_id`.

2. **Calculate Average Sales per Month Across the Two Years:**
   - Averages the monthly total sales for each month over the two years (2019 and 2020).

3. **Join with 2021 Exchange Rates:**
   - Joins the average monthly sales with the `currency` table to get the 2021 exchange rates for France.
   - Matches on the month, converting the month string to an integer for the join.

4. **Calculate Projected Sales in USD:**
   - Multiplies the average monthly sales in euros by the exchange rate to convert to USD.

5. **Calculate the Overall Average:**
   - Averages the projected monthly sales in USD over all months to get the final result.

**Result:**
- The query returns an average monthly projected sales figure of **77,702.86166666665 USD**.

**Second SQL Query (`1result.sql`):**

This query also calculates the average monthly projected sales in USD for France in 2021, with a slightly different structure:

1. **Calculate Monthly Sales for 2019 and 2020:**
   - Selects sales data where the customer is from France and the sale date is in 2019 or 2020.
   - Groups the sales by year and month, summing the `amount_sold` to get monthly sales.
   - Uses the `times` table to get the `calendar_year` and `calendar_month_number`.

2. **Calculate Average Monthly Sales Over the Two Years:**
   - Averages the monthly sales for each calendar month over 2019 and 2020.

3. **Retrieve 2021 Exchange Rates:**
   - Selects the exchange rates for France for each month in 2021 from the `currency` table.

4. **Calculate Projected Sales in USD:**
   - Joins the average monthly sales with the exchange rates, using a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure all months are included.
   - Uses `COALESCE` to default the exchange rate to 1 if it's missing for a month.
   - Multiplies the average monthly sales in euros by the exchange rate to get projected sales in USD.

5. **Calculate the Overall Average:**
   - Averages the projected monthly sales in USD over all months to get the final result.

**Result:**
- The query returns the same average monthly projected sales figure of **77,702.86166666665 USD**.

**Comparison and Recommendation:**

Both queries aim to calculate the same metric and produce identical results. However, there are key differences in their approaches:

- **Readability and Maintainability:**
  - **`1result.sql`** uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with `WITH` clauses, making the query more readable and organized. Each step is clearly defined and separated, which is beneficial for understanding and future maintenance.
  - **`0result.sql`** nests subqueries, which can make the query harder to read and maintain, especially as the complexity increases.

- **Robustness:**
  - **`1result.sql`** uses a `LEFT JOIN` with the exchange rates and employs `COALESCE` to handle cases where an exchange rate might be missing by defaulting to 1. This ensures that the query won't fail due to missing data and provides a fallback scenario.
  - **`0result.sql`** uses an `INNER JOIN` with the exchange rates, which could potentially exclude months that don't have an exchange rate recorded, leading to incomplete data.

- **Use of Relevant Tables:**
  - **`1result.sql`** joins with the `times` table to utilize `calendar_year` and `calendar_month_number`, which is more precise and avoids potential issues with date formats.
  - **`0result.sql`** relies on the `strftime` function to extract year and month from `time_id`, which assumes the date format is consistent and could be less reliable if formats vary.

**Conclusion:**

Given the enhanced readability, maintainability, and robustness of the second query, **`1result.sql`** is the preferred and more reliable SQL query to use for calculating the average monthly projected sales in USD for France in 2021.
