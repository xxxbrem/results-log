I have compared the SQL queries and their results, and I choose **`1result.sql`** as the correct answer.

### **Reasoning:**

- **Correct Time Frame Filtering**: `1result.sql` explicitly filters events between `'20201201'` and `'20201231'`, ensuring that only data from **December 2020** is included.

  ```sql
  AND t.event_date BETWEEN '20201201' AND '20201231'
  ```

- **Accurate Domain Matching**: It uses `REGEXP_EXTRACT` to extract the hostname from `page_location` and matches it exactly to `'shop.googlemerchandisestore.com'`.

  ```sql
  REGEXP_EXTRACT(ep_page_location.value.string_value, r'^https?://([^/]+)') = 'shop.googlemerchandisestore.com'
  ```

  This ensures that only page views from the specified website are counted.

- **Proper Page Path Extraction**: The query extracts the page path from `page_location`, using `REGEXP_REPLACE` and handles cases where the path might be missing by defaulting to `'/'` with `COALESCE`.

  ```sql
  COALESCE(REGEXP_REPLACE(ep_page_location.value.string_value, r'^https?://[^/]+', ''), '/') AS Page_Path
  ```

- **Result Consistency**: The query produces the result where the page with the highest number of page views is the **Home page (`/`)** with the title **'Home'** and **53,818** page views, which aligns with the data.

  ```
  Page_Path, Page_Title, Pageviews
  /, Home, 53818
  ```

- **Comprehensive Data Retrieval**: The query joins on `event_params` to retrieve both `page_title` and `page_location` efficiently.

### **Conclusion:**

Given these points, **`1result.sql`** is the most accurate and appropriate SQL query to answer the task of finding the highest number of page views for different pages under the website **"shop.googlemerchandisestore.com"** in **December 2020**.
