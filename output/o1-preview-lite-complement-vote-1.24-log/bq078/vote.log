The correct SQL query is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

Both SQL queries aim to retrieve the approved symbol of the target gene(s) with the highest overall score associated with the disease 'EFO_0000676' from the data source 'IMPC'. However, `1result.sql` is more precise and aligns better with the task requirements for the following reasons:

- **Comprehensive Selection:** `1result.sql` uses a subquery to find the **maximum overall score** among the targets associated via 'IMPC' and selects all target genes that have this highest score. This means if there are multiple targets sharing the highest overall score, they will all be retrieved.

  ```sql
  AND o.score = (
      SELECT MAX(o2.score)
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect` AS a2
      JOIN `bigquery-public-data.open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect` AS o2
          ON a2.diseaseId = o2.diseaseId AND a2.targetId = o2.targetId
      WHERE a2.diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676' AND a2.datasourceId = 'impc'
  );
  ```

- **Task Alignment:** The task specifies retrieving the approved symbol of **target genes with the highest overall score**. `1result.sql` directly addresses this by explicitly comparing each target's score to the maximum score.

- **Handling Multiple Top Scorers:** In scenarios where more than one target gene has the highest overall score, `1result.sql` ensures that all such genes are included in the result, which makes it more robust and accurate.

- **Avoiding Arbitrary Limitation:** While `0result.sql` limits the result to one record with `LIMIT 1`, it relies on ordering and does not account for the possibility of multiple genes sharing the top score. This could inadvertently exclude other valid target genes with the same highest score.

- **Clarity and Explicitness:** The use of the subquery in `1result.sql` makes the intention clear—selecting genes where the score equals the maximum score—enhancing the query's readability and maintainability.

**Conclusion:**

`1result.sql` is the correct choice as it accurately and comprehensively fulfills the task requirements by ensuring all target genes with the highest overall score are retrieved, not just an arbitrary single result.
