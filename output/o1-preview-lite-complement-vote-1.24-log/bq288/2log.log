  description=""The legal/statistical area description (LSAD) codes describe the particular typology for each geographic entity. For legal entities, the LSAD reflects the term that appears in legal documentation pertaining to the entity, such as a treaty, charter, legislation, resolution, or ordinance. For statistical entities, the LSAD is the term assigned by the Census Bureau or other agency defining the entity. The LSAD code is a two-character field that corresponds to a description of the legal or statistical type of entity and identifies whether the LSAD term should be capitalized and should precede or follow the name of the geographic entity. Note that the same LSAD code is assigned to entities at different levels of the geographic hierarchy when they share the same LSAD. For example, the Census Bureau assigns the same LSAD code (\""21\"") to boroughs in New York and Connecticut, although they are county subdivisions in the former and incorporated places in the latter.\n\nThese codes can be found in the TIGER/Line products, gazetteer files, and other products.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure! Let's consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task.

**Relevant Table:**

- **`bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`**

**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- **`institution_name`**: To filter institutions whose names start with 'Bank'.
- **`established_date`**: To filter institutions established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000.
- **`total_assets`**: To calculate the sum of assets.
- **`state_name`**: To group data by state and identify the state with the highest sum of assets.
- **`fdic_certificate_number`**: To uniquely identify institutions (if needed).
- **`active`**: To filter active institutions (if necessary).

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **`institution_name LIKE 'Bank%'`**: To select institutions whose names start with 'Bank'.
- **`established_date BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'`**: To select institutions established within the specified date range.

---

Now, here are **10 BigQuery SQL queries** ranging from simple to complex to help understand the data:

1. **Select all columns from the institutions table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select institution names and established dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT institution_name, established_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select institutions established between 1900 and 2000:**

   ```sql
   SELECT institution_name, established_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE established_date BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Select institutions whose names start with 'Bank':**

   ```sql
   SELECT institution_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE institution_name LIKE 'Bank%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Select institutions whose names start with 'Bank' and established between 1900 and 2000:**

   ```sql
   SELECT institution_name, established_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE institution_name LIKE 'Bank%'
     AND established_date BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Select state names with total assets of institutions matching the criteria:**

   ```sql
   SELECT state_name, total_assets
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE institution_name LIKE 'Bank%'
     AND established_date BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Sum total assets by state for institutions matching the criteria:**

   ```sql
   SELECT state_name, SUM(total_assets) AS sum_total_assets
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE institution_name LIKE 'Bank%'
     AND established_date BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   GROUP BY state_name
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Order states by sum of total assets in descending order:**

   ```sql
   SELECT state_name, SUM(total_assets) AS sum_total_assets
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE institution_name LIKE 'Bank%'
     AND established_date BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   GROUP BY state_name
   ORDER BY sum_total_assets DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Identify the state with the highest sum of total assets:**

   ```sql
   SELECT state_name, SUM(total_assets) AS sum_total_assets
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE institution_name LIKE 'Bank%'
     AND established_date BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   GROUP BY state_name
   ORDER BY sum_total_assets DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

10. **Count the total number of banking institutions in the state with the highest sum of assets:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_institutions
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
    WHERE state_name = (
      SELECT state_name
      FROM (
        SELECT state_name, SUM(total_assets) AS sum_total_assets
        FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
        WHERE institution_name LIKE 'Bank%'
          AND established_date BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
        GROUP BY state_name
        ORDER BY sum_total_assets DESC
        LIMIT 1
      )
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    *Note:* In this query, we first identify the state with the highest sum of assets (from query 9) and then count all banking institutions in that state.

**Answer:**

```csv
State,Total_Number_of_Banking_Institutions
state_name:str,total_number:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

To solve the task, we:

1. **Identified Relevant Data:**
   - Used the `institutions` table from `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks`.
   - Relevant columns are `institution_name`, `established_date`, `total_assets`, and `state_name`.

2. **Applied Conditions:**
   - Filtered institutions where `institution_name` starts with 'Bank'.
   - Considered institutions established between **January 1, 1900**, and **December 31, 2000**.

3. **Computed Sum of Assets by State:**
   - Summed the `total_assets` for institutions matching the criteria, grouped by `state_name`.

4. **Identified the State with Highest Sum of Assets:**
   - Ordered the results in descending order and selected the top state.

5. **Counted Total Banking Institutions in That State:**
   - Counted all institutions in the identified state, regardless of name or establishment date.

The final result provides the **total number of all banking institutions** in the state with the highest sum of assets from banks matching the specified criteria.Query:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_banking_institutions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
WHERE state_name = (
  SELECT state_name

Task: What is the total number of all banking institutions in the state that has the highest sum of assets from banks established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000, with institution names starting with 'Bank'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
State,Total_Number_of_Banking_Institutions
state_name:str,total_number:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the total number of all banking institutions in the state with the highest sum of assets from banks established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000, with institution names starting with 'Bank', we:

1. **Filtered** the `institutions` table for banks:
   - Established between 1900-01-01 and 2000-12-31.
   - With `institution_name` starting with 'Bank'.
2. **Aggregated** the total assets for these banks by state.
3. **Identified** the state with the highest sum of assets.
4. **Counted** all banking institutions in that state..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
