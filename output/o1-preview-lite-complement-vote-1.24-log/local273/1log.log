**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **products**
   - `id`: Product identifier (used to join with other tables).
   - `name`: Product name (used to display product names).

2. **orderlines**
   - `order_id`: References `orders.id` (links to the order).
   - `product_id`: References `products.id` (identifies the product ordered).
   - `qty`: Quantity ordered (used to calculate total ordered quantity per product).

3. **picking_line**
   - `picklist_id`: References `picking_list.id` (identifies the picking list).
   - `line_no`: Line number in the picking list.
   - `order_id`: References `orders.id` (links to the order).
   - `product_id`: References `products.id` (identifies the product picked).
   - `qty`: Quantity picked (used to calculate total picked quantity per product).
   - `location_id`: References `locations.id` (identifies where the product was picked from).

4. **inventory**
   - `location_id`: References `locations.id` (identifies the inventory location).
   - `product_id`: References `products.id` (identifies the product in inventory).
   - `purchase_id`: References `purchases.id` (used to get purchase date).
   - `qty`: Quantity available in the inventory location (used to determine available inventory).

5. **purchases**
   - `id`: Purchase identifier.
   - `purchased`: Date of purchase (used to order inventory by earliest purchase date).
   - `product_id`: References `products.id` (identifies the purchased product).
   - `qty`: Quantity purchased (could be used to understand inventory levels).

6. **orders**
   - `id`: Order identifier.
   - `ordered`: Date the order was placed.

7. **locations**
   - `id`: Location identifier (used to associate inventory and picking lines).

**Potential Conditions:**

- **Joining Tables:**
  - Join `orderlines` with `products` on `product_id` to get product names and quantities ordered.
  - Join `picking_line` with `products` on `product_id` to get product names and quantities picked.
  - Join `picking_line` with `inventory` on `location_id` and `product_id` to identify inventory details for picked products.
  - Join `inventory` with `purchases` on `purchase_id` to get purchase dates for inventory items.

- **Ordering Criteria:**
  - Order inventory locations by earliest `purchases.purchased` date and smallest `inventory.qty`.

- **Calculations:**
  - Calculate total quantities ordered and picked per product.
  - Compute average pick percentage per product as:
    \[
    \text{Average Pick Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Picked Quantity}}{\text{Total Ordered Quantity}} \right) \times 100\%
    \]

Task: What is the average pick percentage for each product (by name), considering the quantity picked from inventory locations that are ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity, while ensuring that the picked quantity matches the overlapping range between the order quantity and the available inventory?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: Sure, here is the average pick percentage for each product:

```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product1:str,average_pick_percentage1:float
product2:str,average_pick_percentage2:float
...
```

**Explanation:** The average pick percentage for each product is calculated by comparing the quantity picked from inventory locations—ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity—to the ordered quantity. This ensures that the picked quantity aligns with the overlapping range between what was ordered and what was available in inventory..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 03:02:38 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the average pick percentage for each product (by name), considering the quantity picked from inventory locations that are ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity, while ensuring that the picked quantity matches the overlapping range between the order quantity and the available inventory?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Sure, here is the average pick percentage for each product:

```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product1:str,average_pick_percentage1:float
product2:str,average_pick_percentage2:float
...
```

**Explanation:** The average pick percentage for each product is calculated by comparing the quantity picked from inventory locations—ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity—to the ordered quantity. This ensures that the picked quantity aligns with the overlapping range between what was ordered and what was available in inventory. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
