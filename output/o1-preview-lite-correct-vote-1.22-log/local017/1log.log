Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine **in which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years**, we need to consider the relevant tables and columns.

**Relevant tables and columns:**

- **"collisions"** table:
  - `"case_id"`: To uniquely identify collisions and to join with other tables.
  - `"collision_date"`: To extract the year of the collision.
  - `"primary_collision_factor"`: Indicates the primary cause of the collision.

- **"case_ids"** table:
  - `"case_id"`: To join with the "collisions" table.
  - `"db_year"`: The year associated with each case.

**Potential usage and conditions:**

- Use `"primary_collision_factor"` to identify the causes of accidents.
- Extract the year from `"collision_date"` or use `"db_year"` from the "case_ids" table.
- Join the "collisions" and "case_ids" tables on `"case_id"` to associate collisions with their respective years.
- Group and count occurrences to find the most common causes per year.

---

**SQLite SQL queries to explore the data:**

1. **List distinct primary collision factors (causes) in the data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM "collisions"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct years from the "db_year" column:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "db_year"
   FROM "case_ids"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Extract distinct years from the collision dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT strftime('%Y', "collision_date") AS "year"
   FROM "collisions"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **View sample collision data with dates and primary causes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_id", "collision_date", "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM "collisions"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **View sample case IDs with their associated years:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_id", "db_year"
   FROM "case_ids"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Compare collision dates with "db_year" to check for consistency:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "collision_date", "db_year"
   FROM "collisions"
   JOIN "case_ids" USING("case_id")
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count the number of collisions per year using "db_year":**

   ```sql
   SELECT "db_year", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM "collisions"
   JOIN "case_ids" USING("case_id")
   GROUP BY "db_year"
   ORDER BY "db_year" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find the most common causes of collisions overall:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "count"
   FROM "collisions"
   GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find the most common causes of collisions per year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "db_year", "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "count"
   FROM "collisions"
   JOIN "case_ids" USING("case_id")
   GROUP BY "db_year", "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "db_year" ASC, "count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Identify the top causes in a specific year (e.g., 2020):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM "collisions"
    JOIN "case_ids" USING("case_id")
    WHERE "db_year" = 2020
    GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
    ORDER BY "count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

By executing these queries, we can:

- Understand the variety of collision causes in the dataset.
- Verify the years covered in the data.
- Examine the relationship between `"collision_date"` and `"db_year"`.
- Analyze the frequency of each collision cause overall and per year.

**Next steps:**

- Compare the top two causes for each year using the results from query 9.
- Identify any year(s) where the top two causes differ from the prevailing trends in other years.
- Focus on years where the top two causes are unique compared to other years.Query:

Task: In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year
year1:int
year2:int
...
```

(Explanation: These are the years in which the two most common causes of traffic accidents were different from those in other years.).
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 15:04:18 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year
year1:int
year2:int
...
```

(Explanation: These are the years in which the two most common causes of traffic accidents were different from those in other years.) The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
