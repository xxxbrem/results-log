After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have selected the following SQL as the correct answer:

```plaintext
2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Simplicity and Efficiency:** The SQL query in `2result.sql` is concise and directly computes the number of delivered orders per month for each year without the need for additional subqueries, joins, or Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

- **Correctness:** It accurately aggregates the data to produce the correct counts of delivered orders per month for the years 2016, 2017, and 2018, as evidenced by the matching results in `2result.csv`.

- **Inclusivity of All Months:** By using the `CASE` statement to map month numbers to month names and grouping by the month, it ensures all months are represented in the output, even if there are zero orders for a particular month.

- **Proper Ordering:** The query orders the months correctly from January to December by casting the month numbers to integers in the `ORDER BY` clause.

- **Readability:** The use of `strftime` functions and `CASE` statements makes the query readable and easier to understand, which facilitates maintenance and future modifications.

**Conclusion:**

The SQL query in `2result.sql` effectively fulfills the task requirements by generating a report that shows the number of delivered orders for each month in the years 2016, 2017, and 2018, with each column representing a year and each row representing a month.
