After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL that answers the question is `2result.sql`.

**Reasoning:**

- **Objective**: Find the quickplay event type with the lowest user retention rate during the second week after their initial engagement, for users who first engaged between August 1 and August 15, 2018.

- **`2result.sql` Explanation**:
  - Filters events where the `event_name` matches `%_quickplay` and users who first engaged between August 1 and August 15, 2018.
  - Calculates the total number of unique users (`user_pseudo_id`) per `event_name` (quickplay event type).
  - Determines the number of users who performed the same event during the second week after their initial engagement by using `DATE_DIFF` to calculate days since `user_first_touch_timestamp`.
  - Computes the retention rate by dividing the number of users who returned in the second week by the total number of users for each event type.

- **Result**: The event type `level_retry_quickplay` has the lowest second-week retention rate of **8.24%**, which directly answers the question.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

2result.sql
