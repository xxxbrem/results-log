*Note:* I've simplified the query by joining only on `gene_name` and `gene_symbol`, and removed the join conditions involving sample IDs and case IDs, which may not match directly between the datasets. This should allow the query to return results by correlating gene expression and protein abundance across all samples of each sample type.
