After comparing both SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is `1result.sql`.

**Reasoning:**

- **Explicit Date Filtering:** `1result.sql` explicitly filters the data to include only sessions from July 2017 using the condition `_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170731'`. This ensures that only data from the specified date range is considered, even if there are additional tables beyond July 2017.
  
- **Comprehensive Approach:** By selecting from all `ga_sessions_*` tables and applying the date filter, `1result.sql` is robust against any changes in table naming conventions or unexpected data outside the intended date range.
  
- **Readable Structure:** Utilizing Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with `WITH` clauses (`sessions`, `customers`, `purchases`) makes the query more organized, readable, and maintainable.

- **Accurate Results:** Both queries yield the same result, but `1result.sql` provides clearer intent and better practices for production-quality SQL.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

1result.sql
