Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- **`category`**: Used to group articles into different categories for the breakdown.
- **`body`**: Contains the full text of the article; can be searched for mentions of "education".
- **`title`**: Contains the title of the article; can also be searched for mentions of "education".
- **`filename`**: May serve as a unique identifier for each article but is not directly relevant to the task.

**Possible Conditions:**

- **Filtering articles that mention "education"**: `WHERE LOWER(body) LIKE '%education%'` or `WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%education%'`.
- **Grouping by category**: Using `GROUP BY category` to aggregate data per category.

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **Select all categories:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `category`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
2. **Count total articles:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_articles
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
3. **Count articles per category:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `category`, COUNT(*) AS total_articles
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   GROUP BY `category`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
4. **List article titles mentioning "education" in the body:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `title`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   WHERE LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
5. **Count articles mentioning "education" per category:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `category`, COUNT(*) AS articles_with_education
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   WHERE LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%'
   GROUP BY `category`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
6. **Calculate percentage of articles mentioning "education" per category:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     `category`,
     COUNTIF(LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%') / COUNT(*) * 100 AS percentage_mentioning_education
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   GROUP BY `category`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
7. **List filenames of articles in "Business" category:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `filename`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   WHERE `category` = 'business'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
8. **Find articles where the title contains "education":**
   ```sql
   SELECT `title`, `category`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%education%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
9. **Count total articles and articles mentioning "education" per category:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     `category`,
     COUNT(*) AS total_articles,
     SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS articles_with_education
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
   GROUP BY `category`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
10. **List categories with articles having "education" in the title or body:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `category`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.bbc_news.fulltext`
    WHERE LOWER(`title`) LIKE '%education%' OR LOWER(`body`) LIKE '%education%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution of articles across categories and how many of them mention "education" either in the body or title. They form the basis for calculating the required breakdown and percentages for the task.Query:

Task: Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News, the data can be structured as follows:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_Mentioning_Education
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Category**: The category of the BBC News articles (e.g., "Business", "Sports").
- **Total_Articles**: The total number of articles in each category.
- **Percentage_Mentioning_Education**: The percentage of articles within each category that mention "education". This value is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Articles Mentioning "Education"}}{\text{Total Articles}} \right) \times 100
  \].
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'bbc_news': ['fulltext']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 10:31:22 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News, the data can be structured as follows:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_Mentioning_Education
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Category**: The category of the BBC News articles (e.g., "Business", "Sports").
- **Total_Articles**: The total number of articles in each category.
- **Percentage_Mentioning_Education**: The percentage of articles within each category that mention "education". This value is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Articles Mentioning "Education"}}{\text{Total Articles}} \right) \times 100
  \] The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
