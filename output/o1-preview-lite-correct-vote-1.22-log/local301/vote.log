After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, the recommended SQL to use is **`1result.sql`**.

**Reason:**

- **Precise Date Selection:** The query in `1result.sql` accurately selects the exact four weeks before and after **June 15** for each year by using the `week_date` column from the `"cleaned_weekly_sales"` table. It does this by comparing dates directly, ensuring that the weeks chosen are precisely aligned with the dates in question.

- **Avoids Week Number Discrepancies:** Unlike `2result.sql`, which relies on `week_number`, `1result.sql` does not assume that week numbers correspond consistently across different years. This avoids potential errors due to variations in week numbering systems or calendar differences between years.

- **Uses Cleaned Data:** The query operates on the `"cleaned_weekly_sales"` table, which likely contains standardized and properly formatted date fields. This reduces the risk of errors that can occur from parsing and manipulating date strings, as seen in `0result.sql`.

- **Accurate Calculations:** The percentage changes calculated in `1result.sql` closely match the requirements by correctly computing the sales differences based on the specified periods for each year.

- **Consistent Results:** The results from `1result.sql` are consistent and reliable, making it a suitable choice for the analysis of sales performance around mid-June for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.
