The correct SQL is `1result.sql` because it accurately calculates the percentage change in sales by dynamically identifying the exact four weeks before and after June 15 for each year. Here's why this SQL is preferable:

1. **Dynamic Week Selection**:
   - **`1result.sql`** uses window functions and date comparisons to find the exact weeks before and after June 15 for each calendar year. This approach ensures that the analysis precisely captures the four weeks surrounding June 15, regardless of how weeks are numbered or how dates fall within weeks each year.
   - **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** either rely on hard-coded date ranges or fixed week numbers (e.g., weeks 21-24 and 25-28), which might not accurately represent the four-week periods across different years due to variations in how weeks align with dates annually.

2. **Accuracy in Percentage Change**:
   - The percentage changes calculated in **`1result.sql`** are consistent and accurate. The results for 2018 and 2019 match those in the other SQLs, but the difference in 2020 suggests a more precise calculation:
     - **`1result.sql`** shows a percentage change of **-0.4678%** for 2020.
     - **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** show a larger decrease of **-1.146%** for 2020.
   - By dynamically selecting the weeks, **`1result.sql`** accounts for any shifts in the calendar that might affect the data, leading to more reliable results.

3. **Use of Cleaned Data**:
   - **`1result.sql`** operates on the `"cleaned_weekly_sales"` table, which likely has properly formatted dates and cleaned data, reducing the risk of errors in date manipulation and calculations.
   - **`0result.sql`** works with the `"weekly_sales"` table and involves complex string parsing to handle date formats, which can introduce errors or inconsistencies.

4. **Robust SQL Structure**:
   - The SQL query in **`1result.sql`** uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into manageable parts:
     - Identifies weeks before and after June 15.
     - Selects the top four weeks in each category.
     - Calculates total sales for each period.
   - This structure enhances readability, maintainability, and reduces the likelihood of logical errors.

For these reasons, **`1result.sql`** is the most appropriate and accurate SQL for analyzing the percentage change in sales around mid-June for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.
