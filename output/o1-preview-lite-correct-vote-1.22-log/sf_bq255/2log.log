"tpm: TPM 2.0 baseline support

TPM 2.0 devices are separated by adding a field 'flags' to struct
tpm_chip and defining a flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 for tagging them.

This patch adds the following internal functions:

- tpm2_get_random()
- tpm2_get_tpm_pt()
- tpm2_pcr_extend()
- tpm2_pcr_read()
- tpm2_startup()

Additionally, the following exported functions are implemented for
implementing TPM 2.0 device drivers:

- tpm2_do_selftest()
- tpm2_calc_ordinal_durations()
- tpm2_gen_interrupt()

The existing functions that are exported for the use for existing
subsystems have been changed to check the flags field in struct
tpm_chip and use appropriate TPM 2.0 counterpart if
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is est.

The code for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration() and tpm2_startup() were
originally written by Will Arthur.

"tpm: device class for tpm

Added own device class for TPM. Uses MISC_MAJOR:TPM_MINOR for the
first character device in order to retain backwards compatibility.
Added tpm_dev_release() back attached to the character device.

I've been running this code now for a while on my laptop (Lenovo
T430S) TrouSerS works perfectly without modifications. I don't
believe it breaks anything significantly.

The sysfs attributes that have been placed under the wrong place
and are against sysfs-rules.txt should be probably left to
stagnate under platform device directory and start defining
new sysfs attributes to the char device directory.

Guidelines for future TPM sysfs attributes should be probably
along the lines of

- Single flat set of mandatory sysfs attributes. For example,
  current PPI interface is way way too rich when you only want
  to use it to clear and activate the TPM.

- Define sysfs attribute if and only if there's no way to get
  the value from ring-3. No attributes for TPM properties. It's
  just unnecessary maintenance hurdle that we don't want.

"vTPM: fix memory allocation flag for rtce buffer at kernel boot

At ibm vtpm initialzation, tpm_ibmvtpm_probe() registers its interrupt
handler, ibmvtpm_interrupt, which calls ibmvtpm_crq_process to allocate
memory for rtce buffer.  The current code uses 'GFP_KERNEL' as the
type of kernel memory allocation, which resulted a warning at

allocation is high-priority and does not sleep.

"tpm: TPM 2.0 baseline support

TPM 2.0 devices are separated by adding a field 'flags' to struct
tpm_chip and defining a flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 for tagging them.

This patch adds the following internal functions:

- tpm2_get_random()
- tpm2_get_tpm_pt()
- tpm2_pcr_extend()
- tpm2_pcr_read()
- tpm2_startup()

Additionally, the following exported functions are implemented for
implementing TPM 2.0 device drivers:

- tpm2_do_selftest()
- tpm2_calc_ordinal_durations()
- tpm2_gen_interrupt()

The existing functions that are exported for the use for existing
subsystems have been changed to check the flags field in struct
tpm_chip and use appropriate TPM 2.0 counterpart if
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is est.

The code for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration() and tpm2_startup() were
originally written by Will Arthur.

"tpm: device class for tpm

Added own device class for TPM. Uses MISC_MAJOR:TPM_MINOR for the
first character device in order to retain backwards compatibility.
Added tpm_dev_release() back attached to the character device.

I've been running this code now for a while on my laptop (Lenovo
T430S) TrouSerS works perfectly without modifications. I don't
believe it breaks anything significantly.

The sysfs attributes that have been placed under the wrong place
and are against sysfs-rules.txt should be probably left to
stagnate under platform device directory and start defining
new sysfs attributes to the char device directory.

Guidelines for future TPM sysfs attributes should be probably
along the lines of

- Single flat set of mandatory sysfs attributes. For example,
  current PPI interface is way way too rich when you only want
  to use it to clear and activate the TPM.

- Define sysfs attribute if and only if there's no way to get
  the value from ring-3. No attributes for TPM properties. It's
  just unnecessary maintenance hurdle that we don't want.

"vTPM: fix memory allocation flag for rtce buffer at kernel boot

At ibm vtpm initialzation, tpm_ibmvtpm_probe() registers its interrupt
handler, ibmvtpm_interrupt, which calls ibmvtpm_crq_process to allocate
memory for rtce buffer.  The current code uses 'GFP_KERNEL' as the
type of kernel memory allocation, which resulted a warning at
kernel/lockdep.c.  This patch uses 'GFP_ATOMIC' instead so that the
allocation is high-priority and does not sleep.

"clk: ti: move low-level access and init code under clock driver

With most of the clock code under clock driver already, the low-level
register access code, and the init code for the same, is no longer
needed outside the clock driver. Thus, these can be moved under clock
driver also.

2025-01-20 07:03:37 - snowflake.connector.connection - INFO - Snowflake Connector for Python Version: 3.12.4, Python Version: 3.11.11, Platform: Linux-6.1.38-x86_64-with-glibc2.31
2025-01-20 07:03:37 - snowflake.connector.connection - INFO - Connecting to GLOBAL Snowflake domain

2025-01-20 07:03:38 - snowflake.connector.connection - INFO - No async queries seem to be running, deleting session
2025-01-20 07:03:58 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 07:03:58 - root - INFO - The error occurs because the column names generated by the `FLATTEN` function are in uppercase by default in Snowflake. Specifically, the column is named `"KEY"`, not `"key"`. Snowflake is case-sensitive when column names are enclosed in double quotes.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT t."repo_name"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES t,
     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."language") f
WHERE f."KEY" = 'Shell'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Issue:** The original query refers to `f."key"`, which does not exist because the `FLATTEN` function outputs columns with uppercase names unless specified otherwise.
- **Solution:** Change `f."key"` to `f."KEY"` to match the actual column name generated by `FLATTEN`.

**Additional Details:**

- In Snowflake, the `FLATTEN` function outputs the following columns by default (in uppercase):
  - `"SEQ"`
  - `"KEY"`
  - `"PATH"`
  - `"INDEX"`
  - `"VALUE"`
  - `"THIS"`
- Since you are filtering based on the keys of a VARIANT data type (which is what `t."language"` likely is), ensure you refer to the correct column names.

**Next Steps:**

- Run the corrected query to pull the list of repositories that use the 'Shell' programming language.
- Use this list to join with other tables (`LICENSES` and `SAMPLE_COMMITS`) to construct the query that answers your original task.

**Example of the Complete Query to Answer the Task:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Commit_Message_Count"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_COMMITS c
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT t."repo_name"
    FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES t,
         LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."language") f
    WHERE f."KEY" = 'Shell'
) AS shell_repos ON c."repo_name" = shell_repos."repo_name"
INNER JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LICENSES l
    ON c."repo_name" = l."repo_name"
WHERE l."license" = 'apache-2.0'
  AND LENGTH(c."message") > 5
  AND LENGTH(c."message") < 10000
  AND LOWER(c."message") NOT LIKE 'merge%'
  AND LOWER(c."message") NOT LIKE 'update%'
  AND LOWER(c."message") NOT LIKE 'test%';
```

**Explanation:**

- **Filtering Repositories with 'Shell':** The subquery selects repositories where the `"language"` VARIANT contains a key `'Shell'`.
- **Joining with Commits and Licenses:**
  - Joins `SAMPLE_COMMITS` with repositories that use 'Shell'.
  - Joins with `LICENSES` to filter repositories with the 'apache-2.0' license.
- **Applying Message Conditions:**
  - Filters commit messages with length between 6 and 9,999 characters.
  - Ensures messages do not start with 'merge', 'update', or 'test' (case-insensitive).
- **Counting the Messages:**
  - Uses `COUNT(*)` to get the total number of commit messages that meet all criteria.

**Final Result Format:**

```csv
Commit_Message_Count
number:int >= 0 (Attention: answer in one row)
```

This will provide you with the count of commit messages as specified in your task.

"[flow] annotate accumulate and accumulateInto

Summary:
Trying to start adding flow types to files in React. I needed to add a script to package.json in order to run flow, flow-bin is already a dependency.

I had to rewrite the implementation a bit. Flow doesn't recognize

```
var currentIsArray = Array.isArray(current);
if (currentIsArray) {
  // not refined
}
```

but the following does work

```
if (Array.isArray(current)) {
  // refined
}
```

Test Plan:
npm run-script flow
npm run-script test accumulate

"[website] Fix jump on the header

Algolia adds two inline styles

```css
  position: relative;
  vertical-align: top;
```

to the element once the script inserted at the end of the page runs which super slightly moves the header. The fix is to always apply those two rules this way it doesn't jump. I did not notice it on my machine because it doesn't move when custom fonts are not being used.

Test Plan:
- Open two tabs: reactjs.com and localhost:4000/react
- Click around on reactjs.com to prime the cache with the fonts
- Switch tabs and click around on localhost (but do not force refresh!)
- Now you get custom fonts loaded locally and it doesn't jump when you change tabs

"Move guards from auto binding to event dispatch

This wraps a proper guard around event dispatching so that errors doesn't
interupt other event callbacks.

Instead we rethrow the first error after all callbacks have been invoked.

For DEV mode we use native event dispatching if available. This has the
benefit that caught exceptions show up in the dev tools even without caught
exceptions being turned on. Yet, all callbacks are guaranteed to fire.
"
"New class instantiation and initialization process

This allows state to be set up in the constructor instead of through
getInitialState. getInitialState is now considered part of ""classic"".
Therefore, they move into ReactClass's constructor.

As a consequence of this, we no longer have a mapping between the internal
representation and the public instance during the mounting process.
Because the constructor hasn't returned yet.

We used to have a special case for calling setState in getInitialState
which was just ignored. This makes that throw and the component is
considered unmounted during the construction phase.
"
"Hot fix cyclic dependency

We accidentally created an unfortunate cyclic dependency because of the
auto-wrapper hack that uses ReactClass.

Making it injected instead.
"
"Use strings as the type for DOM elements

This makes ReactDOM a simple helper for creating ReactElements with the string tag as the type. The actual class is internal and created by instantiateReactComponent. Configurable using injection.

There's not a separate class for each tag. There's just a generic ReactDOMComponent which could take any tag name.

Invididual tags can be wrapped. When wrapping happens you can return the same tag again. If the wrapper returns the same string, then we fall back to the generic component. This avoids recursion in a single level wrapper.

"tpm: TPM 2.0 baseline support

TPM 2.0 devices are separated by adding a field 'flags' to struct
tpm_chip and defining a flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 for tagging them.

This patch adds the following internal functions:

- tpm2_get_random()
- tpm2_get_tpm_pt()
- tpm2_pcr_extend()
- tpm2_pcr_read()
- tpm2_startup()

Additionally, the following exported functions are implemented for
implementing TPM 2.0 device drivers:

- tpm2_do_selftest()
- tpm2_calc_ordinal_durations()
- tpm2_gen_interrupt()

The existing functions that are exported for the use for existing
subsystems have been changed to check the flags field in struct
tpm_chip and use appropriate TPM 2.0 counterpart if
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is est.

The code for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration() and tpm2_startup() were
originally written by Will Arthur.

"tpm: device class for tpm

Added own device class for TPM. Uses MISC_MAJOR:TPM_MINOR for the
first character device in order to retain backwards compatibility.
Added tpm_dev_release() back attached to the character device.

I've been running this code now for a while on my laptop (Lenovo
T430S) TrouSerS works perfectly without modifications. I don't
believe it breaks anything significantly.

The sysfs attributes that have been placed under the wrong place
and are against sysfs-rules.txt should be probably left to
stagnate under platform device directory and start defining
new sysfs attributes to the char device directory.

Guidelines for future TPM sysfs attributes should be probably
along the lines of

- Single flat set of mandatory sysfs attributes. For example,
  current PPI interface is way way too rich when you only want
  to use it to clear and activate the TPM.

- Define sysfs attribute if and only if there's no way to get
  the value from ring-3. No attributes for TPM properties. It's
  just unnecessary maintenance hurdle that we don't want.

"tpm: TPM 2.0 baseline support

TPM 2.0 devices are separated by adding a field 'flags' to struct
tpm_chip and defining a flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 for tagging them.

This patch adds the following internal functions:

- tpm2_get_random()
- tpm2_get_tpm_pt()
- tpm2_pcr_extend()
- tpm2_pcr_read()
- tpm2_startup()

Additionally, the following exported functions are implemented for
implementing TPM 2.0 device drivers:

- tpm2_do_selftest()
- tpm2_calc_ordinal_durations()
- tpm2_gen_interrupt()

The existing functions that are exported for the use for existing
subsystems have been changed to check the flags field in struct
tpm_chip and use appropriate TPM 2.0 counterpart if
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is est.

The code for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration() and tpm2_startup() were
originally written by Will Arthur.

"tpm: device class for tpm

Added own device class for TPM. Uses MISC_MAJOR:TPM_MINOR for the
first character device in order to retain backwards compatibility.
Added tpm_dev_release() back attached to the character device.

I've been running this code now for a while on my laptop (Lenovo
T430S) TrouSerS works perfectly without modifications. I don't
believe it breaks anything significantly.

The sysfs attributes that have been placed under the wrong place
and are against sysfs-rules.txt should be probably left to
stagnate under platform device directory and start defining
new sysfs attributes to the char device directory.

Guidelines for future TPM sysfs attributes should be probably
along the lines of

- Single flat set of mandatory sysfs attributes. For example,
  current PPI interface is way way too rich when you only want
  to use it to clear and activate the TPM.

- Define sysfs attribute if and only if there's no way to get
  the value from ring-3. No attributes for TPM properties. It's
  just unnecessary maintenance hurdle that we don't want.

At ibm vtpm initialzation, tpm_ibmvtpm_probe() registers its interrupt

"[flow] annotate accumulate and accumulateInto

Summary:
Trying to start adding flow types to files in React. I needed to add a script to package.json in order to run flow, flow-bin is already a dependency.

I had to rewrite the implementation a bit. Flow doesn't recognize

```
var currentIsArray = Array.isArray(current);
if (currentIsArray) {
  // not refined
}
```

but the following does work

```
if (Array.isArray(current)) {
  // refined
}
```

Test Plan:
npm run-script flow
npm run-script test accumulate

"[website] Fix jump on the header

Algolia adds two inline styles

```css
  position: relative;
  vertical-align: top;
```

to the element once the script inserted at the end of the page runs which super slightly moves the header. The fix is to always apply those two rules this way it doesn't jump. I did not notice it on my machine because it doesn't move when custom fonts are not being used.

Test Plan:
- Open two tabs: reactjs.com and localhost:4000/react
- Click around on reactjs.com to prime the cache with the fonts
- Switch tabs and click around on localhost (but do not force refresh!)
- Now you get custom fonts loaded locally and it doesn't jump when you change tabs

"Move guards from auto binding to event dispatch

This wraps a proper guard around event dispatching so that errors doesn't
interupt other event callbacks.

Instead we rethrow the first error after all callbacks have been invoked.

For DEV mode we use native event dispatching if available. This has the
benefit that caught exceptions show up in the dev tools even without caught
exceptions being turned on. Yet, all callbacks are guaranteed to fire.
"
"New class instantiation and initialization process

This allows state to be set up in the constructor instead of through
getInitialState. getInitialState is now considered part of ""classic"".
Therefore, they move into ReactClass's constructor.

As a consequence of this, we no longer have a mapping between the internal
representation and the public instance during the mounting process.
Because the constructor hasn't returned yet.

We used to have a special case for calling setState in getInitialState
which was just ignored. This makes that throw and the component is
considered unmounted during the construction phase.
"
"Hot fix cyclic dependency

We accidentally created an unfortunate cyclic dependency because of the
auto-wrapper hack that uses ReactClass.

Making it injected instead.
"
"Use strings as the type for DOM elements

This makes ReactDOM a simple helper for creating ReactElements with the string tag as the type. The actual class is internal and created by instantiateReactComponent. Configurable using injection.

There's not a separate class for each tag. There's just a generic ReactDOMComponent which could take any tag name.

Invididual tags can be wrapped. When wrapping happens you can return the same tag again. If the wrapper returns the same string, then we fall back to the generic component. This avoids recursion in a single level wrapper.

Task: How many commit messages are there in repositories that use the 'Shell' programming language and 'apache-2.0' license, where the length of the commit message is more than 5 characters but less than 10,000 characters, and the messages do not start with the word 'merge', 'update' or 'test'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Commit_Message_Count
number:int >= 0 (Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

The number represents the count of commit messages in repositories that use the 'Shell' programming language and have the 'apache-2.0' license. These commit messages have a length between 6 and 9,999 characters and do not start with the words 'merge', 'update', or 'test'..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GITHUB_REPOS': {'GITHUB_REPOS': ['LANGUAGES', 'LICENSES', 'SAMPLE_COMMITS', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS', 'SAMPLE_FILES', 'SAMPLE_REPOS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 07:08:11 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many commit messages are there in repositories that use the 'Shell' programming language and 'apache-2.0' license, where the length of the commit message is more than 5 characters but less than 10,000 characters, and the messages do not start with the word 'merge', 'update' or 'test'?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Commit_Message_Count
number:int >= 0 (Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

The number represents the count of commit messages in repositories that use the 'Shell' programming language and have the 'apache-2.0' license. These commit messages have a length between 6 and 9,999 characters and do not start with the words 'merge', 'update', or 'test'. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
