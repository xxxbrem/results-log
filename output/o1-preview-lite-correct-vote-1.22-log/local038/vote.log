After comparing both SQL queries, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **SQL Standards Compliance:** In `1result.sql`, all the selected columns that are not used within an aggregate function (`a."first_name"`, `a."last_name"`) are included in the `GROUP BY` clause. This adheres to SQL standards and ensures compatibility across different SQL database systems.
  
  ```sql
  GROUP BY a."actor_id", a."first_name", a."last_name"
  ```
  
- In `2result.sql`, the `GROUP BY` clause only includes `a.actor_id`. While some SQL implementations allow this due to functional dependency (since `actor_id` is unique, `first_name` and `last_name` are functionally dependent on it), not all databases accept this syntax. This may cause issues in databases that strictly enforce the inclusion of all selected non-aggregate columns in the `GROUP BY` clause.

  ```sql
  GROUP BY a.actor_id
  ```

**Conclusion:**

- **`1result.sql`** is more universally correct and compliant with SQL standards.
- It ensures that the query will work as expected across different database systems without causing errors due to `GROUP BY` clause requirements.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

1result.sql
