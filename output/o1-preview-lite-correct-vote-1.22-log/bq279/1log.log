Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we need to analyze the `bikeshare_stations` and `bikeshare_trips` tables from the `austin_bikeshare` schema.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`**
   - `station_id`: Unique identifier for each station (used to identify stations).
   - `status`: Indicates the status of the station (e.g., 'active', 'closed') (used to determine if a station is active or closed).
   - `modified_date`: Timestamp of the last modification (used to determine the year a station was closed or modified).

2. **`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`**
   - `start_station_id`: ID of the station where a trip started (used to identify active stations).
   - `start_time`: Timestamp when the trip started (used to extract the year for filtering trips in 2013 and 2014).
   - `end_station_id`: ID of the station where a trip ended (also used to identify active stations).

**Sample SQL Queries:**

Below are 10 different BigQuery SQL queries to understand the data in the relevant columns.

1. **Select distinct station IDs from the stations table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `station_id`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select station IDs and their status:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `station_id`, `status`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select trips in 2013 with their start station IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `start_station_id`, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `start_time`) AS year
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `start_time`) = 2013
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Select trips in 2014 with their start station IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `start_station_id`, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `start_time`) AS year
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `start_time`) = 2014
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Select stations modified in 2013 with their status:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `station_id`, `status`, `modified_date`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `modified_date`) = 2013
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Select stations that were closed in 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `station_id`, `status`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   WHERE `status` = 'closed' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `modified_date`) = 2013
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Select active stations from the stations table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `station_id`, `status`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   WHERE `status` = 'active'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Select distinct bike IDs used in trips during 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `bike_id`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `start_time`) = 2013
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Select the first 100 trips ordered by start time:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `trip_id`, `start_time`, `start_station_id`, `end_station_id`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   ORDER BY `start_time` ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Select the number of docks for each station:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `station_id`, `number_of_docks`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help us understand the data needed to calculate the number of active and closed stations for each year.

**Answer:**

```csv
Year,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_closed
2013,num_active:int,num_closed:int
2014,num_active:int,num_closed:int

Task: Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we analyze the `bikeshare_stations` and `bikeshare_trips` tables from the `austin_bikeshare` schema. Active stations are those with recorded trips in a given year, while closed stations are those marked as closed in the stations table with a modification date in the respective year.

```csv
Year,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_closed
2013,num_active:int,num_closed:int
2014,num_active:int,num_closed:int
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'austin_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'austin_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_stations', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'austin_crime': ['crime'], 'austin_incidents': ['incidents_2008', 'incidents_2009', 'incidents_2010', 'incidents_2011', 'incidents_2016'], 'austin_waste': ['waste_and_diversion']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

This query calculates the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014 by:

- Selecting all start and end station IDs from trips in 2013 and 2014.
- Joining these station IDs with the `bikeshare_stations` table to get their current status.
- Counting the distinct station IDs for each status ('active' or 'closed') per year.

**Note:** According to the data, there are no stations that were marked as 'closed' during 2013 or 2014. Therefore, the `Number_of_Stations_closed` column will be zero for both years.

This query calculates:

- **Number_of_Stations_active**: The number of distinct bike share stations that had trips in each year (2013 and 2014).
- **Number_of_Stations_closed**: For 2014, the number of stations that were active in 2013 but had no trips in 2014, indicating they were possibly closed in 2014. For 2013, this number is 0.

**Explanation:**

- **stations2013** and **stations2014**: These common table expressions (CTEs) list all the unique station IDs that had trips in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
- The main query counts the number of active stations for each year.
- For 2014, it calculates the number of stations that were active in 2013 but not in 2014 by finding station IDs present in `stations2013` but not in `stations2014`.

**Note:** This method assumes that if a station had trips in 2013 but none in 2014, it was closed in 2014. Due to data limitations, this is an approximation.

The answer format should be like: To determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we analyze the `bikeshare_stations` and `bikeshare_trips` tables from the `austin_bikeshare` schema. Active stations are those with recorded trips in a given year, while closed stations are those marked as closed in the stations table with a modification date in the respective year.

In this query, we determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014 by analyzing the `bikeshare_stations` and `bikeshare_trips` tables from the `austin_bikeshare` schema.

- **Active stations** are those with recorded trips in a given year.
- **Closed stations** are those marked as closed in the stations table with a modification date in the respective year.

**Explanation:**

1. **Active Stations:**
   - We aggregate the counts of distinct `start_station_id` and `end_station_id` from the `bikeshare_trips` table for each year.
   - This gives us the total number of unique stations that were active (had trips) in each year.

2. **Closed Stations:**
   - We count the distinct `station_id` from the `bikeshare_stations` table where the `status` is 'closed' and the `modified_date` falls in the respective year.
   - This provides the number of stations that were marked as closed in each year.

3. **Combining Results:**
   - We perform a `LEFT JOIN` on the years to combine the counts of active and closed stations.
   - We use `COALESCE` to handle any `NULL` values by replacing them with `0`.

**Note:** Keep in mind that based on the data available, the `Number_of_Stations_closed` may be zero if there are no stations with `status` 'closed' and a `modified_date` in 2013 or 2014.
