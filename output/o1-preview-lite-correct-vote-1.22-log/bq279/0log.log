Begin Exploring Related Columns
To provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we need to consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`

  - `station_id`: Unique identifier for each bike share station. *Potential usage:* Identifying and counting stations.
  - `status`: Indicates whether a station is "active" or "closed". *Potential usage:* Determining the status of stations.
  - `modified_date`: Timestamp of the last modification to the station's status. *Potential usage:* Determining when a station's status was changed.

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`

  - `start_station_id` and `end_station_id`: Identifiers of stations where trips start and end. *Potential usage:* Identifying active stations based on trips.
  - `start_time`: Timestamp when the trip started. *Potential usage:* Filtering trips by year to determine active stations in that year.
  
**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Filtering trips by year:** Using `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2013` or `2014` to get trips from specific years.
- **Determining station status:** Checking if `status = 'active'` or `status = 'closed'`.
- **Filtering by modification date:** Using `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) = 2013` or `2014` to find stations modified in those years.
- **Counting distinct stations:** Using `COUNT(DISTINCT station_id)` to get the number of unique stations.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Check distinct station statuses:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT status
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List years from modified_date in stations table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) AS year
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Stations modified in 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT station_id, name, status, modified_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) = 2013
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Stations modified in 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT station_id, name, status, modified_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) = 2014
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Total trips per year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) AS year, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   GROUP BY year
   ORDER BY year
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Active stations based on trips in 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT start_station_id) AS active_stations_2013
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2013
     AND start_station_id IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Active stations based on trips in 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT start_station_id) AS active_stations_2014
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2014
     AND start_station_id IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Closed stations in 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT station_id, status, modified_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   WHERE status = 'closed'
     AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) = 2013
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Closed stations in 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT station_id, status, modified_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
   WHERE status = 'closed'
     AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) = 2014
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Number of closed stations per year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) AS year, COUNT(DISTINCT station_id) AS closed_stations
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
    WHERE status = 'closed'
      AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) IN (2013, 2014)
    GROUP BY year
    ORDER BY year
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Number of active stations per year (based on status):**

    ```sql
    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) AS year, COUNT(DISTINCT station_id) AS active_stations
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
    WHERE status = 'active'
      AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) <= 2014
    GROUP BY year
    HAVING year IN (2013, 2014)
    ORDER BY year
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Active stations per year (based on trips data):**

    ```sql
    SELECT year, COUNT(DISTINCT station_id) AS active_stations
    FROM (
      SELECT start_station_id AS station_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) AS year
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
      WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) IN (2013, 2014)
        AND start_station_id IS NOT NULL
    )
    GROUP BY year
    ORDER BY year
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Aggregate active and closed stations for 2013 and 2014:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      year,
      COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN station_id END) AS Number_of_Stations_active,
      COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN status = 'closed' THEN station_id END) AS Number_of_Stations_closed
    FROM (
      SELECT station_id, status, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM modified_date) AS year
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`

    FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` s
    WHERE s.status = 'closed'
      AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM s.modified_date) = 2014
      AND s.station_id IN (

Task: Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we analyze the `bikeshare_stations` and `bikeshare_trips` tables from the `austin_bikeshare` schema. Active stations are those with recorded trips in a given year, while closed stations are those marked as closed in the stations table with a modification date in the respective year.

```csv
Year,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_closed
2013,num_active:int,num_closed:int
2014,num_active:int,num_closed:int
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'austin_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'austin_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_stations', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'austin_crime': ['crime'], 'austin_incidents': ['incidents_2008', 'incidents_2009', 'incidents_2010', 'incidents_2011', 'incidents_2016'], 'austin_waste': ['waste_and_diversion']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we analyze the `bikeshare_stations` and `bikeshare_trips` tables from the `austin_bikeshare` schema. Active stations are those with recorded trips in a given year, while closed stations are those marked as closed in the stations table with a modification date in the respective year.

The answer format should be like: To determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we analyze the `bikeshare_stations` and `bikeshare_trips` tables from the `austin_bikeshare` schema. Active stations are those with recorded trips in a given year, while closed stations are those marked as closed in the stations table with a modification date in the respective year.

```csv
Year,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_closed
2013,num_active:int,num_closed:int
2014,num_active:int,num_closed:int
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Based on the available data, there are no stations marked as 'closed' in the `bikeshare_stations` table for the years 2013 and 2014. Therefore, the Number_of_Stations_closed is zero for both years.
