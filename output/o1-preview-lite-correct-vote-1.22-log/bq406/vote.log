Both SQL scripts aim to calculate the growth rates for various demographic groups from 2014 to 2022 concerning the overall workforce. Here's a comparison of the two:

---

**1result.sql**

- **Approach:**
  - Uses two Common Table Expressions (CTEs), `base_year` and `latest_year`, to separately extract data for 2014 and 2022.
  - Joins these CTEs on the `Demographic` field to align the data for calculations.
  - Introduces an `OrderField` to maintain a specific order in the final output.
- **Calculation:**
  - Computes the growth rate using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Growth\_Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Value}_{2022} - \text{Value}_{2014}}{\text{Value}_{2014}} \right) \times 100
    \]
- **Result:**
  - Provides growth rates with demographics in a predefined order for clarity.

**2result.sql**

- **Approach:**
  - Utilizes a single CTE, `data`, which gathers all required data for both years (2014 and 2022) in a unified format.
  - Employs conditional aggregation to pivot the data and extract values for 2014 and 2022.
- **Calculation:**
  - Uses the same growth rate formula as `1result.sql`.
- **Result:**
  - Outputs growth rates with demographics sorted alphabetically.

**Comparison:**

- **Accuracy:** Both scripts correctly compute the growth rates, yielding identical results.
- **Clarity:** `1result.sql` structures the data with explicit ordering using `OrderField`, making the output more user-friendly and easier to interpret.
- **Maintainability:** `1result.sql` separates concerns by using individual CTEs for base and latest years, which can simplify updates if additional years are included in the future.
- **Performance:** While both are efficient, `1result.sql` might perform better with large datasets due to simpler joins versus conditional aggregation.

**Conclusion:**

While both SQL scripts produce correct and identical results, **`1result.sql`** offers better clarity and structure by maintaining a specific order of demographics and separating data extraction for each year. This makes it easier to understand and maintain.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:
