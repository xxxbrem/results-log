After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct and most suitable answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Simplicity and Clarity:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses a straightforward approach by selecting the top player for each statistic using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT 1` within subqueries.
   - The query is easy to read and understand, making it more maintainable and efficient.

2. **Efficiency:**
   - By utilizing `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT 1` directly in the subqueries, the database can optimize the retrieval of the top result without processing unnecessary data.
   - This approach avoids the overhead of additional subqueries or Common Table Expressions (CTEs) used in the other SQL scripts.

3. **Correctness of Results:**
   - The results from **`0result.sql`** accurately identify the players with the highest totals in each category:
     - **Games played:** Peter Edward (Pete Rose) with 3,562 games.
     - **Runs:** Rickey Nelson Henley (Rickey Henderson) with 2,295 runs.
     - **Hits:** Peter Edward (Pete Rose) with 4,256 hits.
     - **Home runs:** Barry Lamar (Barry Bonds) with 762 home runs.
   - These values align with historical baseball records.

4. **Avoidance of Unnecessary Complexity:**
   - **`1result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** introduce additional complexity with nested subqueries and CTEs, which are not necessary for obtaining the desired results.
   - While they produce the same results, the added complexity can impact query performance and readability.

**Conclusion:**

Given its simplicity, efficiency, and correctness, **`0result.sql`** is the preferred SQL script to answer the question.
