Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine which customer has the highest average monthly change in payment amounts, we'll need to examine the relevant tables and columns, and understand how they can be used in our analysis.

---

### **Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`payment`** (Contains payment transactions)
   - **`payment_id`**: Unique identifier for each payment.
   - **`customer_id`**: References the customer who made the payment.
   - **`amount`**: The payment amount.
   - **`payment_date`**: The date and time when the payment was made.
   - **`last_update`**: Timestamp of the last update.

2. **`customer`** (Contains customer information)
   - **`customer_id`**: Unique identifier for each customer.
   - **`first_name`**: Customer's first name.
   - **`last_name`**: Customer's last name.
   - **`email`**: Customer's email address.
   - **`create_date`**: Date when the customer record was created.
   - **`last_update`**: Timestamp of the last update.

---

### **Potential Usage of Columns and Conditions:**

- **`payment.customer_id`**: To link payments to customers.
- **`payment.amount`**: To calculate payment amounts per customer per month.
- **`payment.payment_date`**: To determine the month and year of each payment.
- **Group By Conditions**: Group payments by customer and by month to calculate monthly totals.
- **Time Functions**: Extract year and month from `payment_date` for grouping.
- **Calculations**: Compute the change in monthly payments for each customer.
- **Aggregations**: Use `SUM`, `AVG`, and other aggregate functions to analyze payment data.
- **Ordering**: Order results to identify the customer with the highest average change.

---

### **Sample SQL Queries:**

Here are 10 different SQL queries to explore the data and understand the values in the relevant columns:

1. **Retrieve a list of all customer IDs from the `payment` table:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "customer_id" FROM "payment" LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **Get payment amounts and dates for a specific customer (e.g., customer with ID 1):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "amount", "payment_date" FROM "payment" WHERE "customer_id" = 1 ORDER BY "payment_date" LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **List total payment amounts per customer:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_paid" FROM "payment" GROUP BY "customer_id" LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Extract year and month from payment dates:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "payment_id", "customer_id", strftime('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "year_month", "amount" FROM "payment" LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **Calculate monthly total payments for each customer:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customer_id", strftime('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "year_month", SUM("amount") AS "monthly_total"
    FROM "payment"
    GROUP BY "customer_id", "year_month"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Retrieve first and last names of all customers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customer_id", "first_name", "last_name" FROM "customer" LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Find customers who have made payments in a specific month (e.g., January 2020):**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "customer_id" FROM "payment"
    WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', "payment_date") = '2020-01'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. **List payments greater than a certain amount (e.g., $50):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "payment_id", "customer_id", "amount", "payment_date" FROM "payment"
    WHERE "amount" > 50
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **Identify customers with the highest total payments:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_paid" FROM "payment"
    GROUP BY "customer_id"
    ORDER BY "total_paid" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **Get the number of payments made by each customer:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customer_id", COUNT("payment_id") AS "payment_count" FROM "payment"
    GROUP BY "customer_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

These queries allow us to explore the key aspects of the data:

- **Customer Payment Patterns**: By examining payment amounts and dates, we can identify patterns and trends in customer payments.
- **Monthly Aggregations**: Grouping payments by month helps in calculating the monthly totals and changes required for this analysis.
- **Customer Information**: Retrieving customer names allows us to associate payment data with customer identities.
- **Data Preparation**: Understanding the data distribution and values assists in preparing for the computation of average monthly changes.

---

By analyzing the results of these queries, we can proceed to calculate the average monthly changes in payment amounts for each customer and identify the one with the highest average change. This customer’s full name can then be retrieved from the `customer` table.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT "customer_id" FROM "payment" LIMIT 100;

Task: Which customer has the highest average monthly change in payment amounts? Provide the customer's full name.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
First_Name,Last_Name
first_name:str,last_name:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

To find the customer with the highest average monthly change in payment amounts, we need to:

1. **Calculate Monthly Payment Totals**: For each customer, calculate the total payment amounts for each month.

2. **Compute Monthly Changes**: For each customer, compute the month-to-month changes in their payment totals.

3. **Calculate Average Change**: Calculate the average of these monthly changes for each customer.

4. **Identify the Highest Average**: Determine which customer has the highest average monthly change.

Since we don't have the actual data, we've provided placeholders for the customer's first and last names indicating their data types (`str`). The result is limited to one row, as we're only interested in the customer with the highest average monthly change in payment amounts..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 16:00:57 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which customer has the highest average monthly change in payment amounts? Provide the customer's full name., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
First_Name,Last_Name
first_name:str,last_name:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

To find the customer with the highest average monthly change in payment amounts, we need to:

1. **Calculate Monthly Payment Totals**: For each customer, calculate the total payment amounts for each month.

2. **Compute Monthly Changes**: For each customer, compute the month-to-month changes in their payment totals.

3. **Calculate Average Change**: Calculate the average of these monthly changes for each customer.

4. **Identify the Highest Average**: Determine which customer has the highest average monthly change.

Since we don't have the actual data, we've provided placeholders for the customer's first and last names indicating their data types (`str`). The result is limited to one row, as we're only interested in the customer with the highest average monthly change in payment amounts. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
