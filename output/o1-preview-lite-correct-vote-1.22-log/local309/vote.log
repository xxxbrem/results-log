After comparing the SQL scripts and their results, I have chosen `0result.sql` as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Alignment with the Task:** The task is to identify, for each year, the driver and the constructor who scored the most points. The SQL script in `0result.sql` correctly computes the total points per driver and per constructor for each year.
- **Correct Aggregation:** It uses appropriate SQL aggregations (`SUM`) to calculate total points and finds the maximum points per year for both drivers and constructors.
- **Output Format:** The final output provides, for each year, the full name of the driver and the name of the constructor who scored the most points, matching the requested format.
- **Structure and Clarity:** The SQL script employs Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize the subqueries clearly, making it easier to understand and verify the logic.

**Note:** While the driver and constructor may not be directly associated (the driver may not have driven for that constructor in that year), the task specifies to identify the driver and constructor who independently scored the most points each year. This script fulfills that requirement.
