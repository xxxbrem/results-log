After comparing both SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is:

```plain
0result.sql
```

**Reason:**

The SQL query in `0result.sql` correctly identifies commuters traveling over one hour by using the MetricIDs `'B08303_012E'` (60 to 89 minutes) and `'B08303_013E'` (90 or more minutes). It sums the census values for these MetricIDs per ZIP code within New York State and selects the ZIP code with the highest number of such commuters.

The result shows that ZIP code `11236` has the highest number of commuters traveling over one hour, with `TotalCommuters` of `18945.09`. The state benchmark and state population are also correctly included.

On the other hand, `2result.sql` includes MetricID `'B08303_011E'`, which corresponds to commuters traveling **45 to 59 minutes**, thus including commuters who travel **less than one hour**. This does not align with the requirement to focus only on commuters traveling **over one hour**.

Therefore, `0result.sql` is the correct SQL because it accurately addresses the task by using the appropriate MetricIDs for commuters traveling over one hour.
