**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all unique states available in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT nppes_provider_state
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find the top 100 drugs by total claim count in New York State:**

   ```sql
   SELECT drug_name, SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   WHERE nppes_provider_state = 'NY'
   GROUP BY drug_name
   ORDER BY total_claims DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Identify the drug with the highest total prescriptions in New York State:**

   ```sql
   SELECT drug_name, SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   WHERE nppes_provider_state = 'NY'
   GROUP BY drug_name
   ORDER BY total_claims DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

4. **Get total claim counts and drug costs for all drugs in New York State:**

   ```sql
   SELECT drug_name, SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims, SUM(total_drug_cost) AS total_cost
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   WHERE nppes_provider_state = 'NY'
   GROUP BY drug_name
   ORDER BY total_claims DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **For the top drug identified, list total claim counts and costs per state:**

   Assuming the top drug is called `'TopDrug'` (replace `'TopDrug'` with the actual drug name identified in query 3):

   ```sql
   SELECT nppes_provider_state, SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims, SUM(total_drug_cost) AS total_cost
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   WHERE drug_name = 'TopDrug'
   GROUP BY nppes_provider_state
   ORDER BY total_claims DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List the top five states with the highest total claim counts for the top drug:**

   ```sql
   SELECT nppes_provider_state, SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims, SUM(total_drug_cost) AS total_cost
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   WHERE drug_name = 'TopDrug'
   GROUP BY nppes_provider_state
   ORDER BY total_claims DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

7. **Calculate the average cost per claim for the top drug in each state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT nppes_provider_state, SUM(total_drug_cost)/SUM(total_claim_count) AS avg_cost_per_claim
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   WHERE drug_name = 'TopDrug'
   GROUP BY nppes_provider_state
   ORDER BY avg_cost_per_claim DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List providers in New York who prescribed the top drug, sorted by total claims:**

   ```sql
   SELECT npi, nppes_provider_last_org_name, nppes_provider_first_name, SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   WHERE nppes_provider_state = 'NY' AND drug_name = 'TopDrug'
   GROUP BY npi, nppes_provider_last_org_name, nppes_provider_first_name
   ORDER BY total_claims DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find the total number of beneficiaries for the top drug in each state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT nppes_provider_state, SUM(bene_count) AS total_beneficiaries
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`

   ORDER BY total_beneficiaries DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List the top 10 drugs nationally by total claim counts:**

    ```sql
    SELECT drug_name, SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
    GROUP BY drug_name
    ORDER BY total_claims DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

11. **Get the total drug cost for each state for the top drug:**

    ```sql
    SELECT nppes_provider_state, SUM(total_drug_cost) AS total_cost
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
    WHERE drug_name = 'TopDrug'
    GROUP BY nppes_provider_state
    ORDER BY total_cost DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Identify the top 5 providers nationally who prescribed the top drug the most:**

    ```sql
    SELECT npi, nppes_provider_state, SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
    WHERE drug_name = 'TopDrug'
    GROUP BY npi, nppes_provider_state

Task: For the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, could you list the top five states with the highest total claim counts for this drug? Please also include their total claim counts and total drug costs. 

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
State,Total_Claim_Count,Total_Drug_Cost
state1:str,claim_count1:int,drug_cost1:float
state2:str,claim_count2:int,drug_cost2:float
state3:str,claim_count3:int,drug_cost3:float
state4:str,claim_count4:int,drug_cost4:float
state5:str,claim_count5:int,drug_cost5:float
(Attention: answer in five rows)
```

To solve this task, we first identified the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014 by summing the `total_claim_count` for each `drug_name` where `nppes_provider_state` is 'NY'. After determining the top drug, we then calculated the total claim counts and total drug costs for this drug across all states. We aggregated the data by state, summing `total_claim_count` and `total_drug_cost`, and selected the top five states with the highest total claim counts. The results are presented in the table above..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['hcpcs', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd10_procedures_2019', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['home_health_agencies_2013', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'hospital_general_info', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['care_site', 'concept', 'concept_ancestor', 'concept_class', 'concept_relationship', 'condition_era', 'condition_occurrence', 'cost', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'domain', 'dose_era', 'drug_era', 'drug_exposure', 'drug_strength', 'location', 'observation', 'observation_period', 'payer_plan_period', 'person', 'procedure_occurrence', 'provider', 'relationship', 'vocabulary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 09:09:13 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, could you list the top five states with the highest total claim counts for this drug? Please also include their total claim counts and total drug costs. , reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
State,Total_Claim_Count,Total_Drug_Cost
state1:str,claim_count1:int,drug_cost1:float
state2:str,claim_count2:int,drug_cost2:float
state3:str,claim_count3:int,drug_cost3:float
state4:str,claim_count4:int,drug_cost4:float
state5:str,claim_count5:int,drug_cost5:float
(Attention: answer in five rows)
```

To solve this task, we first identified the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014 by summing the `total_claim_count` for each `drug_name` where `nppes_provider_state` is 'NY'. After determining the top drug, we then calculated the total claim counts and total drug costs for this drug across all states. We aggregated the data by state, summing `total_claim_count` and `total_drug_cost`, and selected the top five states with the highest total claim counts. The results are presented in the table above. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
