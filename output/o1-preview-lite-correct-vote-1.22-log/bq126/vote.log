After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **2result.sql** is the correct SQL for the task. This query not only applies all the required conditions but also ensures that the `title`, `medium`, and `original_image_url` fields are not null or empty, which is essential since we need these values in the output. It filters objects that:

- Are from the 'Photographs' department.
- Have 'Photograph' in their `object_name`.
- Have an `object_end_date` of 1839 or earlier.
- Were created by known artists.
- Have non-null and non-empty `title`, `medium`, and `original_image_url`.

Here's the name of the correct SQL file:

2result.sql
