After examining the SQL queries and their respective results, I conclude that **Option 1's SQL** correctly answers the question.

**Reasoning:**

- **Option 1** uses the `ecommerce.transaction_id` to identify transactions where the "Google Navy Speckled Tee" was purchased. By focusing on `transaction_id`, it ensures that we are considering products purchased in the **same transaction** as the tee, accurately reflecting items bought alongside it.

- **Option 0** relies on `user_pseudo_id` to find users who purchased the tee but then aggregates all products these users bought, regardless of whether they were purchased alongside the tee or in separate transactions. This approach could include items that were not bought together with the tee, thus not accurately representing products purchased alongside it.

- **Option 2** utilizes `event_timestamp` to find events when the tee was purchased. However, since multiple events can belong to the same transaction, and transactions can span multiple events, this method might not capture all items purchased in the same transaction or might include items not purchased together.

By using `ecommerce.transaction_id`, **Option 1's SQL** effectively identifies all items purchased in the same transaction as the "Google Navy Speckled Tee." According to its result, the product purchased with the highest total quantity alongside the tee is **"YouTube Twill Sandwich Cap Black"** with a total quantity of **7,922**.
