These queries progressively explore the data to identify the top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values, considering the most recent available data. They utilize joins, subqueries, ordering, and aggregation to provide comprehensive insights into Russia's debt indicators.Query:

Task: What are the top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Indicator_Name,Total_Debt_Value_USD
External debt stocks, total (DOD, current US$),478666479000
External debt stocks, private non-guaranteed (PNG) (DOD, current US$),387752127000
External debt stocks, short-term (DOD, current US$),103748000000
```

The top three debt indicators for Russia, based on the highest debt values, are:

1. **External debt stocks, total (DOD, current US$)**: This represents the total external debt Russia owes to foreign creditors. As of the latest data available, the total external debt is approximately **$478.67 billion USD**.

2. **External debt stocks, private non-guaranteed (PNG) (DOD, current US$)**: This indicator measures the external debt owed by the private sector that is not guaranteed by the public sector. For Russia, this amounts to about **$387.75 billion USD**.

3. **External debt stocks, short-term (DOD, current US$)**: This refers to external debt with an original maturity of one year or less. Russia's short-term external debt is around **$103.75 billion USD**.

These figures reflect Russia's major debt obligations and are critical for assessing the country's external debt sustainability and financial risk exposure..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'world_bank_global_population': ['population_by_country'], 'world_bank_health_population': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'health_nutrition_population', 'series_summary', 'series_times'], 'world_bank_intl_debt': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'international_debt', 'series_summary', 'series_times'], 'world_bank_intl_education': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'international_education', 'series_summary'], 'world_bank_wdi': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'footnotes', 'indicators_data', 'series_summary', 'series_time']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 12:47:45 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Indicator_Name,Total_Debt_Value_USD
External debt stocks, total (DOD, current US$),478666479000
External debt stocks, private non-guaranteed (PNG) (DOD, current US$),387752127000
External debt stocks, short-term (DOD, current US$),103748000000
```

The top three debt indicators for Russia, based on the highest debt values, are:

1. **External debt stocks, total (DOD, current US$)**: This represents the total external debt Russia owes to foreign creditors. As of the latest data available, the total external debt is approximately **$478.67 billion USD**.

2. **External debt stocks, private non-guaranteed (PNG) (DOD, current US$)**: This indicator measures the external debt owed by the private sector that is not guaranteed by the public sector. For Russia, this amounts to about **$387.75 billion USD**.

3. **External debt stocks, short-term (DOD, current US$)**: This refers to external debt with an original maturity of one year or less. Russia's short-term external debt is around **$103.75 billion USD**.

These figures reflect Russia's major debt obligations and are critical for assessing the country's external debt sustainability and financial risk exposure. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-23 12:49:24 - root - INFO - Apologies for the error. The issue arises because the `international_debt` table in the `world_bank_intl_debt` dataset may not contain data for the Russian Federation for the latest year, or the `indicator_name` matching is case-sensitive. To resolve this, we'll use the `indicators_data` table from the `world_bank_wdi` dataset, which contains comprehensive debt data for Russia. We'll also make the `indicator_name` comparison case-insensitive using the `LOWER()` function.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
  indicator_name AS Indicator_Name, 
  ROUND(value, 4) AS Total_Debt_Value_USD
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`
WHERE country_name = 'Russian Federation' 
  AND value IS NOT NULL 
  AND year = (
    SELECT MAX(year)
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`
    WHERE country_name = 'Russian Federation' AND value IS NOT NULL
  )
  AND LOWER(indicator_name) LIKE '%debt%'
ORDER BY value DESC
LIMIT 3;
