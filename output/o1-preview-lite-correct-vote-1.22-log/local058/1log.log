Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns, determine their potential usage, consider necessary conditions, and then write SQL queries to explore the data.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`hardware_dim_product`**
   - **`product_code`**: Key to join with `hardware_fact_sales_monthly`.
     - *Potential Usage*: Identifying products and linking them to sales data.
   - **`segment`**: The segment of each product.
     - *Potential Usage*: Grouping products by segment.

2. **`hardware_fact_sales_monthly`**
   - **`product_code`**: Key to join with `hardware_dim_product`.
     - *Potential Usage*: Linking sales data to product information.
   - **`fiscal_year`**: The fiscal year of the sales record.
     - *Potential Usage*: Filtering data for the years 2020 and 2021.
   - **`sold_quantity`**: Quantity of products sold.
     - *Potential Usage*: (Not directly needed for unique product counts in this task.)

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- Filtering by fiscal years:
  - **`fiscal_year = 2020`**
  - **`fiscal_year = 2021`**
- Joining tables on **`product_code`**.

---

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "segment"
   FROM "hardware_dim_product"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count unique products per segment in `hardware_dim_product`.**

   ```sql
   SELECT "segment", COUNT(DISTINCT "product_code") AS "unique_product_count"
   FROM "hardware_dim_product"
   GROUP BY "segment"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List fiscal years available in sales data.**

   WHERE hfsm."fiscal_year" = 2021
   GROUP BY hdp."segment"
   ORDER BY "unique_products_sold_2021" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count unique products sold per segment for both years.**

   ```sql
   SELECT hdp."segment", hfsm."fiscal_year", COUNT(DISTINCT hfsm."product_code") AS "unique_products_sold"
   FROM "hardware_fact_sales_monthly" AS hfsm

   WHERE hfsm."fiscal_year" IN (2020, 2021)
   GROUP BY hdp."segment", hfsm."fiscal_year"
   ORDER BY hdp."segment", hfsm."fiscal_year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate the percentage increase in unique products sold from 2020 to 2021 per segment.**

    *(Note: SQLite doesn't support window functions in older versions, so we'll calculate using subqueries.)*

    ```sql
    SELECT
      segment_counts_2020."segment",
      segment_counts_2020."unique_products_sold_2020",
      segment_counts_2021."unique_products_sold_2021",
      ROUND(
        (CAST(segment_counts_2021."unique_products_sold_2021" AS FLOAT) - segment_counts_2020."unique_products_sold_2020")
        / segment_counts_2020."unique_products_sold_2020" * 100, 2
      ) AS "percentage_increase"
    FROM
      (
        SELECT hdp."segment", COUNT(DISTINCT hfsm."product_code") AS "unique_products_sold_2020"
        FROM "hardware_fact_sales_monthly" AS hfsm
        JOIN "hardware_dim_product" AS hdp ON hfsm."product_code" = hdp."product_code"
        WHERE hfsm."fiscal_year" = 2020
        GROUP BY hdp."segment"
      ) AS segment_counts_2020
    JOIN
      (
        SELECT hdp."segment", COUNT(DISTINCT hfsm."product_code") AS "unique_products_sold_2021"
        FROM "hardware_fact_sales_monthly" AS hfsm
        JOIN "hardware_dim_product" AS hdp ON hfsm."product_code" = hdp."product_code"
        WHERE hfsm."fiscal_year" = 2021
        GROUP BY hdp."segment"
      ) AS segment_counts_2021
    ON segment_counts_2020."segment" = segment_counts_2021."segment"
    ORDER BY "percentage_increase" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **List segments that had no unique products sold in 2020 but had sales in 2021.**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT segment_counts_2021."segment"
    FROM
      (
        SELECT hdp."segment"
        FROM "hardware_fact_sales_monthly" AS hfsm
        JOIN "hardware_dim_product" AS hdp ON hfsm."product_code" = hdp."product_code"
        WHERE hfsm."fiscal_year" = 2021
      ) AS segment_counts_2021
    LEFT JOIN
      (
        SELECT hdp."segment"
        FROM "hardware_fact_sales_monthly" AS hfsm
        JOIN "hardware_dim_product" AS hdp ON hfsm."product_code" = hdp."product_code"
        WHERE hfsm."fiscal_year" = 2020
      ) AS segment_counts_2020
    ON segment_counts_2021."segment" = segment_counts_2020."segment"
    WHERE segment_counts_2020."segment" IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Find the total number of unique products sold across all segments in 2020.**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "product_code") AS "total_unique_products_2020"
    FROM "hardware_fact_sales_monthly"
    WHERE "fiscal_year" = 2020
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Find the total number of unique products sold across all segments in 2021.**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "product_code") AS "total_unique_products_2021"
    FROM "hardware_fact_sales_monthly"
    WHERE "fiscal_year" = 2021
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Identify segments with the highest number of new unique products sold in 2021 not sold in 2020.**

    ```sql
    SELECT hdp."segment", COUNT(DISTINCT hfsm."product_code") AS "new_unique_products_2021"
    FROM "hardware_fact_sales_monthly" AS hfsm
    JOIN "hardware_dim_product" AS hdp ON hfsm."product_code" = hdp."product_code"
    WHERE hfsm."fiscal_year" = 2021
      AND hfsm."product_code" NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT "product_code"
        FROM "hardware_fact_sales_monthly"
        WHERE "fiscal_year" = 2020
      )
    GROUP BY hdp."segment"
    ORDER BY "new_unique_products_2021" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Check the distribution of products across segments in the `hardware_dim_product` table.**

    ```sql
    SELECT "segment", COUNT("product_code") AS "total_products_in_segment"
    FROM "hardware_dim_product"
    GROUP BY "segment"
    ORDER BY "total_products_in_segment" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Can you provide a list of hardware product segments along with their unique product counts for 2020 in the output, ordered by the highest percentage increase in unique fact sales products from 2020 to 2021?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: We provide the list of hardware product segments along with their unique product counts for 2020, ordered by the highest percentage increase in unique fact sales products from 2020 to 2021.

```csv
Segment,Unique_Product_Count_2020
segment1:str,count1:int
segment2:str,count2:int
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 16:44:37 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide a list of hardware product segments along with their unique product counts for 2020 in the output, ordered by the highest percentage increase in unique fact sales products from 2020 to 2021?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: We provide the list of hardware product segments along with their unique product counts for 2020, ordered by the highest percentage increase in unique fact sales products from 2020 to 2021.

```csv
Segment,Unique_Product_Count_2020

segment2:str,count2:int
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
