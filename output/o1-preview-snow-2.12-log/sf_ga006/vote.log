After reviewing the SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL that accurately addresses the task requirements.

### Reasoning:

1. **Comprehensive Union of Events:**
   - `0result.sql` correctly unions all the necessary daily event tables for the entire date range from November 1â€“30, 2020, ensuring that all relevant data is included for analysis.

2. **Accurate Filtering of Purchase Events:**
   - It filters events where `"EVENT_NAME" = 'purchase'` and `"ECOMMERCE":"purchase_revenue_in_usd"` is not null, as specified in the task.

3. **Correct Extraction of `ga_session_id`:**
   - The query accurately extracts `ga_session_id` from the nested `"EVENT_PARAMS"` column by flattening and filtering where `ep.value:"key"::STRING = 'ga_session_id'`.

4. **Proper Session Revenue Calculation:**
   - It calculates the total purchase revenue per session (`"session_purchase_revenue"`) by grouping by `"USER_PSEUDO_ID"` and `"ga_session_id"`. This ensures that revenue is correctly aggregated at the session level.

5. **Identification of Users with Multiple Purchase Sessions:**
   - The query identifies users who had more than one purchase session by counting distinct `ga_session_id` per `"USER_PSEUDO_ID"` and filtering where `"number_of_sessions" > 1`.

6. **Accurate Average Purchase Revenue Calculation:**
   - It computes the average purchase revenue per session for each qualifying user by averaging `"session_purchase_revenue"`. This aligns with the task's requirement to find the average per session for users with multiple purchase sessions.

7. **Consistent and Detailed Results:**
   - The results in `0result.csv` provide a comprehensive list of users along with their calculated average purchase revenue per session, matching the task's expectations.

In comparison, while `1result.sql` and `2result.sql` attempt similar operations, they either miss certain steps or do not handle the data as precisely as `0result.sql`. Specifically:

- **`1result.sql`**:
  - It may omit some users who meet the criteria due to differences in join operations and filtering mechanisms.
  
- **`2result.sql`**:
  - The use of `MAX()` in extracting `ga_session_id` could lead to potential inaccuracies if a purchase event contains multiple `ga_session_id` values, though unlikely, and it introduces unnecessary complexity.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is the most accurate and reliable SQL query that fulfills all the task requirements.
