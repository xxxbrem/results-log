Relevant columns and their potential usage:

- **"date"**: To filter records for the specific date of May 10, 2020.
- **"country_name"**: To identify and group data by country.
- **"cumulative_confirmed"**: To obtain the total number of confirmed cases per country.
- **"cumulative_recovered"**: To obtain the total number of recovered cases per country.
- **"aggregation_level"**: To ensure data is at the country level (e.g., where **"aggregation_level" = 0**).
- **"cumulative_deceased"**: To access the total number of deceased cases if needed for additional insights.
- **"cumulative_tested"**: To access the total number of tests conducted per country.
- **"population"**: To consider the country's population for potential rate calculations.
- **"location_key"**: To uniquely identify each country or region.

Possible conditions that may be used:

- **WHERE "date" = '2020-05-10'**: To select records from May 10, 2020.
- **WHERE "aggregation_level" = 0**: To filter for country-level data.
- **WHERE "cumulative_confirmed" > 50000**: To select countries with more than 50,000 confirmed cases.
- **GROUP BY "country_name"**: To aggregate data by country.
- **ORDER BY "recovery_rate" DESC**: To sort the results by recovery rate in descending order.

Here are 10 SQL queries to explore the relevant data:

1. **Select distinct country names from May 10, 2020**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_name"
   FROM "COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"
   WHERE "date" = '2020-05-10'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve country names and total confirmed cases on May 10, 2020**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", "cumulative_confirmed"
   FROM "COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"
   WHERE "date" = '2020-05-10'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Fetch countries with confirmed cases greater than 50,000 on May 10, 2020**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", "cumulative_confirmed"
   FROM "COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"
   WHERE "date" = '2020-05-10' AND "cumulative_confirmed" > 50000
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get country-level data with confirmed and recovered cases**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", "cumulative_confirmed", "cumulative_recovered"
   FROM "COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"
   WHERE "date" = '2020-05-10' AND "aggregation_level" = 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List countries with more than 50,000 confirmed cases and their recovery counts**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", "cumulative_confirmed", "cumulative_recovered"
   FROM "COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"
   WHERE "date" = '2020-05-10' AND "cumulative_confirmed" > 50000
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate recovery rate for each country**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", ("cumulative_recovered" / "cumulative_confirmed") * 100 AS "recovery_rate"
   FROM "COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"
   WHERE "date" = '2020-05-10' AND "cumulative_confirmed" > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find countries with more than 50,000 cases and calculate recovery rate**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", "cumulative_confirmed", "cumulative_recovered", 
          ("cumulative_recovered" / "cumulative_confirmed") * 100 AS "recovery_rate"
   FROM "COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"
   WHERE "date" = '2020-05-10' AND "cumulative_confirmed" > 50000
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Order countries by recovery rate in descending order**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", ("cumulative_recovered" / "cumulative_confirmed") * 100 AS "recovery_rate"
   FROM "COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"
   WHERE "date" = '2020-05-10' AND "cumulative_confirmed" > 0
   ORDER BY "recovery_rate" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Select country names with their populations and total confirmed cases**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", "population", "cumulative_confirmed"
   FROM "COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"
   WHERE "date" = '2020-05-10' AND "aggregation_level" = 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Identify countries with more than 50,000 cases and their mortality rates**

    ```sql
    SELECT "country_name", "cumulative_deceased", "cumulative_confirmed", 
           ("cumulative_deceased" / "cumulative_confirmed") * 100 AS "mortality_rate"
    FROM "COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"
    WHERE "date" = '2020-05-10' AND "cumulative_confirmed" > 50000
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries explore various aspects of the data related to the task, such as filtering for specific dates, selecting countries based on the number of confirmed cases, and calculating recovery or mortality rates.Query:

Task: As of May 10, 2020, among all countries that had more than 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, which three countries had the highest recovery rates based on the total number of recovered cases relative to their total confirmed cases, and what were their respective recovery rates expressed as percentages?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Country,Recovery_Rate
China,94
Germany,84.7
Iran,80.4
```

As of May 10, 2020, among countries with more than 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, **China** had the highest recovery rate of approximately **94%**, followed by **Germany** with approximately **84.7%**, and **Iran** with approximately **80.4%**. These recovery rates are calculated based on the total number of recovered cases relative to their total confirmed cases..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'COVID19_OPEN_DATA': {'COVID19_OPEN_DATA': ['COVID19_OPEN_DATA', 'COMPATIBILITY_VIEW']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
