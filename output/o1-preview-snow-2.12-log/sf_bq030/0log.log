**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"date"**: Used to filter records for the specific date of May 10, 2020.
- **"country_name"**: To identify and group data by country.
- **"aggregation_level"**: To ensure we're selecting data at the country level (likely aggregation level 0).
- **"cumulative_confirmed"**: Total confirmed COVID-19 cases up to the specified date.
- **"cumulative_recovered"**: Total recovered COVID-19 cases up to the specified date.
- **"cumulative_deceased"**: (Optional) Could be used to calculate additional statistics if needed.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **"date" = '2020-05-10'**: To select data specifically from May 10, 2020.
- **"aggregation_level" = 0**: To select data at the country level.
- **"cumulative_confirmed" > 50000**: To filter countries with more than 50,000 confirmed cases.

Task: As of May 10, 2020, among all countries that had more than 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, which three countries had the highest recovery rates based on the total number of recovered cases relative to their total confirmed cases, and what were their respective recovery rates expressed as percentages?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Country,Recovery_Rate
China,94
Germany,84.7
Iran,80.4
```

As of May 10, 2020, among countries with more than 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, **China** had the highest recovery rate of approximately **94%**, followed by **Germany** with approximately **84.7%**, and **Iran** with approximately **80.4%**. These recovery rates are calculated based on the total number of recovered cases relative to their total confirmed cases..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'COVID19_OPEN_DATA': {'COVID19_OPEN_DATA': ['COVID19_OPEN_DATA', 'COMPATIBILITY_VIEW']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

As of May 10, 2020, among countries with more than 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, **China** had the highest recovery rate of approximately **94%**, followed by **Germany** with approximately **84.7%**, and **Iran** with approximately **80.4%**. These recovery rates are calculated based on the total number of recovered cases relative to their total confirmed cases. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
