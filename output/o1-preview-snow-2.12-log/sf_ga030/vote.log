Upon reviewing both SQL scripts, we can see that they both aim to address the task of grouping users by the week they first used the app starting from July 2, 2018, and determining which group has the most active users remained in the next four weeks.

**Comparison and Reasoning:**

1. **Script `0result.sql`:**

   - **Approach:**
     - Aggregates events from a range of dates by performing a large `UNION ALL` of event tables from `20180702` to `20181003`.
     - Calculates the cohort week (`cohort_week_start`) by truncating the `user_first_touch_timestamp` to the week.
     - Identifies users who remained active in the next four weeks by filtering events occurring between `cohort_week_start + 7 days` and `cohort_week_start + 35 days`.
     - Counts the number of distinct users per cohort week who remained active in that period.
     - Selects the cohort week with the maximum number of active users remained.

   - **Observation:**
     - The script includes additional date conditions that might be redundant, making it more complex.
     - Uses both timestamp and week truncation for filtering events, which can be streamlined.

2. **Script `1result.sql`:**

   - **Approach:**
     - Aggregates events similarly by performing a `UNION ALL` of event tables covering the necessary date range.
     - Calculates the user's first touch week (`user_first_touch_week`) and the event week (`event_week`) by truncating the timestamps to the week.
     - Filters users who had events in the four weeks following their first touch week, specifically where `event_week` is greater than `user_first_touch_week` and less than or equal to `user_first_touch_week + 4 weeks`.
     - Counts the number of distinct users per cohort week who remained active in those four weeks.
     - Ranks the cohorts based on the number of active users remained and selects the top one.

   - **Observation:**
     - The script is more straightforward and easier to understand.
     - It accurately implements the logic by considering events in weeks 1 to 4 after the user's first touch week.
     - The use of week-based calculations simplifies the filtering process.

**Conclusion:**

While both scripts aim to solve the problem and produce the same result (`2018-09-03`), `1result.sql` is the more accurate and efficient script. It implements the required logic in a more concise and understandable manner, reducing complexity and the potential for errors.
