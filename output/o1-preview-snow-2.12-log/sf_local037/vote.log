After analyzing the provided SQL queries and their corresponding results, the correct SQL that answers the question is **`0result.sql`**.

---

**Comparison and Reasoning:**

**1. Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**

- **SQL Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT trans."product_category_name_english" AS "product_category_name",
         COUNT(*) AS "number_of_payments"
  FROM "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."OLIST_ORDER_PAYMENTS" p
  JOIN "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."OLIST_ORDER_ITEMS" oi
    ON p."order_id" = oi."order_id"
  JOIN "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."OLIST_PRODUCTS" prod
    ON oi."product_id" = prod."product_id"
  JOIN "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."PRODUCT_CATEGORY_NAME_TRANSLATION" trans
    ON prod."product_category_name" = trans."product_category_name"
  WHERE p."payment_installments" = 1
  GROUP BY trans."product_category_name_english"
  ORDER BY "number_of_payments" DESC NULLS LAST
  LIMIT 3;
  ```

- **Result:**

  ```
  product_category_name,number_of_payments
  computers_accessories,5027
  sports_leisure,4984
  bed_bath_table,4690
  ```

- **Analysis:**
  - The query selects payments where the number of installments is **1**, indicating single payment transactions.
  - It joins the payments with order items and products to associate each payment with its product category.
  - By joining with the `PRODUCT_CATEGORY_NAME_TRANSLATION` table, it translates the product category names to English.
  - It groups the results by the English product category names and counts the number of payments in each category.
  - The query orders the categories by the number of payments in descending order and limits the results to the top three.
  - **This query directly addresses the task by finding the top three product categories with the highest number of single payment transactions and provides the number of payments in each category.**

---

**2. Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`):**

- **SQL Query:**

  ```sql
  WITH single_payment_type_orders AS (
      SELECT "order_id"
      FROM BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE.BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE."OLIST_ORDER_PAYMENTS"
      GROUP BY "order_id"
      HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "payment_type") = 1
  )
  
  SELECT t3."product_category_name", COUNT(*) AS "number_of_payments"
  FROM single_payment_type_orders t0
  INNER JOIN BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE.BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE."OLIST_ORDER_ITEMS" t2
      ON t0."order_id" = t2."order_id"
  INNER JOIN BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE.BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE."OLIST_PRODUCTS" t3
      ON t2."product_id" = t3."product_id"
  GROUP BY t3."product_category_name"
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC NULLS LAST
  LIMIT 3;
  ```

- **Result:**

  ```
  product_category_name,number_of_payments
  cama_mesa_banho,10822
  beleza_saude,9515
  esporte_lazer,8464
  ```

- **Analysis:**
  - The query identifies orders where only **one payment type** was used, regardless of the number of installments.
  - It does not filter based on the number of installments, so payments could be in multiple installments.
  - It groups the payments by product category and counts the total number of payments per category.
  - The query provides the top three categories based on the number of payments but does not specifically focus on single installment payments.
  - **This query does not align precisely with the task, which is to find categories with the highest number of payments made in a single installment.**

**3. Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):**

- **SQL Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT PR."product_category_name", COUNT(*) AS "number_of_payments"
  FROM BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE.BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE."OLIST_ORDER_PAYMENTS" P
  JOIN BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE.BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE."OLIST_ORDER_ITEMS" I
      ON P."order_id" = I."order_id"
  JOIN BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE.BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE."OLIST_PRODUCTS" PR
      ON I."product_id" = PR."product_id"
  WHERE P."payment_installments" = 1
  GROUP BY PR."product_category_name"
  ORDER BY "number_of_payments" DESC NULLS LAST
  LIMIT 3;
  ```

- **Result:**

  ```
  product_category_name,number_of_payments
  informatica_acessorios,5027
  esporte_lazer,4984
  cama_mesa_banho,4690
  ```

- **Analysis:**
  - Similar to Candidate 0, this query filters payments where the number of installments is **1**.
  - It joins payments with order items and products to associate payments with product categories.
  - The product category names are in Portuguese and are not translated to English.
  - It groups the payments by product category and counts them, ordering the results to find the top three categories.
  - **While this query correctly identifies the top categories, it does not translate the category names, which might be less accessible for non-Portuguese speakers.**

---

**Conclusion and Choice:**

- **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`)** is the most suitable answer because:
  - It **directly addresses the task** by focusing on payments made in a **single installment** (`"payment_installments" = 1`).
  - It provides the **product category names in English**, making the results clearer and more understandable.
  - The query accurately counts the number of payments per category and identifies the **top three categories** with the highest number of single installment payments.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plaintext
0result.sql
