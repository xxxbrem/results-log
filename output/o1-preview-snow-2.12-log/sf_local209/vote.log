After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, we find that all three return the same output:

- **Store ID:** 53
- **Store Name:** PAPA SUCIS
- **Total Orders:** 14,572
- **Delivered Ratio:** 0.9905

However, the SQL queries differ in their approach. Here's a brief comparison:

1. **`0result.sql`:**
   - Uses a `WHERE` clause with a subquery to filter to the store with the highest number of orders.
   - The subquery selects the `store_id` with the maximum order count.
   - Groups and calculates metrics only for that specific store.

2. **`1result.sql`:**
   - Calculates metrics for all stores.
   - Uses `ORDER BY` on `total_orders` in descending order and `LIMIT 1` to select the top store.
   - Directly finds the store with the highest number of orders without an additional subquery.

3. **`2result.sql`:**
   - Similar to `0result.sql`, it uses a subquery in the `WHERE` clause to filter to the top store.
   - Operates on orders joined with stores and deliveries, filtering only for the store with the most orders.

**Reason for Choosing `1result.sql`:**

- **Efficiency:** `1result.sql` is more efficient because it calculates the metrics for all stores in one pass and then selects the one with the highest total orders. This avoids the overhead of a subquery in the `WHERE` clause.
- **Simplicity:** The query is straightforward and aligns directly with the taskâ€”identifying the store with the highest number of orders and computing the delivered ratio.
- **Clarity:** Ordering by `total_orders` and limiting the result to one record makes the intent of the query clear and easy to understand.

**Conclusion:**

`1result.sql` is the best choice as it effectively and efficiently answers the task by finding the store with the highest total number of orders and calculating the delivered ratio for that store.
