After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that both queries correctly identify the top three customers with the highest number of delivered orders and provide the average payment value, city, and state for each.

However, **`1result.sql`** is more concise and directly addresses the task without unnecessary complexity. It efficiently retrieves the required information without the use of a Common Table Expression (CTE), making it easier to read and understand.

Therefore, I choose **`1result.sql`** as the correct answer.
