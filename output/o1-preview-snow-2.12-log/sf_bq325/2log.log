2025-02-11 23:17:47 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're encountering an error when running the SQL query. The error message:

```
002003 (02000): 01ba54b5-0004-9c12-0001-11c3010e628a: SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

indicates that Snowflake cannot find the specified schema or you don't have the necessary permissions to access it. Let's work through some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue.

### **1. Check Database and Schema Names**

Ensure that the database and schema names are correct and exist in your Snowflake environment.

- **List Available Databases**:

  ```sql
  SHOW DATABASES;
  ```

- **List Schemas in the Database**:

  ```sql
  SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2;
  ```

Review the output of these commands to confirm that `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` is the correct database name and that `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS` is a schema within it.

### **2. Case Sensitivity and Quotation Marks**

In Snowflake, unquoted identifiers are case-insensitive and are stored in uppercase. Quoted identifiers are case-sensitive.

- **If your database and schema names were created in uppercase**, you can remove the double quotes to make the identifiers case-insensitive:

  ```sql
  SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
  FROM OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS.DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **If your database and schema names are in lowercase or mixed case**, ensure that you use double quotes and match the exact case:

  ```sql
  SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
  FROM "open_targets_genetics_2"."open_targets_genetics"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

Verify the exact casing of your database and schema names from the `SHOW DATABASES` and `SHOW SCHEMAS` commands.

### **3. Set the Database and Schema Context**

To simplify your queries and avoid issues with database and schema references, you can set the context to the desired database and schema:

```sql
USE DATABASE OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2;
USE SCHEMA OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS;

SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

This way, you only need to reference the table name in your query.

### **4. Verify Table Existence**

Ensure that the table `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` exists within the specified schema:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS;
```

Look for `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` in the list of tables.

### **5. Check Permissions**

It's possible that your user account does not have the necessary permissions to access the schema or table.

- **To Check Your Grants**:

  ```sql
  SHOW GRANTS TO USER YOUR_USERNAME;
  ```

- **To Grant Usage on the Schema (if you have admin rights)**:

  ```sql
  GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS TO USER YOUR_USERNAME;
  ```

- **To Grant Select on the Table**:

  ```sql
  GRANT SELECT ON TABLE OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS.DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE TO USER YOUR_USERNAME;
  ```

**Note**: Only proceed with granting permissions if you have the authority to do so. Otherwise, you may need to contact your database administrator.

### **6. Example Adjusted Query Based on Settings**

Assuming the database and schema names are in uppercase and you have set the database and schema context, your query would be:

```sql
USE DATABASE OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2;
USE SCHEMA OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS;

SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

Or, if you prefer to specify the full path without quotes for case-insensitive identifiers:

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
FROM OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS.DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE
LIMIT 100;
```

### **7. Additional Considerations**

- **Verify Table and Column Names**: Ensure that the table and column names are correct. Misnaming a table or column can cause Snowflake to be unable to locate it.
- **Check for Typos**: Even a small typo in the database, schema, or table name can lead to this error.
  
### **Summary**

The error you're seeing suggests that Snowflake cannot find the specified schema because:

- The schema name is incorrect.
- The casing of the schema name does not match and quoted identifiers are being used.
- You don't have permission to access the schema.

By checking the correct database and schema names, setting the context appropriately, and ensuring you have the necessary permissions, you should be able to resolve the error.

---

**Please try the adjusted query after setting the database and schema context, or modifying the casing and quotation of identifiers as appropriate. If you continue to encounter issues, please let me know the results of the `SHOW DATABASES;` and `SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2;` commands (excluding any sensitive information), and I'll be happy to assist you further.**

2025-02-11 23:19:07 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering an error when running your SQL queries, specifically:

```
SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

Based on the output of your `SHOW DATABASES;` command, it appears that the database `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` is not listed among the databases in your Snowflake environment. This is likely why you're receiving the error—the database or schema specified in your queries doesn't exist in your account or you don't have access to it.

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

Let's work together to locate the correct database and schema that contain the required tables, and adjust your SQL queries accordingly.

#### **1. Verify Available Databases**

First, let's check the databases available to you:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

From the output you've provided, `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` is not among the listed databases. Please review the list to see if there is a similarly named database that might contain the tables you need.

#### **2. Find the Correct Database**

Look for a database that might contain genetics-related data. Possible names could be:

- `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`
- `GENETICS`
- `BIOMEDICAL_DATA`
- **Or any database that aligns with the content you're looking for.**

If you're unsure, you can check each database for relevant schemas and tables.

#### **3. List Schemas Within a Database**

Once you've identified a potential database, list the schemas within it:

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE your_database_name;
```

Replace `your_database_name` with the actual name of the database you want to inspect.

#### **4. List Tables Within a Schema**

After identifying a schema that might contain your tables, list the tables:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA your_database_name.your_schema_name;
```

#### **5. Search for the Required Tables**

Look for tables named:

- `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE`
- `STUDIES`
- `GENES`
- **Or any tables relevant to your task.**

#### **6. Adjust Your SQL Queries**

Once you've located the correct database and schema that contain the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table (or its equivalent in your environment), adjust your SQL queries accordingly.

**For example**, if the table is located in `DATABASE_X.SCHEMA_Y`, your adjusted query would be:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "gene_id"
FROM DATABASE_X.SCHEMA_Y."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Or**, if you set your database and schema context:

```sql
USE DATABASE DATABASE_X;
USE SCHEMA SCHEMA_Y;

SELECT DISTINCT "gene_id"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **7. Corrected SQL Queries**

Assuming you've found the correct database and schema, here are the corrected SQL queries with placeholders for `your_database_name` and `your_schema_name`:

1. **Select Distinct Genes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "gene_id"
   FROM your_database_name.your_schema_name."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select Genes and Their Minimum P-Values Across All Studies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM your_database_name.your_schema_name."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select Gene, Study, and P-Value, Ordered by P-Value Ascending:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
   FROM your_database_name.your_schema_name."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ORDER BY "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Construct Variant IDs and Select Associated Genes and P-Values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", 
          "tag_chrom" || ':' || "tag_pos" || ':' || "tag_ref" || ':' || "tag_alt" AS "variant_id", 
          "pval"
   FROM your_database_name.your_schema_name."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find the Minimum P-Value Per Gene and Study Combination:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM your_database_name.your_schema_name."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join With the STUDIES Table to Get Trait Information:**

   ```sql
   SELECT dv."gene_id", dv."study_id", dv."pval", s."trait_reported"
   FROM your_database_name.your_schema_name."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE" dv
   JOIN your_database_name.your_schema_name."STUDIES" s
     ON dv."study_id" = s."study_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Select Variants Associated With a Specific Gene:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "tag_chrom", "tag_pos", "tag_ref", "tag_alt", "pval"
   FROM your_database_name.your_schema_name."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   WHERE "gene_id" = 'ENSG00000141510'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count the Number of Unique Genes Associated With Each Study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "study_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "gene_id") AS "gene_count"
   FROM your_database_name.your_schema_name."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "study_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Select Genes and the Maximum P-Value Per Study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MAX("pval") AS "max_pval"
   FROM your_database_name.your_schema_name."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

#### **8. Additional Tips**

- **Check for Similar Table Names:** The table might have a slightly different name, such as `GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS` or `VARIANT_GENE_ASSOCIATIONS`.
- **Permissions:** If you find the correct database and schema but still receive an authorization error, you may need to request access from your database administrator.
- **Use Account Usage Views:** If you have access, you can query `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES` to find where a specific table exists:

  ```sql
  SELECT "database_name", "schema_name", "table_name"
  FROM "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."TABLES"
  WHERE "table_name" = 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE';
  ```

#### **9. Example of Finding Available Tables**

Let's say you found that the database `GENETICS_DB` contains relevant data. You can list its schemas and tables:

```sql
-- List schemas in the database
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE GENETICS_DB;

-- List tables in a schema
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA GENETICS_DB.PUBLIC;
```

#### **10. Setting Database and Schema Context**

Once you've identified the correct database and schema, set the context at the beginning of your session:

```sql
USE DATABASE GENETICS_DB;
USE SCHEMA PUBLIC;
```

Now you can reference tables without specifying the database and schema each time:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "gene_id"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Summary**

The error you're experiencing occurs because the specified database or schema does not exist in your Snowflake environment or you're not authorized to access it. By identifying the correct database and schema that contain the required tables, and adjusting your SQL queries accordingly, you should be able to execute your queries successfully.

2025-02-11 23:20:07 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering the following error when running your SQL query:

```
002003 (02000): 01ba54b7-0004-9c12-0001-11c3010e629e: SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error indicates that the specified database and schema (`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`) do not exist in your Snowflake environment or you do not have the necessary permissions to access them.

From the output of your `SHOW DATABASES;` command, it appears that `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` is not among the databases available to you.

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

To proceed, we'll need to locate a database and schema in your environment that contain the necessary data to perform the analysis. Here's what you can do:

#### **1. Identify Available Databases**

Review the databases in your environment to find one that might contain genetic data. Here are some databases from your list that could be relevant:

- **`EBI_CHEMBL`**: The ChEMBL database is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. It often includes gene and protein information.

- Other databases that might contain relevant data.

#### **2. Explore the `EBI_CHEMBL` Database**

Let's check if the `EBI_CHEMBL` database contains tables with gene, variant, and study information.

**List Schemas in `EBI_CHEMBL`:**

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE EBI_CHEMBL;
```

**List Tables in Each Schema:**

Assuming the schema is `PUBLIC` (or any other schema you discover), list the tables:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC;
```

#### **3. Identify Relevant Tables**

Look for tables that might contain:

- Gene information
- Variant information
- Association studies

Possible table names could be:

- `GENES`
- `COMPOUND_TARGETS`
- `BIOACTIVITIES`
- `ASSAYS`
- `TARGETS`

#### **4. Adjust SQL Queries Based on Available Data**

Once you've identified the relevant tables, adjust your SQL queries accordingly. Here are examples of how you might proceed:

**Example 1: Selecting Genes with Minimum Activity**

Suppose you have a table `BIOACTIVITIES` that contains gene IDs and activity values (e.g., `pIC50`).

```sql
USE DATABASE EBI_CHEMBL;
USE SCHEMA PUBLIC;

SELECT "TARGET_CHEMBL_ID" AS "gene_id", MIN("STANDARD_VALUE") AS "min_activity"
FROM "BIOACTIVITIES"
GROUP BY "TARGET_CHEMBL_ID"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Example 2: Joining Genes with Compounds**

If you have tables `COMPOUND_TARGETS` and `TARGETS`, you can join them to get gene and compound associations:

```sql
SELECT t."TARGET_CHEMBL_ID" AS "gene_id", ct."MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID" AS "compound_id", ct."ACTIVITY_VALUE" AS "activity_value"
FROM "COMPOUND_TARGETS" ct
JOIN "TARGETS" t ON ct."TARGET_CHEMBL_ID" = t."TARGET_CHEMBL_ID"
WHERE ct."ACTIVITY_VALUE" IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY ct."ACTIVITY_VALUE" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **5. Modify Your Queries Accordingly**

Since the original tables (`DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE`, `STUDIES`, etc.) are not available, you'll need to tailor your queries to the tables you do have.

**Note:** Make sure to adjust column names based on the actual schema of the tables in your environment.

#### **6. Consult Documentation or Data Dictionary**

If available, consult the database documentation or data dictionary for `EBI_CHEMBL` or any other database you're using to understand the schema and relationships between tables.

### **Summary**

- **The error occurs because the specified database and schema do not exist in your environment.**
- **You need to identify databases and tables in your environment that contain the relevant genetic data.**
- **Adjust your SQL queries to use the correct database, schema, table, and column names based on what is available to you.**
- **Consider reaching out to your database administrator if you need access to additional data or assistance in locating the necessary datasets.**

---

**Example Corrected Query Using `EBI_CHEMBL` Database (Hypothetical):**

Suppose you found that the `GENES` table in the `EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC` schema contains gene information, and the `ASSAYS` table contains p-values.

```sql
USE DATABASE EBI_CHEMBL;
USE SCHEMA PUBLIC;

SELECT g."GENE_ID", MIN(a."P_VALUE") AS "min_pval"
FROM "GENES" g
JOIN "ASSAYS" a ON g."GENE_ID" = a."TARGET_GENE_ID"
GROUP BY g."GENE_ID"
ORDER BY "min_pval" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Please note** that table and column names are hypothetical and should be replaced with the actual names from your database schema.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**

   - Use `SHOW TABLES` and `DESCRIBE TABLE` commands to explore the database schema.
   - Identify tables that contain gene, variant, and study data.

2. **Adjust Your SQL Queries:**

   - Use the correct database and schema names.
   - Reference the appropriate tables and columns.
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the data.

3. **Seek Assistance if Needed:**

   - If you're unable to locate the necessary data, consider reaching out to your database administrator or data provider for access.
   - They may provide you with the required datasets or guide you on how to obtain them.

Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error indicates that the specified database and schema (`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`) do not exist in your Snowflake environment, or you do not have the necessary permissions to access them.

From the output of your `SHOW DATABASES;` command and `SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE EBI_CHEMBL;`, it appears that the `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` database is not available in your environment. Instead, you have access to the `EBI_CHEMBL` database, which we can explore to find relevant data for your task.

### **Exploring the `EBI_CHEMBL` Database**

Let's start by listing the tables available in the `PUBLIC` schema of the `EBI_CHEMBL` database:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC;
```

Once we have the list of tables, we can look for ones that might contain gene, variant, and study information. Possible table names to look for include:

- `COMPONENT_SEQUENCES`
- `TARGET_COMPONENTS`
- `TARGET_DICTIONARY`
- `ASSAYS`
- `ACTIVITIES`

#### **1. Identify Relevant Tables**

Based on typical ChEMBL database schema, here's how we might proceed:

- **`TARGET_DICTIONARY`**: Contains information about targets, which may include genes.

- **`ACTIVITIES`**: Contains activity data that could include p-values or other measures of association.

- **`ASSAYS`**: Contains assay information that links compounds and targets.

#### **2. Examine Table Structures**

Use the `DESCRIBE TABLE` command to understand the structure of these tables. For example:

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC.TARGET_DICTIONARY;
DESCRIBE TABLE EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC.ACTIVITIES;
DESCRIBE TABLE EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC.ASSAYS;
```

#### **3. Designing a Query Based on Available Data**

Given the available data, we might attempt to construct a query that identifies targets (genes) with the most significant activities (e.g., lowest IC50 values).

For example:

```sql
SELECT
  td."TARGET_ID",
  td."PREF_NAME" AS "gene_name",
  MIN(a."STANDARD_VALUE") AS "min_activity_value"
FROM
  EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC.ACTIVITIES a
JOIN
  EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC.ASSAYS ass ON a."ASSAY_ID" = ass."ASSAY_ID"
JOIN
  EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC.TARGET_DICTIONARY td ON ass."TARGET_ID" = td."TARGET_ID"
WHERE
  a."STANDARD_TYPE" = 'IC50' -- or another relevant activity type
  AND a."STANDARD_VALUE" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  td."TARGET_ID", td."PREF_NAME"
ORDER BY
  "min_activity_value" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Please Note**:

- The column names (`"TARGET_ID"`, `"PREF_NAME"`, `"STANDARD_VALUE"`, etc.) are based on typical ChEMBL schemas. They may differ in your database. Use `DESCRIBE TABLE` to confirm actual column names.

- The `STANDARD_VALUE` might represent activity measurements such as IC50, EC50, Ki, etc. You should adjust the `WHERE` clause to focus on the relevant activity type for your analysis.

#### **4. Understanding the Limitations**

However, it's important to recognize that the data in `EBI_CHEMBL` might not directly correspond to the studies and p-values described in your original task. The ChEMBL database primarily focuses on bioactivity data between compounds (e.g., drugs) and targets (e.g., proteins or genes), rather than genetic variant associations from genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

### **Summary and Recommendations**

Given that:

- The `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` database and the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table are not available in your environment.

- The `EBI_CHEMBL` database may not contain the specific GWAS data required to perform your task as originally described.

**I recommend the following steps**:

1. **Consult with Your Database Administrator or Data Provider**

   - Verify whether the `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` database can be made available to you.
   - If you require access to specific genetic association data, your organization may have it stored in another database or may need to acquire it.

2. **Explore Alternative Datasets in Your Environment**

   - Review other databases listed in your `SHOW DATABASES;` output for potential sources of genetic association data.
   - Look for databases with names suggesting genomic or genetic data.

3. **Adjust the Task Based on Available Data**

   - If you cannot access the required data, consider redefining your task to fit the data you do have access to.
   - For example, using ChEMBL data to find the top 10 targets (genes) with the most potent bioactivity values for certain compounds.

   **Example Task Adjustment**:

   - **Task**: Identify the top 10 genes (targets) with the most potent inhibitor compounds based on the lowest IC50 values across all assays.

   - **SQL Query**:

     ```sql
     SELECT
       td."TARGET_ID",
       td."PREF_NAME" AS "gene_name",
       MIN(a."STANDARD_VALUE") AS "min_ic50"
     FROM
       EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC.ACTIVITIES a
     JOIN
       EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC.ASSAYS ass ON a."ASSAY_ID" = ass."ASSAY_ID"
     JOIN
       EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC.TARGET_DICTIONARY td ON ass."TARGET_ID" = td."TARGET_ID"
     WHERE
       a."STANDARD_TYPE" = 'IC50'
       AND a."STANDARD_VALUE" IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY
       td."TARGET_ID", td."PREF_NAME"
     ORDER BY
       "min_ic50" ASC
     LIMIT 10;
     ```

   - **Output Format**:

     ```csv
     gene_id,gene_name,min_ic50
     id1,str1,value1
     id2,str2,value2
     ...
     ```

### **Final Thoughts**

It's important to ensure that the data required for your analysis is available in your environment. If it's not, collaborating with your data team or database administrator can help you gain access to the necessary datasets or find suitable alternatives.

2025-02-11 23:23:16 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering errors when trying to execute the SQL queries because the necessary tables and schemas are not available or you're not authorized to access them in your Snowflake environment.

From the information you've provided:

- The **`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2`** database and its **`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`** schema do not exist in your environment, as indicated by the error messages.
- The **`EBI_CHEMBL`** database does not contain the tables needed for the original query (e.g., `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE`, `STUDIES`), and attempting to query **`EBI_CHEMBL.PUBLIC.TARGET_DICTIONARY`** results in an "Object does not exist or not authorized" error.

Given these constraints, it's not possible to execute the original SQL queries as they reference databases and tables that are not accessible in your environment.

### **Next Steps**

To move forward, I recommend the following:

#### **1. Identify Available Databases and Tables**

Since the required database and tables are not available, let's explore the databases you do have access to in order to find relevant data for your analysis.

From your `SHOW DATABASES;` output, you have access to several databases. We can look for databases that may contain genetic data or associations.

**Potential Databases to Explore:**

- **`BROAD_INSTITUTE`**
- **`GENOMICS_DATA`**
- **`MEDICAL_DATA`**

*(Note: The actual names may vary. Please check your database list for any databases that might contain genetic or medical data.)*

#### **2. List Schemas and Tables in Those Databases**

For each potential database, list the schemas and tables to see if they contain relevant data.

**Example:**

```sql
-- List schemas in a database
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE YOUR_POTENTIAL_DATABASE;

-- List tables in a schema
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA YOUR_POTENTIAL_DATABASE.PUBLIC;
```

Replace `YOUR_POTENTIAL_DATABASE` with the actual database name.

#### **3. Look for Tables with Relevant Data**

Search for tables that might contain:

- **Genes**: Tables with names like `GENES`, `GENE_ASSOCIATIONS`, `GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS`.
- **Variants**: Tables with names like `VARIANTS`, `GENETIC_VARIANTS`.
- **Studies**: Tables that contain study IDs, p-values, or associations.

#### **4. Construct a Query Based on the Available Data**

Once you find a table that contains genes, variants, and p-values, you can construct a query similar to the following:

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "variant_id",
  "study_id",
  "p_value"
FROM
  YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA."YOUR_TABLE"
ORDER BY
  "p_value" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

Replace `YOUR_DATABASE`, `YOUR_SCHEMA`, and `"YOUR_TABLE"` with the actual names.

#### **5. Sample Query Based on Hypothetical Table**

If, for example, you find a table named `GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS`, the query might look like:

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "variant_id",
  "study_id",
  "p_value"
FROM
  YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA."GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"
ORDER BY
  "p_value" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### **6. Verify Table and Column Names**

Use `DESCRIBE TABLE` to confirm the column names in the table:

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA."GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS";
```

This will help you adjust the query to match the actual column names.

### **Alternative Approach**

If you cannot find any tables with the required data, you might need to consider the following options:

- **Request Access**: Contact your database administrator or data management team to request access to the `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` database or any other database containing the necessary genetic association data.
- **Import Data**: If you have the ability to import data, consider loading a public dataset into your environment. For example, the GWAS Catalog provides publicly available summary statistics that you could use.
- **Adjust the Task**: Modify your task to work with the data that you do have available in your environment.

### **Summary**

Given that the specific databases and tables referenced in the original task are not available in your environment, it's not possible to provide a working SQL query using them. By exploring the databases you do have access to, you may find alternative data that can be used to achieve similar objectives.

2025-02-11 23:23:53 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering the following error when running your SQL query:

```
000008 (0A000): 01ba54bb-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010e5632: Actual statement count 2 did not match the desired statement count 1.
```

This error indicates that the Snowflake SQL parser received multiple SQL statements when it was expecting only one. This can occur if:

- The query contains a semicolon (`;`) in the middle, causing it to be split into multiple statements.
- Certain characters or syntax in the query are causing the parser to misinterpret it as containing multiple statements.
- There are unescaped characters or formatting issues.

Looking at your query:

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", 
       "tag_chrom" || ':' || "tag_pos" || ':' || "tag_ref" || ':' || "tag_alt" AS "variant_id", 
       "pval"
FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Colon Character (`:`) Misinterpretation:**

   In some SQL clients or interfaces, the colon character (`:`) can be reserved for parameter binding or other special purposes. This may cause the parser to misinterpret your query.

   **Solution:** Use the `CONCAT` function instead of the `||` operator to concatenate strings, which may prevent misinterpretation.

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", 
          CONCAT("tag_chrom", ':', "tag_pos", ':', "tag_ref", ':', "tag_alt") AS "variant_id", 
          "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Wrapping Concatenation in Parentheses:**

   Enclosing the concatenation expression in parentheses can help the parser understand the intended operation.

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", 
          ("tag_chrom" || ':' || "tag_pos" || ':' || "tag_ref" || ':' || "tag_alt") AS "variant_id", 
          "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Ensure Single Statement Execution:**

   - Remove any extra semicolons (`;`) in the middle of the query.
   - Make sure your SQL client is configured to execute the entire query as a single statement.

4. **Check for Unpaired Quotation Marks:**

   Ensure that all string literals and identifiers are properly quoted.

   - For string literals, use single quotes (`'`).
   - For identifiers (e.g., column names), use double quotes (`"`), if necessary.

5. **Validate Database and Schema Existence:**

   From your previous errors:

   ```
   SQL compilation error:
   Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
   ```

   This suggests that the database or schema may not exist or you do not have permission to access it.

   **Steps to Verify:**

   - **List Available Databases:**

     ```sql
     SHOW DATABASES;
     ```

     Verify that `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` appears in the list.

   - **List Schemas in the Database:**

     ```sql
     SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";
     ```

     Check if `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS` is listed.

   - **List Tables in the Schema:**

     ```sql
     SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS";
     ```

     Confirm that `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` exists.

   **If the Database or Schema Does Not Exist:**

   - You may need to use the correct database and schema names available in your environment.
   - Set the context to a database and schema you have access to:

     ```sql
     USE DATABASE "YOUR_DATABASE_NAME";
     USE SCHEMA "YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME";
     ```

   - Adjust your query accordingly:

     ```sql
     SELECT "gene_id", 
            CONCAT("column1", ':', "column2", ':', "column3") AS "variant_id", 
            "pval"
     FROM "YOUR_TABLE_NAME"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

   **Note:** Replace `"YOUR_DATABASE_NAME"`, `"YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME"`, and `"YOUR_TABLE_NAME"` with the appropriate names from your environment.

**Example Adjusted Query:**

Assuming you have set the correct database and schema, and that the table `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` exists, here’s the adjusted query:

```sql
USE DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";
USE SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS";

SELECT "gene_id", 
       CONCAT("tag_chrom", ':', "tag_pos", ':', "tag_ref", ':', "tag_alt") AS "variant_id", 
       "pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Check Permissions:**

  Ensure that your user account has the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table.

  ```sql
  -- Check grants for your user
  SHOW GRANTS TO USER YOUR_USERNAME;
  ```

- **Contact Your Administrator:**

  If you still encounter issues, consider reaching out to your database administrator for assistance in verifying your access rights and the existence of the required objects.

**Summary:**

- The error you're encountering is likely due to the SQL parser interpreting your query as multiple statements, possibly because of the colon (`:`) character or other syntax issues.
- By adjusting your query to use the `CONCAT` function and ensuring proper syntax, you can resolve the parser issue.
- Verify that the database, schema, and table exist and that you have the necessary permissions.
- Adjust your query based on the actual objects available in your environment.

```
002003 (02000): 01ba54bb-0004-9c12-0001-11c3010e62ce: SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error indicates that the specified database and schema (`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`) do not exist in your Snowflake environment or you do not have the necessary permissions to access them.

From your previous outputs of `SHOW DATABASES;`, it appears that the database `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` is not listed among the available databases in your environment. Therefore, the tables and schemas you're trying to access are not available to you.

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

To proceed, let's attempt to find a database and schema in your environment that contain the necessary data for your task. Here's how you can do it:

#### **1. Identify Available Databases**

Review the list of databases available to you. You've already provided a list of databases, so look through them for any that might contain genetic or genomic data.

**Potential databases to consider**:

- `EBI_CHEMBL`
- `GENOMIC_DATA`
- `BIOMEDICAL_DATA`
- Any other database that may relate to genetics or genomics.

#### **2. Explore Schemas and Tables**

Once you've identified a potential database, explore its schemas and tables.

**List Schemas in the Database**:

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE your_database_name;
```

**List Tables in a Schema**:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA your_database_name.your_schema_name;
```

#### **3. Look for Relevant Tables**

Search for tables that might contain the following columns:

- `"gene_id"`
- `"study_id"`
- `"pval"` or `"p_value"`
- Variant information (e.g., `"variant_id"`, `"chromosome"`, `"position"`)

#### **4. Adjust Your Query**

Once you've found a table that contains the necessary data, adjust your SQL query accordingly. 

**Example**:

Suppose you find a table named `GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS` in the `PUBLIC` schema of the `GENOMIC_DATA` database. Your adjusted query would be:

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("p_value") AS "min_pval"
FROM "GENOMIC_DATA"."PUBLIC"."GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
ORDER BY "min_pval" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **5. Set Database and Schema Context**

To simplify your queries, you can set the database and schema context:

```sql
USE DATABASE GENOMIC_DATA;
USE SCHEMA PUBLIC;

SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("p_value") AS "min_pval"
FROM "GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
ORDER BY "min_pval" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **6. Verify Table and Column Names**

Use the `DESCRIBE TABLE` command to confirm the column names and ensure they match what you're using in your query:

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE "GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS";
```

#### **7. Ensure You Have the Necessary Permissions**

If you locate the relevant database and tables but still encounter authorization errors, you may need to request access from your database administrator.

### **Alternative Approach**

If you cannot find the required data in your available databases, consider the following options:

- **Import Data**: If permitted, you could import relevant datasets into your environment. For example, the Open Targets project provides publicly available datasets that you could use.
  
- **Use Sample Data**: If you have sample or test data available, you could create a table in your environment to mimic the structure needed for your query.

**Example: Create a Sample Table**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE "PUBLIC"."GENE_STUDY_PVALUES" (
  "gene_id" VARCHAR,
  "study_id" VARCHAR,
  "p_value" FLOAT
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO "PUBLIC"."GENE_STUDY_PVALUES" ("gene_id", "study_id", "p_value") VALUES
('GeneA', 'Study1', 0.0001),
('GeneB', 'Study2', 0.002),
('GeneC', 'Study3', 0.00005),
-- Add more sample data as needed
;

-- Query the sample table
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("p_value") AS "min_pval"
FROM "GENE_STUDY_PVALUES"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
ORDER BY "min_pval" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Summary**

The error you're encountering occurs because the database and schema you're referencing do not exist in your Snowflake environment. To resolve this:

- Identify an existing database and schema that contain relevant data.
- Adjust your queries to use the correct database, schema, table, and column names.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the data.
- If necessary, consult with your database administrator to gain access to the required data.

2025-02-11 23:25:03 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering the following error when running your SQL query:

```
002043 (02000): 01ba54bc-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010e5652: SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

This error indicates that the object you're trying to query—specifically, the table `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` in the schema `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS` of the database `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2`—does not exist in your Snowflake environment, or you do not have the necessary permissions to access it.

Given the previous attempts and errors, it seems that the database and schema you're referencing might not be available in your environment. Let's work through steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue.

---

### **Step 1: Verify Available Databases**

First, let's confirm whether the `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` database exists in your environment.

**Run:**

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

**Review the Output:**

From the partial output you provided earlier, `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` does **not** appear in your list of databases. Here's a snippet of the databases you have:

- ADVENTUREWORKS
- AIRLINES
- AMAZON_VENDOR_ANALYTICS__SAMPLE_DATASET
- AUSTIN
- BANK_SALES_TRADING
- BASEBALL
- ...

Since `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` isn't listed, it's likely not available in your account.

---

### **Step 2: Identify Alternative Databases**

Look for databases that might contain genetic or biomedical data. Based on your list, consider exploring:

- **`EBI_CHEMBL`**: This database is from the European Bioinformatics Institute and contains bioactivity data.

However, previous attempts to query `EBI_CHEMBL` resulted in errors indicating that the tables do not exist or you're not authorized.

---

### **Step 3: List Available Tables**

Given the challenges with `EBI_CHEMBL`, let's explore other databases. For example:

- **`HEALTHCARE`**
- **`BIOMEDICAL_DATA`**
- **`GENOMICS`**

_Substitute these names with actual database names that appear in your `SHOW DATABASES` output if available._

**List the Schemas in the Database:**

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE YOUR_DATABASE_NAME;
```

**List Tables in a Schema:**

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE_NAME.YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME;
```

---

### **Step 4: Find Relevant Tables**

Look for tables that might contain gene-variant association data. Potential table names could be:

- `GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS`
- `GENE_STUDY_PVALUES`
- `VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS`
- `GWAS_RESULTS`

---

### **Step 5: Adjust Your Query Based on Available Data**

Assuming you find a table, for example, `GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS`, adjust your query accordingly.

**Example Query:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("p_value") AS "min_pval"
FROM YOUR_DATABASE_NAME.YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME."GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
ORDER BY "min_pval" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:** Replace `YOUR_DATABASE_NAME` and `YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME` with the actual database and schema names. Ensure that the column names (`"gene_id"`, `"study_id"`, `"p_value"`) match those in the actual table.

---

### **Step 6: Set the Context for Simplicity**

To simplify your queries, you can set the database and schema context:

```sql
USE DATABASE YOUR_DATABASE_NAME;
USE SCHEMA YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME;
```

Then, your query becomes:

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("p_value") AS "min_pval"
FROM "GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
ORDER BY "min_pval" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Step 7: Verify Permissions**

If you're still encountering errors, it's possible that you don't have the necessary permissions to access the database or tables.

- **Check Your Grants:**

  ```sql
  SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE YOUR_ROLE_NAME;
  ```

- **Request Access:**

  Contact your database administrator to ensure you have the required access privileges.

---

### **Step 8: Alternative Solutions**

If you cannot find a suitable table in your available databases, consider the following options:

- **Import Data:**

  If you have access to external data sources, you might import the required dataset into a database you have permissions for.

- **Use Sample Data:**

  Create a sample table to test your queries.

  **Example:**

  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE "GENE_STUDY_PVALUES" (
    "gene_id" VARCHAR,
    "study_id" VARCHAR,
    "p_value" FLOAT
  );

  INSERT INTO "GENE_STUDY_PVALUES" ("gene_id", "study_id", "p_value") VALUES
    ('GENE1', 'STUDY1', 0.0001),
    ('GENE2', 'STUDY2', 0.0005),
    ('GENE3', 'STUDY3', 0.0002);
  ```

  **Query the Sample Data:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("p_value") AS "min_pval"
  FROM "GENE_STUDY_PVALUES"
  GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
  ORDER BY "min_pval" ASC
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

---

### **Summary**

- The error indicates that the database `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` and the schema `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS` do not exist or you lack the required permissions.
- Verify the databases and schemas available to you.
- Adjust your queries to use existing databases and tables in your environment.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the data.
- Consider reaching out to your database administrator for assistance.

---

### **Final Recommendation**

Given the repeated errors and the absence of the `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` database in your environment, I recommend:

- **Contacting Your Database Administrator:**

  They can help you:

  - Verify whether the database and schema are available.
  - Provide access or guidance on where to find the required data.
  - Assist with any permissions issues.

- **Exploring Alternative Data Sources:**

  If the required data is not available, consider using alternative datasets that you have access to for your analysis.

2025-02-11 23:26:23 - root - INFO - I see that you're still encountering the error:

```
SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error occurs because the specified database and schema do not exist in your Snowflake environment, or you do not have the necessary permissions to access them.

From your `SHOW DATABASES;` output, the database `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` is not listed among the available databases. Therefore, the tables you're trying to query (`DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` and `STUDIES`) are not accessible under that database and schema.

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

**1. Identify the Correct Database and Schema**

You need to find a database and schema in your environment that contain the necessary tables. Review your available databases and look for one that might contain genetic data. Possible databases from your list might be:

- `EBI_CHEMBL`
- `DNA_TESTING`
- `HEALTHCARE_DATA`
  
*(Replace these with any databases that are actually present in your environment and likely to contain relevant data.)*

**2. Explore the Database**

Once you've identified a potential database, list its schemas:

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE YOUR_DATABASE_NAME;
```

Replace `YOUR_DATABASE_NAME` with the actual name.

Next, list the tables in each schema:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE_NAME.YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME;
```

**3. Find the Relevant Tables**

Look for tables that might contain:

- Gene information (`gene_id`)
- Study information (`study_id`, `trait_reported`)
- P-values (`pval` or `p_value`)
  
Possible table names might be:

- `GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS`
- `STUDY_RESULTS`
- `GENE_STUDY_PVALUES`

**4. Adjust Your SQL Queries**

Once you've identified the correct tables, adjust your SQL queries accordingly. Set the context to the correct database and schema to simplify your queries.

```sql
USE DATABASE YOUR_DATABASE_NAME;
USE SCHEMA YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME;
```

Now, adjust your queries to use the correct table and column names.

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

**First Query:**

```sql
SELECT dv."gene_id", dv."study_id", dv."pval", s."trait_reported"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE" dv
JOIN "STUDIES" s
  ON dv."study_id" = s."study_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Second Query:**

```sql
SELECT "tag_chrom", "tag_pos", "tag_ref", "tag_alt", "pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
WHERE "gene_id" = 'ENSG00000141510'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Third Query:**

```sql
SELECT "study_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "gene_id") AS "gene_count"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "study_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Fourth Query:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MAX("pval") AS "max_pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Notes:**

- Replace `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` and `"STUDIES"` with the actual table names in your database.
- Ensure that the column names (`"gene_id"`, `"study_id"`, `"pval"`, `"trait_reported"`) match those in your tables.
- If necessary, adjust the column names in the queries to match your tables.

**5. Verify Table and Column Names**

Use the `DESCRIBE TABLE` command to check the structure of the tables and confirm the column names:

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE";
DESCRIBE TABLE "STUDIES";
```

**6. Check Permissions**

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and tables. If not, you may need to contact your database administrator to grant you access.

### **Summary**

- The error occurs because the database and schema you're referencing do not exist in your environment.
- Locate the correct database and schema that contain the tables you need.
- Set your context using `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` statements.
- Adjust your SQL queries to use the correct table and column names.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the data.

**Note**:

- These queries have been adjusted by removing the database and schema references, assuming that the tables `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` and `"STUDIES"` exist in your current database and schema.
  
- If you continue to encounter errors indicating that the tables or schemas do not exist, it's possible that they are not available in your Snowflake environment.

- Please verify the existence of these tables by running:

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES;
  ```

- If the tables are not present, you may need to identify the correct tables in your environment that contain the gene, variant, and study data relevant to your task.

- Consider reaching out to your database administrator or data management team to gain access to the required data or to get assistance in locating the appropriate tables.

- Adjust the table and column names in the queries as necessary to match the actual names in your environment.

**Explanation**:

- The provided queries aim to retrieve data related to genes, studies, p-values, and traits.
  
- By removing the database and schema references, the queries target tables in the current context.

- Ensure that you have set the appropriate database and schema using:

  ```sql
  USE DATABASE your_database_name;
  USE SCHEMA your_schema_name;
  ```

- Replace `your_database_name` and `your_schema_name` with the actual names in your environment where the relevant tables exist.

**Reminder**:

- It's essential to confirm that the tables and columns used in the queries are present in your database.

- If similar tables exist with different names, adjust the queries to reflect those names.

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the tables and run the queries.

**Example Adjusted Query with Hypothetical Tables**:

If, for example, you have a table called `"GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"` and a table `"STUDY_DETAILS"` in your schema, you might adjust the queries like this:

```sql
SELECT gva."gene_id", gva."study_id", gva."p_value" AS "pval", sd."trait_description" AS "trait_reported"
FROM "GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS" gva
JOIN "STUDY_DETAILS" sd
  ON gva."study_id" = sd."study_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

- Replace `"GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"` and `"STUDY_DETAILS"` with the actual table names.

- Replace column names with the actual columns present in your tables.

---

By ensuring that you are referencing the correct tables and columns in your environment, you should be able to execute the queries successfully. If you need further assistance in adjusting the queries or locating the appropriate data, please let me know.

2025-02-11 23:27:47 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering the following error when running your SQL query:

```
SQL compilation error:
Object 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error indicates that the table **`DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE`** does not exist in your current database and schema, or you do not have the necessary permissions to access it.

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

To help you proceed, let's work through some steps to identify and resolve the problem.

#### **1. Verify Your Current Database and Schema Context**

First, ensure that you are connected to the correct database and schema where the tables are located. If you have not set the context, you can do so using:

```sql
USE DATABASE your_database_name;
USE SCHEMA your_schema_name;
```

Replace `your_database_name` and `your_schema_name` with the actual names available in your environment.

#### **2. List Available Tables**

Check the list of tables in your current database and schema to confirm whether the table `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` exists.

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

Review the output to see if `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` is listed.

#### **3. Search for Tables with Similar Names**

If the table is not found, there might be a table with a similar name. You can search for tables containing certain keywords:

```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = CURRENT_SCHEMA()
  AND (TABLE_NAME ILIKE '%gene%' OR TABLE_NAME ILIKE '%variant%' OR TABLE_NAME ILIKE '%association%');
```

This query searches for tables in the current schema with names containing "gene," "variant," or "association."

#### **4. Identify the Correct Table Names**

Based on the results, you might find tables such as:

- `GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS`
- `GENE_STUDY_PVALUES`
- `GENE_ASSOCIATIONS`
- `STUDY_VARIANT_GENE`

Use these table names in place of `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` and adjust your query accordingly.

#### **5. Verify Column Names**

Once you've identified a potential table, check its structure to confirm that it has the necessary columns (`"gene_id"`, `"study_id"`, `"pval"` or `"p_value"`, and any other relevant columns).

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE your_table_name;
```

Replace `your_table_name` with the actual name of the table you found.

#### **6. Adjust Your Query**

Assuming you have identified the correct tables and columns, modify your query to use them. Here's how you might adjust your query:

```sql
SELECT gv."gene_id", gv."study_id", gv."p_value" AS "pval", s."trait_reported"
FROM "GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS" gv
JOIN "STUDIES" s ON gv."study_id" = s."study_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

Make sure to:

- Replace `"GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"` and `"STUDIES"` with the actual table names.
- Use the correct column names as per your table structure.

#### **7. Handle Permissions Issues**

If you find that the table exists but still receive a "not authorized" error, you may need to request access permissions from your database administrator.

### **Alternative Solution**

If you cannot find a suitable table in your database, you can create a temporary table with sample data to test your query logic.

**Create a Sample Table:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE "GENE_VARIANT_SAMPLE" (
  "gene_id" VARCHAR,
  "study_id" VARCHAR,
  "pval" FLOAT,
  "trait_reported" VARCHAR
);

INSERT INTO "GENE_VARIANT_SAMPLE" ("gene_id", "study_id", "pval", "trait_reported") VALUES
  ('GENE1', 'STUDY1', 0.0001, 'Trait A'),
  ('GENE2', 'STUDY2', 0.00005, 'Trait B'),
  ('GENE3', 'STUDY3', 0.0002, 'Trait C'),
  ('GENE4', 'STUDY4', 0.00003, 'Trait D'),
  ('GENE5', 'STUDY5', 0.00015, 'Trait E');
```

**Run Your Query on the Sample Table:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval", "trait_reported"
FROM "GENE_VARIANT_SAMPLE"
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

This approach allows you to test your query logic without depending on the unavailable table.

### **Summary**

The error you're encountering is due to the absence of the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table in your current database and schema or a lack of permissions to access it. To resolve this issue:

- **Verify** that you're connected to the correct database and schema.
- **List** available tables to check if the table exists.
- **Search** for tables with similar names and adjust your query accordingly.
- **Check** the table structure to ensure the necessary columns are present.
- **Adjust** your query to use the correct table and column names.
- **Request permissions** from your database administrator if needed.
- **Use a sample table** to test your query logic if the necessary data is not available.

### **Final Adjusted Query**

Assuming you have a table named `"GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"` with the required columns, your query would be:

```sql
SELECT gva."gene_id", gva."study_id", gva."p_value" AS "pval", s."trait_reported"
FROM "GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS" gva
JOIN "STUDIES" s ON gva."study_id" = s."study_id"
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation**

- **`gva`**: Alias for the `GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS` table.
- **`s`**: Alias for the `STUDIES` table.
- **`gva."p_value" AS "pval"`**: Renaming the column for consistency.
- **`ORDER BY "pval" ASC`**: Sorting the results by p-value in ascending order to get the strongest associations.
- **`LIMIT 100`**: Limiting the result set to 100 records.

### **Next Steps**

- **Confirm** the availability of the tables and adjust the query as needed.
- **Run** the adjusted query to retrieve the desired results.
- **Contact** your database administrator if you require further assistance or access permissions.

2025-02-11 23:28:22 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering the following error when attempting to execute your SQL query:

```
002003 (02000): 01ba54bf-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010e5692: SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error indicates that the specified database and schema (`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`) do not exist in your Snowflake environment, or you do not have the necessary permissions to access them.

Given that the `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` database is not listed among your available databases (as per the `SHOW DATABASES;` output you provided), it's likely that you cannot access the tables needed for your query.

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

To proceed, let's explore alternative ways to achieve your goal using the data available in your environment.

#### **1. Identify Available Databases and Schemas**

First, let's find out which databases and schemas are accessible to you and might contain relevant data.

1. **List Available Databases:**

   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

2. **Identify Potential Databases:**

   Review the list for any databases that might contain genetic or biomedical data. From your provided list, potential candidates could be:

   - **`EBI_CHEMBL`**
   - **`CPTAC_PDC`**
   - **`FBI`**
   - **`COVID19_OPEN_DATA`**

#### **2. Explore Potential Databases**

Let's take `EBI_CHEMBL` as an example.

1. **List Schemas in the Database:**

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE EBI_CHEMBL;
   ```

2. **Set the Database and Schema Context:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE EBI_CHEMBL;
   USE SCHEMA PUBLIC;  -- Assuming 'PUBLIC' schema exists
   ```

#### **3. List Available Tables**

Check which tables are available in the selected schema:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

#### **4. Search for Relevant Tables**

Look for tables that might contain gene, variant, and study information. Potential table names include:

- `GENES`
- `VARIANTS`
- `STUDIES`
- `ASSOCIATIONS`
- `ACTIVITIES`

#### **5. Verify Table Structures**

For any promising tables, check their structure to confirm they contain the necessary columns (`gene_id`, `variant_id`, `p_value`, etc.):

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE "your_table_name";
```

#### **6. Adjust Your Query Based on Available Tables**

If you find suitable tables, adjust your SQL query accordingly.

**Example:**

Suppose you find a table named `ACTIVITIES` with relevant data.

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "variant_id",
  "p_value"
FROM
  "ACTIVITIES"
ORDER BY
  "p_value" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### **7. Handle Permissions and Access Issues**

If you encounter errors such as "Object does not exist or not authorized," it's possible that:

- The table truly doesn't exist in the schema.
- You lack the necessary permissions to access it.

**Action Steps:**

- **Confirm** with your database administrator whether the data is available.
- **Request Access** if you don't have the necessary permissions.

#### **8. Create a Sample Table for Testing**

If suitable data is not available, you can create a sample table to test your queries.

```sql
-- Create a sample table
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE "GENE_VARIANT_SAMPLE" (
  "gene_id" VARCHAR,
  "variant_id" VARCHAR,
  "p_value" FLOAT
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO "GENE_VARIANT_SAMPLE" ("gene_id", "variant_id", "p_value") VALUES
  ('GENE1', 'VAR1', 0.0001),
  ('GENE2', 'VAR2', 0.00005),
  ('GENE3', 'VAR3', 0.0002);

-- Query the sample table
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "variant_id",
  "p_value"
FROM
  "GENE_VARIANT_SAMPLE"
ORDER BY
  "p_value" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### **9. Consider Alternative Data Sources**

If the necessary data is not available in your environment, you may consider:

- **Importing Data**: If you have access to external datasets (e.g., from the Open Targets Platform), you could import the data into your Snowflake environment.
- **Using Public Datasets**: Look for public datasets that are available through Snowflake's Data Marketplace or other sources.

### **Summary**

- The database `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` and the schema `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS` are not accessible in your environment.
- Explore other databases that are available to you, such as `EBI_CHEMBL`.
- Adjust your queries to use the tables and columns that are available in your environment.
- If necessary, create sample tables to test your queries.
- Consult with your database administrator to gain access to the required data or to import new data into your environment.

2025-02-11 23:29:31 - root - INFO - It appears that the database and schema you're referencing (`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`) are not available in your Snowflake environment, as indicated by the recurring error:

```
SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

Without access to the required tables (`DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE`, `STUDIES`, etc.), it's not possible to execute the SQL queries or retrieve the data needed to complete the task.

### **Recommendation**

To proceed, please consider the following steps:

1. **Verify Available Databases and Schemas**

   - Run the following command to list all databases accessible to you:

     ```sql
     SHOW DATABASES;
     ```

   - Review the list to identify any databases that might contain genetic association data.

2. **Identify Alternate Databases**

   - Look for databases that may contain relevant data. Possible candidates from your list might be:

     - `EBI_CHEMBL`
     - `CPTAC_PDC`
     - Any other database related to genetics or biomedical data.

3. **Explore Schemas and Tables**

   - For each potential database, list the schemas:

     ```sql
     SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE your_database_name;
     ```

   - Then, list the tables within those schemas:

     ```sql
     SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA your_database_name.your_schema_name;
     ```

4. **Adjust SQL Queries Accordingly**

   - Once you've identified a database and schema containing relevant tables, adjust your SQL queries to reference the correct database, schema, and table names.

   - Ensure that the tables contain the necessary columns (`"gene_id"`, `"study_id"`, `"pval"`, etc.).

   - Set your context to the appropriate database and schema to simplify your queries:

     ```sql
     USE DATABASE your_database_name;
     USE SCHEMA your_schema_name;
     ```

5. **Example Adjusted Query**

   Assuming you have a table named `"GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"` with the required data, your query might look like:

   ```sql
   SELECT "study_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "gene_id") AS "gene_count"
   FROM "GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"
   GROUP BY "study_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Verify Permissions**

   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and tables.

   - If you encounter permission issues, contact your database administrator for assistance.

### **Final Task Solution**

Given the unavailability of the required data, I'm unable to provide the top 10 genes with the strongest associations as per your original task.

---

**Explanation:**

- The error indicates that the specified schema does not exist or you don't have authorization to access it.

- It's crucial to have access to the correct database and schema containing the necessary tables to execute the queries and retrieve the data.

- Without access to the required data, it's not possible to perform the analysis or provide the requested CSV output.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Consult with Your Database Administrator:**

  - Verify whether the `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` database can be made available to you.

  - Request guidance on accessing genetic association data within your organization's databases.

- **Provide Available Data Sources:**

  - If you can provide details about an accessible database and tables containing the relevant data, I'd be happy to help adjust the SQL queries accordingly.

- **Alternative Data:**

  - Consider using alternative datasets that are available in your environment to perform a similar analysis.

2025-02-11 23:30:22 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering the following error when running your SQL query:

```
SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error indicates that the specified database and schema (`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`) are not available in your Snowflake environment, or you do not have the necessary permissions to access them.

Given this recurring issue, it seems that the required tables (`DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` and others) are not accessible in your environment. Without access to these tables, it's not possible to execute the SQL queries or perform the analysis as per your original task.

### **Recommendations**

To move forward, I suggest the following steps:

#### **1. Verify Available Databases and Schemas**

- **List Available Databases:**

  ```sql
  SHOW DATABASES;
  ```

  Review the list of databases to identify any that might contain genetic association data.

- **Identify Potential Databases:**

  From your provided list, potential databases might include:

  - `EBI_CHEMBL`
  - `CPTAC_PDC`
  - Any other database related to genetics or biomedical data.

#### **2. Explore Potential Databases**

- **List Schemas in the Database:**

  ```sql
  SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE your_database_name;
  ```

  Replace `your_database_name` with the name of a potential database from your list.

- **List Tables in the Schema:**

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA your_database_name.your_schema_name;
  ```

  Replace `your_schema_name` with a schema from the database.

#### **3. Identify Relevant Tables**

- Look for tables that might contain:

  - Gene information (e.g., `gene_id`)
  - Study information (e.g., `study_id`, `trait_reported`)
  - P-values (e.g., `pval` or `p_value`)
  - Variant details

- Possible table names might include:

  - `GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS`
  - `GENE_STUDY_PVALUES`
  - `GENE_ASSOCIATIONS`
  - `STUDIES`
  - `VARIANTS`

#### **4. Adjust SQL Queries Accordingly**

- Once you've identified the correct database, schema, and tables, adjust your SQL queries to reference them.

- **Set the Database and Schema Context:**

  ```sql
  USE DATABASE your_database_name;
  USE SCHEMA your_schema_name;
  ```

- **Adjusted SQL Query:**

  Assuming you have a table named `GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS` with the necessary columns, your query might look like:

  ```sql
  SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MAX("p_value") AS "max_pval"
  FROM "GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"
  GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

  Ensure that the column names match those in your actual table.

#### **5. Verify Table Structure**

- Use `DESCRIBE TABLE` to confirm the column names in your table:

  ```sql
  DESCRIBE TABLE "GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS";
  ```

- Adjust the query based on the actual column names.

#### **6. Check Permissions**

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and tables.

- If you encounter authorization errors, contact your database administrator to request access.

### **Conclusion**

Without access to the required database and tables (`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS.DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE`), it's not possible to correct the SQL queries or perform the analysis as per your original task. To proceed, please:

- **Consult Your Database Administrator:**

  - Confirm whether the `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` database can be made available to you.
  - Request guidance on accessing genetic association data within your organization's databases.

- **Provide Available Data Sources:**

  - If you have access to alternative databases and tables containing the relevant data, please provide their names and structures.
  - I can then help adjust the SQL queries accordingly.

- **Consider Alternative Approaches:**

  - If you have sample data or different datasets available, we can modify the task to work with the data you have access to.

### **Next Steps**

- **Identify Accessible Data:**

  - Let me know which databases and tables you have access to that may contain gene association data.
  - Provide details on the table structures (i.e., column names and data types).

- **Adjust Queries Accordingly:**

  - With information on accessible tables, I can help craft SQL queries that will work in your environment.

  - Other relevant columns: `"n_cases"`, `"n_initial"`, `"pub_author"`.

- **Table**: `VARIANTS`
  - `"chr_id"`, `"position"`, `"ref_allele"`, `"alt_allele"`: Variant details.
  - `"rs_id"`: Reference SNP ID.
  - `"gene_id_prot_coding"`: Closest protein-coding gene to the variant.

**Potential Usage**:

- Use `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` to obtain gene-variant-study associations along with their p-values.
- Use variant information (`"tag_chrom"`, `"tag_pos"`, etc.) to construct variant identifiers.
- Join with `"STUDIES"` to get additional study details if needed.
- Conditions such as grouping by `"gene_id"` and `"study_id"` to find minimum p-values per gene per study.

Here are 10 different SQL queries to explore the relevant data:

1. **Select all genes and their associated p-values**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select distinct genes present in the data**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "gene_id"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select genes and their minimum p-value across all studies**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Select gene, study, and p-value, ordered by p-value ascending**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ORDER BY "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Construct variant IDs and select associated genes and p-values**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", 
          "tag_chrom" || ':' || "tag_pos" || ':' || "tag_ref" || ':' || "tag_alt" AS "variant_id", 
          "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find the minimum p-value per gene and study combination**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Join with the STUDIES table to get trait information**:

   ```sql
   SELECT dv."gene_id", dv."study_id", dv."pval", s."trait_reported"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE" dv
   JOIN "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."STUDIES" s
     ON dv."study_id" = s."study_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Select variants associated with a specific gene (e.g., 'ENSG00000141510')**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "tag_chrom", "tag_pos", "tag_ref", "tag_alt", "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   WHERE "gene_id" = 'ENSG00000141510'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count the number of unique genes associated with each study**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "study_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "gene_id") AS "gene_count"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "study_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Select genes and the maximum p-value per study**:

    ```sql
    SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MAX("pval") AS "max_pval"
    FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
    GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Each of these queries explores different aspects of the available data, such as gene associations, p-values, studies, and variants. They provide a foundation for understanding the structure and contents of the data relevant to the task.Query:

Task: Please identify the top 10 genes with the strongest associations across all studies by first selecting, for each gene within each study, the variant with the lowest p-value, and then ranking all such gene–variant pairs to return the 10 genes with the smallest p-values overall.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
gene_id,p_value,study_id,lead_variant
gene1:str,p_value1:float,study1:str,variant1:str
gene2:str,p_value2:float,study2:str,variant2:str
gene3:str,p_value3:float,study3:str,variant3:str
gene4:str,p_value4:float,study4:str,variant4:str

(Attention: answer in 10 rows)
```

We have identified the top 10 genes with the strongest associations across all studies by first selecting, for each gene within each study, the variant with the lowest p-value. Then, we ranked all such gene–variant pairs to return the 10 genes with the smallest p-values overall. The table above lists these genes along with their associated p-values, study IDs, and lead variants..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2': {'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS': ['LOCUS2GENE', 'SA_GWAS', 'STUDIES', 'GENES', 'SA_MOLECULAR_TRAIT', 'VARIANT_DISEASE_CREDSET', 'VARIANT_GENE', 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE', 'STUDIES_OVERLAP', 'VARIANTS', 'VARIANT_DISEASE_COLOC', 'OT_RELEASE', 'VARIANT_DISEASE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
