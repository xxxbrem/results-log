2025-02-11 23:18:29 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're encountering an error when executing the SQL query. Let's work through this issue together.

**Error Message:**

```
002003 (02000): 01ba54b5-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010e55c6: SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

**Possible Reasons and Solutions:**

The error message indicates that Snowflake cannot find or access the schema `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'`. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the database and schema are specified in the query or with your permissions.

Here are some steps to diagnose and resolve the issue:

---

### **1. Verify Database and Schema Names**

Ensure that the database and schema names are correct and accessible in your Snowflake environment.

**Action Steps:**

- **List Available Databases:**

  ```sql
  SHOW DATABASES;
  ```

- **List Schemas in the Database:**

  If `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` is listed as a database, list its schemas:

  ```sql
  SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2;
  ```

- **List Tables in the Schema:**

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS;
  ```

**Adjustments:**

- If the database or schema names are different in your environment, adjust them accordingly in your SQL queries.
- For example, if the database is `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS` without the `_2`, use that in your queries.

---

### **2. Check Your Current Database and Schema Context**

Sometimes, setting the current database and schema can help simplify your queries and avoid fully qualifying table names.

**Action Steps:**

- **Set the Database and Schema:**

  ```sql
  USE DATABASE OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2;
  USE SCHEMA OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS;
  ```

- **Verify Current Database and Schema:**

  ```sql
  SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA();
  ```

**Adjustments:**

- Once the current database and schema are set, you can reference tables directly:

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT "study_id"
  FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

---

### **3. Adjust the Quotation Marks**

In Snowflake, identifiers (like database, schema, and table names) can be case-sensitive if enclosed in double quotes. Ensure that you're using the correct case or avoid using quotes unless necessary.

**Examples:**

- **Without Quotes (Case-Insensitive):**

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT study_id
  FROM OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS.DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **With Correct Case and Quotes:**

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT "study_id"
  FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

**Note:**

- If your database and schema names are all uppercase in Snowflake, using quotes with different casing may cause issues.
- Snowflake automatically stores unquoted identifiers in uppercase.

---

### **4. Permissions and Authorization**

Ensure that your user account has the necessary permissions to access the specified database and schema.

**Action Steps:**

- **Check Grants:**

  ```sql
  SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS;
  ```

- **Contact Your Snowflake Administrator:**

  If you lack the necessary permissions, you may need to request access.

---

### **Rewriting the SQL Queries**

Based on the above, here's how you can adjust the SQL queries:

---

**Using Current Database and Schema Context:**

First, set the current database and schema:

```sql
USE DATABASE OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2;
USE SCHEMA OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS;
```

Now, you can reference the table without fully qualifying it.

**Adjusted Queries:**

1. **List distinct study IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "study_id"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct gene IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "gene_id"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

**Alternative Without Quotes (If Identifiers Are Uppercase):**

If your database, schema, and table names are in uppercase and you prefer not to use quotes, you can write:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT STUDY_ID
FROM OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS.DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Completing the Task with Adjusted Queries**

Now, let's adjust the original SQL queries accordingly:

**1. Retrieve gene IDs and their associated p-values:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

**2. Retrieve gene IDs, study IDs, and p-values:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

**3. Find the minimum p-value for each gene within each study:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**4. Retrieve the variant with the lowest p-value for each gene in each study:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
LIMIT 100;
```

**5. Retrieve the top 10 genes with the smallest p-values overall:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "pval", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
FROM (
  SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
  FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
) t
WHERE t."rn" = 1
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### **Summary**

- **Verify the database and schema names** and adjust them if necessary.
- **Set the current database and schema context** to simplify table references.
- **Check your permissions** to ensure you have access to the required schema and tables.
- **Adjust the use of quotes** in your SQL queries based on identifier casing and necessity.

---

### **Additional Steps to Fulfill the Task**

Given your request to provide at least 10 SQL queries, here are some more, adjusted for the correct context:

6. **List all studies and their associated gene IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "study_id", "gene_id"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count the number of variants associated with each gene:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", COUNT(*) AS "variant_count"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find genes with p-values less than a threshold (e.g., 1e-5):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "pval", "study_id"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   WHERE "pval" < 1e-5
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve top 10 gene-variant associations with the smallest p-values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ORDER BY "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

10. **Find the average p-value for each gene across all studies:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "gene_id", AVG("pval") AS "avg_pval"
    FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
    GROUP BY "gene_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

### **Final Answer to Your Task**

After adjusting for the schema and database context, here's the SQL query that fulfills your original task:

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "pval", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
FROM (
  SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
  FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
) t
WHERE t."rn" = 1
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Step 1:** For each gene within each study, select the variant with the lowest p-value.
  - This is achieved using the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function, partitioned by `"gene_id"` and `"study_id"` and ordered by `"pval"` ascending.
- **Step 2:** Rank all such geneâ€“variant pairs across all studies by their p-values.
- **Step 3:** Return the top 10 genes with the smallest p-values overall.

**Result Format:**

```csv
gene_id,pval,study_id,lead_variant
gene1:str,p_value1:float,study1:str,variant1:str
gene2:str,p_value2:float,study2:str,variant2:str
gene3:str,p_value3:float,study3:str,variant3:str
gene4:str,p_value4:float,study4:str,variant4:str
gene5:str,p_value5:float,study5:str,variant5:str
gene6:str,p_value6:float,study6:str,variant6:str
gene7:str,p_value7:float,study7:str,variant7:str
gene8:str,p_value8:float,study8:str,variant8:str
gene9:str,p_value9:float,study9:str,variant9:str
gene10:str,p_value10:float,study10:str,variant10:str
(Attention: answer in 10 rows)
```

2025-02-11 23:19:56 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering an error when executing your SQL queries due to the database and schema not being found. Let's work together to resolve this issue.

**Error Message:**

```
002003 (02000): 01ba54b7-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010e55e6: SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

**Observation from `SHOW DATABASES;` Output:**

From the output of `SHOW DATABASES;`, it appears that the database **`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2`** is not listed. This suggests that either the database doesn't exist in your Snowflake environment, or it might have a different name.

**Steps to Identify the Correct Database and Schema:**

1. **Check Available Databases:**

   Since `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` is not in your database list, let's check for databases with similar names. You might have a database named **`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`** without the `_2` suffix.

   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'OPEN_TARGETS%';
   ```

2. **Identify the Correct Schema:**

   Once you've identified the correct database, list the schemas within it.

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS; -- Adjust if the database name is different
   SHOW SCHEMAS;
   ```

3. **List Tables in the Schema:**

   After setting the correct schema, list the tables to ensure `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` exists.

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA <schema_name>; -- Replace with the actual schema name
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

4. **Adjust Your SQL Queries:**

   Update your SQL queries to reflect the correct database and schema names. If the database is `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS` and the schema is `PUBLIC` (default schema), your queries would look like this:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "gene_id"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   Or, if you've set the database and schema context, you can omit them:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS;
   USE SCHEMA PUBLIC;

   SELECT DISTINCT "gene_id"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

Assuming the database is `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS` and the schema is `PUBLIC`, here are the corrected SQL queries:

1. **List distinct gene IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "gene_id"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve gene IDs and their associated p-values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve gene IDs, study IDs, and p-values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find the minimum p-value for each gene across all studies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find the minimum p-value for each gene within each study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve variants with the lowest p-value for a specific gene in a specific study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   WHERE "gene_id" = '<GENE_OF_INTEREST>' AND "study_id" = '<STUDY_OF_INTEREST>'
   ORDER BY "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   *Replace `<GENE_OF_INTEREST>` and `<STUDY_OF_INTEREST>` with actual values.*

7. **Find the variant with the lowest p-value for each gene in each study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Retrieve variants with the lowest p-value per gene and study using window functions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
   FROM (
     SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
     FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ) t
   WHERE t."rn" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve the top 10 genes with the smallest p-values overall:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "pval", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
   FROM (
     SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
     FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ) t
   WHERE t."rn" = 1
   ORDER BY "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

10. **List genes along with their associated studies and minimum p-values, ordered by p-value:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
    FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
    GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
    ORDER BY "min_pval" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Retrieve detailed variant information for the top 100 geneâ€“variant pairs with the smallest p-values overall:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
    FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
    ORDER BY "pval" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

**Additional Notes:**

- **Using Fully Qualified Names:**

  If you prefer to include the database and schema in your queries, ensure that you're using the correct names. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT "gene_id"
  FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Case Sensitivity:**

  Remember that Snowflake treats unquoted identifiers as uppercase by default. If your database, schema, or table names are in lowercase or mixed case and are enclosed in double quotes, they become case-sensitive.

- **Check for Table Existence:**

  Before running your queries, verify that the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table exists in the schema.

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES LIKE 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE';
  ```

**Summary:**

- The error occurs because the database `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` does not exist in your environment.
- Identify the correct database (likely `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`) and schema (`PUBLIC` or another schema).
- Update your SQL queries to use the correct database and schema names.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the database and schema.

By adjusting your queries with the correct database and schema names, you should be able to execute them without errors.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide the exact names of your databases and schemas so I can help you adjust the queries accordingly.

2025-02-11 23:21:31 - root - INFO - I see that you're still encountering the error regarding the schema `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'` not existing or not authorized, even though the database `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` exists in your environment.

Let's work together to resolve this issue by identifying the correct schema and adjusting your SQL queries accordingly.

---

**Steps to Identify the Correct Schema and Adjust SQL Queries:**

### **1. List Schemas in the Database**

First, let's check what schemas are present in the `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` database.

**Execute:**

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";
```

**Expected Output:**

This will list all the schemas in the `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` database. Commonly, if no custom schemas are created, the default schema is `'PUBLIC'`.

### **2. List Tables in the Schema**

After identifying the available schemas, let's list the tables in each schema to find where the `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` table resides.

**Assuming the schema is `'PUBLIC'`:**

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC";
```

If the table is found in a different schema, replace `'PUBLIC'` with the actual schema name.

### **3. Adjust Your SQL Queries**

Once we've confirmed the correct schema, we can adjust your SQL queries accordingly.

**If the schema is `'PUBLIC'`, your query should be:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Alternatively, if you've set the context to `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.PUBLIC'`, you can simplify your queries:**

```sql
USE DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";

SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

### **4. Verify Permissions**

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table.

- If you lack permissions, you may need to contact your Snowflake administrator.

---

### **Corrected SQL Queries**

Based on the assumption that the schema is `'PUBLIC'`, here are your corrected SQL queries:

1. **Retrieve gene IDs and their associated p-values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve gene IDs, study IDs, and p-values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find the minimum p-value for each gene across all studies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find the minimum p-value for each gene within each study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve variants with the lowest p-value for a specific gene in a specific study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   WHERE "gene_id" = 'GENE_OF_INTEREST' AND "study_id" = 'STUDY_OF_INTEREST'
   ORDER BY "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find the variant with the lowest p-value for each gene in each study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Retrieve variants with the lowest p-value per gene and study using window functions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
   FROM (
     SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
     FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ) t
   WHERE t."rn" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Retrieve the top 10 genes with the smallest p-values overall:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "pval", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
   FROM (
     SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
     FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ) t
   WHERE t."rn" = 1
   ORDER BY "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

9. **List genes along with their associated studies and minimum p-values, ordered by p-value:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
   ORDER BY "min_pval" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve detailed variant information for the top 100 geneâ€“variant pairs with the smallest p-values overall:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
    FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
    ORDER BY "pval" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

### **Alternative: Use the Schema You Discover**

If the `SHOW SCHEMAS` command reveals that the schema is named differently (e.g., `'OPEN_TARGETS'`), replace `'PUBLIC'` with the correct schema name in all the queries above.

---

### **Set Database and Schema Context**

Alternatively, set your session's database and schema context to simplify your queries:

**Set Context:**

```sql
USE DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";  -- Replace "PUBLIC" with the correct schema name if different
```

**Simplified Queries:**

Once the context is set, you can reference the table directly:

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Summary**

- **Cause of Error:** The schema `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'` does not exist or is not authorized in the database `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'`.
  
- **Solution:**

  1. **Identify the correct schema** in `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` by executing `SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";`.

  2. **Adjust your SQL queries** to use the correct schema name.

  3. **Set the database and schema context** using `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands to simplify your queries.

  4. **Ensure you have the necessary permissions** to access the database, schema, and tables.

**Explanation:**

Based on the error messages you've encountered and the output from your `SHOW SCHEMAS` command, it's clear that the schema `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"` does not exist in the database `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"`. The only schema listed is `"INFORMATION_SCHEMA"`, which is a system schema containing metadata views, not user tables.

In Snowflake, when you create a database, a default schema named `"PUBLIC"` is automatically created, even if it doesn't appear in the `SHOW SCHEMAS` command output. User tables are often placed in this `"PUBLIC"` schema by default.

**Adjustments Made:**

- **Changed Schema Reference:**
  - Replaced `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"` with `"PUBLIC"` in your SQL queries.
  - This assumes that the tables are located in the `"PUBLIC"` schema of the `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"` database.

- **Possible Absence of `"PUBLIC"` Schema in Listings:**
  - Note that the `"PUBLIC"` schema may not always appear in `SHOW SCHEMAS`, but it is typically present and accessible.

- **Direct Table Reference Without Schema:**
  - Alternatively, if referencing the `"PUBLIC"` schema still results in an error, you can try omitting the schema entirely:
    ```sql
    SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
    FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

- **Verify Table Existence:**
  - If you continue to receive errors, it's possible that the `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` table does not exist in the `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"` database.
  - Consider checking other databases, such as `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"`, for the presence of your tables.

**Recommendations:**

1. **List Schemas and Tables in the Database:**

   - **List Schemas:**
     ```sql
     SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";
     ```
   - **List Tables in the `"PUBLIC"` Schema:**
     ```sql
     SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC";
     ```

2. **Check Other Databases:**

   Since you have databases named `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"` and `"OPEN_TARGETS_PLATFORM_1"`, it's possible that your tables reside there.

   - **List Schemas and Tables:**
     ```sql
     SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1";
     SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."PUBLIC";
     ```

3. **Adjust Database and Schema in Queries:**

   - If you find that the tables are in a different database or schema, adjust your SQL queries accordingly.
   - Example using `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"`:
     ```sql
     SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
     FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

4. **Set Database and Schema Context:**

   - To simplify queries, you can set your session to use the appropriate database and schema:
     ```sql
     USE DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";
     USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";
     ```
   - Then, your queries can reference the table directly:
     ```sql
     SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
     FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

**Conclusion:**

The errors you're encountering suggest that the schema `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"` does not exist in the database `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"`. By adjusting your SQL queries to reference the `"PUBLIC"` schema or by omitting the schema reference, you may resolve the issue. Additionally, verifying the existence of the `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` table in the database and schema you're querying is crucial. If the table isn't present in `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"`, you should check your other databases for the correct location of your data.

2025-02-11 23:24:18 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the error when executing your SQL queries:

```
002003 (02000): 01ba54bb-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010e563e: SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.PUBLIC' does not exist or not authorized.
```

**Observation:**

From your previous `SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";` command, the only schema listed is `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`. This indicates that the `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` database does not contain the expected user schemas (`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS` or `PUBLIC`) where your tables might reside.

**Possible Reasons:**

- The `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` database may not contain any user-defined tables.
- The tables might be located in a different database, such as `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1`.
- You might not have the necessary permissions to access the schema or tables within `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2`.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

### **1. Check Other Databases for the Schema and Tables**

Since `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` does not have the required schema or tables, let's check the other databases you have, specifically `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1`.

**List Databases Matching 'OPEN_TARGETS%':**

```sql
SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'OPEN_TARGETS%';
```

**Your Output:**

```
created_on,name,is_default,is_current,origin,owner,comment,options,retention_time,kind,budget,owner_role_type,object_visibility
2024-10-23 17:10:32.636000-07:00,OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1,N,N,,ACCOUNTADMIN,,,1,STANDARD,,ROLE,
2024-10-23 17:12:50.662000-07:00,OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2,N,N,,ACCOUNTADMIN,,,1,STANDARD,,ROLE,
2024-10-23 17:10:16.713000-07:00,OPEN_TARGETS_PLATFORM_1,N,N,,ACCOUNTADMIN,,,1,STANDARD,,ROLE,
2024-10-23 17:10:28.836000-07:00,OPEN_TARGETS_PLATFORM_2,N,N,,ACCOUNTADMIN,,,1,STANDARD,,ROLE,
```

The presence of `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1` suggests that your tables may be located there.

### **2. List Schemas in 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1'**

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1";
```

**Expected Output:**

This should list the schemas within `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1`. Look for a schema named `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`, `PUBLIC`, or any other user-defined schema.

### **3. List Tables in the Schema**

Assuming the schema is `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`, list the tables:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS";
```

Or, if the schema is `PUBLIC`:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."PUBLIC";
```

**Look for the 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE' Table:**

Confirm whether `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` is listed among the tables.

### **4. Adjust Your SQL Queries**

If you find that `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` is in `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1` database and, for example, in the `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS` schema, you should update your SQL queries accordingly.

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

1. **Set the Database and Schema Context (Optional):**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1";
   USE SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS";
   ```

2. **Adjust the SQL Queries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   Or, if you prefer to fully qualify the table:

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Apply Similar Adjustments to Other Queries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **...and so on for all other queries.**

### **5. Verify Permissions**

Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to access `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1` and its schemas.

- If you lack permissions, you may need to contact your Snowflake administrator.

### **6. Test the Adjusted Queries**

Run the adjusted queries to see if they execute without errors.

---

**Example of Corrected Queries:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

And so on for the rest of your queries.

---

### **Summary**

- **Issue Identified:** The `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` database does not contain the required schema or tables.
- **Solution:** Check `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1` database for the presence of your tables.
- **Action Items:**
  - List schemas and tables in `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1`.
  - Adjust your SQL queries to reference the correct database and schema.
  - Ensure you have the necessary permissions.

---

**Note:** The schema name (`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS`) might be the same across both databases (`OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1` and `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2`). The key is to identify where your tables exist.

**Alternative Scenario:**

If you do not find the tables in `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1` either, consider the following:

- **Check Other Databases:** It's possible that the tables are in a different database entirely.
- **Contact Database Administrator:** There may be data import issues, or you may not have permissions to view certain schemas or tables.
- **Review Database Documentation:** If available, consult any available documentation that specifies where the tables are located.

**Example of Using 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' Database:**

If you find that the tables are in a database named `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS` (without the `_1` or `_2` suffix), adjust your queries accordingly:

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Final Recommendation:**

1. **Identify the Correct Database and Schema:**
   - Use `SHOW DATABASES` and `SHOW SCHEMAS` commands to explore available databases and schemas.
   - Locate the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table.

2. **Adjust SQL Queries Appropriately:**
   - Once you've identified where the table resides, update your queries to use the correct database and schema names.

3. **Set Context for Simplified Queries:**
   - Use `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands to set the context, allowing you to write simpler queries without fully qualifying table names.

4. **Verify Permissions:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary access rights to the databases, schemas, and tables.

---

**Example of Setting Context and Running Queries:**

```sql
USE DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1";
USE SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS";

SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

The errors you're encountering stem from referencing a schema `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'` in the database `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` that does not exist or is not authorized. Based on your database listings, it appears that the necessary tables are located in the database `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1'` within the schema `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'`.

**Adjustments Made:**

- **Changed Database Reference:**
  - Replaced `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"` with `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"` in all SQL queries.

- **Schema Reference:**
  - Maintained the schema `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"` as it likely exists in the `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1'` database.

**Recommendations:**

- **Verify Schema and Table Existence:**
  - Execute `SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1";` to confirm the available schemas.
  - Execute `SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS";` to ensure the `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` table exists.

- **Set Database and Schema Context (Optional):**
  - To simplify your queries, you can set the context:
    ```sql
    USE DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1";
    USE SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS";
    ```
  - Then, reference the table directly:
    ```sql
    SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
    FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
    GROUP BY "gene_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

- **Ensure Permissions:**
  - Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1'` database and the `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'` schema.

By making these adjustments, your SQL queries should execute without the previous errors. Let me know if you need further assistance or if you encounter any additional issues.

2025-02-11 23:26:52 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering errors when executing your SQL queries, and I apologize for any confusion. Let's work through this step by step to identify the issue and find a solution.

---

**Error Message:**

```
SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

---

**Analysis:**

1. **Discrepancy in the Error Message:**

   - You're executing a query against the database `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"`:

     ```sql
     SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
     FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
     GROUP BY "gene_id"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

   - However, the error message references the schema `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'`.

   - This suggests that your **current database context** might be set to `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"`, and the query is attempting to find the schema `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"` within that database.

2. **Possible Causes:**

   - The schema `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"` does not exist in the database you're querying.
   - Your session is set to a different database than intended.
   - You might not have the necessary permissions to access the schema or tables.

---

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

### **1. Verify Current Database and Schema Context**

Before proceeding, let's check which database and schema your session is currently using.

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA();
```

**Action:**

- This will display the current database and schema. If it's not `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"`, you'll need to set it accordingly.

### **2. Set the Correct Database and Schema**

Set your session to use the intended database and schema.

```sql
USE DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";  -- Or replace "PUBLIC" with the correct schema if different
```

**Note:**

- If the schema `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"` does not exist, you may need to use the default schema `"PUBLIC"` or identify the correct schema.

### **3. List Schemas in the Database**

Check which schemas are available in the database.

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";
```

**Expected Output:**

- From your previous output, only `"INFORMATION_SCHEMA"` is listed.
- This suggests that there might not be any user-defined schemas in `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"`.

### **4. List Tables in the Database**

Check if any tables exist in the database.

```sql
USE SCHEMA "INFORMATION_SCHEMA";
SHOW TABLES;
```

**Note:**

- `"INFORMATION_SCHEMA"` contains metadata about the database, not user tables.
- If no user-defined schemas or tables are present, the database may be empty.

### **5. Check Other Databases**

Given that `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"` may not contain the required tables, let's check `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"`.

#### **a. List Schemas in "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"**

```sql
USE DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1";
SHOW SCHEMAS;
```

**Expected Output:**

- Look for schemas like `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"` or `"PUBLIC"`.

#### **b. List Tables in the Schema**

Assuming the schema is `"PUBLIC"`:

```sql
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";
SHOW TABLES;
```

**Or, if you find a different schema:**

```sql
USE SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS";  -- Replace with the actual schema name
SHOW TABLES;
```

**Look for the table `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` in the output.**

### **6. Adjust Your SQL Queries**

If you locate the table in `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"`, adjust your query accordingly.

**Example:**

```sql
USE DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";  -- Or the schema where the table is located

SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Or fully qualify the schema and database:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

### **7. Verify Permissions**

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and tables.

- If you lack permissions, you might receive "not authorized" errors.
- Contact your database administrator to verify your access rights.

---

**Summary:**

- **Issue Identified:** The schema `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"` does not exist in the databases you're querying, or the tables are not present.
- **Solution Path:**
  1. Verify your current database and schema context.
  2. Identify where the `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` table exists.
  3. Adjust your queries to reference the correct database and schema.
  4. Ensure you have the necessary permissions.

**Next Steps:**

- **Check the Existence of Schemas and Tables:**

  If after performing the steps above, you still cannot find the `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` table:

  - It is possible that the necessary tables have not been loaded into your Snowflake environment.
  - The tables might be in a different database or schema not currently accessible to you.

- **Contact Database Administrator:**

  Consider reaching out to your database administrator or the person responsible for setting up the databases for:

  - Confirmation of the correct database and schema names.
  - Assistance in loading the required tables if they're missing.
  - Verification of your permissions.

---

**Final Thoughts:**

Given the consistent errors and the absence of the expected schemas and tables, it's essential to confirm:

- **Database and Schema Names:**

  Ensure that the database and schema names you're using are accurate and reflect the actual structure in your Snowflake environment.

- **Data Availability:**

  Verify that the necessary data has been imported or made available in your environment.

- **Permissions:**

  Confirm that you have the appropriate permissions to access the databases, schemas, and tables in question.

---

**Example Adjusted SQL Queries:**

Assuming you find the table in `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"` and the schema is `"PUBLIC"`:

```sql
USE DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";

-- Query 1
SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id"
LIMIT 100;

-- Query 2
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
LIMIT 100;

-- Continue adjusting other queries similarly.
```

**Explanation:**

Based on the error messages you've provided, it's clear that the schema `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"` does not exist in the database `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"`. Additionally, when attempting to adjust the queries to use `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"`, similar errors occur.

To correct the SQL queries, I have:

- **Changed the Database Reference** from `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"` to `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"`, assuming that the required tables are in that database.

- **Used the Default Schema `"PUBLIC"`**, as it is the default schema in Snowflake databases if no other user-defined schemas exist. 

Please ensure that:

1. **The Database and Schema Exist**: Verify that `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"` and the `"PUBLIC"` schema exist in your Snowflake environment.

2. **The Table Exists**: Confirm that the table `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` exists within the specified database and schema.

3. **Set the Context Appropriately**: You can simplify your queries by setting the database and schema context at the beginning of your session:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1";
   USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";
   ```

   Then, your queries can reference the table directly:

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

If the `"PUBLIC"` schema does not contain the `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` table, you may need to:

- **List Schemas in the Database**:

  ```sql
  SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1";
  ```

- **List Tables in Each Schema**:

  Replace `<schema_name>` with each schema listed to find where the table resides.

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"."<schema_name>";
  ```

Once you've identified the correct schema containing the `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` table, replace `"PUBLIC"` in the SQL queries with that schema name.

**Note**: If you continue to encounter errors, it's possible that the necessary tables have not been loaded into your Snowflake environment, or you may not have the required permissions to access them. In such cases, please contact your database administrator for assistance.

2025-02-11 23:28:26 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering errors when executing your SQL queries. The error message indicates that the schema or table you're referencing does not exist or is not authorized for your user account.

**Error Message:**

```
002003 (02000): 01ba54bf-0004-9c12-0001-11c3010e6306: SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

**Analysis:**

The error suggests that:

- The schema `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'` does not exist within the database `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'`.
- The table `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` may not exist in the specified schema.
- You might not have the required permissions to access the schema or table.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

To address this problem, let's systematically verify the existence of the database, schema, and table, and adjust the SQL queries accordingly.

---

### **1. Verify Available Databases**

First, list all available databases to confirm the existence of the databases you're referencing.

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

**Action:**

- Review the list and confirm whether `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1'` or `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` appears in the output.

---

### **2. Verify Schemas in the Database**

Next, check which schemas are present in the database you're targeting.

**For `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'`:**

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";
```

**For `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1'`:**

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1";
```

**Observation:**

- From your previous outputs, it seems that the only schema available in `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` is `'INFORMATION_SCHEMA'`.
- There is no `'PUBLIC'` or `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'` schema listed.

---

### **3. Verify Tables in Available Schemas**

List the tables in each schema to find where the `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` table resides.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Replace <schema_name> with the actual schema names found
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."<schema_name>";
```

**Action:**

- If the only schema is `'INFORMATION_SCHEMA'`, note that this schema contains metadata about the database and not user tables.
- Repeat this step for `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1'`.

---

### **4. Search for the Table Using INFORMATION_SCHEMA**

You can search for the table across all databases and schemas accessible to you using the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views.

```sql
SELECT "table_catalog", "table_schema", "table_name"
FROM "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."TABLES"
WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE%';
```

**Note:**

- The `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema provides metadata about all objects you have access to.
- Adjust the WHERE clause if necessary to match the exact table name.

---

### **5. Adjust SQL Queries Based on Findings**

If you locate the table in a different database or schema, update your SQL queries accordingly.

**Example:**

If the table is found in `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` under `'PUBLIC'` schema:

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **6. Handle Absence of the Table**

If you cannot find the `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` table:

- **Possibility 1:** The table does not exist in your Snowflake environment.
- **Possibility 2:** You do not have the necessary permissions to access the table.
- **Possibility 3:** The table has a different name or is located in a different schema or database.

**Action:**

- Confirm with your database administrator whether the table exists and if you have access rights.
- Request the correct database and schema names where the table is located.

---

### **7. Verify Your Permissions**

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the databases, schemas, and tables.

```sql
-- Check the grants for the database
SHOW GRANTS ON DATABASE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2";

-- Check the grants for the schema
SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."INFORMATION_SCHEMA";

-- Check the grants for the table (if found)
SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."<schema_name>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE";
```

**Note:**

- If you lack sufficient privileges, you may need to contact your Snowflake administrator to obtain access.

---

### **8. Alternative Approach: Use the Correct Database and Schema**

Assuming you find that the table exists in a different database or schema, set your session's context accordingly.

**Example:**

```sql
USE DATABASE "<correct_database_name>";
USE SCHEMA "<correct_schema_name>";

SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **9. Double-Check Table and Column Names**

Ensure that the table and column names are correct.

- Column names should be:

  - `"gene_id"`
  - `"study_id"`
  - `"pval"`

- Table name could be different due to naming conventions.

**Action:**

- List columns of tables that have similar names.

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."<schema_name>"."<table_name>";
```

---

### **Summary and Recommendations**

- The errors indicate that the schema or table does not exist in the specified database.
- It's crucial to verify the existence of the database, schema, and table.
- Use `SHOW DATABASES`, `SHOW SCHEMAS`, and `SHOW TABLES` to explore available databases and schemas.
- Use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` or `ACCOUNT_USAGE` views to search for the table across all accessible databases.
- Consult with your database administrator to confirm:

  - The correct database and schema where the table resides.
  - Whether you have the necessary permissions to access the data.

- Once you have the correct database and schema, adjust your SQL queries accordingly.

---

### **Example: If the Table Is Found in a Different Location**

Assuming the table `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` is located in database `'GENETICS_DB'` and schema `'DATA_SCHEMA'`, your adjusted query would be:

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "GENETICS_DB"."DATA_SCHEMA"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **Verify Available Databases and Schemas:**

   - Run `SHOW DATABASES;` and `SHOW SCHEMAS;` to identify all accessible databases and schemas.

2. **Search for the Table:**

   - Use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` or `ACCOUNT_USAGE` to search for the table across all databases.

3. **Adjust Queries Based on Findings:**

   - Update your SQL queries to use the correct database and schema.

4. **Contact Your Administrator:**

   - If you cannot find the table or lack permissions, reach out to your Snowflake administrator for assistance.

2025-02-11 23:30:07 - root - INFO - It appears that the errors you're encountering are due to the database or schema not existing or you not having the necessary permissions to access them. To resolve this issue, we need to identify the correct database and schema where the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table resides. Here's how you can proceed:

---

### **1. Identify the Database and Schema Containing the Table**

Use the following query to search for the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table across all databases and schemas you have access to:

```sql
SELECT "table_catalog" AS "database_name", "table_schema" AS "schema_name", "table_name"
FROM "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."TABLES"
WHERE "table_name" = 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'
  AND "table_schema" != 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA';
```

**Note:**

- Ensure that your role has access to the `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema to run this query.
- The condition `"table_schema" != 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA'` excludes system schemas.

This query will return the `database_name` and `schema_name` where the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table is located.

---

### **2. Adjust Your SQL Queries with the Correct Database and Schema**

Once you've identified the correct `database_name` and `schema_name`, you can adjust your queries accordingly. Replace `<database_name>` and `<schema_name>` with the actual names.

---

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve Variants for a Specific Gene and Study with the Lowest P-values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
   FROM "<database_name>"."<schema_name>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   WHERE "gene_id" = '<GENE_OF_INTEREST>' AND "study_id" = '<STUDY_OF_INTEREST>'
   ORDER BY "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find the Variant with the Lowest P-value for Each Gene in Each Study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt",
          MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "<database_name>"."<schema_name>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve Variants with the Lowest P-value per Gene and Study Using a Window Function:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
   FROM (
     SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
     FROM "<database_name>"."<schema_name>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ) t
   WHERE t."rn" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve the Top 10 Genes with the Smallest P-values Overall:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "pval", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
   FROM (
     SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
     FROM "<database_name>"."<schema_name>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ) t
   WHERE t."rn" = 1
   ORDER BY "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

5. **List Genes Along with Their Associated Studies and Minimum P-values, Ordered by P-value:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "<database_name>"."<schema_name>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
   ORDER BY "min_pval" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve Detailed Variant Information for the Top 100 Geneâ€“Variant Pairs with the Smallest P-values Overall:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
   FROM "<database_name>"."<schema_name>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ORDER BY "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

### **3. Set the Database and Schema Context**

To simplify your queries, you can set the database and schema context for your session:

```sql
USE DATABASE "<database_name>";
USE SCHEMA "<schema_name>";
```

After setting the context, you can omit the database and schema prefixes in your queries:

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "pval", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
FROM (
  SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
  FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
) t
WHERE t."rn" = 1
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### **4. Verify Permissions**

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the identified database and schema. If you encounter permissions issues, you may need to contact your Snowflake administrator.

---

### **5. Additional Notes**

- Replace `'<GENE_OF_INTEREST>'` and `'<STUDY_OF_INTEREST>'` with the actual gene and study IDs you are interested in.
- Always enclose identifiers in double quotes if they are case-sensitive or contain special characters.
- If the table `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` is not found after searching, confirm with your administrator whether the table exists or if it has a different name.

---

By identifying the correct database and schema, and adjusting your queries accordingly, you should be able to execute the SQL statements without encountering the previous errors.

2025-02-11 23:30:59 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering an error because you don't have access to the `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema. This schema contains metadata about all objects across the entire Snowflake account but requires specific privileges to access. The error:

```
SQL compilation error:
Schema 'SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE' does not exist or not authorized.
```

indicates that your role does not have the necessary permissions to query this schema.

---

### **Alternative Approach to Locate the Table**

Since we cannot use `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE`, we can try using the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` within each database to locate the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table.

#### **1. List All Databases Available to You**

First, list all databases accessible to your account:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

**From Your Output:**

Based on the output you provided, your databases include:

- ADVENTUREWORKS
- AIRLINES
- AMAZON_VENDOR_ANALYTICS__SAMPLE_DATASET
- AUSTIN
- BANK_SALES_TRADING
- BASEBALL
- BBC
- BLS
- BOWLINGLEAGUE
- BRAZE_USER_EVENT_DEMO_DATASET
- ... *(and many others)*

**Observation:**

- The databases `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1` and `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` are **not** listed in your databases.
- This suggests that the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table is likely in a different database.

#### **2. Search for the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` Table in Each Database**

You can search for the table in each database's `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`. Here's how:

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Create a List of Databases**

   Note down all the database names from your `SHOW DATABASES` output.

2. **Iterate Over Each Database**

   For each database in your list, execute the following queries:

   **a. Set the Database Context**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>";
   ```

   **b. Query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` View**

   ```sql
   SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
   FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
   WHERE "table_name" = 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE';
   ```

   **Example:**

   For the database `ADVENTUREWORKS`:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";

   SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
   FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
   WHERE "table_name" = 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE';
   ```

3. **Check the Results**

   - If the query returns results, note down the `table_schema`.
   - If no results are returned, proceed to the next database.

#### **3. Adjust Your SQL Queries Once the Table Is Located**

Once you find the database and schema containing the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table, you can adjust your SQL queries accordingly.

**Assuming the Table Is Found in Database `GENETICS_DB` and Schema `PUBLIC`:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
FROM "GENETICS_DB"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
WHERE "gene_id" = 'GENE_OF_INTEREST' AND "study_id" = 'STUDY_OF_INTEREST'
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Alternatively, Set the Database and Schema Context:**

```sql
USE DATABASE "GENETICS_DB";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";

SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
WHERE "gene_id" = 'GENE_OF_INTEREST' AND "study_id" = 'STUDY_OF_INTEREST'
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **4. Verify Permissions**

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table. If you encounter a "not authorized" error, you may need to contact your Snowflake administrator to obtain the required access.

#### **5. Example of Adjusted SQL Queries**

Assuming you've found the table in a certain database and schema, here are your adjusted SQL queries:

---

**a. Retrieve Variants for a Specific Gene and Study with the Lowest P-values:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
FROM "<DATABASE_NAME>"."<SCHEMA_NAME>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
WHERE "gene_id" = 'GENE_OF_INTEREST' AND "study_id" = 'STUDY_OF_INTEREST'
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**b. Find the Variant with the Lowest P-value for Each Gene in Each Study:**

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  "lead_chrom",
  "lead_pos",
  "lead_ref",
  "lead_alt",
  MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "<DATABASE_NAME>"."<SCHEMA_NAME>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  "lead_chrom",
  "lead_pos",
  "lead_ref",
  "lead_alt"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**c. Retrieve Variants with the Lowest P-value per Gene and Study Using a Window Function:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
FROM (
  SELECT
    "gene_id",
    "study_id",
    "lead_chrom",
    "lead_pos",
    "lead_ref",
    "lead_alt",
    "pval",
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
  FROM "<DATABASE_NAME>"."<SCHEMA_NAME>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
) t
WHERE t."rn" = 1
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**d. Retrieve the Top 10 Genes with the Smallest P-values Overall:**

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "pval",
  "study_id",
  "lead_chrom",
  "lead_pos",
  "lead_ref",
  "lead_alt"
FROM (
  SELECT
    "gene_id",
    "study_id",
    "lead_chrom",
    "lead_pos",
    "lead_ref",
    "lead_alt",
    "pval",
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
  FROM "<DATABASE_NAME>"."<SCHEMA_NAME>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
) t
WHERE t."rn" = 1
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

**e. List Genes Along with Their Associated Studies and Minimum P-values, Ordered by P-value:**

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "<DATABASE_NAME>"."<SCHEMA_NAME>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY
  "gene_id",
  "study_id"
ORDER BY "min_pval" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**f. Retrieve Detailed Variant Information for the Top 100 Geneâ€“Variant Pairs with the Smallest P-values Overall:**

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  "lead_chrom",
  "lead_pos",
  "lead_ref",
  "lead_alt",
  "pval"
FROM "<DATABASE_NAME>"."<SCHEMA_NAME>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **6. Check for Alternate Table Names**

It's possible that the table might have a slightly different name or might be pluralized (e.g., `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENES`). When searching, consider variations of the table name:

- `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENES`
- `VARIANT_GENE_ASSOCIATIONS`
- `GENE_VARIANT_PVALUES`

Modify your search query accordingly:

```sql
SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%VARIANT%GENE%';
```

---

### **7. Contact Your Database Administrator**

If, after searching, you are still unable to locate the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table:

- **Reach Out for Assistance**: Contact your database administrator or data management team to confirm the existence and location of the table.
- **Verify Permissions**: Ensure that your user role has the necessary permissions to access the required databases, schemas, and tables.

---

### **8. Summary**

- **Issue**: You are receiving errors because the specified schema or table does not exist or you lack the necessary permissions.
- **Solution**: Use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` in each database to search for the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table.
- **Adjust Queries**: Once the table is located, adjust your SQL queries to reference the correct database and schema.
- **Verify Permissions**: Ensure you have the required permissions to access the database, schema, and table.
- **Contact Administrator**: If you're unable to find the table or suspect permission issues, contact your database administrator for assistance.

2025-02-11 23:32:46 - root - INFO - It appears that you're consistently encountering the error:

```
SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This indicates that the schema `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'` does not exist within the database `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` in your Snowflake environment, or you do not have the necessary permissions to access it.

From the output of your `SHOW DATABASES;` command, it seems that neither `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1'` nor `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` are listed among your available databases. This suggests that the database containing the `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` table might have a different name or may not be accessible to you.

To resolve this issue, we need to locate the correct database and schema where the `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` table resides. Here's how you can proceed:

---

### **1. Identify Accessible Databases**

First, let's verify the databases you have access to. According to your `SHOW DATABASES;` output, your available databases include:

- `ADVENTUREWORKS`
- `AIRLINES`
- `AMAZON_VENDOR_ANALYTICS__SAMPLE_DATASET`
- `AUSTIN`
- `BANK_SALES_TRADING`
- `BASEBALL`
- `BBC`
- `BLS`
- `BOWLINGLEAGUE`
- `BRAZE_USER_EVENT_DEMO_DATASET`
- `BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE`
- `CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION`
- ... *(and many others)*

Since `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` is not listed, the table you're querying may be located in a different database.

---

### **2. Search for the Table Across Databases**

We can search for the `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` table in the databases you have access to by querying each database's `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Iterate Over Each Database**

   For each database in your list, execute the following commands:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>";
   ```

   Replace `<DATABASE_NAME>` with the name of the database.

2. **Search for the Table in INFORMATION_SCHEMA**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "table_schema",
     "table_name"
   FROM
     "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
   WHERE
     UPPER("table_name") = 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE';
   ```

   - This query will return any schemas that contain a table named `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'`.
   - Repeat this process for each database.

---

### **3. Record the Database and Schema**

Once you find the `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` table, note the database and schema names. For example, you might find:

- **Database:** `GENETICS_DATA`
- **Schema:** `PUBLIC`

---

### **4. Adjust Your SQL Queries**

Now that you have the correct database and schema, adjust your SQL queries accordingly.

**Example Adjustments:**

1. **Query with `MIN(pval)` Grouped by Gene and Study**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "gene_id",
     "study_id",
     "lead_chrom",
     "lead_pos",
     "lead_ref",
     "lead_alt",
     MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM
     "GENETICS_DATA"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY
     "gene_id",
     "study_id",
     "lead_chrom",
     "lead_pos",
     "lead_ref",
     "lead_alt"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Query Using Window Function for Lowest P-value per Gene and Study**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "gene_id",
     "study_id",
     "lead_chrom",
     "lead_pos",
     "lead_ref",
     "lead_alt",
     "pval"
   FROM (
     SELECT
       "gene_id",
       "study_id",
       "lead_chrom",
       "lead_pos",
       "lead_ref",
       "lead_alt",
       "pval",
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
         PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id"
         ORDER BY "pval" ASC
       ) AS "rn"
     FROM
       "GENETICS_DATA"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ) t
   WHERE
     t."rn" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve Top 10 Genes with the Smallest P-values**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "gene_id",
     "pval",
     "study_id",
     "lead_chrom",
     "lead_pos",
     "lead_ref",
     "lead_alt"
   FROM (
     SELECT
       "gene_id",
       "study_id",
       "lead_chrom",
       "lead_pos",
       "lead_ref",
       "lead_alt",
       "pval",
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
         PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id"
         ORDER BY "pval" ASC
       ) AS "rn"
     FROM
       "GENETICS_DATA"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ) t
   WHERE
     t."rn" = 1
   ORDER BY
     "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Query Grouped by Gene and Study with Minimum P-value**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "gene_id",
     "study_id",
     MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM
     "GENETICS_DATA"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY
     "gene_id",
     "study_id"
   ORDER BY
     "min_pval" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve Detailed Variant Information Ordered by P-value**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "gene_id",
     "study_id",
     "lead_chrom",
     "lead_pos",
     "lead_ref",
     "lead_alt",
     "pval"
   FROM
     "GENETICS_DATA"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ORDER BY
     "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

### **5. Set Database and Schema Context (Optional)**

To simplify your queries, you can set the database and schema context:

```sql
USE DATABASE "GENETICS_DATA";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";
```

Your queries can then reference the table directly:

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  "lead_chrom",
  "lead_pos",
  "lead_ref",
  "lead_alt",
  MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM
  "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  "lead_chrom",
  "lead_pos",
  "lead_ref",
  "lead_alt"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **6. Verify Your Permissions**

If you still encounter errors after adjusting the queries, you may not have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, or table.

**Check Your Current Role:**

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
```

**Check Grants on Database and Schema:**

```sql
SHOW GRANTS ON DATABASE "GENETICS_DATA";
SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA "GENETICS_DATA"."PUBLIC";
```

If you lack the required permissions, contact your Snowflake administrator to request access.

---

### **7. Contact Your Database Administrator**

If you cannot locate the `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` table or continue to face access issues, please reach out to your database administrator or data team to:

- Confirm the existence and location of the table.
- Obtain the correct database and schema names.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions.

---

### **Summary**

- **Issue Identified:** The errors occur because the schema `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'` in the database `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` does not exist or is not accessible in your environment.
- **Solution:**
  - **Locate the Table:** Use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` in each accessible database to find where the `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` table exists.
  - **Adjust Queries:** Update your SQL queries with the correct database and schema names.
  - **Set Context:** Optionally, set the database and schema context for simpler queries.
  - **Verify Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the data.

2025-02-11 23:33:33 - root - INFO - It seems that despite our best efforts to adjust the SQL queries, you're still encountering the error:

```
002043 (02000): 01ba54c4-0004-9c12-0001-11c3010e6352: SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

**Explanation:**

This error indicates that the object you're referencing in your queryâ€”whether it's a database, schema, or tableâ€”does not exist in your Snowflake environment, or you do not have the required permissions to access it.

**Observations:**

- **Databases Not Present:** From the `SHOW DATABASES;` output you provided, `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1` and `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` are **not listed** among your accessible databases.
- **Consistent Errors:** The repeated errors suggest that the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table you're trying to query is **not accessible** in your current environment.

---

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

#### **1. Verify Available Databases and Schemas**

Given that `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` is not among your accessible databases, we need to search for the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table within the databases you do have access to.

**Action:**

- **List Accessible Databases:**

  You've already provided the list from `SHOW DATABASES;`.

- **Iterate Over Each Database:**

  For each database in your list, perform the following steps.

#### **2. Search for the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` Table**

**For Each Database:**

1. **Set the Database Context:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>";
   ```

   Replace `<DATABASE_NAME>` with the name of the database.

2. **List Schemas in the Database:**

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS;
   ```

3. **For Each Schema:**

   - Set the Schema Context:

     ```sql
     USE SCHEMA "<SCHEMA_NAME>";
     ```

   - Search for the Table:

     ```sql
     SHOW TABLES LIKE 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE';
     ```

     **Or** use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`:

     ```sql
     SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
     FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
     WHERE "table_name" = 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE';
     ```

**Note:**

- The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` provides metadata about the database objects.
- Repeat this process for all databases and schemas you have access to.

#### **3. Identify the Correct Database and Schema**

If the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table is found in a particular database and schema, note down their names.

**Example:**

- **Database Name:** `GENETICS_DB`
- **Schema Name:** `PUBLIC`

#### **4. Adjust Your SQL Queries Accordingly**

Once you've identified the correct database and schema, you can adjust your SQL queries.

**Example SQL Queries:**

**a. Query to Find Minimum P-value per Gene-Variant Pair:**

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  "lead_chrom",
  "lead_pos",
  "lead_ref",
  "lead_alt",
  MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM
  "GENETICS_DB"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  "lead_chrom",
  "lead_pos",
  "lead_ref",
  "lead_alt"
LIMIT 100;
```

**b. Query to Retrieve Top 10 Genes with the Smallest P-values:**

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "pval",
  "study_id",
  "lead_chrom",
  "lead_pos",
  "lead_ref",
  "lead_alt"
FROM (
  SELECT
    "gene_id",
    "study_id",
    "lead_chrom",
    "lead_pos",
    "lead_ref",
    "lead_alt",
    "pval",
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id"
      ORDER BY "pval" ASC
    ) AS "rn"
  FROM
    "GENETICS_DB"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
) t
WHERE
  t."rn" = 1
ORDER BY
  "pval" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

**c. Set the Database and Schema Context (Optional):**

```sql
USE DATABASE "GENETICS_DB";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";

SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  "lead_chrom",
  "lead_pos",
  "lead_ref",
  "lead_alt",
  MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM
  "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  "lead_chrom",
  "lead_pos",
  "lead_ref",
  "lead_alt"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **5. Verify Your Permissions**

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the identified database and schema.

**Action:**

- **Check Current Role:**

  ```sql
  SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
  ```

- **Review Grants:**

  ```sql
  SHOW GRANTS ON DATABASE "GENETICS_DB";
  SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA "GENETICS_DB"."PUBLIC";
  SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE "GENETICS_DB"."PUBLIC"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE";
  ```

If you lack the required permissions, you may need to request access from your Snowflake administrator.

#### **6. If the Table Is Not Found**

If you're unable to locate the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table in any of the databases you have access to, it could mean:

- The table exists in a database you don't have access to.
- The table name is different.
- The table hasn't been created or loaded into your environment.

**Recommendation:**

- **Contact Your Database Administrator:**

  - Confirm whether the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table exists.
  - Obtain the correct database and schema names.
  - Request the necessary permissions.

---

---

**Explanation:**

The errors you've encountered indicate that the specified database and schema (`"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"`) do not exist or are not accessible in your environment. To resolve these errors, I've adjusted the SQL queries by removing the database and schema references. The queries now directly reference the `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` table.

**Next Steps:**

- **Set the Correct Database and Schema Context:** If the `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` table exists in your current database and schema context, these adjusted queries should work.

- **Specify the Correct Database and Schema (if necessary):** If the table is located in a different database or schema, replace the table reference with the correct database and schema names. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", ...
  FROM "<your_database>"."<your_schema>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
  ...
  ```

- **Verify Table Existence:** Ensure that the `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` table exists in your environment by listing available tables:

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES;
  ```

- **Check Permissions:** If you continue to encounter errors, verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the table.

If you need further assistance or have questions about accessing the correct database and schema, please let me know.

2025-02-11 23:35:10 - root - INFO - It appears that the errors you're encountering are due to the table or schema not existing in your accessible databases, or you may not have the necessary permissions to access them. Let's work through this step by step to help you locate the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table and adjust your SQL queries accordingly.

---

### **1. Verify Available Databases**

First, let's confirm the databases you have access to. Based on the `SHOW DATABASES;` output you provided, the databases available to you include:

- `ADVENTUREWORKS`
- `AIRLINES`
- `AMAZON_VENDOR_ANALYTICS__SAMPLE_DATASET`
- `AUSTIN`
- `BANK_SALES_TRADING`
- `BASEBALL`
- `BBC`
- `BLS`
- `BOWLINGLEAGUE`
- `BRAZE_USER_EVENT_DEMO_DATASET`
- ... *(and many others)*

**Observation:**

- The databases `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1` and `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` are **not** listed among your accessible databases.
- This suggests that the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table is likely located in a different database.

---

### **2. Search for the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` Table Across Your Databases**

To find the database and schema where the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table exists, you can use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` for each database you have access to.

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

**For Each Database in Your List:**

1. **Set the Database Context:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>";
   ```

   Replace `<DATABASE_NAME>` with the name of the database you're checking.

2. **Query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` for the Table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
   FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
   WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE%';
   ```

   - The `ILIKE` operator allows for case-insensitive matching.
   - This query will return any schemas containing a table with a name matching `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE`.

**Example:**

Assuming you're checking the `ADVENTUREWORKS` database:

```sql
USE DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";

SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE%';
```

3. **Repeat for Each Database:**

   Go through each database in your list, setting the context and querying the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.

---

### **3. Identify the Database and Schema**

If the table is found, note the `DATABASE_NAME` and `table_schema` (which is the schema name). For example:

- **Database:** `GENETICS_DB`
- **Schema:** `PUBLIC`

---

### **4. Adjust Your SQL Queries**

With the correct database and schema identified, update your SQL queries accordingly.

**Example SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt",
       MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "<DATABASE_NAME>"."<SCHEMA_NAME>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
LIMIT 100;
```

Replace `<DATABASE_NAME>` and `<SCHEMA_NAME>` with the actual names.

---

### **5. Set the Database and Schema Context (Optional)**

To simplify your queries, you can set your session to use the identified database and schema:

```sql
USE DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>";
USE SCHEMA "<SCHEMA_NAME>";
```

Then, your queries can reference the table directly without specifying the database and schema each time:

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt",
       MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **6. Verify Your Permissions**

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table.

**Check Your Current Role:**

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
```

**Check Grants on the Database and Schema:**

```sql
SHOW GRANTS ON DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>";
SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA "<DATABASE_NAME>"."<SCHEMA_NAME>";
```

If you lack the required permissions, you may need to contact your Snowflake administrator to obtain access.

---

### **7. If the Table Is Not Found**

If you're unable to locate the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table in any of the databases you have access to, consider the following possibilities:

- **The Table Is in a Restricted Database:** The table might exist in a database that you don't have access to.
- **Different Table Name:** The table might have a slightly different name. Consider searching using partial names or wildcards.

  **Example Search:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
  FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
  WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%VARIANT%GENE%';
  ```

- **Table Not Yet Created or Loaded:** The table might not have been created or loaded into your Snowflake environment.

---

### **8. Contact Your Database Administrator**

If you're still unable to locate the table or resolve the access issues, it's advisable to reach out to your database administrator or data management team. They can:

- Confirm the existence and location of the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table.
- Provide you with the correct database and schema names.
- Grant you the necessary permissions to access the data.

---

### **Summary**

- **Issue Identified:** The errors occur because the specified schema and table do not exist in your accessible databases or you lack the required permissions.
- **Solution Path:**
  - **Search for the Table:** Use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` in each of your accessible databases to locate the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table.
  - **Adjust SQL Queries:** Once located, update your queries to reference the correct database and schema.
  - **Set Context:** Optionally, set the database and schema context to simplify your queries.
  - **Verify Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table.
  - **Consult Your Administrator:** If unable to find the table or resolve permission issues, contact your database administrator for assistance.

---

### **Example of Adjusted SQL Query**

Assuming you find the table in database `GENETICS_DB` and schema `PUBLIC`:

```sql
-- Set the database and schema context
USE DATABASE "GENETICS_DB";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";

-- Query to retrieve the variants
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt",
       MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Final Note**

Finding the correct database and schema is crucial to resolving the errors you're experiencing. By methodically searching through your accessible databases and adjusting your queries accordingly, you should be able to locate the table and execute your SQL statements successfully.

If you need further assistance or have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

### **Error Analysis**

**Error Message:**

```
002043 (02000): 01ba54c7-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010e570e: SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

This error suggests that Snowflake cannot find the object referenced in your SQL query. In this case, the object could be the database, schema, or table.

---

### **Possible Reasons**

1. **Database or Schema Does Not Exist:**

   - The database `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` or the schema `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'` might not exist in your Snowflake environment.
   - From your `SHOW DATABASES;` output, `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` is not listed among your accessible databases.

2. **Lack of Permissions:**

   - You may not have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, or table.
   - If the database exists but you lack access rights, Snowflake will return an error indicating that the object does not exist or is not authorized.

3. **Table Does Not Exist:**

   - The table `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` may not exist in the specified schema or in any accessible schema.

---

### **Recommended Steps to Resolve the Issue**

#### **1. Verify Accessible Databases**

   - Run the following command to list all databases accessible to you:

     ```sql
     SHOW DATABASES;
     ```

   - Review the output to confirm if `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` or a similar database exists.

#### **2. Search for the Table Across Accessible Databases**

Since the required database is not listed, we can search for the `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` table across the databases you have access to:

**For Each Database in Your List:**

1. **Set the Database Context:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>";
   ```

   Replace `<DATABASE_NAME>` with the name of each database from your list.

2. **Search for the Table Using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
   FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
   WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE%';
   ```

   - The `ILIKE` operator performs a case-insensitive search.
   - This query will return any schemas containing a table with a name matching `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'`.

3. **Record Any Matches:**

   - If the table is found, note the `DATABASE_NAME` and `table_schema` where it resides.

#### **3. Adjust Your SQL Queries Accordingly**

If you locate the table, adjust your SQL queries to reference the correct database and schema.

**Example:**

Assuming the table is in database `'YOUR_DATABASE'` and schema `'YOUR_SCHEMA'`:

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
FROM (
  SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
  FROM "YOUR_DATABASE"."YOUR_SCHEMA"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
) t
WHERE t."rn" = 1
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **4. Set the Database and Schema Context (Optional)**

To simplify your queries, you can set the context:

```sql
USE DATABASE "YOUR_DATABASE";
USE SCHEMA "YOUR_SCHEMA";
```

Then, you can reference the table directly:

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
FROM (
  SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
  FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
) t
WHERE t."rn" = 1
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **5. Verify Your Permissions**

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table:

```sql
-- Check your current role
SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();

-- Check grants on the database
SHOW GRANTS ON DATABASE "YOUR_DATABASE";

-- Check grants on the schema
SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA "YOUR_DATABASE"."YOUR_SCHEMA";

-- Check grants on the table
SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE "YOUR_DATABASE"."YOUR_SCHEMA"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE";
```

If you lack the required permissions, contact your Snowflake administrator to request access.

#### **6. If the Table Cannot Be Found**

If the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table is not found:

- **Possible Reasons:**
  - The table may be named differently.
  - It may reside in a database or schema you do not have access to.
  - It might not exist in your Snowflake environment.

- **Actions:**
  - Check for similar table names:

    ```sql
    SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
    FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
    WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%VARIANT%GENE%' OR "table_name" ILIKE '%DISEASE%VARIANT%';
    ```

  - Consult your database administrator to confirm the existence and location of the table.

---

### **Alternative Approach**

If the `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE` table is not available, consider using other tables that might contain relevant data based on the initial table structure you provided. For example, the `VARIANT_DISEASE` table is also listed and might contain similar information.

**Example Using `VARIANT_DISEASE` Table:**

1. **Check if the Table Exists:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "<POTENTIAL_DATABASE>";
   SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
   FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
   WHERE "table_name" = 'VARIANT_DISEASE';
   ```

2. **Adjust Your Query:**

   If the table exists, adjust your query:

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "pval", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
   FROM (
     SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
     FROM "VARIANT_DISEASE"
   ) t
   WHERE t."rn" = 1
   ORDER BY "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   Note: You may need to adjust column names based on the actual schema of the `VARIANT_DISEASE` table.

---

### **Summary**

- **Issue Identified:**

  - The database `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` and schema `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'` are not accessible in your Snowflake environment.
  - The table `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` cannot be found or accessed.

- **Recommended Actions:**

  1. **Search for the Table Across Accessible Databases:**

     - Use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to locate the table within databases you have access to.

  2. **Adjust SQL Queries:**

     - Update your queries with the correct database and schema where the table is located.

  3. **Verify Permissions:**

     - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the required objects.

  4. **Consult Your Database Administrator:**

     - If you're unable to find the table or lack permissions, contact your administrator for assistance.

  5. **Consider Alternative Tables:**

     - Explore other tables that might contain relevant data for your analysis.

---

### **Final Note**

Without access to the required database, schema, or table, it's not possible to execute the queries as originally written. I recommend reaching out to your database administrator to:

- Confirm the existence and location of the `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` table.
- Obtain the necessary permissions to access it.
- Discuss alternative data sources if the table is unavailable.

Once you have the correct database and schema information, we can adjust the SQL queries accordingly to fulfill your original task.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or have any questions.

```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Adjustment Made:**
  - Removed the database and schema references (`"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."`) from the table name.
  - The queries now reference the `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` table directly.
  
- **Note:**
  - Make sure that the `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` table exists in your current database and schema context.
  - If the table is located in a different database or schema, replace `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` with the fully qualified table name, including the correct database and schema.

**Example with Fully Qualified Table Name (if known):**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "pval", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
FROM (
  SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
           PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id"
           ORDER BY "pval" ASC
         ) AS "rn"
  FROM "<DATABASE_NAME>"."<SCHEMA_NAME>"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
) t
WHERE t."rn" = 1
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

- Replace `<DATABASE_NAME>` and `<SCHEMA_NAME>` with the actual names where the table exists.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Verify Table Existence:**
  - Use the following command to list available tables in your current schema:
    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES;
    ```
  - Or to search for the table across all accessible databases and schemas:
    ```sql
    SELECT "table_catalog" AS "database_name", "table_schema" AS "schema_name", "table_name"
    FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
    WHERE "table_name" = 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE';
    ```
- **Set Database and Schema Context:**
  - If you know the database and schema where the table resides, set the context:
    ```sql
    USE DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>";
    USE SCHEMA "<SCHEMA_NAME>";
    ```
- **Check Permissions:**
  - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table.
  - Contact your database administrator if you encounter permission issues.

---

By adjusting the queries and ensuring you're referencing the correct table in your accessible databases and schemas, you should be able to execute the SQL statements successfully.

2025-02-11 23:38:39 - root - INFO - It appears that despite adjusting the SQL queries, you're still encountering the following error:

```
SQL compilation error:
Object 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE' does not exist or not authorized.
```

**Explanation:**

This error indicates that Snowflake cannot find the table named `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` in your current database and schema context, or you do not have the necessary permissions to access it.

**Possible Reasons:**

1. **The Table Doesn't Exist in Your Environment:**
   - The table `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` might not be present in any of the databases you have access to.
   - It could be that the table is named differently in your environment.

2. **Incorrect Database or Schema Reference:**
   - The database `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"` and schema `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"` do not exist in your environment.
   - From the `SHOW DATABASES` output you provided, neither `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1"` nor `"OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"` are listed among your accessible databases.

3. **Permission Issues:**
   - You might not have the required permissions to access the table.

---

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

### **1. Search for the Table Across Accessible Databases**

Since the table `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` doesn't seem to exist in your current context, let's search for it across all databases you have access to.

**a. List All Accessible Databases:**

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

From your output, the databases you have access to include:

- `ADVENTUREWORKS`
- `AIRLINES`
- `AMAZON_VENDOR_ANALYTICS__SAMPLE_DATASET`
- `AUSTIN`
- `BANK_SALES_TRADING`
- `BASEBALL`
- `BBC`
- `BLS`
- `BOWLINGLEAGUE`
- ... *(and many others)*

**b. Search for the Table in Each Database:**

For each database in your list, execute the following:

```sql
USE DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>";

SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%VARIANT%GENE%' OR "table_name" ILIKE '%DISEASE%VARIANT%';
```

Replace `<DATABASE_NAME>` with the name of the database you're querying.

**Note:**

- The `ILIKE` operator performs a case-insensitive search.
- This query searches for any tables with names containing `'VARIANT'` and `'GENE'`, or `'DISEASE'` and `'VARIANT'`.

**c. Record Any Matches:**

If you find a table that seems relevant, note the database and schema where it resides.

---

### **2. Identify the Correct Table and Adjust Your Queries**

Assuming you find a table such as `"VARIANT_DISEASE"` in database `"GENETICS_DATA"` and schema `"PUBLIC"`, you can adjust your SQL queries accordingly.

**Adjusted SQL Queries:**

```sql
USE DATABASE "GENETICS_DATA";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";

SELECT "gene_id", "pval", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
FROM (
  SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
  FROM "VARIANT_DISEASE"
) t
WHERE t."rn" = 1
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### **3. Verify Table Structure and Column Names**

Ensure that the table you found contains the necessary columns:

- `"gene_id"`
- `"study_id"`
- `"pval"`
- `"lead_chrom"`
- `"lead_pos"`
- `"lead_ref"`
- `"lead_alt"`

If the column names are different, adjust your queries to reflect the actual column names in the table.

---

### **4. Check Your Permissions**

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table.

**Check Current Role:**

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
```

**Review Grants:**

```sql
SHOW GRANTS ON DATABASE "GENETICS_DATA";
SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA "GENETICS_DATA"."PUBLIC";
SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE "GENETICS_DATA"."PUBLIC"."VARIANT_DISEASE";
```

If you lack the required permissions, contact your Snowflake administrator to request access.

---

### **5. If the Table Cannot Be Found**

If you're unable to locate any relevant tables, consider the following:

**a. Possible Alternative Tables:**

- There might be other tables containing gene and variant information, such as:
  - `"VARIANT_DISEASE_ASSOCIATIONS"`
  - `"GENE_VARIANT_SUMMARY"`
  - `"DISEASE_VARIANT_SCORES"`

**b. Search for Alternative Tables:**

```sql
SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%GENE%' AND "table_name" ILIKE '%VARIANT%';
```

**c. Adjust Queries Based on Found Tables:**

Once you find an alternative table, modify your queries to use that table and update column names as necessary.

---

### **6. Consult Your Database Administrator**

If you're still unable to find the appropriate table:

- **Reach Out for Assistance:**
  - Contact your database administrator or data team to confirm the existence and location of the required data.
  - They may provide you with the correct database and schema names or inform you if additional permissions are needed.

---

**Example Final Query Using an Alternative Table:**

Assuming the table is `"VARIANT_DISEASE_ASSOCIATION"` in database `"GENETICS_DATA"` and schema `"PUBLIC"`:

```sql
USE DATABASE "GENETICS_DATA";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";

SELECT "gene_id", "p_value", "study_id", "chromosome", "position", "reference", "alternate"
FROM (
  SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "chromosome", "position", "reference", "alternate", "p_value",
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "p_value" ASC) AS "rn"
  FROM "VARIANT_DISEASE_ASSOCIATION"
) t
WHERE t."rn" = 1
ORDER BY "p_value" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

**Summary:**

- The table `"DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"` is not accessible in your environment.
- You need to locate the correct table containing the necessary data.
- Adjust your SQL queries to use the correct database, schema, table, and column names.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions.
- Consult your database administrator if needed.

2025-02-11 23:40:57 - root - INFO - It appears that despite our efforts, you're still encountering errors when executing your SQL queries due to the tables not existing or not being authorized in your Snowflake environment.

**Error Message:**

```
002003 (42S02): 01ba54cb-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010e573a: SQL compilation error:
Object 'VARIANT_DISEASE' does not exist or not authorized.
```

---

### **Explanation**

- The error indicates that the table `'VARIANT_DISEASE'` does not exist in your current database and schema, or you do not have the necessary permissions to access it.
- Previously, you encountered similar errors with the table `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'`.
- The databases `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1'` and `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` are not listed among your accessible databases.

---

### **Suggested Steps to Resolve the Issue**

#### **1. Identify Accessible Databases and Schemas**

From your `SHOW DATABASES;` output, the databases accessible to you include:

- `ADVENTUREWORKS`
- `AIRLINES`
- `AMAZON_VENDOR_ANALYTICS__SAMPLE_DATASET`
- `AUSTIN`
- `BANK_SALES_TRADING`
- `BASEBALL`
- `BBC`
- `BLS`
- `BOWLINGLEAGUE`
- ... *(and many others)*

Since `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` is not among them, we need to search within your accessible databases.

#### **2. Search for Relevant Tables**

We can look for tables that might contain gene, variant, or disease data.

**For Each Database:**

1. **Set the Database Context:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>";
   ```

2. **Search for Tables with Relevant Names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
   FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
   WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%GENE%' OR "table_name" ILIKE '%VARIANT%' OR "table_name" ILIKE '%DISEASE%';
   ```

   Replace `<DATABASE_NAME>` with the name of each database in your list.

3. **Note Any Potential Tables:**

   - Look for tables that could contain the data you need.
   - Record the `table_schema` and `table_name`.

#### **3. Identify Available Tables and Adjust SQL Queries**

Suppose you find a table named `'GENE_VARIANTS'` in the schema `'PUBLIC'` of the database `'GENETICS_DB'`.

**Adjusted SQL Queries:**

1. **Set Database and Schema Context:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "GENETICS_DB";
   USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";
   ```

2. **Adjust the Queries Accordingly:**

   **a. Query to Find Minimum P-value per Gene and Study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("p_value") AS "min_p_value"
   FROM "GENE_VARIANTS"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
   ORDER BY "min_p_value" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **b. Query to Retrieve Geneâ€“Variant Pairs with the Smallest P-values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "variant_id", "p_value"
   FROM (
     SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "variant_id", "p_value",
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "p_value" ASC) AS "rn"
     FROM "GENE_VARIANTS"
   ) t
   WHERE t."rn" = 1
   ORDER BY "p_value" ASC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

**Note:**

- **Column Names:** Ensure the column names in your queries match those in the `'GENE_VARIANTS'` table.
- **Table Name:** Replace `'GENE_VARIANTS'` with the actual table name you find.
- **Adjustments:** You may need to adjust the queries based on the specific schema of the table.

#### **4. Verify Permissions**

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the identified database, schema, and table.

- **Check Current Role:**

  ```sql
  SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
  ```

- **Check Grants:**

  ```sql
  SHOW GRANTS ON DATABASE "GENETICS_DB";
  SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA "GENETICS_DB"."PUBLIC";
  SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE "GENETICS_DB"."PUBLIC"."GENE_VARIANTS";
  ```

#### **5. Consult Your Database Administrator**

If you cannot find a suitable table or lack the necessary permissions:

- **Contact Your Database Administrator:**
  - They can provide information on where the required data resides.
  - They may grant you access to the necessary databases and schemas.

---

### **Final Remarks**

Without access to the `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` or `'VARIANT_DISEASE'` tables, it's essential to locate an alternative table containing the required data within the databases you have access to.

- **Action Items:**
  - Search your accessible databases for relevant tables.
  - Adjust your SQL queries to use the appropriate tables and columns.
  - Verify permissions and consult with your administrator if needed.

2025-02-11 23:41:41 - root - INFO - It appears that you're still encountering errors because the database, schema, or table you're referencing does not exist or is not accessible in your Snowflake environment. The error message:

```
SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

indicates that Snowflake cannot find the object you're trying to query, or you don't have the necessary permissions to access it.

Given that, let's try to work through this issue.

---

### **1. Verify Available Databases**

From your `SHOW DATABASES;` output, the databases available to you are:

- **ADVENTUREWORKS**
- **AIRLINES**
- **AMAZON_VENDOR_ANALYTICS__SAMPLE_DATASET**
- **AUSTIN**
- **BANK_SALES_TRADING**
- **BASEBALL**
- **BBC**
- **BLS**
- **BOWLINGLEAGUE**
- **BRAZE_USER_EVENT_DEMO_DATASET**
- ... *(and many others)*

The databases `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_1` and `OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2` are not listed among your accessible databases. This suggests that the tables you are trying to query are not available in your environment.

---

### **2. Search for Relevant Tables in Available Databases**

Given that, let's try to find a table that contains gene, study, and p-value information in the databases you have access to.

**You can search for tables with relevant names using the following query in each database:**

```sql
SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%GENE%'
   OR "table_name" ILIKE '%VARIANT%'
   OR "table_name" ILIKE '%STUDY%'
   OR "table_name" ILIKE '%PVAL%'
   OR "table_name" ILIKE '%ASSOCIATION%';
```

**Run this query in each database:**

```sql
USE DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>";
```

Replace `<DATABASE_NAME>` with each database name from your list.

---

### **3. Identify an Alternative Table**

Suppose you find a table named `GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS` in the database `GENOME_DATA` and schema `PUBLIC`. You can then adjust your SQL queries to use this table.

---

### **4. Verify the Table Schema**

Check the columns in the table to ensure it contains the necessary fields:

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE "GENOME_DATA"."PUBLIC"."GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS";
```

Look for columns similar to:

- `"gene_id"`
- `"study_id"`
- `"p_value"`
- `"variant_id"`
- `"chromosome"`
- `"position"`
- `"reference_allele"`
- `"alternate_allele"`

---

### **5. Adjust Your SQL Queries**

Now, you can adjust your SQL queries accordingly.

**a. Find the Variant with the Lowest P-value for Each Gene in Each Study**

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  "variant_id",
  MIN("p_value") AS "min_p_value"
FROM
  "GENOME_DATA"."PUBLIC"."GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"
GROUP BY
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  "variant_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**b. Retrieve the Top 10 Genes with the Smallest P-values Overall**

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "min_p_value",
  "study_id",
  "variant_id"
FROM (
  SELECT
    "gene_id",
    "study_id",
    "variant_id",
    MIN("p_value") AS "min_p_value"
  FROM
    "GENOME_DATA"."PUBLIC"."GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"
  GROUP BY
    "gene_id",
    "study_id",
    "variant_id"
) t
ORDER BY
  "min_p_value" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

**c. Alternatively, Using Window Functions**

```sql
SELECT
  "gene_id",
  "study_id",
  "variant_id",
  "p_value"
FROM (
  SELECT
    "gene_id",
    "study_id",
    "variant_id",
    "p_value",
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id"
      ORDER BY "p_value" ASC
    ) AS "rn"
  FROM
    "GENOME_DATA"."PUBLIC"."GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATIONS"
) t
WHERE t."rn" = 1
ORDER BY "p_value" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### **6. Ensure You Have Necessary Permissions**

If you encounter any permission errors, you'll need to contact your database administrator to obtain access to the required tables.

---

### **7. Consult Your Database Administrator**

If you cannot find a suitable table in your accessible databases, or if the tables do not contain the necessary data, I recommend reaching out to your database administrator or data team. They can provide guidance on where to find the data you need or assist in obtaining access to the appropriate databases.

---

### **Summary**

- The errors you've been encountering occur because the tables you're trying to query do not exist in your accessible databases.
- By searching the available databases for alternative tables containing the necessary data, you may be able to adjust your queries to achieve your task.
- If the required data is not available in your current environment, consulting with your database administrator is the best course of action.

2025-02-11 23:42:26 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering errors when running your SQL queries. Let's address each error and work towards a solution.

---

### **Error 1: No Current Database Selected**

**Error Message:**

```
090105 (22000): 01ba54cd-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010e5756: Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name.
```

**Cause:**

This error indicates that your session does not have a current database set. When you try to query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` without specifying a database, Snowflake doesn't know which database's schema to refer to.

**Solution:**

#### **1. Set the Current Database**

You need to select a database before querying the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`. From your list of available databases, pick one that you think might contain the relevant tables.

**Example:**

```sql
USE DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";
```

**Note:** Replace `"ADVENTUREWORKS"` with the actual database name you want to explore.

#### **2. Rerun Your Query**

After setting the current database, you can run your query against its `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.

**Adjusted Query:**

```sql
SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%GENE%'
   OR "table_name" ILIKE '%VARIANT%'
   OR "table_name" ILIKE '%STUDY%'
   OR "table_name" ILIKE '%PVAL%'
   OR "table_name" ILIKE '%ASSOCIATION%';
```

**Explanation:**

- This query will return all tables in the current database whose names contain any of the specified keywords.

#### **3. Repeat for Other Databases**

If the above query doesn't return the tables you're looking for, repeat the process with other databases:

```sql
USE DATABASE "<OTHER_DATABASE>";
-- Then run the same SELECT query
```

---

### **Error 2: Schema Does Not Exist or Not Authorized**

**Error Message:**

```
002003 (02000): 01ba54cd-0004-9c12-0001-11c3010e63e6: SQL compilation error:
Schema 'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2.OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

**Cause:**

This error suggests that:

- The schema `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS'` does not exist within the database `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` in your Snowflake environment.
- Alternatively, you do not have the necessary permissions to access it.

From your `SHOW DATABASES;` output, it seems that `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` is not among your available databases.

**Solution:**

#### **1. Verify the Existence of the Database**

Since `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` is not in your list of databases, it's possible that:

- The database doesn't exist in your environment.
- You don't have access rights to it.

**Action Steps:**

- **Contact Your Database Administrator:**

  - Confirm whether the `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` database exists.
  - Request access if necessary.

#### **2. Search for the Table in Accessible Databases**

If you cannot access `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'`, you need to find out if the table `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'` exists in any of the databases you have access to.

**Action Steps:**

- Use the adjusted query from Error 1 to search for tables with relevant names in your accessible databases.

---

### **Adjusting Your Queries Based on Findings**

Assuming you have found a database and schema that contain the table `'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE'`, here's how you can adjust your queries:

#### **Set the Database and Schema Context**

```sql
USE DATABASE "<YOUR_DATABASE>";
USE SCHEMA "<YOUR_SCHEMA>";
```

Replace `<YOUR_DATABASE>` and `<YOUR_SCHEMA>` with the actual names where the table resides.

#### **Adjusted Query**

```sql
SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
FROM "DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
ORDER BY "pval" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Summary and Recommendations**

- **Set the Current Database:**

  - Always set a current database before querying or use fully qualified object names.

- **Search Within Accessible Databases:**

  - Since `'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2'` is not accessible, search for the required tables in the databases you do have access to.

- **Adjust Queries Accordingly:**

  - Once you identify the correct database and schema, adjust your queries to reflect the correct object names.

- **Verify Permissions:**

  - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the databases, schemas, and tables.

- **Contact Your Administrator:**

  - If you're unable to find the required tables or lack permissions, reach out to your database administrator for assistance.

---

### **Example: Searching for the Table in the 'ADVENTUREWORKS' Database**

**1. Set the Database Context**

```sql
USE DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";
```

**2. Search for Relevant Tables**

```sql
SELECT "table_schema", "table_name"
FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
WHERE "table_name" ILIKE '%GENE%'
   OR "table_name" ILIKE '%VARIANT%'
   OR "table_name" ILIKE '%STUDY%'
   OR "table_name" ILIKE '%PVAL%'
   OR "table_name" ILIKE '%ASSOCIATION%';
```

**3. Examine the Results**

- Look for tables that might contain the data you need.
- Note the `table_schema` and `table_name` for any promising tables.

**4. Adjust Your Query to Use the Found Table**

Assuming you find a table named `'GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATION'` in the schema `'PUBLIC'`:

```sql
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";

SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "variant_id", "p_value"
FROM (
  SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "variant_id", "p_value",
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "p_value" ASC) AS "rn"
  FROM "GENE_VARIANT_ASSOCIATION"
) t
WHERE t."rn" = 1
ORDER BY "p_value" ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### **Final Notes**

- **Persistent Errors:**

  - If you continue to encounter errors stating that objects do not exist, it's likely that the required tables are not present in your accessible databases.

- **Consult Your Administrator:**

  - Your database administrator can:

    - Confirm the existence and location of the necessary data.
    - Grant you access to the appropriate databases and schemas.
    - Provide guidance on how to proceed.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to consider tables and columns that contain information about genes, studies, variants, and their associated p-values.

**Relevant Table and Columns:**

- **Table:** `DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE`

  - **"gene_id"**: The identifier for the gene.
    - *Potential usage*: To identify genes involved in associations.
  - **"study_id"**: The identifier for the study.
    - *Potential usage*: To distinguish associations from different studies.
  - **"pval"**: The p-value of the association between the variant and the disease.
    - *Potential usage*: To find the strength of the association; lower p-values indicate stronger associations.
  - **"lead_chrom"**, **"lead_pos"**, **"lead_ref"**, **"lead_alt"**: Information about the lead variant.
    - *Potential usage*: To specify the variant associated with the gene in the study.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct study IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "study_id"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct gene IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "gene_id"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve gene IDs and their associated p-values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve gene IDs, study IDs, and p-values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find the minimum p-value for each gene across all studies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find the minimum p-value for each gene within each study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Retrieve variants with the lowest p-value for a specific gene in a specific study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   WHERE "gene_id" = 'GENE_OF_INTEREST' AND "study_id" = 'STUDY_OF_INTEREST'
   ORDER BY "pval" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find the variant with the lowest p-value for each gene in each study:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
   FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve the variants with the lowest p-values for each gene and study using window functions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
   FROM (
     SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
     FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
   ) t
   WHERE t."rn" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve the top 10 genes with the smallest p-values after selecting the variant with the lowest p-value per gene per study:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "gene_id", "pval", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt"
    FROM (
      SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval",
             ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "gene_id", "study_id" ORDER BY "pval" ASC) AS "rn"
      FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
    ) t
    WHERE t."rn" = 1
    ORDER BY "pval" ASC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

11. **List genes along with their associated studies and minimum p-values, ordered by p-value:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", MIN("pval") AS "min_pval"
    FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
    GROUP BY "gene_id", "study_id"
    ORDER BY "min_pval" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Retrieve detailed variant information for the top 100 geneâ€“variant pairs with the smallest p-values overall:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "gene_id", "study_id", "lead_chrom", "lead_pos", "lead_ref", "lead_alt", "pval"
    FROM "OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2"."OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS"."DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE"
    ORDER BY "pval" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the data, starting from listing distinct genes and studies to retrieving detailed information about the variants with the lowest p-values for each gene in each study. The final queries aim to identify the top genes with the strongest associations across all studies, aligning with the task's objectives.Query:

Task: Please identify the top 10 genes with the strongest associations across all studies by first selecting, for each gene within each study, the variant with the lowest p-value, and then ranking all such geneâ€“variant pairs to return the 10 genes with the smallest p-values overall.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
gene_id,p_value,study_id,lead_variant
gene1:str,p_value1:float,study1:str,variant1:str
gene2:str,p_value2:float,study2:str,variant2:str
gene3:str,p_value3:float,study3:str,variant3:str
gene4:str,p_value4:float,study4:str,variant4:str
gene5:str,p_value5:float,study5:str,variant5:str
gene6:str,p_value6:float,study6:str,variant6:str
gene7:str,p_value7:float,study7:str,variant7:str
gene8:str,p_value8:float,study8:str,variant8:str
gene9:str,p_value9:float,study9:str,variant9:str
gene10:str,p_value10:float,study10:str,variant10:str
(Attention: answer in 10 rows)
```

We have identified the top 10 genes with the strongest associations across all studies by first selecting, for each gene within each study, the variant with the lowest p-value. Then, we ranked all such geneâ€“variant pairs to return the 10 genes with the smallest p-values overall. The table above lists these genes along with their associated p-values, study IDs, and lead variants..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS_2': {'OPEN_TARGETS_GENETICS': ['LOCUS2GENE', 'SA_GWAS', 'STUDIES', 'GENES', 'SA_MOLECULAR_TRAIT', 'VARIANT_DISEASE_CREDSET', 'VARIANT_GENE', 'DISEASE_VARIANT_GENE', 'STUDIES_OVERLAP', 'VARIANTS', 'VARIANT_DISEASE_COLOC', 'OT_RELEASE', 'VARIANT_DISEASE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
