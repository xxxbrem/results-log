After comparing both SQL queries and their results, it's clear that both queries are syntactically correct and produce the same output. However, the first query, `0result.sql`, uses a cleaner and more conventional syntax without unnecessary quotation marks around identifiers and a simpler aliasing of the table. This makes it more readable and adheres to standard SQL practices.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
```
