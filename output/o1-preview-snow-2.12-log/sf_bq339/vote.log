After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that `2result.sql` is the correct SQL query.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Date Handling:** The query in `2result.sql` uses the `EXTRACT` function with `TO_TIMESTAMP` to accurately extract the month and year from the `"start_date"` column. This approach avoids potential issues related to time zones and ensures that all data from 2017 is correctly included.

- **Clear Month Mapping:** The query includes a `CASE` statement to map month numbers to their corresponding month names. This provides clarity in the results and ensures that the month names are accurate.

- **Correct Calculation of Usage Minutes:** The query accurately calculates the cumulative bike usage minutes for both customers and subscribers by summing the `"duration_sec"` divided by 60 to convert seconds to minutes.

- **Accurate Absolute Difference Calculation:** The query correctly computes the absolute difference between the cumulative usage minutes of customers and subscribers.

- **Consistent Results:** The results from `2result.csv` align with those from `0result.csv`, indicating consistency and accuracy in the calculations. Both show July (`Month_num` = 7) as the month with the largest absolute difference of approximately 343,258 minutes.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:
