After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **1result.sql** is the correct choice.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Extension Extraction Logic:**

   - **1result.sql** uses regular expressions to accurately extract the file extensions, considering edge cases where the filename might not have an extension or when the extension starts with a special character.
   
     ```sql
     REGEXP_SUBSTR(REGEXP_SUBSTR(f."path", '[^/\\\\]+$'), '\\.[^\\.]+$')
     ```
     
     This extracts the part of the filename after the last dot, effectively capturing the extension.

   - **0result.sql** uses a combination of string manipulation functions that may not handle all edge cases as effectively.
   
     ```sql
     LOWER(SPLIT_PART(REGEXP_REPLACE(f."path", '^.*/', ''), '.', -1))
     ```
     
     This method might fail if filenames contain multiple dots or special characters.

2. **Handling Special Filenames:**

   - **1result.sql** considers filenames without extensions (like `Dockerfile`) by checking whether the mapping's extension starts with a dot and adjusts the matching logic accordingly.
   
     ```sql
     WHEN LEFT(mapping."extension", 1) = '.'
     ```
   
   - **0result.sql** handles `Dockerfile` specifically but may not generalize well to other filenames without extensions.
   
3. **Readability and Maintainability:**

   - **1result.sql** presents a clearer approach by directly matching file extensions and filenames, making it easier to understand and maintain.
   - The use of regular expressions in **1result.sql** provides a robust solution for pattern matching.

4. **Results Consistency:**

   - Both queries produce the same results, but **1result.sql** achieves this with a methodology that's more reliable across diverse filenames.

Therefore, **1result.sql** is more accurate and robust for determining the programming languages based on file extensions in the dataset.
