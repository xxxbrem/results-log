2025-01-26 04:44:31 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to nesting window functions within one another. In SQL, window functions cannot be nested directly inside other window functions. Specifically, you cannot use a window function like `AVG(...) OVER (...)` inside another window function like `LAG(...) OVER (...)`.

To resolve this issue, you can calculate the moving averages in a subquery and then compute the differences using the `LAG` function in the outer query. Below is the corrected SQL query:

---

```sql

**Explanation:**

- **Issue with Nested Window Functions:**
  - In your original query, you attempted to nest window functions by using the `LAG` function on an `AVG` window function directly. SQL does not allow window functions to be nested in this way.
  
- **Solution Using Subquery:**
  - **Subquery (`t`):** Calculate the moving averages (`Temperature_MA8_Celsius`, `Precipitation_MA8_cm`, `Wind_Speed_MA8_mps`) within a subquery. This ensures that each moving average is calculated and available as a column in the result set.
  - **Outer Query:** In the main query, compute the differences between the current moving average and the one from 8 days prior using the `LAG` function on the moving average columns obtained from the subquery.
  
- **Calculating Differences:**
  - `LAG("Temperature_MA8_Celsius", 8) OVER (ORDER BY t."Date")`: Retrieves the moving average from 8 days prior.
  - Subtract this value from the current moving average and round to one decimal place.

- **Additional Notes:**
  - **Casting Wind Speed:** Ensure that the `"wdsp"` column is properly cast to `FLOAT` before calculations, as it is originally stored as `VARCHAR`.
  - **Date Conversion:** Consistently use `TO_DATE` to convert the concatenated date components into a proper date format for ordering and filtering.
  - **Ordering:** Order the final results by `"Date"` in ascending order.
  - **Limiting Results:** Use `LIMIT 100` to retrieve up to 100 records as per your requirement.

**Resulting Data Format:**

The query will produce a table with the following columns:

- **Date:** Date of the observation, starting from 2019-01-09.
- **Temperature_Celsius:** Daily temperature in Celsius, rounded to one decimal place.
- **Precipitation_cm:** Daily precipitation in centimeters, rounded to one decimal place.
- **Wind_Speed_mps:** Daily wind speed in meters per second, rounded to one decimal place.
- **Temperature_MA8_Celsius:** 8-day moving average of temperature.
- **Precipitation_MA8_cm:** 8-day moving average of precipitation.
- **Wind_Speed_MA8_mps:** 8-day moving average of wind speed.
- **Temperature_Difference_Celsius:** Difference between the current moving average temperature and that of 8 days prior.
- **Precipitation_Difference_cm:** Difference between the current moving average precipitation and that of 8 days prior.
- **Wind_Speed_Difference_mps:** Difference between the current moving average wind speed and that of 8 days prior.

**Sample Output Structure:**

```csv
Date,Temperature_Celsius,Precipitation_cm,Wind_Speed_mps,Temperature_MA8_Celsius,Precipitation_MA8_cm,Wind_Speed_MA8_mps,Temperature_Difference_Celsius,Precipitation_Difference_cm,Wind_Speed_Difference_mps
2019-01-09,2.4,0.0,7.8,2.4,0.5,7.0,,,
2019-01-10,-3.3,0.0,11.6,0.5,0.3,8.5,,,
...
```

**Note:**

- The first 8 records will have `NULL` values for the difference columns because there is no data from 8 days prior to compute the difference.
- All values are rounded to one decimal place as per your requirement.

**Data Considerations:**

- **Data Gaps:** Ensure that there are no missing dates in your dataset, as gaps can affect the moving average and difference calculations.
- **Multiple Stations:** If there are multiple stations in Rochester, this query aggregates them together. If you need data from a specific station, include additional filtering on the station identifiers.
- **Unit Conversions:**
  - **Temperature:** Converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius using `(("temp" - 32) * 5/9)`.
  - **Precipitation:** Converted from inches to centimeters using `("prcp" * 2.54)`.
  - **Wind Speed:** Converted from knots to meters per second using `(CAST("wdsp" AS FLOAT) * 0.514444)`.

**Final Remarks:**

By restructuring your query to compute window functions within a subquery and then applying additional window functions in the outer query, you avoid nesting window functions and resolve the SQL compilation error. This approach preserves the required calculations and aligns with SQL's limitations regarding window functions.

I hope this helps you obtain the desired weather data for Rochester in the first season of 2019. Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

These queries progressively build upon each other to:

- Identify the relevant weather stations in Rochester, NY.
- Retrieve temperature, precipitation, and wind speed data.
- Convert units to Celsius, centimeters, and meters per second.
- Calculate 8-day moving averages for the weather parameters.
- Compute differences between current moving averages and those from up to 8 days prior.
- Limit results to records starting from January 9, 2019, within the first season (assumed to be January to March).
- Order the data by date in ascending order.

**Note:** The queries assume that:

- The `wdsp` (wind speed) column, though stored as `VARCHAR`, contains numeric values that can be cast to `FLOAT`.
- The first season of the year is from January to March.
- The date conversions and calculations are compatible with the data formats in the tables.Query:

Task: Show me the daily weather data (temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) in Rochester for the first season of year 2019, converted to Celsius, centimeters, and meters per second, respectively. Also, include the moving averages (window size = 8) and the differences between the moving averages for up to 8 days prior (all values rounded to one decimal place, sorted by date in ascending order, and records starting from 2019-01-09).

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Date,Temperature_Celsius,Precipitation_cm,Wind_Speed_mps,Temperature_MA8_Celsius,Precipitation_MA8_cm,Wind_Speed_MA8_mps,Temperature_Difference_Celsius,Precipitation_Difference_cm,Wind_Speed_Difference_mps
2019-01-09,temperature1:float,precipitation1:float,wind_speed1:float,ma_temperature1:float,ma_precipitation1:float,ma_wind_speed1:float,diff_temperature1:float,diff_precipitation1:float,diff_wind_speed1:float
2019-01-10,temperature2:float,precipitation2:float,wind_speed2:float,ma_temperature2:float,ma_precipitation2:float,ma_wind_speed2:float,diff_temperature2:float,diff_precipitation2:float,diff_wind_speed2:float
...
```

This table presents the daily weather data for Rochester starting from January 9, 2019. It includes temperature (in Celsius), precipitation (in centimeters), and wind speed (in meters per second), along with their 8-day moving averages and the differences between the current moving average and up to 8 days prior. All values are rounded to one decimal place and sorted by date in ascending order..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
