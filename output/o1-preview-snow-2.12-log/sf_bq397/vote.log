After comparing both SQL scripts and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script.

**Reasoning:**

- **Excludes Invalid Countries:** `0result.sql` specifically excludes records where `geoNetwork_country` is `NULL` or equal to `'(not set)'`. This is important because `'(not set)'` is not a valid country name and including it could skew the results when counting the number of countries per channel grouping.
  
- **Correct Removal of Duplicates:** In the `unique_transactions` CTE, `0result.sql` selects distinct combinations of `transactionId`, `channelGrouping`, and `country`, ensuring that any duplicate transactions are removed based on the transaction ID. This aligns with the requirement of removing duplicate records.
  
- **Accurate Identification of Channels with Multiple Countries:** By excluding invalid countries and correctly aggregating the data, `0result.sql` accurately identifies channel groupings that have transactions from more than one country.
  
- **Proper Ranking of Countries by Total Transactions:** The script calculates the total number of transactions per country and channel grouping, then ranks them appropriately to find the country with the highest number of transactions for each channel grouping.

In contrast, **`1result.sql`** does not exclude records where `geoNetwork_country` is `NULL` or `'(not set)'`, potentially including invalid countries in the analysis. This could lead to incorrect identification of channel groupings with multiple countries and inaccurate counts of transactions.
