These corrected queries adjust the conditions to ensure data retrieval:

- Replaced direct comparisons of `"drugName"` with a subquery using the `DRUG_SYNONYMS_V1` table to account for synonyms and variations of the drug name 'sorafenib'.
- Used `LOWER()` function for case-insensitive comparisons in species names and drug synonyms.
- Simplified some conditions where previous queries returned no data.
- Ensured that all table and column names are correctly referenced.

Please run these corrected queries to retrieve the desired data.

   FROM "TARGETOME_REACTOME"."TARGETOME_VERSIONED"."INTERACTIONS_V1" 
   WHERE "drugName" = 'sorafenib'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve assay values for sorafenib interactions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT i."interactionID", i."drugName", i."targetID", i."target_uniprotID", e."exp_assayValueMedian"
   FROM "TARGETOME_REACTOME"."TARGETOME_VERSIONED"."INTERACTIONS_V1" i

     ON i."expID" = e."expID"
   WHERE i."drugName" = 'sorafenib'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Filter interactions with median assay value ≤ 100:**
   ```sql
   SELECT i."interactionID", i."drugName", i."targetID", i."target_uniprotID", e."exp_assayValueMedian"
   FROM "TARGETOME_REACTOME"."TARGETOME_VERSIONED"."INTERACTIONS_V1" i

   WHERE i."drugName" = 'sorafenib' 
     AND e."exp_assayValueMedian" <= 100
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Apply assay low and high value conditions:**
   ```sql

Task: Determine which three lowest-level Reactome pathways (with TAS evidence) have the highest chi-squared statistics, considering only Homo sapiens targets associated with sorafenib under the conditions that the median assay value is ≤ 100 and both low and high assay values are ≤ 100 or null. For each of these three pathways, how many of these targets and non-targets lie within the pathway and outside it?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Pathway_Name,Targets_in_Pathway,NonTargets_in_Pathway,Targets_outside_Pathway,NonTargets_outside_Pathway
pathway1_name:str,targets_in:int,non_targets_in:int,targets_out:int,non_targets_out:int
pathway2_name:str,targets_in:int,non_targets_in:int,targets_out:int,non_targets_out:int
pathway3_name:str,targets_in:int,non_targets_in:int,targets_out:int,non_targets_out:int
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

This table lists the three lowest-level Reactome pathways (with TAS evidence) that have the highest chi-squared statistics, considering the specified conditions. For each pathway, it shows the number of Homo sapiens targets associated with sorafenib (under the given assay conditions) and non-targets that are within the pathway and those that are outside of it..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'TARGETOME_REACTOME': {'REACTOME_VERSIONED': ['PE_TO_PATHWAY_V77', 'PATHWAY_V77', 'PATHWAY_HIERARCHY_V77', 'PHYSICAL_ENTITY_V77'], 'TARGETOME_VERSIONED': ['EXPERIMENTS_V1', 'INTERACTIONS_V1', 'SOURCES_V1', 'DRUG_SYNONYMS_V1', 'TARGET_SYNONYMS_V1']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

This table lists the three lowest-level Reactome pathways (with TAS evidence) that have the highest chi-squared statistics, considering the specified conditions. For each pathway, it shows the number of Homo sapiens targets associated with sorafenib (under the given assay conditions) and non-targets that are within the pathway and those that are outside of it. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
