Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant tables, columns, and potential usage:**

- **PERSON** table:
  - **"PID"**: Actor's unique identifier. Used to identify each actor.
  - **"Name"**: Actor's name.

- **M_CAST** table:
  - **"PID"**: Actor's unique identifier. Used to link to the PERSON table.
  - **"MID"**: Movie's unique identifier. Used to link to the MOVIE table.

- **MOVIE** table:
  - **"MID"**: Movie's unique identifier.
  - **"year"**: Release year of the movie. Used to determine when actors appeared in films.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Join **M_CAST** with **PERSON** on "PID" to associate actors with their movie appearances.
- Join **M_CAST** with **MOVIE** on "MID" to obtain the release years of movies.
- Use aggregation functions like `MIN` and `MAX` to find the first and last years of appearances.
- Use window functions to calculate gaps between movie years for each actor.
- Filter actors based on the length of gaps between appearances.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve a list of all actors:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "PID", "Name"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve a list of all movies with their release years:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "MID", "title", "year"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.MOVIE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve all records from the M_CAST table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "MID", "PID"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List all movies each actor has appeared in:**

   ```sql
   SELECT person."Name", movie."title", movie."year"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST AS m_cast
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON AS person
     ON m_cast."PID" = person."PID"
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.MOVIE AS movie
     ON m_cast."MID" = movie."MID"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find the number of movies each actor has appeared in:**

   ```sql
   SELECT person."Name", COUNT(m_cast."MID") AS "MovieCount"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST AS m_cast
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON AS person
     ON m_cast."PID" = person."PID"
   GROUP BY person."Name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Get the years in which each actor appeared in movies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT person."Name", movie."year" AS "AppearanceYear"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST AS m_cast
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON AS person
     ON m_cast."PID" = person."PID"
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.MOVIE AS movie
     ON m_cast."MID" = movie."MID"
   ORDER BY person."Name", movie."year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find the first and last years each actor appeared in movies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT person."Name",
          MIN(movie."year") AS "FirstYear",
          MAX(movie."year") AS "LastYear"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST AS m_cast
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON AS person
     ON m_cast."PID" = person."PID"
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.MOVIE AS movie
     ON m_cast."MID" = movie."MID"
   GROUP BY person."Name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List all unique years in which each actor appeared:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT person."Name", movie."year" AS "AppearanceYear"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST AS m_cast
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON AS person
     ON m_cast."PID" = person."PID"
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.MOVIE AS movie
     ON m_cast."MID" = movie."MID"
   ORDER BY person."Name", movie."year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate the number of years between each actor's first and last appearances:**

   ```sql
   SELECT person."Name",
          (MAX(movie."year") - MIN(movie."year")) AS "CareerSpanYears"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST AS m_cast
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON AS person
     ON m_cast."PID" = person."PID"
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.MOVIE AS movie
     ON m_cast."MID" = movie."MID"
   GROUP BY person."Name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Identify gaps between movie appearances for each actor:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      appearances."PID",
      appearances."Name",
      appearances."year" AS "CurrentYear",
      LEAD(appearances."year") OVER (PARTITION BY appearances."PID" ORDER BY appearances."year") AS "NextYear",
      (LEAD(appearances."year") OVER (PARTITION BY appearances."PID" ORDER BY appearances."year") - appearances."year") AS "GapYears"
    FROM (
      SELECT DISTINCT person."PID", person."Name", movie."year"
      FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST AS m_cast
      JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON AS person
        ON m_cast."PID" = person."PID"
      JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.MOVIE AS movie
        ON m_cast."MID" = movie."MID"
    ) AS appearances
    ORDER BY appearances."PID", appearances."year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the data to help understand how actors' appearances are distributed over the years. By examining the results, one can determine patterns such as the frequency of appearances and potential gaps in actors' careers, which is essential for addressing the original task.Query:

Task: From the first year each actor appeared in a film to the last, how many actors in the database never had a gap longer than three consecutive years without at least one new movie appearance, meaning there is no four-year span anywhere in their active career without at least a single film credit?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_actors_without_long_gap
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This number represents the count of actors who, from their first film appearance to their last, never had a gap longer than three consecutive years without appearing in at least one movie. That is, there is no four-year span anywhere in their active career without at least a single film credit..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'DB_IMDB': {'DB_IMDB': ['COUNTRY', 'M_GENRE', 'M_LANGUAGE', 'LOCATION', 'MOVIE', 'M_DIRECTOR', 'M_LOCATION', 'M_PRODUCER', 'LANGUAGE', 'PERSON', 'GENRE', 'M_CAST', 'M_COUNTRY']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

This number represents the count of actors who, from their first film appearance to their last, never had a gap longer than three consecutive years without appearing in at least one movie. That is, there is no four-year span anywhere in their active career without at least a single film credit. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
