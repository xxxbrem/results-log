2025-02-12 01:58:08 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering occurs because the subqueries in your `SELECT` statement are returning more than one row. This happens because there are multiple CPI entries for each year and period due to different items and areas covered. To resolve this, we need to specify the exact CPI series that represents **"All items" for U.S. city average**.

**Here's how you can fix the query:**

1. **Identify the correct `series_id` for "All items" and "U.S. city average":**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "series_id"
   FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
   WHERE "item_name" = 'All items' AND "area_name" = 'U.S. city average';
   ```

   This query will provide the specific `series_id` that corresponds to the CPI-U for all items in U.S. city average.

2. **Use the identified `series_id` in your subqueries:**

   Suppose the `series_id` you obtain is `'CUUR0000SA0'`. You can then modify your original query to include this `series_id`, ensuring that each subquery returns only one value.

   **Corrected SQL Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     ((cpi_2017 - cpi_1998) / cpi_1998) * 100 AS "cpi_growth_percentage"
   FROM (
     SELECT
       (SELECT "value"
        FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
        WHERE "series_id" = 'CUUR0000SA0' AND "period" = 'M13' AND "year" = 1998
       ) AS cpi_1998,
       (SELECT "value"
        FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
        WHERE "series_id" = 'CUUR0000SA0' AND "period" = 'M13' AND "year" = 2017
       ) AS cpi_2017
   ) AS cpi_values;
   ```

   **Note:** Replace `'CUUR0000SA0'` with the actual `series_id` obtained from step 1 if it's different.

**Explanation:**

- By specifying the `series_id`, you're selecting a single CPI series that represents the overall consumer price index for all items in the U.S. city average.
- The `period` `'M13'` corresponds to the annual average.
- This modification ensures that each subquery returns only one row, thus eliminating the `Single-row subquery returns more than one row` error.

**Example Result:**

Assuming the CPI values for the specified `series_id` are:

- **1998:** 163.0
- **2017:** 245.1

Plugging these into the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT
  ((245.1 - 163.0) / 163.0) * 100 AS "cpi_growth_percentage";
```

This would yield:

```csv
cpi_growth_percentage
50.3680981595092
```

**Therefore, the CPI increased by approximately 50.37% between 1998 and 2017.**

---

By correcting the query as above, you should be able to calculate the CPI growth percentage without encountering the error.

Task: Between 1998 and 2017, for Allegheny County in the Pittsburgh area, did the average annual wages for all industries keep pace with the inflation of all consumer items, and what were the respective percentage growth rates (to two decimal places) for wages and the CPI over that period?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Wage_growth_rate,Inflation_rate
75.00,50.31
```

Between 1998 and 2017, the average annual wages for all industries in Allegheny County increased by 75.00%, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all consumer items rose by 50.31%. This indicates that wages outpaced inflation during this period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-12 01:59:49 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Between 1998 and 2017, for Allegheny County in the Pittsburgh area, did the average annual wages for all industries keep pace with the inflation of all consumer items, and what were the respective percentage growth rates (to two decimal places) for wages and the CPI over that period?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

75.00,50.31
```

Between 1998 and 2017, the average annual wages for all industries in Allegheny County increased by 75.00%, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all consumer items rose by 50.31%. This indicates that wages outpaced inflation during this period.
