After analyzing the provided SQL queries and considering the task requirements, the SQL script that best fulfills the task is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Comprehensive Performance Metrics:** `1result.sql` calculates all the required metricsâ€”**total sales**, **average item price**, **average review scores**, and **packing times** per seller.
  
- **Filters Sellers Appropriately:** It includes only those sellers who have **sold more than 100 products** by using the `HAVING COUNT(*) > 100` clause in the `total_sales_per_seller` CTE.
  
- **Proper Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** The query uses CTEs to break down the calculations into logical sections:
  - `total_sales_per_seller`: Calculates total products sold, total sales, and average item price.
  - `avg_review_score_per_seller`: Computes average review scores per seller.
  - `avg_packing_time_per_seller`: Determines average packing times per seller.
  
- **Accurate Calculation of Packing Time:** It calculates **packing time** as the difference in hours between `order_approved_at` and `order_delivered_carrier_date`, ensuring both timestamps are valid.
  
- **Data Integrity:** It joins the CTEs using `LEFT JOIN` on `seller_id`, ensuring that all sellers who meet the criteria are included, even if some may lack review scores or packing times.
  
- **Ordering Results:** The final results are ordered by `Total_Sales` in descending order, highlighting the top-performing sellers.
  
- **Clarity and Maintainability:** The use of CTEs makes the query more readable and maintainable, facilitating future modifications if necessary.

**Note:** While `1result.sql` effectively addresses the seller performance metrics, the task also requires highlighting the **product category names in English with the highest sales volume**. This aspect can be addressed with an additional query, such as the one provided in the earlier queries (e.g., Query 14). Including this query separately ensures that both parts of the task are fully satisfied without overcomplicating the seller performance query.
