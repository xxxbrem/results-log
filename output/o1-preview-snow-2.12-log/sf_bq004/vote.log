2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

Between the two SQL scripts provided (`1result.sql` and `2result.sql`), `2result.sql` is the correct choice for the following reasons:

1. **Accurate Summation of Quantities:**
   - `2result.sql` sums the `productQuantity` directly without using `COALESCE` to default `NULL` values to `1`. This means it only counts actual quantities recorded in the data, ensuring the total quantity reflects true purchase amounts.
   - In contrast, `1result.sql` uses `COALESCE(p.value:"productQuantity"::INTEGER, 1)`, which substitutes a `NULL` `productQuantity` with `1`. This could inflate the total quantity by assigning a quantity of `1` to products where the quantity was not recorded, potentially overestimating the actual quantities purchased.

2. **Consistency with Data Integrity:**
   - By not assuming a default quantity, `2result.sql` maintains the integrity of the original data. It avoids making assumptions about missing `productQuantity` values, which could lead to inaccurate results.
   - Ensuring that only valid, non-`NULL` quantities are summed provides a more reliable and accurate representation of the data.

3. **Alignment with the Task's Requirements:**
   - The task is to find the product with the highest total quantity purchased among visitors who bought any YouTube-related product, excluding those containing 'YouTube' in the product name.
   - `2result.sql` appropriately filters the data to include only the relevant visitors and products, and calculates the total quantities accordingly.

**Conclusion:**

`2result.sql` provides a more accurate and reliable result by summing actual recorded quantities without default substitutions. Therefore, it is the correct SQL script for answering the task.
