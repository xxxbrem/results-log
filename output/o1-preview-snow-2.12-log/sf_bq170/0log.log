2025-01-24 02:27:56 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to mismatched quotation marks in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, the string literal `'TCGA-BRCA"` starts with a single quote (`'`) but ends with a double quote (`"`), which causes a syntax error because the SQL parser cannot properly identify the beginning and end of the string.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "chromosome"
FROM "TCGA_MITELMAN"."TCGA_VERSIONED"."COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_ALLELIC_HG38_GDC_R23"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BRCA'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks in SQL:**
  - In SQL, **single quotes** (`'`) are used to enclose string literals.
  - **Double quotes** (`"`) are used to enclose identifiers such as column names or table names (when needed, especially if they contain special characters or are case-sensitive).

- **Issue in Your Query:**
  - The string `'TCGA-BRCA"` starts with a single quote but ends with a double quote.
  - This mismatch leads the SQL parser to expect more input to close the string properly, resulting in an unexpected end of input (`<EOF>`) error.

- **Fix:**
  - Ensure that the string literal is enclosed with matching single quotes.
  - Replace the double quote at the end of `'TCGA-BRCA"` with a single quote: `'TCGA-BRCA'`.

**Error Message Explained:**

```
001003 (42000): 01b9ea93-0004-8086-0001-11c300f906de: SQL compilation error:
parse error line 4 at position 13 near '<EOF>'.
```

- **Line 4 at position 13 near `<EOF>`:**
  - This indicates that the parser reached the end of the file (input) unexpectedly while parsing the string literal.
  - The mismatched quotes prevented the parser from recognizing the end of the string, causing it to look for a closing quote until it reached the end of the input.

**Additional Note:**

- Always ensure consistency in using quotation marks in SQL queries:
  - Use **single quotes** for string literals: `'string_value'`.
  - Use **double quotes** for identifiers (if necessary): `"column_name"`.

**Now, if you run the corrected query, it should execute without errors and return the distinct chromosomes for TCGA-BRCA cases:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "chromosome"
FROM "TCGA_MITELMAN"."TCGA_VERSIONED"."COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_ALLELIC_HG38_GDC_R23"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BRCA'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Expected Results:**

```
chromosome
1
2
3
...
X
Y
```

- The query will list all distinct chromosomes present in the copy number segment data for TCGA-BRCA cases.

```

**Explanation:**

- **Issue Addressed:** The previous query returned no data, likely due to a mismatch in the chromosome values during the join between the `cn` (copy number) and `cb` (cytoband) tables.
  
- **Correction Made:**
  
  - **Chromosome Matching:** Used `TRIM(LEADING 'chr' FROM cn."chromosome")` to remove the `'chr'` prefix from the chromosome values in the copy number table. This ensures that chromosome values match between the two tables.
  
  - **Simplified Conditions:** Retained essential conditions for the join and selection without overcomplicating, aiming to retrieve data successfully.

**Note:** This query counts the number of unique breast cancer cases (`"case_barcode"`) for each `"copy_number"` across all cytobands, ensuring that the data is retrieved by correcting the join condition.

# Copy Number Variations

Copy number variation (abbreviated CNV) refers to a circumstance in which the number of copies of a specific segment of DNA varies among different individuals’ genomes. The individual variants may be short or include thousands of bases. These structural differences may have come about through duplications, deletions or other changes and can affect long stretches of DNA. Such regions may or may not contain a gene(s).


## How Copy Number is Calculated

- For each case, we only care about the maximum copy number for a specific chromosome region;
- The overlap between a cytoband (a defined region on a chromosome) and a copy number segment is calculated using:
$$\text{overlap}=\frac{|\text{hg38\_stop}−\text{hg38\_start}| + |\text{end\_pos}−\text{start\_pos}| − |\text{hg38\_stop}−\text{end\_pos}| − |\text{hg38\_start}−\text{start\_pos}|}{2}$$
This measures how much of the copy number segment overlaps with the cytoband.
- The weighted average copy number for each cytoband is calculated by
$$\text{weighted copy number}=\frac{\sum (\text{overlap} \times \text{copy\_number})}{\sum \text{overlap}}$$
- Usually, the weighted average is rounded to produce the final copy mumber for each cytoband.


## Five Types of Genomic Alterations

Here’s an explanation of the five types of genomic alterations as represented by copy number variations (CNVs):

### Homozygous Deletions

- Definition: A homozygous deletion (often called a complete deletion) occurs when both copies of a gene are lost, resulting in a copy number of 0.
- Criteria: copy number = 0 identifies homozygous deletions.
- Biological Significance: Homozygous deletions can lead to the loss of tumor suppressor genes (genes that normally prevent cancer growth). Without these protective genes, cells can more easily progress toward cancer.


### Heterozygous Deletions

- Definition: A heterozygous deletion involves the loss of one copy of a gene, while the other copy remains intact. The copy number is 1 in this case.
- Criteria: copy number = 1 indicates a heterozygous deletion.
- Biological Significance: While less severe than a homozygous deletion, heterozygous deletions can still disrupt cellular function, especially if the remaining copy of the gene is mutated or insufficient to maintain normal function.


### Normal Diploid

- Definition: A normal diploid region has the standard two copies of a gene, as is typical in most healthy human cells.
- Criteria: copy number = 2 is used to identify regions with a normal diploid copy number.
- Biological Significance: Diploid regions are expected in non-cancerous cells and represent the baseline state of the genome, where two functional copies of each gene are present.


### Gains

- Definition: A gain is an increase in the number of copies of a region of the genome, but it's less severe than amplification. Gains involve having up to two additional copies beyond the diploid state, resulting in a copy number of 3.
- Criteria: One extra copy beyond the normal two.
- Biological Significance: Gains can be associated with increased expression of genes that promote cancer, but the effects may be more moderate compared to amplifications.


###  Amplifications

- Definition: Amplifications refer to regions of the genome where the number of copies of a gene is much higher than usual. For a diploid cell (a normal cell with two copies of each chromosome), amplifications involve having more than four copies of a gene.
- Criteria: There are at least 4 copies of a gene in the region.
- Biological Significance: Amplifications are common in cancer, where extra copies of oncogenes (genes that can promote cancer growth) may drive uncontrolled cell proliferation.


These categories help identify patterns in the genomic alterations present in cancer cells, providing insight into the molecular mechanisms driving cancer progression.

Task: For breast cancer cases (TCGA-BRCA) from REL 23 of the active GDC archive, identify and categorize copy number variations (CNVs) across different cytobands on all chromosomes. CNVs include amplifications, gains, homozygous deletions, heterozygous deletions, and normal diploid states. For each cytoband, tell me its name and start/end position, and calculate the frequency of each CNV type as a percentage of the total number of cases (rounded to 2 decimals).

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
cytoband_name,hg38_start,hg38_stop,homozygous_deletion_freq,heterozygous_deletion_freq,normal_diploid_freq,gain_freq,amplification_freq
name1:str,start1:int,end1:int,freq1:0-100,freq2:0-100,freq3:0-100,freq4:0-100,freq5:0-100
name2:str,start2:int,end2:int,freq1:0-100,freq2:0-100,freq3:0-100,freq4:0-100,freq5:0-100
...
```

In this table:

- **cytoband_name**: The name of the cytoband (e.g., "1p36.33").
- **hg38_start**: The starting position of the cytoband on the chromosome according to the hg38 reference genome.
- **hg38_stop**: The ending position of the cytoband on the chromosome according to the hg38 reference genome.
- **homozygous_deletion_freq**: The frequency (%) of homozygous deletions in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.
- **heterozygous_deletion_freq**: The frequency (%) of heterozygous deletions in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.
- **normal_diploid_freq**: The frequency (%) of normal diploid state in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.
- **gain_freq**: The frequency (%) of gains in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.
- **amplification_freq**: The frequency (%) of amplifications in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.

*Note*: The frequencies are calculated as percentages of the total number of breast cancer cases (TCGA-BRCA) from REL 23 of the active GDC archive, rounded to two decimal places..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 02:40:11 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For breast cancer cases (TCGA-BRCA) from REL 23 of the active GDC archive, identify and categorize copy number variations (CNVs) across different cytobands on all chromosomes. CNVs include amplifications, gains, homozygous deletions, heterozygous deletions, and normal diploid states. For each cytoband, tell me its name and start/end position, and calculate the frequency of each CNV type as a percentage of the total number of cases (rounded to 2 decimals)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
cytoband_name,hg38_start,hg38_stop,homozygous_deletion_freq,heterozygous_deletion_freq,normal_diploid_freq,gain_freq,amplification_freq
name1:str,start1:int,end1:int,freq1:0-100,freq2:0-100,freq3:0-100,freq4:0-100,freq5:0-100
name2:str,start2:int,end2:int,freq1:0-100,freq2:0-100,freq3:0-100,freq4:0-100,freq5:0-100
...
```

In this table:

- **cytoband_name**: The name of the cytoband (e.g., "1p36.33").
- **hg38_start**: The starting position of the cytoband on the chromosome according to the hg38 reference genome.
- **hg38_stop**: The ending position of the cytoband on the chromosome according to the hg38 reference genome.
- **homozygous_deletion_freq**: The frequency (%) of homozygous deletions in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.
- **heterozygous_deletion_freq**: The frequency (%) of heterozygous deletions in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.
- **normal_diploid_freq**: The frequency (%) of normal diploid state in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.
- **gain_freq**: The frequency (%) of gains in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.
- **amplification_freq**: The frequency (%) of amplifications in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.

*Note*: The frequencies are calculated as percentages of the total number of breast cancer cases (TCGA-BRCA) from REL 23 of the active GDC archive, rounded to two decimal places. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-24 02:41:19 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For breast cancer cases (TCGA-BRCA) from REL 23 of the active GDC archive, identify and categorize copy number variations (CNVs) across different cytobands on all chromosomes. CNVs include amplifications, gains, homozygous deletions, heterozygous deletions, and normal diploid states. For each cytoband, tell me its name and start/end position, and calculate the frequency of each CNV type as a percentage of the total number of cases (rounded to 2 decimals)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
cytoband_name,hg38_start,hg38_stop,homozygous_deletion_freq,heterozygous_deletion_freq,normal_diploid_freq,gain_freq,amplification_freq
name1:str,start1:int,end1:int,freq1:0-100,freq2:0-100,freq3:0-100,freq4:0-100,freq5:0-100
name2:str,start2:int,end2:int,freq1:0-100,freq2:0-100,freq3:0-100,freq4:0-100,freq5:0-100
...
```

In this table:

- **cytoband_name**: The name of the cytoband (e.g., "1p36.33").
- **hg38_start**: The starting position of the cytoband on the chromosome according to the hg38 reference genome.
- **hg38_stop**: The ending position of the cytoband on the chromosome according to the hg38 reference genome.
- **homozygous_deletion_freq**: The frequency (%) of homozygous deletions in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.
- **heterozygous_deletion_freq**: The frequency (%) of heterozygous deletions in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.
- **normal_diploid_freq**: The frequency (%) of normal diploid state in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.
- **gain_freq**: The frequency (%) of gains in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.
- **amplification_freq**: The frequency (%) of amplifications in the cytoband among TCGA-BRCA cases.

*Note*: The frequencies are calculated as percentages of the total number of breast cancer cases (TCGA-BRCA) from REL 23 of the active GDC archive, rounded to two decimal places.
