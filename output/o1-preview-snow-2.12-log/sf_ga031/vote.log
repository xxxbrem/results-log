After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

Both SQL queries aim to calculate the user session conversion rate by determining the percentage of sessions that included both the 'Home' and 'Checkout Confirmation' page views. However, `1result.sql` is more straightforward and efficient in its approach:

- **Clarity:** `1result.sql` separately identifies sessions that visited the 'Home' page and sessions that visited the 'Checkout Confirmation' page, then finds the intersection of these sessions to determine the converted sessions.

- **Efficiency:** By directly joining the sessions based on `ga_session_id`, it avoids the extra subquery and grouping used in `0result.sql`, making the query easier to read and understand.

- **Accuracy:** Both queries produce the same conversion rate of **1.7391%**, indicating that `1result.sql` correctly computes the desired metric.

Based on these considerations, the correct SQL is:
