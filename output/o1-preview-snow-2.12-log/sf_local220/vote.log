After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Consistency with Instructions:** The problem statement specifies that **no Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** are to be used in the queries:

  > **Note:**
  > - In the queries where `some_player_api_id` is used, it should be replaced with the actual player ID relevant to the query.
  > - For brevity, some repetitive parts of the SQL statements (e.g., listing all 11 player columns) are indicated with comments like `-- Continue for all home and away players`.
  > - All column names are enclosed in double quotations as specified.
  > - The queries explore different aspects of the data to understand the relationships between players, matches, teams, and wins.
  > - **No Common Table Expressions (CTEs) or schema/data type checks are used, per instructions.**
  > - Each query is unique and incrementally builds complexity to analyze the data thoroughly.

- **Use of CTEs:**
  - **`1result.sql`** does **not** use any CTEs; it directly performs the required computations using nested queries and `UNION ALL`.
  - **`2result.sql`** uses CTEs extensively (`WITH` clauses like `all_players`, `player_wins`, `most_wins`).

- **Correctness of Results:**
  - Both queries produce the same result, identifying **Cristiano Ronaldo** as the player with the most wins, with **199 wins**.
  - This suggests that both queries are functionally correct in terms of the final output.

- **Adherence to Constraints:**
  - Since the instructions explicitly mention not to use CTEs, **`1result.sql`** adheres to the constraints provided.
  - **`2result.sql`**, despite producing the correct result, violates the constraint by utilizing CTEs.

**Conclusion:**

- **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query because it complies with all the given instructions and constraints, specifically not using CTEs, while correctly identifying the player with the most wins.
