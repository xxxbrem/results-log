After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** best answers the task. Here's why:

- **Comprehensive Age Groups:** `1result.sql` includes all age groups and calculates the difference in average deaths per code for each age group, whether the difference is positive or negative. This provides a complete picture of how the average deaths from "discharge" codes compare to those from "vehicle" codes across all age groups.

- **Accurate Calculation of Differences:** It calculates the average deaths per ICD-10 code for both "discharge" and "vehicle" categories among individuals identified as white, and then computes the difference without filtering out negative values. This aligns with the task's requirement to determine how much higher the average number of deaths is for "discharge" codes compared to "vehicle" codes, considering all scenarios.

- **Clear Ordering of Results:** The results in `1result.csv` are ordered by the difference in average deaths per code, which helps identify the age groups with the most significant differences at a glance.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that fulfills the task effectively.
