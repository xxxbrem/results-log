After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Calculation of Projected Sales:** The `1result.sql` script correctly calculates the projected sales for 2021 by applying the growth rate from 2019 to 2020 for each product and month. The formula used aligns with the method described in the task:

  \[
  \text{Projected\_Sales\_2021} = \text{Sales\_2020} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Sales\_2020} - \text{Sales\_2019}}{\text{Sales\_2019}}\right)
  \]

  This simplifies to:

  \[
  \text{Projected\_Sales\_2021} = \frac{\text{Sales\_2020}^2}{\text{Sales\_2019}}
  \]

  The script handles cases where sales in 2019 or 2020 are zero, ensuring that the calculations do not result in division by zero errors.

- **Comprehensive Data Inclusion:** By using a full outer join between 2019 and 2020 sales data, `1result.sql` includes all products, even if they had sales in only one of the years. This approach provides a more accurate and comprehensive projection.

- **Correct Handling of Zero Sales:** The script assigns a projected sales value of zero when there were no sales in 2020 and uses the 2020 sales directly when there were no sales in 2019, which aligns with logical expectations for growth projections.

- **Consistent Results:** The output of `1result.sql` provides average projected monthly sales in USD that are consistent with the expected trends, without inflated values that might result from miscalculations.
