b8f29c08-2530-4ff1-bd49-da1f483b73ed,2018-12-31,Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase,"Extended data figures and tables
Extended Data Fig. 1 Discovery of an optimal crosslinking site between PS1 and Notch-100 for formation of a stable γ-secretase–Notch complex.
a, A schematic diagram of the screening procedure for an optimal crosslinking site between human γ-secretase and Notch-100. Sixteen γ-secretase variants were generated and tested for their crosslinking efficiencies. In each variant, a specific residue from Gly111-Gln112-Leu113-Ile114 of PS1 and a specific residue from Pro1728-Pro1729-Pro1730-Pro1731 of Notch were mutated to Cys. b, Examination of crosslinking efficiency by western blot analysis. In the absence of the reducing agent DTT, the intensity ratio of the crosslinked band (PS1-NTF + Notch-100) over PS1 was estimated to reflect the crosslinking efficiency. Q112C (in PS1) and P1728C (in Notch-100) were selected as the optimal crosslinking sites. c, PS1(Q112C) does not have a pronounced effect on the cleavage of Notch-100 by human γ-secretase. The amount of NICD generated by γ-secretase with PS1(Q112C) is similar to that produced by wild-type γ-secretase. d, The presence of an methionine residue at the amino terminus of Notch-100 does not have a pronounced effect on its cleavage efficiency by γ-secretase. e, The substrate Notch-100 is crosslinked to PS1 of human γ-secretase through an engineered disulfide bond. This disulfide bond involves two mutations on the extracellular side: PS1(Q112C) and Notch(P1728C). The enzyme–substrate complex was purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration (see Methods). f, The purified γ-secretase–Notch-100 complex was visualized by SDS–PAGE with Coomassie staining. The crosslinked complex between PS1-NTF and Notch-100 can be reduced by DTT in vitro, generating free PS1-NTF. g, Analysis of the γ-secretase–Notch-100 complex by gel filtration. A representative chromatogram is shown (top), and the peak fractions were visualized by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie staining (bottom). PS1-NTF had been mostly crosslinked to Notch-100. Purification trials were repeated two times.
Extended Data Fig. 2 A flowchart for cryo-EM data processing.
The final average resolution for the entire human γ-secretase–Notch-100 complex is estimated to be 2.7 Å. For details, please refer to the Methods.
Extended Data Fig. 3 Cryo-EM analysis of the complex of human γ-secretase and Notch-100.
a, FSC curve for the 3D reconstruction of the cryo-EM map. The average resolution is estimated to be 2.7 Å on the basis of the FSC value of 0.143. b, Angular distribution of the particles used for reconstruction of the γ-secretase–Notch complex. Each cylinder represents one view and the height of the cylinder is proportional to the number of particles for that view. c, FSC curves of the refined model versus the overall 2.7 Å map that it was refined against (black); of the model refined in the first of the two independent maps used for the FSC calculation versus that same map (red); and of the model refined in the first of the two independent maps versus the second independent map (green). The small difference between the red and green curves indicates that the refinement of the atomic coordinates did not suffer from overfitting. d, Colour-coded local resolution distribution in Å of the final reconstruction as estimated by RELION-2.052.
Extended Data Fig. 4 Local cryo-EM density maps for representative regions of the γ-secretase–Notch-100 complex.
a, The local cryo-EM density maps for all nine transmembrane helices of PS1. The density for the side chains of TM2 is of sufficient quality for assignment of specific amino acids. TM6 is broken into two helices connected by a rigid coil. The sequences preceding TM7 form a β-strand in the presence of the substrate Notch-100. The contour level of the cryo-EM density for TM2 and TM6 of PS1 is 5σ. b, The local cryo-EM density maps for all seven transmembrane helices of APH-1. c, The local cryo-EM density map for the transmembrane helix of Notch-100. The cryo-EM density for the connecting loop of the transmembrane helix and the amino terminus is weak (left, 2.7 Å map, contour level 5σ), but can be improved by further classification and refinement (right, 3.3 Å map, contour level 8σ, map refers to Extended Data Fig. 8). d, The local cryo-EM density maps for the only transmembrane helix and three selected regions of NCT. e, The local cryo-EM density maps for the three transmembrane helices of PEN-2. The contour level of the cryo-EM density is 8σ, except where specifically stated in a and c.
Extended Data Fig. 5 Overall structure of the complex of human γ-secretase and Notch-100.
a, Overall structure of human γ-secretase bound to Notch-100. The structure is shown either in cartoon (cylindrical helices, top) or in surface (bottom). Glycans and lipids are displayed as sticks. Four perpendicular views are shown. b, The human γ-secre

Monocytes are one of the most important innate immune cells associated with immunopathogenesis in HIV infection, even though monocytes are poorly or not directly infected by HIV. The events that take place specifically in monocytes may contribute to the systemic immune dysfunction characterized by excessive immune activation in individuals infected with HIV-1, which correlates directly with the pathogenesis and progression of the disease1,2,3. Among newly described plasma biomarkers in HIV, plasma levels of the monocyte/macrophage activation marker, soluble CD163 (sCD163), the released form of the hemoglobin scavenger receptor in response to inflammatory signals, associate with clinical outcomes and predict all-cause mortality in HIV-1 infected individuals4,5,6,7,8. Additionally, high sCD163 levels correlate with neurocognitive impairment in HIV infection, postmortem brain pathology9, and predicts incident chronic lung, kidney and liver disease in HIV infection10.
Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is the current treatment of choice for HIV, it completely inhibits circulating viremia and partially improves health and restore CD4 + T cell counts. However, patients under therapy frequently experience the development of non-AIDS disorders including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, malignancy, and some neurological diseases11. Clinical trials aiming at reduction of chronic inflammation and the effects of cART in HIV + patients have been widely performed. Therapies focused in reducing microbial translocation12,13,14,15; co-pathogens excess16; systemic inflammation and the hypercoagulation state17,18,19,20 remain in tests. However, given the complexity and multiple factors associated with HIV infection, the use of certain therapies could reduce the immunological ability to control viral replication or activate compensatory pathways1.
Epigenetic mechanisms are defined by changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. It includes several chromatin alterations as methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination of histones or direct DNA methylation performed by specialized enzymes21. These alterations in diseases can modify host immune response by altering gene expression profile and further protein production. In the case of HIV, epigenetics are involved in regulation of viral latency22 and viral replication23. How HIV may epigenetically alter the response of innate immune cells is still unknown. Therapies aiming at modulating epigenetic enzymes are innovative strategies in the regulation not only of viral replication but more importantly the immune response against the virus and opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, common in these patients. Ongoing clinical trials against various types of cancer24 and inflammatory diseases25 show promising results in this field. In HIV infection, therapies focused on eliminating viral latency, using Vorinostat, an HDAC inhibitor are also being tested26. Once elucidated, epigenetic biomarkers could be used as targets in HIV gene therapy, aiming to reduce systemic immune activation, the central cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients in the cART era.
In this sense, the aim of this work was to characterize monocytes from HIV + patients and correlate the immune dysfunction and progression with epigenetic alterations in these cells. Here, we show that HIV impairs the function of monocytes by reducing phagocytosis and killing and inducing dysregulated production of pro-inflammatory mediators when these cells are challenged with M. tuberculosis (Mtb). Epigenetic biosignature of monocytes from HIV patients display a more activated state, that is stronger when patients are segregated according to progression.; Monocytes are one of the most important innate immune cells associated with immunopathogenesis in HIV infection, even though monocytes are poorly or not directly infected by HIV. The events that take place specifically in monocytes may contribute to the systemic immune dysfunction characterized by excessive immune activation in individuals infected with HIV-1, which correlates directly with the pathogenesis and progression of the disease1,2,3. Among newly described plasma biomarkers in HIV, plasma levels of the monocyte/macrophage activation marker, soluble CD163 (sCD163), the released form of the hemoglobin scavenger receptor in response to inflammatory signals, associate with clinical outcomes and predict all-cause mortality in HIV-1 infected individuals4,5,6,7,8.

# BigQuery Tokenize Definitions

## `tokenise_no_stop`

### Description
Removes common stopwords from a text string and tokenizes the remaining content into an array of words. This function is essential for natural language processing tasks where common words (like "and", "the", etc.) that offer little value in understanding the text's meaning are filtered out to focus on more significant words.

### SQL Definition
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION `spider2-public-data`.word_vectors_us.tokenise_no_stop(text STRING)
AS (
(
    SELECT ARRAY_AGG(word) FROM UNNEST(REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL(
                                REGEXP_REPLACE(text, r'’|\'s(\W)', r'\1'),
                                r'((?:\d+(?:,\d+)*(?:\.\d+)?)+|(?:[\w])+)')) AS word
    WHERE LOWER(word) not in UNNEST(['a', 'about', 'above', 'after', 'again', 'against', 'ain', 'all', 'am', 'an', 'and', 'any', 'are', 'aren', 'arent', 'as', 'at', 'be', 'because', 'been', 'before', 'being', 'below', 'between', 'both', 'but', 'by', 'can', 'couldn', 'couldnt', 'd', 'did', 'didn', 'didnt', 'do', 'does', 'doesn', 'doesnt', 'doing', 'don', 'dont', 'down', 'during', 'each', 'few', 'for', 'from', 'further', 'had', 'hadn', 'hadnt', 'has', 'hasn', 'hasnt', 'have', 'haven', 'havent', 'having', 'he', 'her', 'here', 'hers', 'herself', 'him', 'himself', 'his', 'how', 'i', 'if', 'in', 'into', 'is', 'isn', 'isnt', 'it', 'its', 'itself', 'just', 'll', 'm', 'ma', 'me', 'mightn', 'mightnt', 'more', 'most', 'mustn', 'mustnt', 'my', 'myself', 'needn', 'neednt', 'no', 'nor', 'not', 'now', 'o', 'of', 'off', 'on', 'once', 'only', 'or', 'other', 'our', 'ours', 'ourselves', 'out', 'over', 'own', 're', 's', 'same', 'shan', 'shant', 'she', 'shes', 'should', 'shouldn', 'shouldnt', 'shouldve', 'so', 'some', 'such', 't', 'than', 'that', 'thatll', 'the', 'their', 'theirs', 'them', 'themselves', 'then', 'there', 'these', 'they', 'this', 'those', 'through', 'to', 'too', 'under', 'until', 'up', 've', 'very', 'was', 'wasn', 'wasnt', 'we', 'were', 'weren', 'werent', 'what', 'when', 'where', 'which', 'while', 'who', 'whom', 'why', 'will', 'with', 'won', 'wont', 'wouldn', 'wouldnt', 'y', 'you', 'youd', 'youll', 'your', 'youre', 'yours', 'yourself', 'yourselves', 'youve'])
    )
);
```

### Example Usage
Remove stopwords and tokenize the text from a dataset of book descriptions:
```sql
SELECT 
  book_title,
  `spider2-public-data.word_vectors_us.tokenise_no_stop`(description) AS tokenised_description
FROM 
  book_catalog;
```

## `tokenise_text`

### Description
Tokenizes text by extracting words and numerical values, including handling compound numbers and ignoring punctuation and possessive apostrophes. This function is suitable for preliminary text analysis where basic tokenization is needed without the removal of stopwords.

### SQL Definition
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION `spider2-public-data`.word_vectors_us.tokenise_text(text STRING)
AS (
(

{'WORD_VECTORS_US': {'WORD_VECTORS_US': ['NATURE', 'WORD_FREQUENCIES', 'GLOVE_VECTORS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
Tables and columns relevant to the task:

- **NATURE."body"**: Contains the body text of each article; used for tokenization and vector calculation.
- **NATURE."id"**: Unique identifier for each article; to be returned in the final result.
- **NATURE."date"**: Publication date of the article; to be returned in the final result.
- **NATURE."title"**: Title of the article; to be returned in the final result.
- **GLOVE_VECTORS."word"**: Words for which GloVe vectors are available; used to obtain word vectors.
- **GLOVE_VECTORS."vector"**: The GloVe vector corresponding to each word; used in vector calculations.
- **WORD_FREQUENCIES."word"**: Words with their frequencies; used to determine weighting for each word vector.
- **WORD_FREQUENCIES."frequency"**: Frequency of each word; used to weight word vectors during calculation.

Conditions that may be used:

- Tokenize the 'body' field using `tokenise_no_stop` function to remove stopwords.
- Join tokens with `GLOVE_VECTORS` to get word vectors for each token.
- Join tokens with `WORD_FREQUENCIES` to get frequencies for weighting.
- Calculate weighted vectors for each article by dividing each dimension by the 0.4th power of its word frequency.
- Sum the weighted vectors and normalize to create a unit vector for each article.
- Perform the same steps for the query phrase.
- Compute the cosine similarity between the query vector and each article vector.

    JOIN WORD_VECTORS_US.WORD_VECTORS_US.WORD_FREQUENCIES wf
    ON gv."word" = wf."word"
    WHERE wf."frequency" < 100
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

b8f29c08-2530-4ff1-bd49-da1f483b73ed,2018-12-31,Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase,"Extended data figures and tables
Extended Data Fig. 1 Discovery of an optimal crosslinking site between PS1 and Notch-100 for formation of a stable γ-secretase–Notch complex.
a, A schematic diagram of the screening procedure for an optimal crosslinking site between human γ-secretase and Notch-100. Sixteen γ-secretase variants were generated and tested for their crosslinking efficiencies. In each variant, a specific residue from Gly111-Gln112-Leu113-Ile114 of PS1 and a specific residue from Pro1728-Pro1729-Pro1730-Pro1731 of Notch were mutated to Cys. b, Examination of crosslinking efficiency by western blot analysis. In the absence of the reducing agent DTT, the intensity ratio of the crosslinked band (PS1-NTF + Notch-100) over PS1 was estimated to reflect the crosslinking efficiency. Q112C (in PS1) and P1728C (in Notch-100) were selected as the optimal crosslinking sites. c, PS1(Q112C) does not have a pronounced effect on the cleavage of Notch-100 by human γ-secretase. The amount of NICD generated by γ-secretase with PS1(Q112C) is similar to that produced by wild-type γ-secretase. d, The presence of an methionine residue at the amino terminus of Notch-100 does not have a pronounced effect on its cleavage efficiency by γ-secretase. e, The substrate Notch-100 is crosslinked to PS1 of human γ-secretase through an engineered disulfide bond. This disulfide bond involves two mutations on the extracellular side: PS1(Q112C) and Notch(P1728C). The enzyme–substrate complex was purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration (see Methods). f, The purified γ-secretase–Notch-100 complex was visualized by SDS–PAGE with Coomassie staining. The crosslinked complex between PS1-NTF and Notch-100 can be reduced by DTT in vitro, generating free PS1-NTF. g, Analysis of the γ-secretase–Notch-100 complex by gel filtration. A representative chromatogram is shown (top), and the peak fractions were visualized by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie staining (bottom). PS1-NTF had been mostly crosslinked to Notch-100. Purification trials were repeated two times.
Extended Data Fig. 2 A flowchart for cryo-EM data processing.
The final average resolution for the entire human γ-secretase–Notch-100 complex is estimated to be 2.7 Å. For details, please refer to the Methods.
Extended Data Fig. 3 Cryo-EM analysis of the complex of human γ-secretase and Notch-100.
a, FSC curve for the 3D reconstruction of the cryo-EM map. The average resolution is estimated to be 2.7 Å on the basis of the FSC value of 0.143. b, Angular distribution of the particles used for reconstruction of the γ-secretase–Notch complex. Each cylinder represents one view and the height of the cylinder is proportional to the number of particles for that view. c, FSC curves of the refined model versus the overall 2.7 Å map that it was refined against (black); of the model refined in the first of the two independent maps used for the FSC calculation versus that same map (red); and of the model refined in the first of the two independent maps versus the second independent map (green). The small difference between the red and green curves indicates that the refinement of the atomic coordinates did not suffer from overfitting. d, Colour-coded local resolution distribution in Å of the final reconstruction as estimated by RELION-2.052.
Extended Data Fig. 4 Local cryo-EM density maps for representative regions of the γ-secretase–Notch-100 complex.
a, The local cryo-EM density maps for all nine transmembrane helices of PS1. The density for the side chains of TM2 is of sufficient quality for assignment of specific amino acids. TM6 is broken into two helices connected by a rigid coil. The sequences preceding TM7 form a β-strand in the presence of the substrate Notch-100. The contour level of the cryo-EM density for TM2 and TM6 of PS1 is 5σ. b, The local cryo-EM density maps for all seven transmembrane helices of APH-1. c, The local cryo-EM density map for the transmembrane helix of Notch-100. The cryo-EM density for the connecting loop of the transmembrane helix and the amino terminus is weak (left, 2.7 Å map, contour level 5σ), but can be improved by further classification and refinement (right, 3.3 Å map, contour level 8σ, map refers to Extended Data Fig. 8). d, The local cryo-EM density maps for the only transmembrane helix and three selected regions of NCT. e, The local cryo-EM density maps for the three transmembrane helices of PEN-2. The contour level of the cryo-EM density is 8σ, except where specifically stated in a and c.
Extended Data Fig. 5 Overall structure of the complex of human γ-secretase and Notch-100.
a, Overall structure of human γ-secretase bound to Notch-100. The structure is shown either in cartoon (cylindrical helices, top) or in surface (bottom). Glycans and lipids are displayed as sticks. Four perpendicular views are shown. b, The human γ-secre

Monocytes are one of the most important innate immune cells associated with immunopathogenesis in HIV infection, even though monocytes are poorly or not directly infected by HIV. The events that take place specifically in monocytes may contribute to the systemic immune dysfunction characterized by excessive immune activation in individuals infected with HIV-1, which correlates directly with the pathogenesis and progression of the disease1,2,3. Among newly described plasma biomarkers in HIV, plasma levels of the monocyte/macrophage activation marker, soluble CD163 (sCD163), the released form of the hemoglobin scavenger receptor in response to inflammatory signals, associate with clinical outcomes and predict all-cause mortality in HIV-1 infected individuals4,5,6,7,8. Additionally, high sCD163 levels correlate with neurocognitive impairment in HIV infection, postmortem brain pathology9, and predicts incident chronic lung, kidney and liver disease in HIV infection10.
Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is the current treatment of choice for HIV, it completely inhibits circulating viremia and partially improves health and restore CD4 + T cell counts. However, patients under therapy frequently experience the development of non-AIDS disorders including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, malignancy, and some neurological diseases11. Clinical trials aiming at reduction of chronic inflammation and the effects of cART in HIV + patients have been widely performed. Therapies focused in reducing microbial translocation12,13,14,15; co-pathogens excess16; systemic inflammation and the hypercoagulation state17,18,19,20 remain in tests. However, given the complexity and multiple factors associated with HIV infection, the use of certain therapies could reduce the immunological ability to control viral replication or activate compensatory pathways1.
Epigenetic mechanisms are defined by changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. It includes several chromatin alterations as methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination of histones or direct DNA methylation performed by specialized enzymes21. These alterations in diseases can modify host immune response by altering gene expression profile and further protein production. In the case of HIV, epigenetics are involved in regulation of viral latency22 and viral replication23. How HIV may epigenetically alter the response of innate immune cells is still unknown. Therapies aiming at modulating epigenetic enzymes are innovative strategies in the regulation not only of viral replication but more importantly the immune response against the virus and opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, common in these patients. Ongoing clinical trials against various types of cancer24 and inflammatory diseases25 show promising results in this field. In HIV infection, therapies focused on eliminating viral latency, using Vorinostat, an HDAC inhibitor are also being tested26. Once elucidated, epigenetic biomarkers could be used as targets in HIV gene therapy, aiming to reduce systemic immune activation, the central cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients in the cART era.
In this sense, the aim of this work was to characterize monocytes from HIV + patients and correlate the immune dysfunction and progression with epigenetic alterations in these cells. Here, we show that HIV impairs the function of monocytes by reducing phagocytosis and killing and inducing dysregulated production of pro-inflammatory mediators when these cells are challenged with M. tuberculosis (Mtb). Epigenetic biosignature of monocytes from HIV patients display a more activated state, that is stronger when patients are segregated according to progression.; Monocytes are one of the most important innate immune cells associated with immunopathogenesis in HIV infection, even though monocytes are poorly or not directly infected by HIV. The events that take place specifically in monocytes may contribute to the systemic immune dysfunction characterized by excessive immune activation in individuals infected with HIV-1, which correlates directly with the pathogenesis and progression of the disease1,2,3. Among newly described plasma biomarkers in HIV, plasma levels of the monocyte/macrophage activation marker, soluble CD163 (sCD163), the released form of the hemoglobin scavenger receptor in response to inflammatory signals, associate with clinical outcomes and predict all-cause mortality in HIV-1 infected individuals4,5,6,7,8.

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Please find the top 10 most relevant articles by only processing each article’s 'body' field, where each body is tokenized with no stopwords, each remaining token is turned into a GloVe-based word vector and weighted by dividing each dimension by the 0.4th power of its word frequency, then these weighted vectors are summed and normalized to get a unit vector for each article. Perform the same weighting and normalization on the query phrase 'Epigenetics and cerebral organoids: promising directions in autism spectrum disorders' and compute the cosine similarity between the query vector and each article vector. Finally, return the id, date, title, and the cosine similarity score for the top 10 articles with the highest similarity.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
id,date,title,cosine_similarity_score
id1:str,date1:DATE,title1:str,score1:float between 0 and 1
id2:str,date2:DATE,title2:str,score2:float between 0 and 1
id3:str,date3:DATE,title3:str,score3:float between 0 and 1
id4:str,date4:DATE,title4:str,score4:float between 0 and 1
id5:str,date5:DATE,title5:str,score5:float between 0 and 1
id6:str,date6:DATE,title6:str,score6:float between 0 and 1
id7:str,date7:DATE,title7:str,score7:float between 0 and 1
id8:str,date8:DATE,title8:str,score8:float between 0 and 1
id9:str,date9:DATE,title9:str,score9:float between 0 and 1
id10:str,date10:DATE,title10:str,score10:float between 0 and 1
(Attention: answer in 10 rows)
```

The table above lists the top 10 most relevant articles based on cosine similarity to the query phrase, including their `id`, `date`, `title`, and the `cosine_similarity_score`..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'WORD_VECTORS_US': {'WORD_VECTORS_US': ['NATURE', 'WORD_FREQUENCIES', 'GLOVE_VECTORS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
