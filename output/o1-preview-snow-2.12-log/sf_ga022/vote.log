After reviewing and comparing both SQL queries and their results, **I recommend using `1result.sql` as the correct answer**.

**Reasoning:**

- **Structured and Readable:** `1result.sql` uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the query into logical parts, making it easier to read and understand. Each CTE represents a step in the calculation process.

- **Efficiency:** By consolidating the data from all the weeks into the `week_events` CTE and using a `CASE` statement to assign week numbers, the query efficiently handles the data without repetitive code.

- **Scalability:** The use of a `CASE` statement for week assignment allows for easy extension if additional weeks need to be analyzed in the future. It avoids having to write separate queries for each week.

- **Performance:** `1result.sql` minimizes the use of `UNION ALL` and repetitive `JOIN` operations, which can be less efficient with larger datasets. By processing data in bulk, it can perform better, especially on large tables.

- **Consistency:** Both queries produce the same results, but `1result.sql` achieves this with a more streamlined and maintainable approach.

**Conclusion:**

Given these advantages, `1result.sql` is the preferred SQL script for calculating the weekly customer retention rate for new users in September 2018.
