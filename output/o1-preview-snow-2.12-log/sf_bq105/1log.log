2025-02-11 20:46:24 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering occurs because the column `"state_name"` does not exist in the table `DISTRACT_2015`. The error message indicates that SQL cannot find a column with that name in the specified table.

In the `DISTRACT_2015` table, the available columns are:

- `"state_number"`
- `"consecutive_number"`
- `"vehicle_number"`
- `"driver_distracted_by"`
- `"driver_distracted_by_name"`

Unlike `DISTRACT_2016`, the `DISTRACT_2015` table does not include the `"state_name"` column directly. However, the `ACCIDENT_2015` table contains both `"state_number"` and `"state_name"`, along with `"consecutive_number"`.

To obtain the state names for your query, you can join the `DISTRACT_2015` table with the `ACCIDENT_2015` table on both `"state_number"` and `"consecutive_number"`.

Here's how you can modify your query:

```sql
SELECT d."consecutive_number", a."state_name", d."driver_distracted_by_name"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.ACCIDENT_2015 a
  ON d."state_number" = a."state_number" AND d."consecutive_number" = a."consecutive_number"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Aliasing Tables**: We use `d` as an alias for `DISTRACT_2015` and `a` for `ACCIDENT_2015` for clarity.
- **Selecting Columns**:
  - `d."consecutive_number"`: The unique identifier for each accident from the distraction table.
  - `a."state_name"`: The state name from the accident table.
  - `d."driver_distracted_by_name"`: The distraction status from the distraction table.
- **Joining Tables**: We join the two tables on both `"state_number"` and `"consecutive_number"` to ensure we match records accurately.
  - `d."state_number" = a."state_number"`: Ensures we're comparing records from the same state.
  - `d."consecutive_number" = a."consecutive_number"`: Ensures we're comparing the same accident records.
- **Limiting Results**: `LIMIT 100` limits the output to 100 rows for testing purposes.

**By running this modified query, you should be able to retrieve the `state_name` along with the other desired data without encountering the error.**

---

**Additional Information:**

- **Why the Error Occurred**: The `DISTRACT_2015` table does not have the `"state_name"` column, which is why SQL reports it as an invalid identifier.
- **Data Availability**: In 2015, the dataset structure might be slightly different from 2016, requiring you to combine data from multiple tables.
- **Data Integration**: Joining tables on common keys like `"state_number"` and `"consecutive_number"` is a common practice to enrich the data and obtain additional information not present in a single table.

**If you need to perform similar queries for 2016, you might not need the join since `DISTRACT_2016` includes the `"state_name"` column. However, for consistency and to ensure all data is accurate, you may still consider joining the tables in both cases.**

2025-02-11 20:47:52 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering occurs because the column `"state_name"` does not exist directly in the table `DISTRACT_2015`. As previously noted, the `DISTRACT_2015` table contains the following columns:

- `"state_number"`
- `"consecutive_number"`
- `"vehicle_number"`
- `"driver_distracted_by"`
- `"driver_distracted_by_name"`

To include the `"state_name"` in your query results, you need to **join** the `DISTRACT_2015` table with the `ACCIDENT_2015` table, which contains both `"state_number"` and `"state_name"`.

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT d."consecutive_number", a."state_name", d."driver_distracted_by_name"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.ACCIDENT_2015 a
  ON d."state_number" = a."state_number" AND d."consecutive_number" = a."consecutive_number"
WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT IN ('Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', 'Not Reported')
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Aliasing Tables**: We use `d` for `DISTRACT_2015` and `a` for `ACCIDENT_2015`.
- **Selecting Columns**:
  - `d."consecutive_number"`: Accident identifier from `DISTRACT_2015`.
  - `a."state_name"`: State name from `ACCIDENT_2015`.
  - `d."driver_distracted_by_name"`: Distraction status from `DISTRACT_2015`.
- **Joining Tables**:
  - We join `DISTRACT_2015` (`d`) with `ACCIDENT_2015` (`a`) on both `"state_number"` and `"consecutive_number"` to ensure accurate matching of records.
- **Applying the Condition**:
  - The `WHERE` clause excludes records where `"driver_distracted_by_name"` is 'Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', or 'Not Reported'.
- **Limiting Results**:
  - `LIMIT 100` restricts the output to 100 rows for testing purposes.

**By running this corrected query, you should be able to retrieve the desired data without encountering the error.**

---

**Note on Other Queries:**

If you encounter similar errors in other queries where `"state_name"` is not directly available in the table you're querying, you would need to join with a table that contains the `"state_name"` column. Specifically:

- For `DISTRACT_2015` and `DISTRACT_2016`, join with `ACCIDENT_2015` and `ACCIDENT_2016`, respectively.
- Ensure that the join conditions are correctly specified using the common keys such as `"state_number"` and `"consecutive_number"`.

Let me know if you need further assistance with any other queries!

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Query 1**: The `"state_name"` column might not exist directly in the `DISTRACT_2016` table. To include it, we join `DISTRACT_2016` (`d`) with `ACCIDENT_2016` (`a`) using the `"state_number"` and `"consecutive_number"` columns.

2. **Query 2**: The error occurs due to case sensitivity in Snowflake when using double-quoted identifiers. If the column names in `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` are stored in uppercase (which is common in Snowflake when not using quoted identifiers during table creation), you need to adjust your query to match the case. Therefore, we changed the column names to uppercase: `"ZIPCODE"`, `"POPULATION"`, `"MINIMUM_AGE"`, `"MAXIMUM_AGE"`, `"GENDER"`.

3. **Query 3**: Similar to Query 2, we adjusted the column names to uppercase to match the actual column names in the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table: `"ZIPCODE"`, `"STATE_NAME"`.

4. **Query 4**: Adjusted the column names in both tables to uppercase to match the actual column names. Ensure that the join condition uses the correct cases: `p."ZIPCODE" = z."ZIPCODE"`.

5. **Query 5**: Since `"state_name"` doesn't exist directly in `DISTRACT_2015`, we join with `ACCIDENT_2015` to obtain it. The join is performed on `"state_number"` and `"consecutive_number"`. The `GROUP BY` clause uses `a."state_name"`.

6. **Query 6**: Similar to Query 5, corrected by joining `DISTRACT_2016` with `ACCIDENT_2016` to include `"state_name"`. The join ensures we have the correct state names for grouping.

7. **Query 7**: The `ACCIDENT_2015` table may not have the `"state_name"` column directly. We join with `US_STATES_AREA` (`s`) using `a."state_number"` converted to `VARCHAR` to match `s."state_fips_code"`. This allows us to include `"state_name"` in the results.

8. **Query 8**: Similar correction as Query 7 but applied to the `ACCIDENT_2016` table.

---

**General Notes:**

- **Case Sensitivity**: Snowflake is case-sensitive when using double-quoted identifiers. Ensure that the column names in your queries match the exact case of the column names in the database schema. If the columns are stored in uppercase, you must reference them using uppercase letters within double quotes.

- **Column Existence**: If a column does not exist directly in a table, you can retrieve it by performing a `JOIN` with another table that contains the desired column.

- **Aliases**: Using table aliases (e.g., `d` for `DISTRACT_2016`) helps to simplify your queries and makes them more readable, especially when dealing with multiple tables.

- **JOIN Conditions**: Always ensure that your join conditions correctly match the keys from both tables to accurately merge the data.

- **LIMIT Clause**: Including `LIMIT 100` is useful for testing and previewing a subset of your results without processing the entire dataset.

2025-02-11 20:51:25 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 27
invalid identifier 'P."population"'
```

occurs because the column `"population"` does not exist in the table alias `p` as referenced. In **Snowflake**, when you enclose identifiers in double quotes, they become case-sensitive. This means you need to match the exact case of the column names as they are defined in the table schema.

In the table `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`, the columns are likely defined in uppercase. Therefore, you should adjust your query to use uppercase column names within the double quotes.

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT z."STATE_NAME", SUM(p."POPULATION") AS total_population
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p."ZIPCODE" = z."ZIPCODE"
GROUP BY z."STATE_NAME"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Column Names in Uppercase**: Changed `p."population"` to `p."POPULATION"` and `p."zipcode"` to `p."ZIPCODE"` to match the case in the table schema.
- **Join Condition**: Ensured that both sides of the `ON` clause use the correct case for `"ZIPCODE"`.
- **Grouping and Selecting**: Updated `z."state_name"` to `z."STATE_NAME"` in both the `SELECT` clause and the `GROUP BY` clause.

**Why This Fixes the Error:**

- **Case Sensitivity with Quoted Identifiers**: In Snowflake, when you use double quotes around identifiers (e.g., `"POPULATION"`), it preserves the case, and you must reference it exactly as it was defined. Unquoted identifiers are converted to uppercase by default.
- **Matching Schema Definitions**: By adjusting the column names to uppercase, you ensure that they match the column names as they exist in the table, preventing the "invalid identifier" error.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Column Name Reference**: If you're unsure about the exact case of the column names, you can query the information schema or use a `DESCRIBE TABLE` command to list all columns and their cases.
  ```sql
  DESCRIBE TABLE NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010;
  ```
- **Avoiding Case Sensitivity Issues**: To simplify and avoid such case-related issues, you can create tables and columns without using double quotes around identifiers, allowing Snowflake to treat them as uppercase automatically. Alternatively, consistently use uppercase for all identifiers when using double quotes.

2025-02-11 20:52:22 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
invalid identifier 'Z.STATE_NAME'
```

occurs because the column `"state_name"` is not recognized in the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table as referenced. In **Snowflake**, when you use double quotes around identifiers, they become **case-sensitive**. This means that `"state_name"` and `"STATE_NAME"` are considered different identifiers.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Case Sensitivity**: The column in `ZIPCODE_AREA` may be stored as `"STATE_NAME"` (uppercase), and referencing it as `"state_name"` (lowercase) leads to an invalid identifier error.
   
2. **Column Name Mismatch**: The column might have a different name than expected.

**Solution:**

1. **Verify the Column Names and Their Cases:**

   - Use the following command to check the exact column names in `ZIPCODE_AREA`:

     ```sql
     DESCRIBE TABLE NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA;
     ```
   
   - This will list all columns with their exact cases. Confirm if the column is `"STATE_NAME"` or `"state_name"`.

2. **Adjust the Column Names in Your Query:**

   - **Option A**: Use the correct case with double quotes, matching the column names in the table.

     ```sql
     SELECT z."STATE_NAME", SUM(p."POPULATION") AS total_population
     FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
     JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
       ON p."ZIPCODE" = z."ZIPCODE"
     GROUP BY z."STATE_NAME"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

     **Explanation**:

     - Changed `z."state_name"` to `z."STATE_NAME"` to match the column name's case in `ZIPCODE_AREA`.
     - Ensured that all column names use the correct case within double quotes.
   
   - **Option B**: Remove double quotes to allow Snowflake to handle the case automatically (identifiers are converted to uppercase by default).

     ```sql
     SELECT z.STATE_NAME, SUM(p.POPULATION) AS total_population
     FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
     JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
       ON p.ZIPCODE = z.ZIPCODE
     GROUP BY z.STATE_NAME
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

     **Explanation**:

     - Removed double quotes around column names.
     - Snowflake automatically folds unquoted identifiers to uppercase, matching default column naming conventions.

**Why This Fixes the Error:**

- **Case Sensitivity with Quoted Identifiers**: In Snowflake, identifiers enclosed in double quotes are case-sensitive. If the column is stored as `"STATE_NAME"`, referencing it as `"state_name"` won't work.
  
- **Unquoted Identifiers Default to Uppercase**: By removing the double quotes, the identifiers are converted to uppercase, matching the default case of column names if they were created without quotes or in uppercase.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Consistency**: Ensure that all column names in your query match the case of the columns in the database.
  
- **Best Practices**:

  - Use unquoted identifiers when possible to avoid case sensitivity issues.
  - If you must use quotes (e.g., for column names with spaces or special characters), always match the case exactly as in the table schema.

**Example Using the Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT z."STATE_NAME", SUM(p."POPULATION") AS total_population
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p."ZIPCODE" = z."ZIPCODE"
GROUP BY z."STATE_NAME"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Or Without Quotes:**

```sql
SELECT z.STATE_NAME, SUM(p.POPULATION) AS total_population
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p.ZIPCODE = z.ZIPCODE
GROUP BY z.STATE_NAME
LIMIT 100;
```

2025-02-11 20:53:35 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
invalid identifier 'D."state_name"'
```

occurs because the column `"state_name"` does not exist in the table `DISTRACT_2015` (aliased as `d`). When you attempt to select `d."state_name"`, SQL cannot find this column in the `DISTRACT_2015` table.

---

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you need to join the `DISTRACT_2015` table with another table that contains the `"state_name"` column. The `ACCIDENT_2015` table includes both `"state_name"` and `"state_number"`, and shares the `"consecutive_number"` with `DISTRACT_2015`. By joining these tables, you can access the `"state_name"` in your query.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT a."state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS distracted_accidents
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.ACCIDENT_2015 a
  ON d."state_number" = a."state_number" AND d."consecutive_number" = a."consecutive_number"
WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT IN ('Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', 'Not Reported')
GROUP BY a."state_name"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Aliasing Tables:**
  - `d` is an alias for `DISTRACT_2015`.
  - `a` is an alias for `ACCIDENT_2015`.
  
- **Selecting Columns:**
  - `a."state_name"`: Retrieves the state name from the `ACCIDENT_2015` table.
  - `COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS distracted_accidents`: Counts the number of unique accidents involving driver distraction.
  
- **Joining Tables:**
  - The `JOIN` combines records from `DISTRACT_2015` and `ACCIDENT_2015` where both the `"state_number"` and `"consecutive_number"` match. This ensures that we're linking the correct accident records between the two tables.
  
- **Filtering Records:**
  - The `WHERE` clause excludes records where `"driver_distracted_by_name"` is 'Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', or 'Not Reported', focusing only on accidents caused by driver distraction.
  
- **Grouping Results:**
  - `GROUP BY a."state_name"` groups the results by state, allowing us to count the number of distracted accidents per state.
  
- **Limiting Output:**
  - `LIMIT 100` restricts the result set to the first 100 rows, which is useful for testing or previewing the data.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Column Availability:**
  - The `"state_name"` column is not present in the `DISTRACT_2015` table, which is why the original query failed. By joining with `ACCIDENT_2015`, you gain access to the `"state_name"` for each accident.
  
- **Case Sensitivity:**
  - Ensure that you use the correct case for column names when enclosing them in double quotes. Snowflake treats quoted identifiers as case-sensitive.
  
- **Consistent Aliasing:**
  - Using clear aliases (`d` and `a`) makes the query more readable and helps prevent confusion between columns from different tables.
  
- **Data Integrity:**
  - Joining on both `"state_number"` and `"consecutive_number"` ensures that you are accurately matching the records corresponding to each accident within the same state.

---

By applying this corrected query, you should be able to retrieve the number of distracted driving accidents per state without encountering the 'invalid identifier' error.

**Let me know if you need further assistance with this query or have any other questions!**

Task: According to the 2015 and 2016 accident and driver distraction, and excluding cases where the driver’s distraction status is recorded as 'Not Distracted,' 'Unknown if Distracted,' or 'Not Reported,' how many traffic accidents per 100,000 people were caused by driver distraction in each U.S. state for those two years, based on 2010 census population data, and which five states each year had the highest rates?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the 2015 and 2016 accident data, excluding cases where the driver’s distraction status is recorded as 'Not Distracted,' 'Unknown if Distracted,' or 'Not Reported,' the five U.S. states each year with the highest rates of traffic accidents caused by driver distraction per 100,000 people (using 2010 census population data) are as follows:

```csv
Year,State,Accidents_per_100k
2015,State1:str,rate1:float
2015,State2:str,rate2:float
2015,State3:str,rate3:float
2015,State4:str,rate4:float
2015,State5:str,rate5:float
2016,State1:str,rate1:float
2016,State2:str,rate2:float
2016,State3:str,rate3:float
2016,State4:str,rate4:float
2016,State5:str,rate5:float
(Attention: answer in ten rows)
```

Each row represents one of the top five states for the specified year, along with the calculated rate of distraction-related accidents per 100,000 people..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

**Explanation:**

The error was caused by mixing quoted and unquoted identifiers in Snowflake. In Snowflake:

- Unquoted identifiers are automatically uppercased and are not case-sensitive.
- Quoted identifiers are case-sensitive and must match exactly, including case.

To fix the issue:

- Ensure that table aliases (`p`, `z`, `a`, `d`, `da`, `ps`) are unquoted and referenced consistently without quotes.
- Enclose all column names in double quotes, matching the exact case as defined in the database schema.
- Avoid double-quoting the table aliases when defining or referencing them if they are not case-sensitive.

This ensures that the identifiers are correctly recognized by Snowflake, resolving the `invalid identifier` errors.

**Explanation:**

To fix the `invalid identifier 'P."population"'` error, we need to ensure that:

1. **Consistent Quoting and Case Sensitivity:**
   - Since the table and column names are double-quoted and created in lowercase, they are case-sensitive.
   - Ensure all table aliases and column references are correctly double-quoted and use the exact case as in the schema.

2. **Table Aliases:**
   - Use unquoted aliases to avoid case sensitivity issues, or consistently quote the aliases.
   - In the query above, we use unquoted aliases (`p`, `z`, etc.) and reference them consistently without double quotes.

3. **Column References:**
   - Column names are double-quoted and case-sensitive; ensure they match exactly.
   - For example, use `p."population"` instead of `p.population` to match the column name `"population"`.

By applying these corrections, the query should run without the `invalid identifier` error.
