2025-02-11 20:46:41 - root - INFO - It appears that the error you're encountering is due to the `"state_name"` column not existing in the `DISTRACT_2015` table. This is confirmed by the SQL error message:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 23
invalid identifier '"state_name"'
```

### Explanation:

- **Possible Cause**: The column `"state_name"` is not present in the `DISTRACT_2015` table.
- Although the `DISTRACT_2016` table includes a `"state_name"` column (as indicated in its DDL), the `DISTRACT_2015` table may not have this column.

### Solution:

#### 1. Verify the Columns in `DISTRACT_2015`:

First, let's check the structure of the `DISTRACT_2015` table to confirm the available columns.

**SQL Query to List Columns in `DISTRACT_2015`:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015
LIMIT 1;
```

This will display the columns in the table. If you find that `"state_name"` is missing, you'll need to adjust your query accordingly.

#### 2. Modify the Query to Exclude `"state_name"`:

Since `"state_name"` is not present, you can modify your query to use only `"state_number"`. Here's the adjusted query:

```sql
SELECT "state_number", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "total_accidents"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015
GROUP BY "state_number"
ORDER BY "total_accidents" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

This query should execute without errors and provide the total accidents per `state_number`.

#### 3. Map `state_number` to `state_name` Using Another Table:

If you need the state names, you can join `DISTRACT_2015` with another table that contains the mapping between `state_number` and `state_name`. The `US_STATES_AREA` table in the `UTILITY_US` schema contains such information.

**Adjusted Query with a JOIN:**

```sql
SELECT d."state_number", u."state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "total_accidents"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
  ON d."state_number" = u."state_fips_code"
GROUP BY d."state_number", u."state_name"
ORDER BY "total_accidents" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the data types of `d."state_number"` and `u."state_fips_code"` match. You may need to cast one to match the other.
- The `US_STATES_AREA` table's `"state_fips_code"` should correspond to the `"state_number"` in the `DISTRACT_2015` table.
  
#### 4. Handle Cases Where State Codes Are Strings:

If the state codes in `US_STATES_AREA` are strings and `state_number` is numeric, you can cast the numeric code to a string:

```sql
SELECT d."state_number", u."state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "total_accidents"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
  ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
GROUP BY d."state_number", u."state_name"
ORDER BY "total_accidents" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

- `LPAD` is used to pad the state number with a leading zero if necessary (since FIPS codes are typically two-digit strings).

#### 5. Proceed with Further Analysis:

Once you've resolved the error and obtained the correct accident counts per state, you can continue with your analysis to calculate accidents per 100,000 people.

**Sample Query to Calculate Accidents per 100,000 People:**

```sql
WITH distract_accidents AS (
  SELECT d."state_number", u."state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
  LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
    ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
  WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT IN ('Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', 'Not Reported')
  GROUP BY d."state_number", u."state_name"
),

state_populations AS (
  SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."population") AS "state_population"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
    ON z."zipcode" = p."zipcode"
  GROUP BY z."state_name"
)

SELECT da."state_name",
       (da."distracted_accidents"::FLOAT / sp."state_population") * 100000 AS "accidents_per_100k"
FROM distract_accidents da
JOIN state_populations sp ON da."state_name" = sp."state_name"
ORDER BY "accidents_per_100k" DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

- This query calculates the rate of distraction-related accidents per 100,000 people for each state and lists the top five states.

### Summary:

- **Issue**: The `"state_name"` column does not exist in `DISTRACT_2015`.
- **Solution**: Use `"state_number"` or join with another table that contains state names.
- **Next Steps**: Adjust your queries accordingly and proceed with your analysis.

2025-02-11 20:48:52 - root - INFO - Certainly! Here are the corrected SQL queries, each provided in ```sql``` format:

---

**1. Corrected Query for `DISTRACT_2015` Total Accidents by State:**

Since the `"state_name"` column does not exist in the `DISTRACT_2015` table, we need to join with the `US_STATES_AREA` table to obtain the state names.

```sql
SELECT d."state_number", u."state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "total_accidents"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
  ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
GROUP BY d."state_number", u."state_name"
ORDER BY "total_accidents" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**2. Corrected Query for `DISTRACT_2015` Distracted Accidents by State:**

Again, we'll join with `US_STATES_AREA` to get the `"state_name"`.

```sql
SELECT d."state_number", u."state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
  ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
  AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
  AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
GROUP BY d."state_number", u."state_name"
ORDER BY "distracted_accidents" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**3. Corrected Query for Calculating Accidents per 100,000 People in 2015:**

We'll modify the query to join `DISTRACT_2015` with `US_STATES_AREA` to get the state names and then proceed with the calculation.

```sql
WITH distract_accidents AS (
  SELECT d."state_number", u."state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
  LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
    ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
  WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
    AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
    AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
  GROUP BY d."state_number", u."state_name"
),
state_populations AS (
  SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."population") AS "state_population"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
    ON z."zipcode" = p."zipcode"
  GROUP BY z."state_name"
)
SELECT da."state_name",
       (da."distracted_accidents"::FLOAT / sp."state_population") * 100000 AS "accidents_per_100k"
FROM distract_accidents da
JOIN state_populations sp ON da."state_name" = sp."state_name"
ORDER BY "accidents_per_100k" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**4. Query for `DISTRACT_2016` Total Accidents by State (No Correction Needed):**

The `"state_name"` column exists in `DISTRACT_2016`, so the original query should work without errors.

```sql
SELECT "state_number", "state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "total_accidents"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2016
GROUP BY "state_number", "state_name"
ORDER BY "total_accidents" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**5. Query for `DISTRACT_2016` Distracted Accidents by State (No Correction Needed):**

This query also remains valid as is.

```sql
SELECT "state_number", "state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2016
WHERE "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
  AND "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
  AND "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
GROUP BY "state_number", "state_name"
ORDER BY "distracted_accidents" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**6. Query for Population by Zipcode (No Correction Needed):**

This query should work as intended.

```sql
SELECT "zipcode", SUM("population") AS "total_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY "zipcode"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**7. Query for State Populations (No Correction Needed):**

Assuming the `"state_name"` exists in `ZIPCODE_AREA`, this query is valid.

```sql
SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."population") AS "state_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
  ON z."zipcode" = p."zipcode"
GROUP BY z."state_name"
ORDER BY "state_population" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**8. Query for State FIPS Codes and Names (No Correction Needed):**

This query remains correct.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "state_fips_code", "state_name"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **For Queries 1, 2, and 3**, the corrections involve joining with the `US_STATES_AREA` table to retrieve the `"state_name"` since it's not present in the `DISTRACT_2015` table.
- **For Queries 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8**, no corrections are needed as the columns referenced exist in the respective tables, and no errors have been reported.

---

**Note on the Error:**

The error you encountered was due to the absence of the `"state_name"` column in the `DISTRACT_2015` table. By introducing a join with the `US_STATES_AREA` table, we can include the `"state_name"` in our queries.

---

**Additional Information:**

- **Casting and Padding State Numbers:** The `state_number` in `DISTRACT_2015` is likely an integer, while the `state_fips_code` in `US_STATES_AREA` is a string (possibly with leading zeros). Using `LPAD` and `CAST`, we ensure the state codes match for the join.

  ```sql
  LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
  ```

- **Aliases:** We use table aliases (`d` for `DISTRACT_2015`, `u` for `US_STATES_AREA`, `z` for `ZIPCODE_AREA`, `p` for `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`) to make the queries more readable.

### Explanation of the Error:

- **Cause of the Error**: The error `'NoneType' object is not an iterator` suggests that the SQL query is referencing a column or object that does not exist, causing the database engine to return `None` where an iterable object is expected.
- **Specific Issue**: In this case, the column `"state_name"` does not exist in the `DISTRACT_2015` table. As shown in your previous query results for `DISTRACT_2015`, the columns available are:

  ```
  "state_number", "consecutive_number", "vehicle_number", "driver_distracted_by", "driver_distracted_by_name"
  ```

- **Consequence**: Referencing a non-existent column in the `SELECT` or `GROUP BY` clauses leads to the error.

### Solution:

To resolve this error, you'll need to adjust your query by either:

1. **Removing `"state_name"` from the Query**:

   If you don't need the state names in your results, you can modify your query to exclude `"state_name"`.

   ```sql
   SELECT "state_number", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015
   WHERE "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
     AND "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
     AND "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
   GROUP BY "state_number"
   ORDER BY "distracted_accidents" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   This query will provide the counts of distracted accidents per `state_number`.

2. **Joining with the `US_STATES_AREA` Table to Get `"state_name"`**:

   If you want to include state names in your results, you need to join the `DISTRACT_2015` table with another table that contains the state names corresponding to each `state_number`. The `US_STATES_AREA` table in the `UTILITY_US` schema contains such information.

   **Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     d."state_number",
     u."state_name",
     COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
   LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
     ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
   WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
     AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
     AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
   GROUP BY d."state_number", u."state_name"
   ORDER BY "distracted_accidents" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **Table Aliases**: We use `d` as an alias for `DISTRACT_2015` and `u` for `US_STATES_AREA`.
   - **Joining Tables**: The `LEFT JOIN` allows us to include all records from `DISTRACT_2015` and match records from `US_STATES_AREA` where available.
   - **Matching State Codes**:
     - The `state_number` in `DISTRACT_2015` is a numeric value.
     - The `state_fips_code` in `US_STATES_AREA` is a string, possibly with leading zeros.
     - We use `CAST` to convert `state_number` to a string and `LPAD` to pad it with leading zeros to ensure it matches the format of `state_fips_code`.
       ```sql
       LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
       ```
   - **Group By Clause**: We include both `d."state_number"` and `u."state_name"` in the `GROUP BY` clause.
   - **Select Clause**: We select `u."state_name"` to include the state names in the results.

### Testing the Corrected Query:

Please run the corrected query to ensure it executes without errors and provides the desired results.

**Example Execution:**

```sql
SELECT
  d."state_number",
  u."state_name",
  COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
  ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
  AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
  AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
GROUP BY d."state_number", u."state_name"
ORDER BY "distracted_accidents" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### Additional Considerations:

- **Data Verification**: Ensure that the `US_STATES_AREA` table contains accurate mappings of `state_fips_code` to `state_name`.
- **Leading Zeros**: The `state_fips_code` may have leading zeros (e.g., '01' for Alabama). Using `LPAD` with a length of 2 ensures correct matching.
- **Alternative State Names**: If there are discrepancies in state names between tables, verify that join conditions are correct.

### Summary:

- **Error Cause**: The absence of `"state_name"` in the `DISTRACT_2015` table causes the error.
- **Solution**: Modify the query to either exclude `"state_name"` or join with a table that contains the state names.
- **Corrected Query Provided**: The adjusted query includes a `LEFT JOIN` with `US_STATES_AREA` to obtain state names.

2025-02-11 20:49:58 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `"state_name"` column does not exist in the `DISTRACT_2015` table. This is why you receive the error:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 23
invalid identifier '"state_name"'
```

### Explanation:

- **Cause of the Error**: The `DISTRACT_2015` table only contains `"state_number"` but not `"state_name"`. Referencing `"state_name"` directly from this table results in an invalid identifier error.

### Solution:

To include the state names in your query, you need to join the `DISTRACT_2015` table with another table that contains the mapping between state numbers and state names. The `US_STATES_AREA` table in the `UTILITY_US` schema contains this information.

Here's how you can modify your query to resolve the error:

```sql
SELECT
  d."state_number",
  u."state_name",
  COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
  ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
  AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
  AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
GROUP BY d."state_number", u."state_name"
ORDER BY "distracted_accidents" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### Breakdown of the Corrected Query:

- **Table Aliases**:
  - `d` refers to `DISTRACT_2015`.
  - `u` refers to `US_STATES_AREA`.

- **Joining Tables**:
  - We perform a `LEFT JOIN` between `DISTRACT_2015` and `US_STATES_AREA` to bring in the `"state_name"` associated with each `"state_number"`.
  - The join condition matches the `"state_number"` from `DISTRACT_2015` with the `"state_fips_code"` from `US_STATES_AREA`.
  
- **Matching State Codes**:
  - `d."state_number"` is a numeric value (e.g., `1` for Alabama).
  - `u."state_fips_code"` is likely a two-character string that may have leading zeros (e.g., `'01'` for Alabama).
  - To match these, we convert `d."state_number"` to a string, and use `LPAD` to pad it with a leading zero if necessary:
    ```sql
    LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
    ```
    
- **Select Clause**:
  - We select both `d."state_number"` and `u."state_name"` to include them in the results.
  
- **Where Clause**:
  - We exclude records where `"driver_distracted_by_name"` is `'Not Distracted'`, `'Unknown if Distracted'`, or `'Not Reported'` by using `NOT ILIKE` with the appropriate patterns.

- **Group By Clause**:
  - We group by `d."state_number"` and `u."state_name"` to aggregate the counts correctly.

### Steps to Resolve the Error:

1. **Remove the Direct Reference to `"state_name"`**:
   - Since `"state_name"` doesn't exist in `DISTRACT_2015`, we cannot reference it directly.

2. **Join with `US_STATES_AREA` to Get `"state_name"`**:
   - By joining with `US_STATES_AREA`, we bring in the `"state_name"` corresponding to each `"state_number"`.

3. **Ensure State Codes Match**:
   - Use `LPAD` and `CAST` to match the numeric `state_number` with the string `state_fips_code` that may have leading zeros.

### Additional Notes:

- **Casing and Whitespace**:
  - Ensure that there are no extra spaces or mismatches in casing when matching state codes.
  
- **Verify the Presence of Data**:
  - If after making these changes you still encounter issues, verify that both tables contain the expected data.

### Alternative if You Only Need State Numbers:

If including the state names is not essential, and you can work with state numbers alone, you can simplify your query:

```sql
SELECT
  "state_number",
  COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015
WHERE "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
  AND "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
  AND "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
GROUP BY "state_number"
ORDER BY "distracted_accidents" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

This version removes the need for a join and should execute without errors.

### Conclusion:

By joining `DISTRACT_2015` with `US_STATES_AREA` and correctly matching the state codes, you can include the state names in your query results and avoid the `invalid identifier '"state_name"'` error.

2025-02-11 20:51:16 - root - INFO - I see that you're encountering an error when running the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "zipcode", SUM("population") AS "total_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY "zipcode"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Error Message:**

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
invalid identifier '"zipcode"'
```

### Explanation:

The error `'invalid identifier '"zipcode"'` indicates that the column `"zipcode"` does not exist in the table `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` within the `CENSUS_BUREAU_USA` schema.

**Even though the DDL provided earlier shows that `"zipcode"` is a column in `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`, it's possible that in the actual database, the column names are different or have been altered.**

### Steps to Resolve the Error:

#### 1. Verify the Columns in `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`:

To confirm the exact column names in the table, you can retrieve the column list using one of the following methods.

**Option A: Use `SELECT *` to View Column Names**

Run the following query to see all columns:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
LIMIT 1;
```

This will display the first row of the table and show all column names. Examine the output to identify the correct column name for ZIP codes.

**Option B: Use Information Schema to Get Column Names**

You can query the information schema to get the list of columns for the table:

```sql
SELECT "column_name"
FROM "NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS"."INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."COLUMNS"
WHERE "table_schema" = 'CENSUS_BUREAU_USA'
  AND "table_name" = 'POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010';
```

This will return all column names in the `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` table.

#### 2. Identify the Correct Column Name:

Common alternative names for ZIP code columns include:

- `"zip_code"`
- `"zipcode_tabulation_area"`
- `"zcta5"`
- `"geo_id"`

Based on the structure of census data, it's possible that the ZIP code is stored in a column named `"geo_id"` or similar.

#### 3. Adjust the Query with the Correct Column Name:

Once you've identified the correct column name for the ZIP code, modify your query accordingly.

**Example: If the Column is Named `"geo_id"`**

If the ZIP code is stored in the `"geo_id"` column, which might contain a prefix (e.g., '86000US' followed by the ZIP code), you might need to extract the ZIP code.

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING("geo_id", 8) AS "zipcode", SUM("population") AS "total_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY SUBSTRING("geo_id", 8)
LIMIT 100;
```

- Here, `SUBSTRING("geo_id", 8)` extracts the ZIP code from the `geo_id` starting from the 8th character.

**Example: If the Column is Named `"zip_code"`**

```sql
SELECT "zip_code", SUM("population") AS "total_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY "zip_code"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### 4. Verify Data Types and Formats:

Ensure that the column you're using for ZIP codes contains valid ZIP code data and is of an appropriate data type (`VARCHAR`).

### Updated Query:

Assuming the ZIP code is stored in the `"geo_id"` column and requires extraction:

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING("geo_id", 8) AS "zipcode", SUM("population") AS "total_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY SUBSTRING("geo_id", 8)
LIMIT 100;
```

### Additional Notes:

- **Data Consistency**: Always ensure that the data you are querying is consistent and matches your expectations. Sometimes, data may change, or column names may be updated.
- **Column Names**: When working with large databases or unfamiliar schemas, it's a good practice to verify column names using `DESCRIBE` statements or querying the information schema.

### Conclusion:

The error occurs because the column `"zipcode"` does not exist in the `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` table. By verifying the actual column names in the table and adjusting your query accordingly, you should be able to resolve the error.

---

**Corrected Query (Based on Column `"geo_id"`):**

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING("geo_id", 8) AS "zipcode", SUM("population") AS "total_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY SUBSTRING("geo_id", 8)
LIMIT 100;
```

```

**Error Message:**

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
invalid identifier '"zipcode"'
```

### Explanation:

In Snowflake, object identifiers (such as table names and column names) are case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes. This means you must use the exact case as it was defined in the database schema. If the column `ZIPCODE` was created without double quotes, it is stored in uppercase by default.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Case Sensitivity Issue:**
   - The column might be defined as `"ZIPCODE"` (uppercase), and referencing it as `"zipcode"` (lowercase) causes the error.

2. **Column Does Not Exist:**
   - The column `zipcode` might not exist in the table, or it could be named differently.

### Solution:

#### 1. Verify the Exact Column Names and Their Cases:

Run the following command to list all columns in the table along with their exact names and cases:

```sql
DESC TABLE NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010;
```

This will display all column names, types, and other details. Look for the exact name of the column that contains the ZIP code.

#### 2. Adjust Your Query with Correct Column Names:

- **If the column is named `"ZIPCODE"` (uppercase), update your query as follows:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "ZIPCODE", SUM("POPULATION") AS "total_population"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
  GROUP BY "ZIPCODE"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **If the columns were created without double quotes, they are stored in uppercase by default. You can write your query without double quotes and use uppercase identifiers:**

  ```sql
  SELECT ZIPCODE, SUM(POPULATION) AS TOTAL_POPULATION
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
  GROUP BY ZIPCODE
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

#### 3. Check for Alternative Column Names:

If after checking, you find that the ZIP code is stored under a different column name, such as `"geo_id"` or `"zipcode_tabulation_area"`, adjust your query accordingly.

- **Example using `"geo_id"`:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "geo_id" AS "zipcode", SUM("population") AS "total_population"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
  GROUP BY "geo_id"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **If `"geo_id"` contains prefixes and you need to extract the ZIP code:**

  ```sql
  SELECT SUBSTRING("geo_id", 8, 5) AS "zipcode", SUM("population") AS "total_population"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
  GROUP BY SUBSTRING("geo_id", 8, 5)
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

  This assumes that the ZIP code starts at the 8th character and is 5 characters long.

### Example of Adjusted Query:

Assuming the column is stored as `"ZIPCODE"` in uppercase, the adjusted query would be:

```sql
SELECT "ZIPCODE", SUM("POPULATION") AS "total_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY "ZIPCODE"
LIMIT 100;
```

Or without double quotes:

```sql
SELECT ZIPCODE, SUM(POPULATION) AS TOTAL_POPULATION
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY ZIPCODE
LIMIT 100;
```

### Additional Tips:

- **Consistency in Identifier Usage:**
  - If you choose to use double quotes, ensure that you consistently use the exact case matching the column definitions.
  - If you prefer case-insensitive identifiers, omit the double quotes and write the identifiers in uppercase.

- **Understanding Snowflake Identifier Rules:**
  - Unquoted identifiers are case-insensitive and automatically converted to uppercase.
  - Quoted identifiers are case-sensitive and must match the exact case used during object creation.

### Conclusion:

The error occurs because the column name `"zipcode"` you're referencing does not exactly match the column name in the table due to case sensitivity or naming differences. By verifying the exact column names and adjusting your query to use the correct identifiers and casing, you should be able to resolve the error.

SELECT "zipcode", SUM("population") AS "total_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY "zipcode"
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation

The error message indicates that the column `"zipcode"` does not exist in the table `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`. Even though the DDL provided earlier shows a column named `"zipcode"`, it's possible that:

- The actual column name in the database is different (e.g., different casing or spelling).
- The column was created without quotes and is stored in uppercase by default.
- The `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` table structure has changed since the DDL was provided.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

#### 1. Verify the Actual Column Names in the Table

To identify the correct column names in the `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` table, you can use one of the following methods:

##### Option A: Use `DESCRIBE TABLE`

```sql
DESC TABLE NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010;
```

This command will list all the columns in the table with their exact names and data types.

##### Option B: Use `SHOW COLUMNS`

```sql
SHOW COLUMNS IN TABLE NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010;
```

##### Option C: Select All Columns

```sql
SELECT *
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
LIMIT 1;
```

This will display all column names and the first row of data.

#### 2. Adjust Your Query Based on the Actual Column Names

After identifying the correct column names, update your query accordingly.

**Common Scenarios:**

- **Column Names in Uppercase:** If the table was created without quoting column names, they are stored in uppercase by default. Try using uppercase column names without double quotes.

  ```sql
  SELECT ZIPCODE, SUM(POPULATION) AS TOTAL_POPULATION
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
  GROUP BY ZIPCODE
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Different Column Name:** The ZIP code might be stored in a different column, such as `"geo_id"` or `"ZCTA"`.

  **Example Using `GEO_ID`:**

  If the column is named `"GEO_ID"`, and it contains the ZIP code prefixed with other characters (e.g., '86000US' + ZIP code), you can extract the ZIP code using `SUBSTRING`.

  ```sql
  SELECT SUBSTRING(GEO_ID, 8) AS ZIPCODE, SUM(POPULATION) AS TOTAL_POPULATION
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
  GROUP BY SUBSTRING(GEO_ID, 8)
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

  **Example Using `ZCTA`:**

  If there's a column named `"ZCTA"` (ZIP Code Tabulation Area), use:

  ```sql
  SELECT ZCTA, SUM(POPULATION) AS TOTAL_POPULATION
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
  GROUP BY ZCTA
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

#### 3. Handle Case Sensitivity in Snowflake

In Snowflake:

- **Unquoted Identifiers:** Not case-sensitive and converted to uppercase.
- **Quoted Identifiers:** Case-sensitive and must match exactly.

**If the Column is Unquoted (Stored in Uppercase):**

Try using the column name without quotes and in uppercase.

```sql
SELECT ZIPCODE, SUM(POPULATION) AS TOTAL_POPULATION
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY ZIPCODE
LIMIT 100;
```

**If the Column is Quoted (Case-Sensitive):**

Ensure you're using the exact case as stored in the database. For example, if the column is `"ZipCode"`, you must reference it exactly as `"ZipCode"`.

```sql
SELECT "ZipCode", SUM("Population") AS "total_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY "ZipCode"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### 4. Example Adjusted Queries

**Option 1: Using `ZIPCODE` in Uppercase Without Quotes**

```sql
SELECT ZIPCODE, SUM(POPULATION) AS TOTAL_POPULATION
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY ZIPCODE
LIMIT 100;
```

**Option 2: Using `GEO_ID` and Extracting ZIP Codes**

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(GEO_ID, 8, 5) AS ZIPCODE, SUM(POPULATION) AS TOTAL_POPULATION
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
GROUP BY SUBSTRING(GEO_ID, 8, 5)
LIMIT 100;
```

#### 5. Verify the Adjusted Query

After adjusting the query, run it to see if it executes without errors. If you still encounter issues, please share the exact column names from the `DESC TABLE` command so we can help you tailor the query precisely.

### Summary

- **Error Cause:** The column `"zipcode"` does not exist in the table with that exact name and case.
- **Solution:** Verify the exact column names and adjust the query to use the correct identifiers, considering case sensitivity.
- **Next Steps:** Use `DESC TABLE` to list the columns and modify your query accordingly.

### Additional Assistance

If you provide the output of:

```sql
DESC TABLE NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010;
```

I can help you adjust the query based on the actual column names.

2025-02-11 20:53:43 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering an error in your SQL query due to invalid column identifiers. Let's address the error step by step to help you resolve it.

---

### **Error Message:**

```
000904 (42000): 01ba5424-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010e3a32: SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 27
invalid identifier 'P."population"'
```

### **Explanation:**

The error indicates that the column `"population"` in the alias `p` (which refers to the table `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`) is not recognized. This could be due to:

1. **Column Name Differences:** The column does not exist in the table, or it's named differently.
2. **Case Sensitivity Issues:** In Snowflake, quoted identifiers are case-sensitive.

---

### **Steps to Resolve the Error:**

#### **1. Verify the Exact Column Names in `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`:**

**Run the following command to list all columns in the table:**

```sql
DESC TABLE NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010;
```

**Alternatively, you can view a sample of the data:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
LIMIT 1;
```

**Note:** This will display the column names and help you identify the exact names and cases.

#### **2. Adjust Your Query Based on Actual Column Names:**

Assuming you find that the columns are named in uppercase without quotes (which is the default in Snowflake when columns are created without quotes), you should adjust your query accordingly.

**Possible Column Names:**

- Instead of `"zipcode"`, the column might be `ZIPCODE`.
- Instead of `"population"`, the column might be `POPULATION`.

#### **3. Modify Your Query:**

**Updated Query Using Unquoted Uppercase Identifiers:**

```sql
SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p.POPULATION) AS "state_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
  ON z."zipcode" = p.ZIPCODE
GROUP BY z."state_name"
ORDER BY "state_population" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`p.POPULATION`:** We reference `POPULATION` without quotes and in uppercase, assuming the column is unquoted and stored in uppercase.
- **`p.ZIPCODE`:** Similarly, use `ZIPCODE` without quotes and in uppercase.
- **`z."state_name"` and `z."zipcode"`:** In the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table, we maintain the quoted lowercase identifiers since those columns might have been created with quotes and are case-sensitive.

---

### **Understanding Snowflake Identifier Sensitivity:**

- **Unquoted Identifiers:**
  - Stored in uppercase.
  - Case-insensitive.
  - Examples: `ZIPCODE`, `POPULATION`.
- **Quoted Identifiers:**
  - Case-sensitive.
  - Must match exactly as created.
  - Examples: `"zipcode"`, `"ZipCode"`, `"state_name"`.

---

### **Alternative Scenario:**

If after checking, you find that the column names are indeed in lowercase and require quotes, ensure you use the correct case and include quotes.

**Example Query Using Quoted Identifiers:**

```sql
SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."population") AS "state_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
  ON z."zipcode" = p."zipcode"
GROUP BY z."state_name"
ORDER BY "state_population" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Verify Data Types:** Ensure the data types of the columns used in the `ON` clause are compatible.
- **Check for Column Name Variations:** Sometimes, columns might have similar but different names, like `ZIP_CODE` or `POPULATION_COUNT`.

---

### **Recap:**

- **Error Cause:** The column `"population"` in alias `p` is not recognized due to incorrect casing or it doesn't exist.
- **Solution:** Verify the exact column names and adjust your query accordingly, considering case sensitivity and proper quoting.
- **Action:** Use `DESC TABLE` or `SELECT *` to get the actual column names. Then, modify your query to match these names.

---

### **Final Adjusted Query:**

Assuming the `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` table has columns `ZIPCODE` and `POPULATION` in uppercase:

```sql
SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p.POPULATION) AS "state_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
  ON z."zipcode" = p.ZIPCODE
GROUP BY z."state_name"
ORDER BY "state_population" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Next Steps:**

- Run the adjusted query.
- If you encounter further errors, please share the output of the `DESC TABLE` command for `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` so we can provide more precise assistance.

LIMIT 100;
```

**Error Message:**

```
SQL compilation error: error line 5 at position 33
invalid identifier 'P."population"'
```

### Explanation:

The error occurs because the column `"population"` in alias `p` (which refers to `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`) is not recognized due to case sensitivity or incorrect column referencing.

From the `DESC TABLE` results you provided for `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`, the columns are:

- `GENDER`
- `POPULATION`
- `GEO_ID`
- `MINIMUM_AGE`
- `MAXIMUM_AGE`
- `ZIPCODE`

**Key Points:**

- **Case Sensitivity in Snowflake:**
  - Quoted identifiers (e.g., `"population"`) are case-sensitive and must match the exact case of the column name.
  - Unquoted identifiers are case-insensitive and converted to uppercase.

- **Column Names:**
  - The column is named `POPULATION` in uppercase.

### Solution:

#### **1. Correct the Column References:**

- Change `p."population"` to `p."POPULATION"` (match the exact case).
- Similarly, adjust `p."zipcode"` to `p."ZIPCODE"` in the `ON` clause.

#### **2. Adjust `d."state_name"` Reference:**

Earlier, we determined that the `DISTRACT_2015` table does not have the `"state_name"` column. You need to join `DISTRACT_2015` with `US_STATES_AREA` to get the state names.

### Corrected Query:

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
WITH distract_accidents AS (
  SELECT
    d."state_number",
    u."state_name",
    COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
  LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
    ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
  WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'

```

### Explanation:

- **First CTE (`distract_accidents`):**

  - Joins `DISTRACT_2015` with `US_STATES_AREA` to obtain `"state_name"` using `state_number` and `state_fips_code`.
  - The `LPAD` function ensures that `state_number` matches the two-digit `state_fips_code` (e.g., '01' for Alabama).

- **Second CTE (`state_populations`):**

  - Adjusted column references:
    - `p."POPULATION"`: Corrected to match the exact case.
    - `p."ZIPCODE"`: Corrected in the `ON` clause.
  - Aggregates population by `"state_name"`.

- **Final `SELECT`:**

  - Calculates accidents per 100,000 people for each state.
  - Uses `"state_name"` from the CTEs.

### Additional Notes:

- **Ensure Column Names Match Exactly:**

  - Use double quotes with exact casing for column names like `"POPULATION"` and `"ZIPCODE"`.
  - Use aliases consistently (e.g., `p` for `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`).

- **Case Sensitivity Recap:**

  - **Quoted Identifiers ("IDENTIFIER"):** Case-sensitive.
  - **Unquoted Identifiers (IDENTIFIER):** Case-insensitive, converted to uppercase.

- **Data Type Matching:**

  - Make sure that the data types of joining columns are compatible.

### Verifying Column Names:

If you continue to encounter errors, verify the exact column names and their cases in your tables using:

```sql
DESC TABLE NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010;
```

And for `ZIPCODE_AREA`:

```sql
DESC TABLE NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA;
```

### Alternative Using Unquoted Identifiers:

As an alternative, you can use unquoted identifiers (assuming columns are in uppercase):

```sql
WITH distract_accidents AS (
  SELECT
    d."state_number",
    u."state_name",
    COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
  LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
    ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u.STATE_FIPS_CODE
  WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
    AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
    AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
  GROUP BY d."state_number", u."state_name"
),
state_populations AS (
  SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p.POPULATION) AS state_population
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
    ON z."zipcode" = p.ZIPCODE
  GROUP BY z."state_name"
)
SELECT da."state_name",
       (da."distracted_accidents"::FLOAT / sp.state_population) * 100000 AS "accidents_per_100k"
FROM distract_accidents da
JOIN state_populations sp ON da."state_name" = sp."state_name"
ORDER BY "accidents_per_100k" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

In this version, unquoted identifiers like `POPULATION` and `ZIPCODE` are used, making it less prone to case sensitivity issues.

---

### **Original Query and Error:**

**Your Query:**

```sql
SELECT d."state_name",
       (COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number")::FLOAT / p."state_population") * 100000 AS "accidents_per_100k"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
JOIN (
  SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."population") AS "state_population"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
    ON z."zipcode" = p."zipcode"
  GROUP BY z."state_name"
) p ON d."state_name" = p."state_name"
WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
  AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
  AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
GROUP BY d."state_name", p."state_population"
ORDER BY "accidents_per_100k" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Error Message:**

```
000904 (42000): 01ba5427-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010e3a6a: SQL compilation error: error line 5 at position 29
invalid identifier 'P."population"'
```

### **Explanation of the Error:**

1. **Case Sensitivity in Column Names:**

   - In Snowflake, **quoted identifiers** (identifiers enclosed in double quotes) are **case-sensitive**.
   - The column names in `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` are in uppercase, as shown in your `DESC TABLE` output:

     ```
     GENDER, POPULATION, GEO_ID, MINIMUM_AGE, MAXIMUM_AGE, ZIPCODE
     ```

   - You are referencing `p."population"` and `p."zipcode"`, but the actual column names are `POPULATION` and `ZIPCODE` (uppercase).

2. **Missing `"state_name"` Column in `DISTRACT_2015`:**

   - The `DISTRACT_2015` table does **not** have a column named `"state_name"`.
   - This will cause an error when you reference `d."state_name"`.

### **Corrections Needed:**

1. **Correct Column References in the Subquery:**

   - Change `p."population"` to `p."POPULATION"`.
   - Change `p."zipcode"` to `p."ZIPCODE"`.

2. **Join `DISTRACT_2015` with `US_STATES_AREA` to Obtain `"state_name"`:**

   - Since `"state_name"` doesn't exist in `DISTRACT_2015`, you need to join with `US_STATES_AREA` to get state names.
   - Use `d."state_number"` and match it with `u."state_fips_code"` in `US_STATES_AREA`.

3. **Adjust the Final `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` Clauses:**

   - Reference `da."state_name"` from the `distract_accidents` CTE.
   - Ensure all column references are updated accordingly.

### **Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
WITH distract_accidents AS (
  SELECT
    d."state_number",
    u."state_name",
    COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
  LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
    ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
  WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
    AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
    AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
  GROUP BY d."state_number", u."state_name"
),
state_populations AS (
  SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."POPULATION") AS "state_population"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
    ON z."zipcode" = p."ZIPCODE"
  GROUP BY z."state_name"
)
SELECT da."state_name",
       (da."distracted_accidents"::FLOAT / sp."state_population") * 100000 AS "accidents_per_100k"
FROM distract_accidents da
JOIN state_populations sp ON da."state_name" = sp."state_name"
ORDER BY "accidents_per_100k" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Detailed Explanation:**

#### **1. CTE `distract_accidents`:**

- **Purpose:** Calculate the number of distraction-related accidents per state.
- **Joins:**

  - `DISTRACT_2015` (`d`): Contains accident data with `"state_number"` but not `"state_name"`.
  - `US_STATES_AREA` (`u`): Contains `"state_fips_code"` and `"state_name"`.

- **Joining on State Codes:**

  - Use `LPAD` to pad `d."state_number"` to match the format of `u."state_fips_code"` (e.g., '01' for Alabama).

    ```sql
    ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
    ```

- **Selecting Columns:**

  - `u."state_name"`: To get the state name.
  - `COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number")`: To count unique accidents per state.

- **Grouping:**

  - Group by `d."state_number"` and `u."state_name"`.

#### **2. CTE `state_populations`:**

- **Purpose:** Calculate the total population per state from ZIP code data.
- **Tables:**

  - `ZIPCODE_AREA` (`z`): Contains `"state_name"` and `"zipcode"`.
  - `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` (`p`): Contains population data with `"ZIPCODE"` and `"POPULATION"`.

- **Column Corrections:**

  - Use `p."POPULATION"` instead of `p."population"`.
  - Use `p."ZIPCODE"` instead of `p."zipcode"`.

- **Joining on ZIP Codes:**

  - Match `z."zipcode"` with `p."ZIPCODE"`.

    ```sql
    ON z."zipcode" = p."ZIPCODE"
    ```

- **Calculating State Population:**

  - Sum `p."POPULATION"` grouped by `z."state_name"`.

#### **3. Final `SELECT` Statement:**

- **Join CTEs:**

  - Join `distract_accidents` (`da`) with `state_populations` (`sp`) on `"state_name"`.

- **Calculations:**

  - Calculate accidents per 100,000 people:

    ```sql
    (da."distracted_accidents"::FLOAT / sp."state_population") * 100000 AS "accidents_per_100k"
    ```

- **Ordering and Limiting:**

  - Order by `"accidents_per_100k"` in descending order.
  - Limit the results to the top 100.

### **Additional Notes:**

- **Case Sensitivity:**

  - Ensure all column names match the exact case in the database when using double quotes.

- **Column Names from `DESC TABLE`:**

  - `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` columns (from your `DESC TABLE` output):

    - `"GENDER"`, `"POPULATION"`, `"GEO_ID"`, `"MINIMUM_AGE"`, `"MAXIMUM_AGE"`, `"ZIPCODE"`

- **Data Types:**

  - Confirm that `"state_population"` and `"distracted_accidents"` are numeric for division.

- **Data Validity:**

  - Ensure that the joins correctly match states and that there are no mismatched or missing data.

### **Testing the Corrected Query:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:**

  - Execute the corrected query in your database environment.
  - Verify that it runs without errors.

- **Verify Results:**

  - Check the output to ensure that the numbers make sense.
  - Validate that the states with the highest accidents per 100,000 people are as expected.

---

**By applying these corrections, your query should execute successfully and provide the desired results.**

---

### **Summary:**

- **Issue:** The original query referenced columns with incorrect casing and missing columns.
- **Solution:**

  - Adjust column references to match the exact case in the database.
  - Join `DISTRACT_2015` with `US_STATES_AREA` to obtain `"state_name"`.

- **Result:** A corrected query that calculates the number of distraction-related accidents per 100,000 people for each U.S. state in 2015.

2025-02-11 20:57:25 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering an error when running your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT d."state_name",
       (COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number")::FLOAT / p."state_population") * 100000 AS "accidents_per_100k"

**Error Message:**

```
000904 (42000): 01ba5428-0004-9c12-0001-11c3010e4816: SQL compilation error: error line 5 at position 29
invalid identifier 'P."population"'
```

---

### **Explanation of the Error:**

The error indicates that there is an issue with the identifier `p."population"` in your query. Specifically, at **line 5, position 29**, the identifier `p."population"` is invalid.

**Possible causes:**

1. **Case Sensitivity:**

   - In Snowflake, when you use double quotes around identifiers (e.g., `"population"`), the identifier becomes **case-sensitive**.
   - If the column in your table is actually named `"POPULATION"` (uppercase), referencing it as `"population"` (lowercase) will cause an error.

2. **Column Does Not Exist:**

   - The column `"population"` might not exist in the table `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` (aliased as `p`).

---

### **Solution:**

#### **1. Verify and Adjust Column Names for Case Sensitivity:**

Based on the `DESC TABLE` output you provided for `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`, the columns are:

- **`GENDER`**
- **`POPULATION`**
- **`GEO_ID`**
- **`MINIMUM_AGE`**
- **`MAXIMUM_AGE`**
- **`ZIPCODE`**

Note that the column names are in **uppercase**.

Therefore, you should:

- Change `p."population"` to `p."POPULATION"`
- Change `p."zipcode"` to `p."ZIPCODE"`

#### **2. Correct the Reference to `d."state_name"`:**

The `DISTRACT_2015` table does **not** have a `"state_name"` column. It only has `"state_number"`. You need to obtain the state names by joining with the `US_STATES_AREA` table.

#### **3. Update Your Query:**

Here is the corrected query:

```sql
WITH distract_accidents AS (
  SELECT
    d."state_number",
    u."state_name",
    COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
  LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
    ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
  WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
    AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
    AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
  GROUP BY d."state_number", u."state_name"
),
state_populations AS (
  SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."POPULATION") AS "state_population"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
    ON z."zipcode" = p."ZIPCODE"
  GROUP BY z."state_name"
)
SELECT da."state_name",
       (da."distracted_accidents"::FLOAT / sp."state_population") * 100000 AS "accidents_per_100k"
FROM distract_accidents da
JOIN state_populations sp ON da."state_name" = sp."state_name"
ORDER BY "accidents_per_100k" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Adjusted Column References for Case Sensitivity:**

   - Changed `p."population"` to `p."POPULATION"`
   - Changed `p."zipcode"` to `p."ZIPCODE"`

2. **Retrieved `state_name` by Joining with `US_STATES_AREA`:**

   - Since `DISTRACT_2015` does not have `"state_name"`, we join `DISTRACT_2015` (aliased as `d`) with `US_STATES_AREA` (aliased as `u`) to get the state names.
   - Used `LPAD` to pad `state_number` to match the format of `state_fips_code` (which may have leading zeros).

     ```sql
     LEFT JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA u
       ON LPAD(CAST(d."state_number" AS VARCHAR), 2, '0') = u."state_fips_code"
     ```

3. **Updated the Final `SELECT` Statement:**

   - Changed `d."state_name"` to `da."state_name"` since `state_name` is now obtained in the `distract_accidents` CTE.

4. **Ensured Consistent Grouping and Ordering:**

   - Grouped by `da."state_name"` and `sp."state_population"`
   - Ordered by `"accidents_per_100k"`

---

### **Key Points to Remember:**

- **Case Sensitivity with Quoted Identifiers:**

  - In Snowflake, when you use double quotes around identifiers, they become case-sensitive.
  - Always use the exact case as defined in the table schema.

- **Joining Tables to Obtain Missing Columns:**

  - If a column isn't available in a table, you may need to join with another table that contains the necessary information.

- **Data Types and Formats:**

  - Ensure that the data types of the columns you're comparing or joining are compatible.
  - For state codes, use functions like `LPAD` to match formats (e.g., adding leading zeros).

---

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Run the Corrected Query:**

   - Execute the updated SQL query in your database environment.

2. **Verify the Results:**

   - Check that the query runs without errors.
   - Review the output to ensure it makes sense (e.g., the calculated accident rates per 100,000 people).

3. **Adjust if Necessary:**

   - If you encounter any new errors, double-check the column names and ensure they match exactly.
   - Confirm that all tables and columns exist and are accessible.

---

### **Additional Assistance:**

- If you continue to experience issues, please provide:

  - The exact error message.
  - Any additional details about the column names and table structures.

- I can then help you further troubleshoot and resolve the problem.

---

**By making these adjustments, your query should execute successfully and provide you with the rates of distraction-related traffic accidents per 100,000 people for each U.S. state in 2015.**

Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure, let's first identify the relevant tables, columns, and potential conditions for this task.

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

1. **DISTRACT_2015** and **DISTRACT_2016** (from schema `NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES`)
   - `"state_number"`: Used to identify the state numerically.
   - `"state_name"`: Name of the state.
   - `"consecutive_number"`: Unique identifier for each accident.
   - `"driver_distracted_by_name"`: Description of the driver's distraction status.

   **Conditions:**
   - Exclude records where `"driver_distracted_by_name"` is 'Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', or 'Not Reported'.

2. **POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010** (from schema `CENSUS_BUREAU_USA`)
   - `"zipcode"`: Zip code to map to states.
   - `"population"`: Population count for each zip code.

3. **ZIPCODE_AREA** (from schema `UTILITY_US`)
   - `"zipcode"`: Zip code.
   - `"state_code"`: State abbreviation (e.g., 'CA' for California).
   - `"state_name"`: State name (e.g., 'California').

   **Usage:**
   - Map zip codes to state names to calculate the total population per state by joining with `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`.

4. **US_STATES_AREA** (from schema `UTILITY_US`)
   - `"state_fips_code"`: State FIPS code (corresponds to `"state_number"`).
   - `"state_name"`: State name.

   **Usage:**
   - Map `"state_number"` from the distraction tables to `"state_fips_code"` for accurate state identification.

### SQL Queries:

Below are 10 different SQL queries to explore the relevant data:

1. **Query to list distinct driver distraction statuses in 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "driver_distracted_by_name"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Query to list distinct driver distraction statuses in 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "driver_distracted_by_name"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2016
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Query to count total accidents per state in 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state_number", "state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "total_accidents"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015
   GROUP BY "state_number", "state_name"
   ORDER BY "total_accidents" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Query to count total accidents per state in 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state_number", "state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "total_accidents"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2016
   GROUP BY "state_number", "state_name"
   ORDER BY "total_accidents" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Query to count distraction-related accidents per state in 2015 (excluding specified statuses):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state_number", "state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015
   WHERE "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
     AND "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
     AND "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
   GROUP BY "state_number", "state_name"
   ORDER BY "distracted_accidents" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Query to count distraction-related accidents per state in 2016 (excluding specified statuses):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state_number", "state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "distracted_accidents"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2016
   WHERE "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
     AND "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
     AND "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
   GROUP BY "state_number", "state_name"
   ORDER BY "distracted_accidents" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Query to view population data by zip code from the 2010 census:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "zipcode", SUM("population") AS "total_population"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
   GROUP BY "zipcode"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Query to map zip codes to states and calculate total population per state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."population") AS "state_population"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
   JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
     ON z."zipcode" = p."zipcode"
   GROUP BY z."state_name"
   ORDER BY "state_population" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Query to view mapping of state FIPS codes to state names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "state_fips_code", "state_name"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.US_STATES_AREA
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Query to calculate accidents per 100,000 people in 2015 for each state:**

    ```sql
    SELECT d."state_name",
           (COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number")::FLOAT / p."state_population") * 100000 AS "accidents_per_100k"
    FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
    JOIN (
      SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."population") AS "state_population"
      FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
      JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
        ON z."zipcode" = p."zipcode"
      GROUP BY z."state_name"
    ) p ON d."state_name" = p."state_name"
    WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Distracted%'
      AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Unknown%'
      AND d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT ILIKE '%Not Reported%'
    GROUP BY d."state_name", p."state_population"
    ORDER BY "accidents_per_100k" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Each of these queries aims to explore different aspects of the data to help understand the relevant columns, values, and how they can be used to solve the task.

Task: According to the 2015 and 2016 accident and driver distraction, and excluding cases where the driver’s distraction status is recorded as 'Not Distracted,' 'Unknown if Distracted,' or 'Not Reported,' how many traffic accidents per 100,000 people were caused by driver distraction in each U.S. state for those two years, based on 2010 census population data, and which five states each year had the highest rates?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the 2015 and 2016 accident data, excluding cases where the driver’s distraction status is recorded as 'Not Distracted,' 'Unknown if Distracted,' or 'Not Reported,' the five U.S. states each year with the highest rates of traffic accidents caused by driver distraction per 100,000 people (using 2010 census population data) are as follows:

```csv
Year,State,Accidents_per_100k
2015,State1:str,rate1:float
2015,State2:str,rate2:float
2015,State3:str,rate3:float
2015,State4:str,rate4:float
2015,State5:str,rate5:float
2016,State1:str,rate1:float
2016,State2:str,rate2:float
2016,State3:str,rate3:float
2016,State4:str,rate4:float
2016,State5:str,rate5:float
(Attention: answer in ten rows)
```

Each row represents one of the top five states for the specified year, along with the calculated rate of distraction-related accidents per 100,000 people..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
