2025-02-11 11:52:26 - root - INFO - **Answer:**

Unfortunately, as the `'TCGA.PUBLIC.COPY_NUMBER_DATA'` table does not exist or is not authorized in the provided database schema, we cannot compute the Pearson correlation between the frequencies of copy number aberrations from the Mitelman database and those from TCGA data.

However, we can compute the frequencies of copy number aberrations per chromosome and aberration type within the Mitelman database for cases with `"Morph" = '3111'` and `"Topo" = '0401'`.

Here's a SQL query to compute these frequencies:

```sql
WITH total_cases AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c."RefNo" || '-' || c."CaseNo") AS "TotalCases"
    FROM "MITELMAN"."PROD"."CYTOGEN" c
    WHERE c."Morph" = '3111' AND c."Topo" = '0401'
),
aberration_counts AS (
    SELECT

... (additional rows)
```

*(Note: Replace `num_cases:int`, `total_cases:int`, and `freq_percentage:float` with actual numerical values from your database. Only rows with at least five cases are included.)*

**Explanation:**

Due to the absence of the `'TCGA.PUBLIC.COPY_NUMBER_DATA'` table in the provided database schema, we are unable to compute the Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values between the frequencies from the Mitelman database and TCGA data.

As we are restricted to using only the tables within the `'MITELMAN.PROD'` schema, we have provided the frequencies of copy number aberrations per chromosome and aberration type within the Mitelman database for the specified cases (`"Morph" = '3111'` and `"Topo" = '0401'`).

This information can be used for further analysis or comparison when the TCGA data becomes available.

---

**Note:** If you have access to the TCGA data elsewhere or in another schema, you can adjust the SQL query to include the TCGA frequencies and compute the Pearson correlation coefficients accordingly.

- **Title:** Correlations between Mitelman DB and TCGA datasets
- **Author:** Boris Aguilar
- **Created:** 04-23-2022
- **Purpose:** Compare Mitelman DB and TCGA datasets
- **URL:**

This notebook demonstrates how to compute correlations between Mitelman DB and TCGa datasets. The Mitelman DB is hosted by ISB-CGC and can be accessed at this URL: https://mitelmandatabase.isb-cgc.org/. This notebook replicates some of the analyses from the paper by Denomy et al: https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/79/20/5181. Note, however that results are not replicated exactly as some of the underlying data has changed since publication.



# Calculate Frequency of Gains and Losses of breast cancer samples in Mitelman DB

We can use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of samples, e.g., across all breast cancer samples.

In [ ]:

```
# Set parameters for this query
cancer_type = 'BRCA' # Cancer type for TCGA
bq_project = 'mitelman-db'  # project name of Mitelman-DB BigQuery table
bq_dataset = 'prod' # Name of the dataset containing Mitelman-DB BigQuery tables
morphology = '3111' # Breast cancer
topology = '0401' # Adenocarcinoma
```

First, we identify all Mitelman DB cases related to the morphology and topology of interest.

This query was copied from the new feature of the MitelmanDB interface: View Overall Gain/Loss in chromosome.

```
case_query = """
# sql here
"""

# Run the query and put results in a data frame
mysql = ( "WITH " + case_query + """
SELECT *
FROM mitelman
""" )
final_mitelman = client.query(mysql).result().to_dataframe()
```

# Calculate Frequency of TCGA Copy Number Gains and Losses in breast cancer samples.

As a comparison to Mitelman DB gain and loss frequency, we can calculate similar frequencies using TCGA Copy Number data.

```
cnv_query = """
# sql here
"""

# Execute query and put results into a data frame
mysql = ( "WITH " + cnv_query + """
SELECT *
FROM tcga
""" )
cnv = client.query(mysql).result().to_dataframe()
```

# Compute Pearson correlation and p-values

The following query compute Pearson correlation for each chromosome comparing Mitelman DB frequencies with those computed from TCGA. Moreover, for each correlation values, its respective p-values is computed by using the BigQuery function `isb-cgc-bq.functions.corr_pvalue_current`. The minimum number of cases for correlation computation was 5.

```
mysql = ( "WITH " + case_query + "," + cnv_query + """
# sql here
""")
```

The non a value results (NaN) represent cases in which the computed frequencies of TCGA are zero for all the cytobands.

# Conclusion

This notebook demonstrated usage of the Mitelman BigQuery dataset, which includes CytoConverter chromosomal coordinate data, in combination with TCGA BigQuery tables for a comparative analysis. Specifically, the notebook computes correlation (Pearson) coefficients between gains and losses obtained with Mitelam DB and TCGA datasets.

We observed that the mayority (but not all) of the significan correlation shown in Denomy et al. paper (Table 1, https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0585) are also significan in this analysis.

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Could you compute, by chromosome, the Pearson correlation between the frequency of copy number aberrations (including amplifications, gains, losses, and deletions) from the Mitelman database for cases with morph = 3111 and topo = 0401, and those computed from TCGA data, returning correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values for each aberration type, ensuring only results with at least five matching records are shown.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Chromosome,Aberration_type,Correlation_coefficient,P-value
chromosome:str,aberration_type:str,correlation_coefficient:float,p_value:float
chromosome:str,aberration_type:str,correlation_coefficient:float,p_value:float
...
```

The table above shows, for each chromosome and aberration type (amplification, gain, loss, or deletion), the Pearson correlation coefficient and corresponding p-value between the frequency of copy number aberrations from the Mitelman database and those computed from TCGA data for cases with morph = 3111 and topo = 0401. Only results with at least five matching records are included..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'MITELMAN': {'PROD': ['CYTOCONVERTED', 'KARYCLONE', 'MOLBIOLCLINASSOC', 'CYTOGEN', 'KARYABNORM', 'REFERENCE', 'AUTHORREFERENCE', 'CYTOCONVERTEDLOG', 'KARYBIT', 'KODER', 'MOLCLINBREAK', 'MOLCLINGENE', 'RECURRENTNUMDATA', 'CYTOGENINV', 'CYTOBANDS_HG38', 'CYTOGENINVVALID', 'KARYBREAK', 'MOLCLINABNORM', 'RECURRENTDATA']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 11:59:26 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you compute, by chromosome, the Pearson correlation between the frequency of copy number aberrations (including amplifications, gains, losses, and deletions) from the Mitelman database for cases with morph = 3111 and topo = 0401, and those computed from TCGA data, returning correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values for each aberration type, ensuring only results with at least five matching records are shown., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Aberration_type,Correlation_coefficient,P-value
chromosome:str,aberration_type:str,correlation_coefficient:float,p_value:float
chromosome:str,aberration_type:str,correlation_coefficient:float,p_value:float
...
```

The table above shows, for each chromosome and aberration type (amplification, gain, loss, or deletion), the Pearson correlation coefficient and corresponding p-value between the frequency of copy number aberrations from the Mitelman database and those computed from TCGA data for cases with morph = 3111 and topo = 0401. Only results with at least five matching records are included. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
