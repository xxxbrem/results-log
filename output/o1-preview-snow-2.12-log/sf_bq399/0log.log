Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table**: `"WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."COUNTRY_SUMMARY"`
   - `"country_code"`: Used to uniquely identify countries and for joining with other tables.
   - `"short_name"`: The country's name.
   - `"region"`: The region to which the country belongs.
   - `"income_group"`: To filter for high-income countries.

2. **Table**: `"WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."INDICATORS_DATA"`
   - `"country_code"`: For joining with the country summary table.
   - `"indicator_name"`: Contains the name of the indicator (e.g., "Crude birth rate (per 1,000 people)").
   - `"indicator_code"`: Unique code for each indicator; useful for precise filtering.
   - `"value"`: The numerical value of the indicator.
   - `"year"`: To filter data from the 1980s (1980-1989).

3. **Table**: `"WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."SERIES_SUMMARY"`
   - `"indicator_name"`: To find the exact name of indicators related to crude birth rate.
   - `"series_code"`: Corresponds to the `indicator_code` in `INDICATORS_DATA`.

**Potential Conditions:**

- Filter countries where `"income_group"` equals `'High income'`.
- Filter records where `"year"` is between `1980` and `1989`.
- Identify indicators where `"indicator_name"` contains `'Crude birth rate'`.
- Use `"indicator_code"` for precise matching once identified.
- Filter data by specific `"region"` if needed.

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct income groups to identify how 'High income' is labeled:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "income_group"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."COUNTRY_SUMMARY"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **List all regions to understand regional classifications:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "region"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."COUNTRY_SUMMARY"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Get all high-income countries along with their regions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "country_code", "short_name", "region"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."COUNTRY_SUMMARY"
   WHERE "income_group" = 'High income'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Find all indicator names containing 'crude birth rate':**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "indicator_name"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."INDICATORS_DATA"
   WHERE "indicator_name" ILIKE '%crude birth rate%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Retrieve the indicator code for 'Crude birth rate':**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "indicator_code", "indicator_name"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."SERIES_SUMMARY"
   WHERE "indicator_name" ILIKE '%crude birth rate%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List crude birth rate data for all countries in the 1980s:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "country_code", "year", "value"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."INDICATORS_DATA"
   WHERE "indicator_name" = 'Crude birth rate (per 1,000 people)'
     AND "year" BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Get average crude birth rate for each country in the 1980s:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "country_code", AVG("value") AS "average_crude_birth_rate"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."INDICATORS_DATA"
   WHERE "indicator_name" = 'Crude birth rate (per 1,000 people)'
     AND "year" BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989
   GROUP BY "country_code"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Identify high-income countries with their average crude birth rate:**
   ```sql
   SELECT cs."country_code", cs."short_name", cs."region", AVG(id."value") AS "average_crude_birth_rate"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."COUNTRY_SUMMARY" cs
   JOIN "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."INDICATORS_DATA" id
     ON cs."country_code" = id."country_code"
   WHERE cs."income_group" = 'High income'
     AND id."indicator_name" = 'Crude birth rate (per 1,000 people)'
     AND id."year" BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989
   GROUP BY cs."country_code", cs."short_name", cs."region"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Check the years available for crude birth rate data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."INDICATORS_DATA"
   WHERE "indicator_name" = 'Crude birth rate (per 1,000 people)'
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Retrieve detailed crude birth rate data for a specific country (e.g., 'USA') in the 1980s:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "year", "value"
    FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."INDICATORS_DATA"
    WHERE "country_code" = 'USA'
      AND "indicator_name" = 'Crude birth rate (per 1,000 people)'
      AND "year" BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989
    ORDER BY "year"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Task: Which high-income country had the highest average crude birth rate respectively in each region, and what are their corresponding average birth rate, during the 1980s?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Country,Region,Average Crude Birth Rate
country1:str,region1:str,rate1:float
country2:str,region2:str,rate2:float
...
```

To determine the high-income country with the highest average crude birth rate in each region during the 1980s, we:

1. **Identified High-Income Countries**: Selected countries from the `COUNTRY_SUMMARY` table where the `income_group` is `'High income'`, along with their corresponding `region`.

2. **Extracted Crude Birth Rate Data**: Retrieved crude birth rate data from the `INDICATORS_DATA` table where `indicator_name` corresponds to the crude birth rate indicator, focusing on the years from 1980 to 1989.

3. **Calculated Averages**: Calculated the average crude birth rate for each high-income country over the specified period.

4. **Selected Highest per Region**: For each region, identified the high-income country with the highest average crude birth rate during the 1980s..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'WORLD_BANK': {'WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION': ['POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY'], 'WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_DEBT', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_EDUCATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_EDUCATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY'], 'WORLD_BANK_WDI': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'FOOTNOTES', 'INDICATORS_DATA', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIME']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 13:21:44 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which high-income country had the highest average crude birth rate respectively in each region, and what are their corresponding average birth rate, during the 1980s?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Country,Region,Average Crude Birth Rate
country1:str,region1:str,rate1:float
country2:str,region2:str,rate2:float
...
```

4. **Selected Highest per Region**: For each region, identified the high-income country with the highest average crude birth rate during the 1980s. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
