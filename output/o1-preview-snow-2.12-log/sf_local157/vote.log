After carefully comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice for the following reasons:

1. **Accurate Volume Conversion**:
   - Both SQL queries correctly handle the conversion of volumes ending with `'K'` and `'M'` by multiplying them with `1,000` and `1,000,000` respectively.
   - They also appropriately treat `'-'` volumes as zero.

2. **Handling Non-Zero Previous Volumes**:
   - `1result.sql` uses `LAG(NULLIF(pd."volume_numeric", 0)) IGNORE NULLS OVER (...) AS "prev_volume"` to ensure only non-zero volumes are considered for the previous day's volume. This aligns precisely with the requirement to use only non-zero volumes for the calculation.
   - The use of `NULLIF` combined with `IGNORE NULLS` allows the function to skip any zero volumes and retrieve the last non-zero volume, which is essential for accurate percentage change calculations.

3. **Date Filtering**:
   - `1result.sql` filters the data in the final `SELECT` statement to include only dates between August 1 and August 10, 2021. This ensures that all necessary previous volumes are considered without unnecessarily expanding the dataset.
   - In contrast, `0result.sql` includes an additional day (`July 31, 2021`) in the initial data selection. While this is acceptable, it adds an extra date to process, which is not strictly necessary since `LAG` can handle preceding values without requiring the date range to be extended.

4. **Simplicity and Readability**:
   - `1result.sql` is more straightforward and easier to read. It uses clearer aliases and structures, making it more maintainable and understandable for future users or reviewers.
   - It avoids the more complex window framing used in `0result.sql`, which may not be necessary for this calculation.

5. **Performance Consideration**:
   - By not extending the date range unnecessarily, `1result.sql` may have better performance, especially with larger datasets, since it processes only the required data.

6. **Consistent Results**:
   - The results produced by both SQL queries are identical, indicating that `1result.sql` meets all the requirements accurately.

Based on these reasons, **`1result.sql`** is selected as the correct SQL query that fulfills all the given requirements effectively.
