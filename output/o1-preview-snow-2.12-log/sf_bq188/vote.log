After comparing the two SQL queries, **`2result.sql`** is the more accurate and reliable choice.

**Reason:**

- **Product ID Extraction:**
  - **`2result.sql`** uses `REGEXP_SUBSTR` to extract the product ID from the `"uri"` field with the pattern `/product/(\d+)`. This method accurately captures URIs that represent product pages.
  - **`0result.sql`** uses `SPLIT_PART` to extract the third segment of the URI, which assumes that the product ID is always in that position. This method may not account for URIs with different structures, potentially leading to incorrect product ID extraction.

- **Completeness:**
  - **`2result.sql`** covers all possible URIs that match the `/product/ID` pattern, ensuring that all relevant product page views are included in the calculation.
  - **`0result.sql`** may miss or incorrectly include URIs due to its reliance on position-based splitting.

- **Consistent Results:**
  - Both queries produce the same final result, identifying **'Intimates'** as the category with the highest total quantity purchased and calculating an average time of **4.4675 minutes** spent on each product page visit.
  - However, the method used in **`2result.sql`** is more robust and less prone to errors, ensuring the reliability of the result.

Therefore, the correct SQL to use is:

```plaintext
2result.sql
