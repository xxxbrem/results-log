This query calculates the average time in minutes that users spend on each product page visit for the 'Intimates' category, which has the highest total quantity purchased. It corrects the previous query by extracting the product ID from the `"uri"` field using `REGEXP_SUBSTR` and matching it with the `"id"` in the `PRODUCTS` table to accurately filter events related to products in the 'Intimates' category.

This simplified query calculates the average time in minutes that users spend on product page visits across all categories. It does so by finding, for each `'product_page_view'` event, the next event within the same session and computing the time difference. The division by `60.0` converts the time from seconds to minutes.

2025-02-12 07:17:42 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to two main issues:

1. **Placeholder Not Replaced**: The term `'category_name'` in your query is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the actual category name, which is `'Intimates'`.

2. **Incorrect Alias Reference**: The error message mentions `E1."created_at"`, but in your query, you're only using the alias `E` without any `E1`. This suggests that the error message might be from a different query or there's a mismatch in aliases.

---

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT E."user_id", E."session_id", E."created_at", E."uri"
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E
WHERE E."event_type" = 'product_page_view'
  AND E."uri" ILIKE '%Intimates%'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Replace Placeholder**: I've replaced `'category_name'` with `'Intimates'`, which is the category with the highest total quantity purchased based on previous results.

- **Alias Consistency**: Ensured that the alias `E` is used consistently throughout the query.

---

**Additional Considerations:**

However, please note that filtering `E."uri"` using `ILIKE '%Intimates%'` might not yield results if the `"uri"` field doesn't contain the category name directly. The `"uri"` might include product IDs or other identifiers instead of category names.

To accurately link events to the `'Intimates'` category, we need to:

1. **Extract Product IDs from URIs**: Use `REGEXP_SUBSTR` or another method to extract the product ID from the `"uri"`.

2. **Join with the `PRODUCTS` Table**: Match the extracted product IDs with the `"id"` in the `PRODUCTS` table to get the category.

---

**Revised Query to Account for URI Structure:**

```sql
SELECT E."user_id", E."session_id", E."created_at", E."uri"
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E
JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.PRODUCTS P
  ON REGEXP_SUBSTR(E."uri", '[0-9]+') = TO_VARCHAR(P."id")
WHERE E."event_type" = 'product_page_view'
  AND P."category" = 'Intimates'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Extract Product ID**: `REGEXP_SUBSTR(E."uri", '[0-9]+')` extracts the first sequence of digits from the `"uri"` field, assuming the product ID is numeric and appears in the URI.

- **Data Type Matching**: Used `TO_VARCHAR(P."id")` to ensure data types match when comparing the extracted product ID with the `"id"` in the `PRODUCTS` table.

- **Join and Filter**: The join links the event to the product, and the `WHERE` clause filters for events in the `'Intimates'` category.

---

**What to Do If No Data Is Returned:**

If this query still returns no data, it may indicate:

- **URI Structure is Different**: The `"uri"` does not contain the product IDs in the expected format.

- **Data Type Mismatch**: Ensure that the extracted product IDs and product `"id"`s are of the same data type.

- **No Matching Records**: There are no `'product_page_view'` events linked to the `'Intimates'` category, which is unlikely but possible.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. **Inspect URIs**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT E."uri"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E
   WHERE E."event_type" = 'product_page_view'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - Review the URIs to understand how product information is encoded.

2. **Adjust the Regular Expression**:

   - Modify `REGEXP_SUBSTR` to match the actual pattern of product IDs in the URIs.

3. **Verify Product IDs**:

   - Ensure that the `"id"` in the `PRODUCTS` table corresponds to the extracted IDs from the URIs.

---

**Alternative Simplification:**

If the above methods are not yielding results, you can simplify the query to retrieve all `'product_page_view'` events without filtering by category:

```sql
SELECT E."user_id", E."session_id", E."created_at", E."uri"
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E
WHERE E."event_type" = 'product_page_view'
LIMIT 100;
```

This allows you to explore the data and gain insights into how to correctly filter by category.

---

**Conclusion:**

The key is to correctly link the events with the product categories by accurately extracting product identifiers from the URIs and ensuring data type consistency. By refining the query and exploring the data further, you should be able to retrieve the desired information.

---

**Note:** Always make sure to replace placeholders with actual values and verify the data's structure to write effective queries.

In this query:

- **Simplification**: I simplified the conditions by calculating the average time users spend on product page visits across all categories, given the data limitations.
  
- **Assumption**: The `"created_at"` timestamps are assumed to be in **microseconds** since the epoch (UNIX time). Dividing by `1,000,000` converts them to seconds.

- **Explanation**:
  - The `LEAD` window function is used to get the timestamp of the next event within the same session for each `'product_page_view'` event.
  - The time difference between the `'product_page_view'` event and the next event is calculated.
  - The `DATEDIFF` function computes the difference in seconds between the two timestamps.
  - Dividing by `60.0` converts the time difference from seconds to minutes.
  - The average of these time differences gives the average time spent on product page visits.

This query should return a numerical value for `"Average_time_spent_on_product_page_minutes"`.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
Firstly, let's consider the **tables** and **columns** that are relevant to the task:

---

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **PRODUCTS**:
   - `"id"`: Product ID, used to join with other tables.
   - `"category"`: Product category, needed to group purchases by category.

2. **ORDER_ITEMS**:
   - `"product_id"`: Links to `"id"` in `PRODUCTS`, used to identify the product purchased.
   - `"id"`: Unique identifier for each order item; counting these gives the quantity purchased.
   - `"user_id"`: Identifies the user who made the purchase.

3. **EVENTS**:
   - `"user_id"`: Links events to users.
   - `"session_id"`: Identifies a user session; used to sequence events.
   - `"created_at"`: Timestamp of the event; used to calculate time spent.
   - `"event_type"`: Describes the type of event (e.g., 'product_page_view').
   - `"uri"`: URL of the page visited; may contain product information.

---

**Potential Usage of Columns and Conditions:**

- **`PRODUCTS."category"`**: To group total quantities purchased by category.
- **Counting `ORDER_ITEMS."id"`**: To determine the total quantity purchased per product.
- **Joining `ORDER_ITEMS` with `PRODUCTS`**: To associate purchases with product categories.
- **Filtering `EVENTS` by `"event_type" = 'product_page_view'`**: To find events where users viewed product pages.
- **Using `EVENTS."created_at"` and `EVENTS."session_id"`**: To calculate the time difference between events within the same session.
- **Matching `EVENTS."uri"` with product identifiers**: To associate events with specific products or categories.

---

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List distinct product categories in the `PRODUCTS` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "category"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.PRODUCTS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get the total quantity purchased per product by counting order items:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", COUNT(*) AS "total_quantity_purchased"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.ORDER_ITEMS
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Join `ORDER_ITEMS` and `PRODUCTS` to get total quantity purchased per category:**

   ```sql
   SELECT P."category", COUNT(*) AS "total_quantity_purchased"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.ORDER_ITEMS OI
   JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.PRODUCTS P
     ON OI."product_id" = P."id"
   GROUP BY P."category"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Order the categories by total quantity purchased in descending order:**

   ```sql
   SELECT P."category", COUNT(*) AS "total_quantity_purchased"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.ORDER_ITEMS OI
   JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.PRODUCTS P
     ON OI."product_id" = P."id"
   GROUP BY P."category"
   ORDER BY "total_quantity_purchased" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List events where users viewed product pages (`'product_page_view'` events):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "event_type", "user_id", "session_id", "created_at", "uri"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS
   WHERE "event_type" = 'product_page_view'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find all events for sessions where product pages were viewed, including the next event:**

   ```sql
   SELECT E1."user_id", E1."session_id", E1."created_at" AS "view_time", E2."created_at" AS "next_event_time"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E1
   JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E2
     ON E1."user_id" = E2."user_id"
    AND E1."session_id" = E2."session_id"
    AND E2."created_at" > E1."created_at"
   WHERE E1."event_type" = 'product_page_view'
   ORDER BY E1."user_id", E1."session_id", E1."created_at"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate time spent on each product page (difference between view and next event):**

   ```sql
   SELECT E1."user_id", E1."session_id", E1."created_at" AS "view_time",
          MIN(E2."created_at") AS "next_event_time",
          (MIN(E2."created_at") - E1."created_at") / 60 AS "time_spent_minutes"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E1
   JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E2
     ON E1."user_id" = E2."user_id"
    AND E1."session_id" = E2."session_id"
    AND E2."created_at" > E1."created_at"
   WHERE E1."event_type" = 'product_page_view'
   GROUP BY E1."user_id", E1."session_id", E1."created_at"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Identify the category with the highest total quantity purchased:**

   ```sql
   SELECT P."category", COUNT(*) AS "total_quantity_purchased"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.ORDER_ITEMS OI
   JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.PRODUCTS P
     ON OI."product_id" = P."id"
   GROUP BY P."category"
   ORDER BY "total_quantity_purchased" DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

9. **Retrieve product page views for the top category identified:**

   ```sql
   SELECT E."user_id", E."session_id", E."created_at", E."uri"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E
   WHERE E."event_type" = 'product_page_view'
     AND E."uri" ILIKE '%category_name%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   *Note: Replace `'category_name'` with the actual category name obtained from query 8.*

10. **Compute the average time spent on product pages for the top category:**

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG((MIN(E2."created_at") - E1."created_at") / 60) AS "average_time_spent_minutes"
    FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E1
    JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E2
      ON E1."user_id" = E2."user_id"
     AND E1."session_id" = E2."session_id"
     AND E2."created_at" > E1."created_at"
    WHERE E1."event_type" = 'product_page_view'
      AND E1."uri" ILIKE '%category_name%'
    GROUP BY E1."user_id", E1."session_id", E1."created_at"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    *Note: Replace `'category_name'` with the actual category name obtained from query 8.*

11. **Display the average time spent on product pages across all categories for comparison:**

    ```sql
    SELECT P."category", AVG((E2."created_at" - E1."created_at") / 60) AS "average_time_spent_minutes"
    FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E1
    JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E2
      ON E1."user_id" = E2."user_id"
     AND E1."session_id" = E2."session_id"
     AND E2."created_at" > E1."created_at"
    JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.PRODUCTS P
      ON E1."uri" ILIKE CONCAT('%', P."id", '%')
    WHERE E1."event_type" = 'product_page_view'
    GROUP BY P."category"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Get the URI patterns for product pages to better match products with events:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "uri"
    FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS
    WHERE "event_type" = 'product_page_view'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Find the mapping between product IDs and URIs in events:**

    ```sql
    SELECT E."uri", P."id", P."category"
    FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E
    JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.PRODUCTS P
      ON E."uri" ILIKE CONCAT('%', P."id", '%')
    WHERE E."event_type" = 'product_page_view'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Calculate the number of product page views per category:**

    ```sql
    SELECT P."category", COUNT(*) AS "page_views"
    FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS E
    JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.PRODUCTS P
      ON E."uri" ILIKE CONCAT('%', P."id", '%')
    WHERE E."event_type" = 'product_page_view'
    GROUP BY P."category"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Determine the sequence of events within sessions for users:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "user_id", "session_id", "event_type", "created_at", "sequence_number"
    FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.EVENTS
    ORDER BY "user_id", "session_id", "sequence_number"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

These queries help in understanding the data structure and the relationships between tables. They assist in:

- Identifying the category with the highest total quantity purchased.
- Calculating the average time users spend on product pages for that category.
- Exploring how `EVENTS` data can be linked to specific products and categories.

*Note:* Time calculations assume that the `"created_at"` column represents timestamps in seconds. Dividing by 60 converts time differences to minutes.Query:

Task: Among all product categories in the dataset, which category has the highest total quantity purchased, and for that category, what is the average time in minutes that users spend on each product page visit, calculated as the average difference between the time the product page is viewed and the time of the next event within the same session

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Category_with_highest_total_quantity_purchased,Average_time_spent_on_product_page_minutes
category_name:str,average_time:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The category with the highest total quantity purchased is determined by summing the number of items ordered for each product category in the `ORDER_ITEMS` and `PRODUCTS` tables. For that category, the average time users spend on each product page visit is calculated by computing the average difference in minutes between the time a product page is viewed and the time of the next event within the same session from the `EVENTS` table..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': {'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': ['DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS', 'ORDERS', 'USERS', 'EVENTS', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS', 'PRODUCTS', 'ORDER_ITEMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-12 07:27:57 - root - INFO - The error occurred because the `event_type` `'product_page_view'` does not exist in the `EVENTS` table. Instead, the correct `event_type` for product page views is `'product'`. Additionally, the regular expression used to extract the `product_id` from the `uri` field was not correctly capturing the product IDs due to pattern mismatch.

I've updated the query with the following changes:

- Replaced `event_type = 'product_page_view'` with `event_type = 'product'`.
- Adjusted the regular expression in `REGEXP_SUBSTR` to correctly extract the `product_id` from the `uri` field.
- Added `NULLS LAST` to the `ORDER BY` clause to handle any null values.
- Ensured that the time units are correctly calculated based on the `created_at` field being in microseconds.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

This query will:

- Identify the category with the highest total quantity purchased.
- Calculate the average time (in minutes) that users spend on each product page visit within that category.

**Notes:**

- The `REGEXP_SUBSTR` function now captures numeric product IDs at the end of the `uri`.
- Time difference is calculated by subtracting `view_time` from `next_event_time`, dividing by `60,000,000` to convert microseconds to minutes.
- `NULLS LAST` in the `ORDER BY` clause ensures that null values do not interfere with the sorting.

Please run this updated query, and it should return the desired results.

2025-02-12 07:27:59 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Among all product categories in the dataset, which category has the highest total quantity purchased, and for that category, what is the average time in minutes that users spend on each product page visit, calculated as the average difference between the time the product page is viewed and the time of the next event within the same session, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Category_with_highest_total_quantity_purchased,Average_time_spent_on_product_page_minutes
category_name:str,average_time:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The category with the highest total quantity purchased is determined by summing the number of items ordered for each product category in the `ORDER_ITEMS` and `PRODUCTS` tables. For that category, the average time users spend on each product page visit is calculated by computing the average difference in minutes between the time a product page is viewed and the time of the next event within the same session from the `EVENTS` table. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
