After reviewing both SQL queries and their corresponding results, **2result.sql** is the correct SQL that fulfills the task requirements.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Tag Parsing:**
  - **2result.sql** correctly parses the tags from the `<tag1><tag2><tag3>` format. It uses `REGEXP_REPLACE` to remove the leading `<` and trailing `>` from the tags string and then splits the tags on `><`. This results in individual tags being correctly extracted.
  - **1result.sql**, on the other hand, seems to concatenate tags incorrectly. It replaces `><` with `,` and then removes `<` and `>`, which can lead to tags being concatenated improperly (e.g., 'html|http-headers|meta|owasp|penetration-testing' treated as a single tag).

- **Proper Aggregation of Scores:**
  - In **2result.sql**, scores are aggregated per individual tag. This aligns with the requirement to calculate the total score for each tag separately based on the number of upvotes and accepted answers associated with answers tagged with that tag.
  - **1result.sql** aggregates scores for combined tags due to improper tag splitting, leading to incorrect total scores per individual tag.

- **Adherence to Task Specifications:**
  - **2result.sql** follows the task instructions precisely by:
    - Considering only answers posted before June 7, 2018.
    - Calculating the score for each tag as 10 times the number of upvotes and 15 times the number of accepted answers.
    - Deriving tags from the questions associated with the user's answers.
    - Considering upvotes and accepted answers only for the user's answers.
    - Returning the top 10 tags with the highest total scores.

Therefore, **2result.sql** correctly implements the required logic and produces accurate results in compliance with the task.
