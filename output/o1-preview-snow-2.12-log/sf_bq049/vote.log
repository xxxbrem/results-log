After reviewing and comparing the three SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct script for the following reasons:

1. **Accurate Identification of the Third-Ranked Zip Code:**
   - `1result.sql` dynamically calculates the total Bourbon Whiskey sales for each zip code in Dubuque County during 2022.
   - It correctly ranks the zip codes based on these sales and selects the zip code that ranks **third**.
   - This ensures that the analysis is accurate and reflects the actual data rather than assuming a specific zip code.

2. **Uses Population Aged 21 and Over:**
   - The script retrieves the population aged 21 and over for the identified zip code from the population dataset.
   - This aligns with the requirement to use only the population aged 21 and older for per capita calculations.

3. **Includes All Months in 2022:**
   - It generates all months in 2022 using the `months` CTE and ensures that each month is represented in the final result.
   - Even if there were no sales in a particular month, the script accounts for it by showing a `0.0` per capita sales figure.
   - This provides a complete monthly view of per capita sales throughout the year.

4. **Proper Calculation of Per Capita Sales:**
   - The script calculates the per capita Bourbon Whiskey sales for each month by dividing the monthly sales by the population aged 21 and over.
   - It rounds the result to four decimal places for clarity.

5. **Clear and Ordered Output:**
   - The final output presents the months in chronological order, making it easy to interpret the data.
   - The per capita sales figures are labeled appropriately, enhancing the readability of the results.

**In contrast**, the other scripts have certain limitations:

- **`0result.sql`:**
  - While it also identifies the third-ranked zip code, it does not account for months with zero sales, potentially overlooking months that should be included with a per capita sales figure of zero.
  - The months are not ordered chronologically, which can make interpretation more difficult.

- **`2result.sql`:**
  - This script assumes that `'52001'` is the third-ranked zip code without calculating the actual rankings based on the data.
  - If `'52001'` is not the third-ranked zip code in terms of Bourbon Whiskey sales, the results will not meet the requirements.
  - It may produce inaccurate analysis due to this assumption.

**Therefore,** based on the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the requirements, **`1result.sql`** is the correct script to use.
