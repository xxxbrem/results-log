After reviewing and comparing the three provided SQL scripts and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct script for calculating the 5-day symmetric moving average of predicted toy sales for December 5 to 8, 2018. Here's the reasoning:

### Reasoning:

1. **Inclusion of Zero Sales Days:**
   - **`1result.sql`** generates a complete sequence of dates from January 1, 2017, to August 29, 2018, using a recursive common table expression (`date_sequence`). This ensures that all days within the period are accounted for, including days with zero sales.
   - By left joining the `daily_toy_sales` onto this sequence, it fills missing days with zero sales (`COALESCE(s."daily_toy_sales", 0)`), providing a more accurate dataset for regression analysis.
   - In contrast, **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** only include dates present in the sales data, potentially omitting days with zero sales. This can bias the regression model and affect the accuracy of predicted sales.

2. **Accurate Regression Modeling:**
   - **`1result.sql`** computes regression coefficients (`slope` and `intercept`) using the full set of daily sales data, including zero sales days. This leads to a more reliable linear regression model that reflects the actual sales trend over time.
   - **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** may produce regression models that are skewed due to the exclusion of zero sales days, which can misrepresent the true sales pattern.

3. **Correct Date Calculations:**
   - **`1result.sql`** carefully calculates the `day_number` for both historical and future dates, ensuring consistency in the time variables used for regression and prediction.
   - The predicted dates for December 3 to 10, 2018, are correctly generated, and their corresponding `day_number` values are accurately calculated based on the difference from the start date (January 1, 2017).
   - The script then uses these `day_number` values to predict future sales using the regression equation.

4. **Accurate Moving Average Computation:**
   - **`1result.sql`** calculates the 5-day symmetric moving average for the dates between December 5 and 8, 2018, by averaging the predicted sales from two days before to two days after each target date.
   - The results are ordered correctly by date, and the total sum of the moving averages is accurately provided.

5. **Output Formatting:**
   - The script outputs the dates and their corresponding 5-day symmetric moving averages in a clear and organized manner.
   - The inclusion of the 'Total Sum' at the end provides the cumulative moving average for the specified dates, as required.

### Conclusion:

Considering the above points, **`1result.sql`** is the SQL script that correctly implements the requirements, providing an accurate calculation of the 5-day symmetric moving averages for the predicted toy sales from December 5 to 8, 2018.
