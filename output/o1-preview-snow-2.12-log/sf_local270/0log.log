Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we'll first identify the relevant tables and columns, consider their potential usage, and then construct SQL queries to explore the data.

---

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`PACKAGING`**
   - **`"id"`**: The unique identifier for packaging containers.
     - *Potential usage*: Identifying packaging containers.
   - **`"name"`**: The name of the packaging container.
     - *Potential usage*: Displaying container names in the output.

2. **`PACKAGING_RELATIONS`**
   - **`"packaging_id"`**: The ID of the parent packaging container.
     - *Potential usage*: Determining which packaging contains other items or packaging.
   - **`"contains_id"`**: The ID of the item or packaging contained within the parent packaging.
     - *Potential usage*: Identifying contents, which could be products or other packaging.
   - **`"qty"`**: The quantity of the contained item or packaging.
     - *Potential usage*: Calculating accumulated quantities across nested levels.

3. **`PRODUCTS`**
   - **`"id"`**: The unique identifier for products.
     - *Potential usage*: Linking contained items to product details.
   - **`"name"`**: The name of the product.
     - *Potential usage*: Displaying item names in the output.
   - **`"group_id"`**: A grouping identifier for products.
     - *Potential usage*: Possibly grouping products; may not be directly relevant to this task.

---

**Conditions and Considerations:**

- **Top-Level Packaging Containers**: Packaging containers that are **not** contained within any other packaging. These are identified by packaging IDs that do **not** appear in the `"contains_id"` column of `PACKAGING_RELATIONS`.
- **Accumulated Quantity**: Total quantity of each item accumulated across all nested levels within a top-level packaging container.
- **Threshold**: We're interested in items where the accumulated quantity exceeds **500**.
- **Hierarchy Traversal**: Since packaging can be nested, we'll need to consider multiple levels of containment to accumulate quantities properly.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **Retrieve All Packaging Containers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING"
   LIMIT 100;

   SELECT "pr"."packaging_id", "pr"."contains_id", "pr"."qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS "pr"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join Packaging Relations with Products to Identify Items:**

     "pr"."contains_id" AS "product_id",
     "pr"."qty",
     "prod"."name" AS "product_name"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS "pr"
   INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" AS "prod"
     ON "pr"."contains_id" = "prod"."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Identify Contained IDs That Refer to Other Packaging (Nested Packaging):**

     "nested_pr"."contains_id" AS "product_id",
     ("top_pr"."qty" * "nested_pr"."qty") AS "total_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS "top_pr"
   INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS "nested_pr"
     ON "top_pr"."contains_id" = "nested_pr"."packaging_id"
   WHERE "top_pr"."packaging_id" IN (

     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING"
     WHERE "id" NOT IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
       FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
     )
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Combine Products and Quantities from Direct and One-Level Nested Packaging:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "top_pack"."name" AS "container_name",
     "prod"."name" AS "item_name",
     SUM("pr"."qty") AS "total_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS "top_pack"
   INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS "pr"
     ON "top_pack"."id" = "pr"."packaging_id"
   INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" AS "prod"
     ON "pr"."contains_id" = "prod"."id"
   WHERE "top_pack"."id" NOT IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
   )
   GROUP BY "top_pack"."name", "prod"."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Identify Containers and Items Where Accumulated Quantity Exceeds 500 (Direct Contents):**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      "top_pack"."name" AS "container_name",
      "prod"."name" AS "item_name",
      SUM("pr"."qty") AS "total_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS "top_pack"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS "pr"
      ON "top_pack"."id" = "pr"."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" AS "prod"
      ON "pr"."contains_id" = "prod"."id"
    WHERE "top_pack"."id" NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
      FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
    )
    GROUP BY "top_pack"."name", "prod"."name"
    HAVING SUM("pr"."qty") > 500
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

      "top_pack"."name" AS "container_name",
      "prod"."name" AS "item_name",
      SUM("top_pr"."qty" * "nested_pr"."qty") AS "total_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS "top_pack"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS "top_pr"
      ON "top_pack"."id" = "top_pr"."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS "nested_pr"
      ON "top_pr"."contains_id" = "nested_pr"."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" AS "prod"
      ON "nested_pr"."contains_id" = "prod"."id"
    WHERE "top_pack"."id" NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
      FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
    )
    GROUP BY "top_pack"."name", "prod"."name"
    HAVING SUM("top_pr"."qty" * "nested_pr"."qty") > 500
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Identify All Item Quantities in Top-Level Packaging Without Nesting (For Comparison):**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      "pr"."packaging_id",
      "pr"."contains_id" AS "product_id",
      "pr"."qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS "pr"
    WHERE "pr"."packaging_id" IN (
      SELECT "id"
      FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING"
      WHERE "id" NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
        FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
      )
    )
    AND "pr"."contains_id" IN (
      SELECT "id" FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS"
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Attempt to Aggregate Quantities Across Multiple Nested Levels (Limited by SQL Capabilities):**

    Since standard SQL in this context does not support recursive queries and we're instructed not to use CTEs, we're limited in our ability to traverse multiple levels of nesting. However, we can attempt to simulate this by joining multiple times (e.g., for two levels of nesting).

    ```sql
    SELECT
      "top_pack"."name" AS "container_name",
      "prod"."name" AS "item_name",
      SUM("top_pr"."qty" * "nested_pr"."qty" * "deep_pr"."qty") AS "total_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS "top_pack"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS "top_pr"
      ON "top_pack"."id" = "top_pr"."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS "nested_pr"
      ON "top_pr"."contains_id" = "nested_pr"."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS "deep_pr"
      ON "nested_pr"."contains_id" = "deep_pr"."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" AS "prod"
      ON "deep_pr"."contains_id" = "prod"."id"
    WHERE "top_pack"."id" NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
      FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
    )
    GROUP BY "top_pack"."name", "prod"."name"
    HAVING SUM("top_pr"."qty" * "nested_pr"."qty" * "deep_pr"."qty") > 500
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These SQL queries help explore the data in the relevant tables and understand how packaging containers and products are related. By examining direct containment and attempting to aggregate quantities across nested levels (within the constraints provided), we can approach solving the task.

**Note:** Due to the limitations specified (no use of CTEs or recursion), fully traversing all nested levels to accurately accumulate quantities may not be feasible with standard SQL in this context. Advanced techniques or recursive queries (e.g., using Common Table Expressions with recursion) would typically be required to navigate arbitrary levels of nesting in hierarchical data structures. However, the provided queries attempt to simulate this traversal within the given constraints.Query:

Task: Which top-level packaging containers, meaning those not contained within any other packaging, have any item for which the total quantity accumulated across all nested levels in the hierarchy exceeds 500, and what are the names of both these containers and the corresponding items?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: We identified the top-level packaging containers that are not contained within any other packaging. For each of these containers, we calculated the total quantity of each item (product) contained within them across all nested levels. We then selected those items for which the accumulated quantity exceeds 500. The table below lists the names of these containers and the corresponding item names.

```csv
Container_Name,Item_Name
container_name1:str,item_name1:str
container_name2:str,item_name2:str
...

When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PURCHASES', 'LOCATIONS', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_PAGES', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'ORDERS', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'PICKING_LINE', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'INVENTORY', 'PACKAGING', 'PICKING_LIST', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 11:32:01 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which top-level packaging containers, meaning those not contained within any other packaging, have any item for which the total quantity accumulated across all nested levels in the hierarchy exceeds 500, and what are the names of both these containers and the corresponding items?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: We identified the top-level packaging containers that are not contained within any other packaging. For each of these containers, we calculated the total quantity of each item (product) contained within them across all nested levels. We then selected those items for which the accumulated quantity exceeds 500. The table below lists the names of these containers and the corresponding item names.

```csv
Container_Name,Item_Name
container_name1:str,item_name1:str
container_name2:str,item_name2:str
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
