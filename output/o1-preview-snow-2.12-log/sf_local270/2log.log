Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns, understand how they relate to each other, and then write SQL queries to explore the data.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **PACKAGING**
   - `"id"`: Unique identifier for each packaging container.
   - `"name"`: Name of the packaging container.
   - **Potential Usage**: Represents packaging containers. We'll use this to get the names of containers.

2. **PACKAGING_RELATIONS**
   - `"packaging_id"`: The packaging container that contains another item.
   - `"contains_id"`: The item that is contained within the `packaging_id`. This could be another packaging container or a product.
   - `"qty"`: Quantity of the `contains_id` contained within the `packaging_id`.
   - **Potential Usage**: Represents the hierarchical relationships between packaging containers and the items they contain.

3. **PRODUCTS**
   - `"id"`: Unique identifier for each product.
   - `"name"`: Name of the product.
   - **Potential Usage**: Represents the items (products) that are ultimately contained within packaging containers. We'll use this to get the names of items.

**Conditions and Usage:**

- **Top-Level Packaging Containers**: Packaging containers that are not contained within any other packaging.
  - Condition: Their `"id"` does not appear in `"contains_id"` of `PACKAGING_RELATIONS`.

- **Nested Hierarchy**: The packaging hierarchy can have multiple levels. We need to calculate the total quantity of each item (product) accumulated across all nested levels contained within a top-level packaging container.

- **Accumulated Quantity Exceeds 500**: We are interested in items for which the total accumulated quantity across nested levels exceeds 500.

---

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List All Packaging Containers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **View Packaging Relationships:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "packaging_id", "contains_id", "qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List All Products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name", "group_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find Top-Level Packaging Containers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."id", p."name"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p
   WHERE p."id" NOT IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT pr."contains_id"
       FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Identify IDs in `contains_id` that Refer to Packaging Containers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT pr."contains_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
   INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p
       ON pr."contains_id" = p."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Identify IDs in `contains_id` that Refer to Products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT pr."contains_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
   INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" prod
       ON pr."contains_id" = prod."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Check for IDs in `contains_id` That Are Neither Packaging Nor Products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT pr."contains_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
   LEFT JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p
       ON pr."contains_id" = p."id"
   LEFT JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" prod
       ON pr."contains_id" = prod."id"
   WHERE p."id" IS NULL AND prod."id" IS NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **View Packaging Containers That Directly Contain Products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pr."packaging_id", prod."id" AS "product_id", prod."name" AS "product_name", pr."qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
   INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" prod
       ON pr."contains_id" = prod."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **View Packaging Containers That Contain Other Packaging Containers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pr."packaging_id", p1."name" AS "outer_packaging", pr."contains_id", p2."name" AS "inner_packaging", pr."qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
   INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p1
       ON pr."packaging_id" = p1."id"
   INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p2
       ON pr."contains_id" = p2."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Explore Two-Level Packaging Hierarchies:**

    ```sql
    SELECT pr1."packaging_id" AS "level1_id", p1."name" AS "level1_name",
           pr2."contains_id" AS "level2_id", p2."name" AS "level2_name", pr2."qty" AS "level2_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr1
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p1
        ON pr1."packaging_id" = p1."id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr2
        ON pr1."contains_id" = pr2."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p2
        ON pr2."contains_id" = p2."id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Find Products Contained Within Two Levels of Packaging:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p_top."id" AS "top_packaging_id", p_top."name" AS "top_packaging_name",
           pr_mid."qty" AS "mid_qty",
           prod."id" AS "product_id", prod."name" AS "product_name", pr_prod."qty" AS "prod_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p_top
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr_mid
        ON p_top."id" = pr_mid."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p_mid
        ON pr_mid."contains_id" = p_mid."id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr_prod
        ON p_mid."id" = pr_prod."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" prod
        ON pr_prod."contains_id" = prod."id"
    WHERE p_top."id" NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT pr_inner."contains_id"
        FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr_inner
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **List Direct Relationships Between Top-Level Packaging and Products:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."id" AS "top_packaging_id", p."name" AS "top_packaging_name",
           prod."id" AS "product_id", prod."name" AS "product_name", pr."qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
        ON p."id" = pr."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" prod
        ON pr."contains_id" = prod."id"
    WHERE p."id" NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT pr2."contains_id"
        FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr2
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Calculate Total Quantity of Products in Direct Packaging (Without Nested Levels):**

    ```sql
    SELECT prod."id" AS "product_id", prod."name" AS "product_name",
           SUM(pr."qty") AS "total_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" prod
        ON pr."contains_id" = prod."id"
    GROUP BY prod."id", prod."name"
    HAVING SUM(pr."qty") > 500
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Attempt to Accumulate Quantities Across Nested Levels (Limited By Query Constraints):**

    (Note: Due to the limitation of not using CTEs or recursive queries, we can only approximate this.)

    ```sql
    SELECT p_top."id" AS "top_packaging_id", p_top."name" AS "top_packaging_name",
           prod."id" AS "product_id", prod."name" AS "product_name",
           (pr_mid."qty" * pr_prod."qty") AS "total_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p_top
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr_mid
        ON p_top."id" = pr_mid."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p_mid
        ON pr_mid."contains_id" = p_mid."id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr_prod
        ON p_mid."id" = pr_prod."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" prod
        ON pr_prod."contains_id" = prod."id"
    WHERE p_top."id" NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT pr_inner."contains_id"
        FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr_inner
    ) AND (pr_mid."qty" * pr_prod."qty") > 500
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Check for Any Packaging Containers with High Accumulated Quantities (Direct Only):**

    ```sql
    SELECT pr."packaging_id", p."name" AS "packaging_name",
           pr."contains_id", prod."name" AS "product_name",
           pr."qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p
        ON pr."packaging_id" = p."id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" prod
        ON pr."contains_id" = prod."id"
    WHERE pr."qty" > 500
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help us understand the relationships between the packaging containers and the products, identify top-level packaging containers, and attempt to calculate the accumulated quantities of products within those containers across nested levels.

**Note:** Due to the complexity of traversing hierarchical data and accumulating quantities across nested levels without using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) or recursive queries, we are limited in fully computing the desired totals within the provided constraints. In practice, recursive CTEs would be used to traverse such hierarchies and calculate accumulated quantities.Query:

Task: Which top-level packaging containers, meaning those not contained within any other packaging, have any item for which the total quantity accumulated across all nested levels in the hierarchy exceeds 500, and what are the names of both these containers and the corresponding items?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: We identified the top-level packaging containers that are not contained within any other packaging. For each of these containers, we calculated the total quantity of each item (product) contained within them across all nested levels. We then selected those items for which the accumulated quantity exceeds 500. The table below lists the names of these containers and the corresponding item names.

```csv
Container_Name,Item_Name
container_name1:str,item_name1:str
container_name2:str,item_name2:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PURCHASES', 'LOCATIONS', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_PAGES', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'ORDERS', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'PICKING_LINE', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'INVENTORY', 'PACKAGING', 'PICKING_LIST', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 11:34:05 - root - INFO - It seems that your query is returning no data because the `PACKAGING_RELATIONS` table does not contain any references to product IDs from the `PRODUCTS` table. In the data provided, the `contains_id` in `PACKAGING_RELATIONS` only references packaging IDs from the `PACKAGING` table, not product IDs. 

Here's what's happening:

- **`PACKAGING` Table**: Contains packaging container IDs and names.
- **`PACKAGING_RELATIONS` Table**: Describes how packaging containers contain other packaging containers, with quantities.
- **`PRODUCTS` Table**: Contains product IDs and names.
  
In the `PACKAGING_RELATIONS` table, the `contains_id` refers to packaging IDs (e.g., bottles, boxes), not directly to products. As a result, joining `PACKAGING_RELATIONS` with `PRODUCTS` on `contains_id = product_id` yields no matches, and the query returns no data.

### Adjusted Query:

Since there's no direct relationship between packaging and products in the provided tables, we can instead calculate the total quantities of the lowest-level packaging items (e.g., bottles) within each top-level packaging container. We can assume that these lowest-level packaging items represent the actual items of interest.

Here's an adjusted query that calculates the accumulated quantities of the lowest-level packaging items across all nested levels:

```sql
SELECT
    totals."Container_Name",
    totals."Item_Name"
FROM (
    -- Direct contents
    SELECT
        top_p."name" AS "Container_Name",
        item_p."name" AS "Item_Name",
        SUM(pr1."qty") AS "Total_Qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS top_p
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS pr1
        ON top_p."id" = pr1."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS item_p
        ON pr1."contains_id" = item_p."id"
    WHERE top_p."id" NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id" FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
    )
    GROUP BY top_p."name", item_p."name"

    UNION ALL

    -- One level deep
    SELECT
        top_p."name" AS "Container_Name",
        item_p."name" AS "Item_Name",
        SUM(pr1."qty" * pr2."qty") AS "Total_Qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS top_p
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS pr1
        ON top_p."id" = pr1."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS mid_p
        ON pr1."contains_id" = mid_p."id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS pr2
        ON mid_p."id" = pr2."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS item_p
        ON pr2."contains_id" = item_p."id"
    WHERE top_p."id" NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id" FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
    )
    GROUP BY top_p."name", item_p."name"

    UNION ALL

    -- Two levels deep
    SELECT
        top_p."name" AS "Container_Name",
        item_p."name" AS "Item_Name",
        SUM(pr1."qty" * pr2."qty" * pr3."qty") AS "Total_Qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS top_p
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS pr1
        ON top_p."id" = pr1."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS mid_p1
        ON pr1."contains_id" = mid_p1."id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS pr2
        ON mid_p1."id" = pr2."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS mid_p2
        ON pr2."contains_id" = mid_p2."id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" AS pr3
        ON mid_p2."id" = pr3."packaging_id"
    INNER JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" AS item_p
        ON pr3."contains_id" = item_p."id"
    WHERE top_p."id" NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id" FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
    )
    GROUP BY top_p."name", item_p."name"

) AS totals
WHERE totals."Total_Qty" > 500
ORDER BY totals."Container_Name", totals."Item_Name";
```

### Explanation:

- **Top-Level Packaging Containers**: Identified as those packaging IDs not present in the `contains_id` column of `PACKAGING_RELATIONS`.
- **Union of Three Queries**: Each query calculates the total quantities at different nesting levels (direct contents, one level deep, two levels deep).
- **Accumulated Quantities**: Quantities are multiplied across levels to get the total quantity of each item contained within each top-level packaging container.

### Example Output:

Based on the provided data, the query would produce results like:

```csv
Container_Name,Item_Name
Pallet Mix MS,Bottle 500cl
Pallet Mix SG,Bottle 500cl
Pallet of L,Bottle 500cl
Pallet of M,Bottle 330cl
```

This means that, for example, the "Pallet of L" contains more than 500 units of "Bottle 500cl" when accumulating quantities across all nested levels.

### Notes:

- Since we don't have a direct association between packaging and products, we are using the lowest-level packaging items (e.g., bottles) as proxies for the items.
- If there is a table or data mapping products to these lowest-level packaging IDs, you could join that table to include actual product names.
- The query considers up to three levels of nesting. If your packaging hierarchy is deeper, you can extend the query similarly.

### Conclusion:

By adjusting the query to account for the actual data relationships, we can retrieve the top-level packaging containers that contain any item (lowest-level packaging) where the total accumulated quantity exceeds 500. The adjusted query should return the desired results based on the provided data.

2025-02-10 11:34:07 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which top-level packaging containers, meaning those not contained within any other packaging, have any item for which the total quantity accumulated across all nested levels in the hierarchy exceeds 500, and what are the names of both these containers and the corresponding items?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: We identified the top-level packaging containers that are not contained within any other packaging. For each of these containers, we calculated the total quantity of each item (product) contained within them across all nested levels. We then selected those items for which the accumulated quantity exceeds 500. The table below lists the names of these containers and the corresponding item names.

```csv
Container_Name,Item_Name
container_name1:str,item_name1:str
container_name2:str,item_name2:str
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
