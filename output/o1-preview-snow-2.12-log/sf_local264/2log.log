Begin Exploring Related Columns
Firstly, to address the task, we need to identify which tables and columns are relevant.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"MODEL"`
    - **Column:** `"L1_model"` - *Potential Usage:* This column contains the model categories. We can use it to identify and count the occurrences of each model category.
    - **Column:** `"version"` - *Potential Usage:* Represents different versions. We can aggregate counts across different versions.
    - **Column:** `"step"` - *Potential Usage:* Represents different steps. We can aggregate counts across different steps.
    - **Conditions that may be used:**
        - Comparing traditional models to the Stack model by filtering or grouping based on the `"L1_model"` values.
        - Filtering data for specific versions or steps if needed.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **Retrieve all distinct model categories (`L1_model`):**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "L1_model"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **Count the total number of occurrences of each model category:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Total_Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    ORDER BY "Total_Count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **List all records from the `MODEL` table to view the data structure:**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Count occurrences of each model category across different versions:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", "version", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    GROUP BY "L1_model", "version"
    ORDER BY "L1_model", "version"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **Count occurrences of each model category across different steps:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", "step", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    GROUP BY "L1_model", "step"
    ORDER BY "L1_model", "step"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Retrieve all distinct versions available:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "version"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Retrieve all distinct steps available:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "step"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. **Count total occurrences comparing traditional models to the Stack model:**

    (Assuming "Stack Model" is a specific value in `"L1_model"`)

    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Total_Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    WHERE "L1_model" ILIKE '%Stack%'
       OR "L1_model" NOT ILIKE '%Stack%'
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    ORDER BY "Total_Count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **Retrieve records where `L1_model` contains 'Stack':**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    WHERE "L1_model" ILIKE '%Stack%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **Retrieve records where `L1_model` does not contain 'Stack' (traditional models):**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    WHERE "L1_model" NOT ILIKE '%Stack%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Count total records in the `MODEL` table:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total_Records"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL";
    ```

12. **Find versions where the Stack model is used:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "version"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    WHERE "L1_model" ILIKE '%Stack%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Find steps where the Stack model is used:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "step"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    WHERE "L1_model" ILIKE '%Stack%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Count distinct model categories used per version:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "version", COUNT(DISTINCT "L1_model") AS "Model_Category_Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    GROUP BY "version"
    ORDER BY "version"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **List the number of times each model category appears per step:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "step", "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    GROUP BY "step", "L1_model"
    ORDER BY "step", "Count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries are designed to help us explore the data within the `MODEL` table and understand the distribution of model categories (`L1_model`) across different steps and versions. By analyzing the results of these queries, we can identify which model category appears most frequently and how traditional models compare to the Stack model in terms of their occurrences.

**Note:** Since we do not have the actual data values, the queries above make logical assumptions. For instance, we assume that the Stack model can be identified in the `"L1_model"` column by values containing 'Stack'. The `ILIKE` operator is used for case-insensitive matching in SQL.Query:

Task: Which model category (L1_model) appears the most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, and what is the total count of its occurrences?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
L1_model,Total_Count
model_name:str,count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To identify the model category (`L1_model`) that appears most frequently across all steps and versions, we count the number of occurrences of each `L1_model` in the `MODEL` table. The one with the highest total count is the most frequently appearing model category..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKING': {'STACKING': ['EDA', 'FEATURE_IMPORTANCE', 'MODEL', 'MODEL_IMPORTANCE', 'MODEL_SCORE', 'PROBLEM', 'SOLUTION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-21 17:29:43 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which model category (L1_model) appears the most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, and what is the total count of its occurrences?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
L1_model,Total_Count
model_name:str,count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To identify the model category (`L1_model`) that appears most frequently across all steps and versions, we count the number of occurrences of each `L1_model` in the `MODEL` table. The one with the highest total count is the most frequently appearing model category. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
Current snswer: 
L1_model,Total_Count
regression,213
Current sql:
SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Total_Count"
FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
GROUP BY "L1_model"
ORDER BY "Total_Count" DESC
LIMIT 1;When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
