After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that `1result.sql` is the correct SQL to use.

**Reasoning:**

1. **QUADKEY Filtering:**

   - **`0result.sql`:** Uses `LEFT("QUADKEY", 8) = '12020210'` to filter the data. This approach only matches QUADKEYs that are exactly 8 characters long, potentially excluding records where the QUADKEY is longer but starts with these digits.
   - **`1result.sql`:** Uses `"QUADKEY" LIKE '12020210%'`, which matches any QUADKEY that starts with '12020210', regardless of its length. This ensures all relevant records for Amsterdam and Rotterdam are included.

2. **Handling Empty or Null `LENGTH_M` Values:**

   - **`0result.sql`:** Uses `CAST("LENGTH_M" AS FLOAT)` without handling empty strings or null values, which can cause errors or exclude valid data when `LENGTH_M` is empty.
   - **`1result.sql`:** Incorporates `NULLIF("LENGTH_M", '')` to convert empty strings to `NULL` before casting. This prevents errors during the casting process and includes all records with valid length values.

3. **Data Completeness and Accuracy:**

   - **`1result.sql`** includes an additional condition `AND "LENGTH_M" <> ''` in the `WHERE` clause to ensure only records with non-empty `LENGTH_M` are considered.
   - The results from `1result.sql` (`1result.csv`) show higher total road lengths, indicating a more comprehensive aggregation of the data.

4. **Ordering Results:**

   - **`1result.sql`:** Includes an `ORDER BY` clause that sorts the results by "City" and "Total_Road_Length_meters" in descending order, enhancing readability and analysis.

**Conclusion:**

The query in `1result.sql` is more robust and accurate due to its comprehensive filtering and handling of data anomalies, leading to more reliable results.
