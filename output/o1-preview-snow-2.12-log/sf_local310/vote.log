**Reasoning:**

Both SQL queries aim to find the races where the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor is smallest, using only the data from the `RESULTS` table. However, since the `RESULTS` table lacks explicit `year` information and only contains `race_id`s, both queries operate on a per-race basis rather than per-year.

Upon comparing the two SQL queries:

- **Similarity:** Both queries calculate the maximum points earned by any driver and constructor per race and sum those values to find the total per race.
  
- **Differences:**
  
  - **Ordering:** 
    - **1result.sql** orders the results by the total sum in ascending order, but does not specify how to handle ties.
    - **2result.sql** orders the results by the total sum in ascending order and then by `race_id` ascending to handle ties consistently.
  
  - **Precision:**
    - **2result.sql** uses the `ROUND` function to round the total sum, ensuring numerical consistency in the output.

Given these differences, **`2result.sql`** provides a more precise and consistent result due to the additional ordering by `race_id` and the use of `ROUND` for numerical accuracy. This ensures that in cases where multiple races have the same total points, the races are listed in order of their `race_id`, providing a deterministic and reproducible output.

**Conclusion:**

- **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer because it handles ordering more precisely and provides consistent results when there are ties in the total points.
- The output lists the races in ascending order of total points and `race_id`, adhering to the requirement of listing the three instances in order of ascending total.
