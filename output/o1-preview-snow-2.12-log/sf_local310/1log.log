Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Columns in the `RESULTS` Table and Their Potential Usage:**

- `"race_id"`: Identifies each race. Potentially could be used to infer the year if there is a sequential or identifiable pattern.
- `"driver_id"`: Identifies each driver. Used to calculate total points per driver.
- `"constructor_id"`: Identifies each constructor. Used to calculate total points per constructor.
- `"points"`: The points earned by a driver (and thus a constructor) in a specific race. Essential for summing up total points.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Grouping by `"driver_id"` and `"race_id"` to calculate total points per driver per race.
- Grouping by `"constructor_id"` and `"race_id"` to calculate total points per constructor per race.
- Attempting to identify patterns or ranges in `"race_id"` that could correspond to specific years.

**Exploratory SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve Distinct Race IDs**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "race_id"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   ORDER BY "race_id" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count Results per Race ID**

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", COUNT(*) AS "result_count"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   GROUP BY "race_id"
   ORDER BY "race_id" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Calculate Total Points per Driver per Race**

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "total_driver_points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   GROUP BY "race_id", "driver_id"
   ORDER BY "race_id", "driver_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Calculate Total Points per Constructor per Race**

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "constructor_id", SUM("points") AS "total_constructor_points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   GROUP BY "race_id", "constructor_id"
   ORDER BY "race_id", "constructor_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find Minimum and Maximum Race IDs**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("race_id") AS "min_race_id", MAX("race_id") AS "max_race_id"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS";
   ```

6. **Attempt to Infer Year Ranges from Race IDs**

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id",
          NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY "race_id") AS "race_id_decile"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   GROUP BY "race_id"
   ORDER BY "race_id" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Total Points per Driver Across All Races**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   GROUP BY "driver_id"
   ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Total Points per Constructor Across All Races**

   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   GROUP BY "constructor_id"
   ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Aggregate Total Points per Race ID**

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id",
          SUM("points") AS "total_race_points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   GROUP BY "race_id"
   ORDER BY "race_id" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Identify Possible Year Groupings by Race ID**

    ```sql
    SELECT "race_id", COUNT(*) AS "entries_per_race"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
    GROUP BY "race_id"
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
    ORDER BY "race_id" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Explanation:**

These queries are designed to explore the data within the `RESULTS` table to determine if it's possible to infer the years associated with each `race_id`. However, the `RESULTS` table lacks explicit `year` information, and without access to a mapping between `race_id` and `year` (which would typically be found in the `RACES` table), we cannot accurately associate races with their respective years.

**Conclusion:**

Given that the `RESULTS` table does not contain `year` data and we're restricted to using only this table, it's not possible to perform the required analysis to find the three years with the smallest sums as specified in the task. The absence of `year` information means we cannot aggregate the data on a yearly basis, making it impossible to complete the task under the given constraints.Query:

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Using only the data from the ‘results’ table, find the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor in that year (both calculated by summing up points from the ‘results’ table) is smallest, and list those three years in order of ascending total.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Unfortunately, the `results` table does not contain the `year` information for each race, as it only includes `race_id`, `driver_id`, `constructor_id`, and other race-related data. Without access to the `races` table, which maps `race_id` to `year`, we cannot determine the years for each race based solely on the `results` table. Therefore, it's not possible to complete the task using only the data from the `results` table..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'RACES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'CIRCUITS', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'SEASONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'RESULTS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES_EXT', 'STATUS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Error Message
Cannot complete the task using only the RESULTS table because it lacks year information.


2025-02-10 10:08:20 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Using only the data from the ‘results’ table, find the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor in that year (both calculated by summing up points from the ‘results’ table) is smallest, and list those three years in order of ascending total., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Unfortunately, the `results` table does not contain the `year` information for each race, as it only includes `race_id`, `driver_id`, `constructor_id`, and other race-related data. Without access to the `races` table, which maps `race_id` to `year`, we cannot determine the years for each race based solely on the `results` table. Therefore, it's not possible to complete the task using only the data from the `results` table. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
