Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"race_id"**: Potential usage - Used to group results by race. However, without a direct mapping to "year" within the "RESULTS" table, it's challenging to determine the year for each race.
- **"driver_id"**: Potential usage - Identifies drivers. Can be used to calculate total points per driver.
- **"constructor_id"**: Potential usage - Identifies constructors. Can be used to calculate total points per constructor.
- **"points"**: Potential usage - Points earned in each result. Essential for calculating total points for drivers and constructors.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Grouping by "race_id", "driver_id", and "constructor_id" to calculate total points.
- Aggregating "points" to find the highest totals.
- Ordering results to identify the highest or lowest point earners.
- Since "year" is not available, attempting to infer it from "race_id" is not reliable without additional information.

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "race_id") AS "total_races"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS;
   ```

3. **Calculate total points per driver across all races:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "driver_id"
   ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
   LIMIT 100;

   SELECT "constructor_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "constructor_id"
   ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find the highest points scored by a driver in a single race:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "race_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "race_id", "driver_id"
   ORDER BY "race_points" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "constructor_id", SUM("points") AS "race_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "race_id", "constructor_id"
   ORDER BY "race_points" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate total points per driver per race:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "driver_race_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "race_id", "driver_id"
   ORDER BY "race_id", "driver_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate total points per constructor per race:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "constructor_id", SUM("points") AS "constructor_race_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "race_id", "constructor_id"
   ORDER BY "race_id", "constructor_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List the results with highest points awarded:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "result_id", "race_id", "driver_id", "constructor_id", "points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   ORDER BY "points" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count the number of drivers per race:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "race_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "driver_id") AS "drivers_count"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
    GROUP BY "race_id"
    ORDER BY "race_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Count the number of constructors per race:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "race_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "constructor_id") AS "constructors_count"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
    GROUP BY "race_id"
    ORDER BY "race_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Find the maximum points by any driver per race:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "race_id", MAX("points") AS "max_driver_points"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
    GROUP BY "race_id"
    ORDER BY "race_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Find the maximum points by any constructor per race:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "race_id", MAX("points") AS "max_constructor_points"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
    GROUP BY "race_id"
    ORDER BY "race_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Aggregate total points per race:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "race_id", SUM("points") AS "total_race_points"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
    GROUP BY "race_id"
    ORDER BY "race_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **List all results with their corresponding points:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "result_id", "race_id", "driver_id", "constructor_id", "points"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Conclusion:**

After exploring the "RESULTS" table and considering the available columns, it becomes clear that the table lacks a "year" column or any direct temporal information that associates "race_id" with a specific year. The "race_id" values alone do not provide sufficient information to infer the year of each race.

As a result, it is not possible to determine the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor is smallest using only the data from the "RESULTS" table.

**Explanation:**

- **Lack of Year Information:** The "RESULTS" table does not contain a "year" column, and "race_id" cannot be reliably mapped to a year without additional information from the "RACES" table.
- **Inability to Group by Year:** Without knowing which races occurred in which years, we cannot aggregate points on a yearly basis.
- **Task Requires Yearly Aggregation:** The task specifically asks for the sum of points per year, which is not possible with the given data.

---

**Summary:**

Given the limitations of the data in the "RESULTS" table, it is not feasible to complete the task as specified. Access to the "RACES" table or any other table containing a mapping of "race_id" to "year" would be necessary to perform the required analysis.Query:

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Using only the data from the ‘results’ table, find the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor in that year (both calculated by summing up points from the ‘results’ table) is smallest, and list those three years in order of ascending total.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Unfortunately, the `results` table does not contain the `year` information for each race, as it only includes `race_id`, `driver_id`, `constructor_id`, and other race-related data. Without access to the `races` table, which maps `race_id` to `year`, we cannot determine the years for each race based solely on the `results` table. Therefore, it's not possible to complete the task using only the data from the `results` table..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'RACES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'CIRCUITS', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'SEASONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'RESULTS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES_EXT', 'STATUS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

The answer format should be like: Unfortunately, the `results` table does not contain the `year` information for each race, as it only includes `race_id`, `driver_id`, `constructor_id`, and other race-related data. Without access to the `races` table, which maps `race_id` to `year`, we cannot determine the years for each race based solely on the `results` table.
