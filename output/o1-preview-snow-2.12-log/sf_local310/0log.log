Begin Exploring Related Columns
After reviewing the task and the available data, I have attempted to determine whether it's possible to complete the task using only the data from the `RESULTS` table.

**Relevant Table and Columns:**

- **Table:** `F1.F1.RESULTS`
- **Columns:**
  - `"race_id"`: Identifier for each race.
    - **Potential Usage:** Used to group results by race. However, without access to a mapping between `race_id` and `year`, we cannot determine the year of each race.
  - `"driver_id"`: Identifier for each driver.
    - **Potential Usage:** Used to calculate total points for each driver.
  - `"constructor_id"`: Identifier for each constructor.
    - **Potential Usage:** Used to calculate total points for each constructor.
  - `"points"`: Points earned by the driver in a race.
    - **Potential Usage:** Used to sum up points for drivers and constructors.

**Conditions and Limitations:**

- The `RESULTS` table does **not** contain a `year` column or any date-related information.
- Without the `RACES` table or any other table that maps `race_id` to a specific year, we cannot determine the year in which each race took place.
- Making assumptions about the relationship between `race_id` and `year` (e.g., assuming `race_id` increments over time) would not be based on the data provided and would violate the constraint of using only the data from the `RESULTS` table.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

Here are SQL queries designed to understand the structure and contents of the `RESULTS` table:

1. **List distinct `race_id` values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "race_id"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   ORDER BY "race_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the number of results per `race_id`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", COUNT(*) AS "num_results"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "race_id"
   ORDER BY "race_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find the range of `race_id` values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("race_id") AS "min_race_id", MAX("race_id") AS "max_race_id"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS;
   ```

4. **Count the total number of distinct races:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "race_id") AS "total_races"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS;
   ```

5. **List `race_id` and corresponding `result_id`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "result_id"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   ORDER BY "race_id", "result_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate total points per driver across all races:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "driver_id"
   ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate total points per constructor across all races:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "constructor_id"
   ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Sum of points per driver within each race:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "driver_points_in_race"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "race_id", "driver_id"
   ORDER BY "race_id", "driver_points_in_race" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Sum of points per constructor within each race:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "constructor_id", SUM("points") AS "constructor_points_in_race"
   FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
   GROUP BY "race_id", "constructor_id"
   ORDER BY "race_id", "constructor_points_in_race" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List the number of drivers in each race:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "race_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "driver_id") AS "num_drivers"
    FROM F1.F1.RESULTS
    GROUP BY "race_id"
    ORDER BY "race_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Conclusion:**

- The `RESULTS` table lacks any date or year information that would allow us to group the results by year.
- Without the ability to associate each `race_id` with a specific year, we cannot calculate the total points per driver or constructor for each year.
- Therefore, it's **not possible** to determine the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor is smallest, using only the data from the `RESULTS` table.

**Answer:**

Unfortunately, based on the data available in the `RESULTS` table alone, it's not possible to complete the task as specified. The `RESULTS` table does not include any date or year information, and without access to the `RACES` table (which contains the mapping between `race_id` and `year`), we cannot determine the years associated with each race.

**Explanation:**

- **Year Information Missing:** The critical piece of information required to complete the task is the year in which each race took place. This information is not present in the `RESULTS` table.
- **Data Integrity:** Making assumptions about the relationship between `race_id` and `year` (such as assuming that `race_id` values increment sequentially by year) would violate the instruction to use only the data provided and to avoid external knowledge.
- **Constraint Compliance:** To respect the constraints of the task, we cannot utilize other tables or make unsupported assumptions.

Therefore, we cannot provide the three years in question or compute the required sums using only the data from the `RESULTS` table.Query:

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Using only the data from the ‘results’ table, find the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor in that year (both calculated by summing up points from the ‘results’ table) is smallest, and list those three years in order of ascending total.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Unfortunately, the `results` table does not contain the `year` information for each race, as it only includes `race_id`, `driver_id`, `constructor_id`, and other race-related data. Without access to the `races` table, which maps `race_id` to `year`, we cannot determine the years for each race based solely on the `results` table. Therefore, it's not possible to complete the task using only the data from the `results` table..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'RACES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'CIRCUITS', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'SEASONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'RESULTS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES_EXT', 'STATUS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Unfortunately, the `results` table does not contain the `year` information for each race, as it only includes `race_id`, `driver_id`, `constructor_id`, and other race-related data. Without access to the `races` table, which maps `race_id` to `year`, we cannot determine the years for each race based solely on the `results` table. Therefore, it's not possible to complete the task using only the data from the `results` table. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
