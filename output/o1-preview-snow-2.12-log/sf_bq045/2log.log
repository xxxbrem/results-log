Begin Exploring Related Columns
Firstly, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns that can help us answer the task.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS`
   - **"usaf"**: Station identifier; potential usage: match with "stn" in GSOD tables.
   - **"name"**: Station name; potential usage: provide station names in the final output.
   - **"state"**: State abbreviation; potential usage: filter stations located in Washington State ("WA").
   - **"lat"**: Latitude; potential usage: verify station location if needed.
   - **"lon"**: Longitude; potential usage: verify station location if needed.

2. **Table:** `NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2022`
   - **"stn"**: Station identifier; potential usage: match with "usaf" in STATIONS table.
   - **"year"**: Year of the record; potential usage: confirm the year is 2022.
   - **"mo"**: Month of the record.
   - **"da"**: Day of the record.
   - **"prcp"**: Precipitation in millimeters; potential usage: determine if a day is a "rainy day".
   - **"flag_prcp"**: Precipitation data quality flag; potential usage: identify valid precipitation data.

3. **Table:** `NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2023`
   - **Same columns as GSOD2022 with data for the year 2023.**

**Conditions to consider:**

- **Rainy day definition:** "`prcp`" > 0 and "`prcp`" != 99.99 (excluding invalid data and specific invalid value 99.99).
- **Valid precipitation data:** Exclude records where "`prcp`" = 99.99 or is NULL.
- **Stations in Washington State:** Filter stations where "`state`" = 'WA'.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all stations in Washington State:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "usaf", "name", "state"
   FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS
   WHERE "state" = 'WA'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get distinct station IDs from GSOD2022:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "stn"
   FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2022
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get precipitation data for Washington stations in 2022:**

   ```sql
   SELECT g."stn", g."year", g."mo", g."da", g."prcp", g."flag_prcp"
   FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2022 g
   JOIN NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS s ON g."stn" = s."usaf"
   WHERE s."state" = 'WA'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get precipitation data for Washington stations in 2023:**

   ```sql
   SELECT g."stn", g."year", g."mo", g."da", g."prcp", g."flag_prcp"
   FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2023 g
   JOIN NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS s ON g."stn" = s."usaf"
   WHERE s."state" = 'WA'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find rainy days for Washington stations in 2022:**

   ```sql
   SELECT g."stn", g."year", g."mo", g."da", g."prcp"
   FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2022 g
   JOIN NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS s ON g."stn" = s."usaf"
   WHERE s."state" = 'WA'
     AND g."prcp" > 0
     AND g."prcp" != 99.99
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find rainy days for Washington stations in 2023:**

   ```sql
   SELECT g."stn", g."year", g."mo", g."da", g."prcp"
   FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2023 g
   JOIN NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS s ON g."stn" = s."usaf"
   WHERE s."state" = 'WA'
     AND g."prcp" > 0
     AND g."prcp" != 99.99
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count rainy days per station in Washington for 2022:**

   ```sql
   SELECT g."stn", COUNT(*) AS "rainy_days_2022"
   FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2022 g
   JOIN NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS s ON g."stn" = s."usaf"
   WHERE s."state" = 'WA'
     AND g."prcp" > 0
     AND g."prcp" != 99.99
   GROUP BY g."stn"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count rainy days per station in Washington for 2023:**

   ```sql
   SELECT g."stn", COUNT(*) AS "rainy_days_2023"
   FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2023 g
   JOIN NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS s ON g."stn" = s."usaf"
   WHERE s."state" = 'WA'
     AND g."prcp" > 0
     AND g."prcp" != 99.99
   GROUP BY g."stn"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List stations with invalid precipitation data in 2022:**

   ```sql
   SELECT g."stn", g."year", g."mo", g."da", g."prcp"
   FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2022 g
   WHERE g."prcp" = 99.99
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Check the distribution of "flag_prcp" values in 2022:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT g."flag_prcp"
    FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2022 g
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Retrieve precipitation records for a specific station in 2022:**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2022
    WHERE "stn" = '#####'
    LIMIT 100;

    JOIN NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS s ON g."stn" = s."usaf"
    WHERE s."state" = 'WA'
      AND g."prcp" != 99.99
    GROUP BY g."stn"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Identify stations with no rainy days in 2022:**

    ```sql
    SELECT g."stn"
    FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2022 g
    JOIN NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS s ON g."stn" = s."usaf"
    WHERE s."state" = 'WA'
    GROUP BY g."stn"
    HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN g."prcp" > 0 AND g."prcp" != 99.99 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Get the list of stations with partial data in 2022:**

    ```sql
    SELECT g."stn", COUNT(*) AS "recorded_days_2022"
    FROM NOAA_DATA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2022 g
    WHERE g."year" = '2022'
    GROUP BY g."stn"
    HAVING COUNT(*) < 365
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Which weather stations in Washington State recorded more than 150 rainy days in 2023 but fewer rainy days compared to 2022? Defining a “rainy day” as one having precipitation greater than zero millimeters and not equal to 99.99. Only include stations with valid precipitation data.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The following table lists the weather stations in Washington State that recorded more than 150 rainy days in 2023 but fewer rainy days compared to 2022. Only stations with valid precipitation data are included, and a "rainy day" is defined as one with precipitation greater than zero millimeters and not equal to 99.99.

```csv
station_id,station_name,number_of_rainy_days_2023,number_of_rainy_days_2022
station_id1:str,station_name1:str,count_2023:int,count_2022:int
station_id2:str,station_name2:str,count_2023:int,count_2022:int
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-12 17:05:42 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which weather stations in Washington State recorded more than 150 rainy days in 2023 but fewer rainy days compared to 2022? Defining a “rainy day” as one having precipitation greater than zero millimeters and not equal to 99.99. Only include stations with valid precipitation data., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The following table lists the weather stations in Washington State that recorded more than 150 rainy days in 2023 but fewer rainy days compared to 2022. Only stations with valid precipitation data are included, and a "rainy day" is defined as one with precipitation greater than zero millimeters and not equal to 99.99.

station_id2:str,station_name2:str,count_2023:int,count_2022:int
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
