After comparing the SQL queries and their outputs, the most appropriate and accurate SQL script is **Candidate 2result.sql**. Here's the reasoning:

- **Candidate 2result.sql**:
  - **Clear Thresholds**: Calculates the minimum, average, and maximum durations in milliseconds and computes precise midpoints for classification thresholds.
  - **Proper Classification**:
    - Uses `>=` and `<` operators to ensure that each track falls into one and only one category without overlaps or gaps.
    - Defines categories based on duration ranges:
      - **Short**: From `MinMs` up to but not including `Mid_MinAvg`.
      - **Medium**: From `Mid_MinAvg` up to but not including `Mid_AvgMax`.
      - **Long**: From `Mid_AvgMax` up to and including `MaxMs`.
  - **Accurate Revenue Calculation**:
    - Calculates total revenue per track using `LEFT JOIN` to include tracks without sales.
    - Aggregates revenue correctly for each category.
  - **Results Match Expectations**: The output provides the minimum and maximum durations in minutes and total revenue for each category, matching the expected results.

By ensuring proper handling of boundary conditions and providing a clear and precise classification, **Candidate 2result.sql** is the correct SQL script.
