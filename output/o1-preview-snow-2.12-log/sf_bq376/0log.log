Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns that can help us associate bike share stations and crime incidents with neighborhoods in San Francisco.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS.BOUNDARIES**

   - **Column:** `"neighborhood"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Provides the names of neighborhoods in San Francisco.
   - **Column:** `"neighborhood_geom"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Contains the geometric boundaries of neighborhoods, useful for spatial joins to determine which bike share stations and crime incidents are located within each neighborhood.

2. **SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO**

   - **Column:** `"station_id"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Unique identifier for each bike share station.
   - **Column:** `"name"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Name of the bike share station.
   - **Columns:** `"lat"`, `"lon"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Latitude and longitude of bike share stations, used to determine their locations.
   - **Column:** `"station_geom"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Geometric point representing the station's location, useful for spatial operations.

3. **SAN_FRANCISCO_SFPD_INCIDENTS.SFPD_INCIDENTS**

   - **Column:** `"unique_key"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Unique identifier for each crime incident.
   - **Column:** `"category"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Category of the crime incident.
   - **Columns:** `"latitude"`, `"longitude"`
     - **Potential Usage:** Latitude and longitude of crime incidents, used to determine their locations.

**Potential Conditions and Operations:**

- Perform spatial joins between the locations of bike share stations/crime incidents and neighborhood boundaries to assign each to a neighborhood.
- Use COUNT functions to tally the number of stations and incidents per neighborhood.
- Filter neighborhoods that have at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident.

---

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. **List all unique neighborhoods in San Francisco:**

Task: For each neighborhood in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, provide the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To identify neighborhoods in San Francisco where both bike share stations and crime incidents are present, we can associate each station and incident with a neighborhood based on their geographic locations. The following table provides the neighborhood names along with the total counts of bike share stations and crime incidents in each:

```csv
neighborhood_name,bike_share_station_count,crime_incident_count
neighborhood1:str,station_count1:int,incident_count1:int
neighborhood2:str,station_count2:int,incident_count2:int
...
```

- **neighborhood_name**: The name of the San Francisco neighborhood (string).
- **bike_share_station_count**: The total number of bike share stations located in the neighborhood (integer).
- **crime_incident_count**: The total number of crime incidents that have occurred in the neighborhood (integer).

This output format lists the neighborhoods satisfying the conditions, along with the respective counts of bike share stations and crime incidents..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS': {'SAN_FRANCISCO_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATION_STATUS', 'BIKESHARE_REGIONS', 'BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_FILM_LOCATIONS': ['FILM_LOCATIONS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS': ['BOUNDARIES'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_SFFD_SERVICE_CALLS': ['SFFD_SERVICE_CALLS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_SFPD_INCIDENTS': ['SFPD_INCIDENTS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_TRANSIT_MUNI': ['CALENDAR', 'FARES', 'SHAPES', 'VEHICLE_MONITORING', 'STOPS', 'STOP_TIMES', 'TRIPS', 'ROUTES', 'STOP_MONITORING'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_TREES': ['STREET_TREES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Please correct it and output only 1 complete SQL query.When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.

2025-02-12 07:39:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each neighborhood in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, provide the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To identify neighborhoods in San Francisco where both bike share stations and crime incidents are present, we can associate each station and incident with a neighborhood based on their geographic locations. The following table provides the neighborhood names along with the total counts of bike share stations and crime incidents in each:

```csv
neighborhood_name,bike_share_station_count,crime_incident_count
neighborhood1:str,station_count1:int,incident_count1:int
neighborhood2:str,station_count2:int,incident_count2:int
...
```

- **neighborhood_name**: The name of the San Francisco neighborhood (string).
- **bike_share_station_count**: The total number of bike share stations located in the neighborhood (integer).
- **crime_incident_count**: The total number of crime incidents that have occurred in the neighborhood (integer).

This output format lists the neighborhoods satisfying the conditions, along with the respective counts of bike share stations and crime incidents. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
