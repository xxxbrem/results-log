2025-02-12 07:30:59 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering occurs because the `ST_CONTAINS` function expects both arguments to be of compatible spatial types (`GEOGRAPHY` or `GEOMETRY`), but in your query, the arguments are of mismatched types:

- `"neighborhoods"."neighborhood_geom"` is of type `BINARY(8388608)`, which stores the geometry in Well-Known Binary (WKB) format.
- `ST_POINT(stations."lon", stations."lat")` returns a `GEOGRAPHY` type.

**Issue:**

- The `ST_CONTAINS` function cannot directly operate on a `BINARY` type and a `GEOGRAPHY` type.
- Both inputs to `ST_CONTAINS` must be of the same spatial type.

**Solution:**

1. **Convert the WKB Geometry to a Spatial Type:**

   - Use `ST_GEOGFROMWKB` to convert the binary WKB geometry into a `GEOGRAPHY` type.
   - Alternatively, use `ST_GEOMFROMWKB` to convert to a `GEOMETRY` type.

2. **Ensure Both Inputs to `ST_CONTAINS` Are of the Same Spatial Type:**

   - If you convert the neighborhood geometry to `GEOGRAPHY`, ensure the point is also `GEOGRAPHY`.
   - If you use `GEOMETRY`, ensure both geometries are `GEOMETRY` types.

**Corrected Query:**

Option 1: **Using `GEOGRAPHY` Type**

```sql
SELECT neighborhoods."neighborhood", COUNT(*) AS "station_count"
FROM "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE"."BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO" AS stations
JOIN "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS"."BOUNDARIES" AS neighborhoods
  ON ST_CONTAINS(
       ST_GEOGFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"),
       ST_GEOGPOINT(stations."lon", stations."lat")
     )
GROUP BY neighborhoods."neighborhood"
LIMIT 100;
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `ST_GEOGFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom")` converts the binary geometry to `GEOGRAPHY`.
  - `ST_GEOGPOINT(stations."lon", stations."lat")` creates a `GEOGRAPHY` point from longitude and latitude.
  - Both inputs to `ST_CONTAINS` are now `GEOGRAPHY` types.

Option 2: **Using `GEOMETRY` Type**

```sql
SELECT neighborhoods."neighborhood", COUNT(*) AS "station_count"
FROM "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE"."BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO" AS stations
JOIN "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS"."BOUNDARIES" AS neighborhoods
  ON ST_CONTAINS(
       ST_GEOMFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"),
       ST_MAKEPOINT(stations."lon", stations."lat")
     )
GROUP BY neighborhoods."neighborhood"
LIMIT 100;
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `ST_GEOMFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom")` converts the binary geometry to `GEOMETRY`.
  - `ST_MAKEPOINT(stations."lon", stations."lat")` creates a `GEOMETRY` point.
  - Both inputs to `ST_CONTAINS` are now `GEOMETRY` types.

**Note on Functions:**

- `ST_GEOGFROMWKB` and `ST_GEOMFROMWKB` are used to convert WKB to `GEOGRAPHY` and `GEOMETRY`, respectively.
- `ST_GEOGPOINT` creates a `GEOGRAPHY` point.
- `ST_MAKEPOINT` creates a `GEOMETRY` point.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend using the `GEOGRAPHY` type if your data represents real-world coordinates on the Earth's surface (latitude and longitude). Here's the adjusted query using `GEOGRAPHY` types:

```sql
SELECT neighborhoods."neighborhood", COUNT(*) AS "station_count"
FROM "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE"."BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO" AS stations
JOIN "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS"."BOUNDARIES" AS neighborhoods
  ON ST_CONTAINS(
       ST_GEOGFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"),
       ST_GEOGPOINT(stations."lon", stations."lat")
     )
GROUP BY neighborhoods."neighborhood"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Additional Steps for Crime Incidents:**

To include the total number of crime incidents per neighborhood where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, you can proceed as follows:

1. **Count Crime Incidents per Neighborhood:**

   ```sql
   SELECT neighborhoods."neighborhood", COUNT(*) AS "incident_count"
   FROM "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_SFPD_INCIDENTS"."SFPD_INCIDENTS" AS incidents
   JOIN "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS"."BOUNDARIES" AS neighborhoods
     ON ST_CONTAINS(
          ST_GEOGFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"),
          ST_GEOGPOINT(incidents."longitude", incidents."latitude")
        )
   GROUP BY neighborhoods."neighborhood"
   ```

2. **Combine Both Counts:**

   You can use subqueries or common table expressions (CTEs) to combine the counts from bike share stations and crime incidents.

   ```sql
   WITH station_counts AS (
     SELECT neighborhoods."neighborhood", COUNT(*) AS "station_count"
     FROM "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE"."BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO" AS stations
     JOIN "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS"."BOUNDARIES" AS neighborhoods
       ON ST_CONTAINS(
            ST_GEOGFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"),

   FROM station_counts sc
   JOIN incident_counts ic ON sc."neighborhood" = ic."neighborhood"
   ORDER BY sc."neighborhood"
   ```

   - **Explanation:**
     - The `station_counts` CTE calculates the number of bike share stations per neighborhood.
     - The `incident_counts` CTE calculates the number of crime incidents per neighborhood.
     - The final `SELECT` combines neighborhoods that have both bike share stations and crime incidents by joining on the neighborhood name.

**Final Output Format:**

```csv
neighborhood_name,bike_share_station_count,crime_incident_count
neighborhood1:str,count1:int,count2:int
neighborhood2:str,count1:int,count2:int
...
```

- Only neighborhoods with at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are included.
- The neighborhoods are listed along with the counts of stations and incidents.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the longitude and latitude values are not null in your data.
- Check that all spatial functions are supported and correctly used in your Snowflake environment.
- If you encounter any further errors, verify the data types of your columns and the availability of spatial extensions in your database.

2025-02-12 07:31:41 - root - INFO - I understand you're encountering an error indicating that the function `ST_GEOGPOINT` is unknown. This suggests that `ST_GEOGPOINT` may not be the correct function name in your Snowflake environment.

**Explanation:**

In Snowflake, spatial functions may have different names than in other SQL dialects. Here's how you can adjust your query:

1. **Use the Correct Function to Create a GEOGRAPHY Point:**

   - In Snowflake, `ST_POINT(longitude, latitude)` creates a `GEOGRAPHY` point. There's no `ST_GEOGPOINT` function.
   - Ensure you're using `ST_POINT` to create the point from longitude and latitude.

2. **Convert WKB to GEOGRAPHY Correctly:**

   - Use `ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom")` instead of `ST_GEOGFROMWKB`.
   - This function converts the WKB (Well-Known Binary) geometry into a `GEOGRAPHY` object.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT neighborhoods."neighborhood", COUNT(*) AS "station_count"
FROM "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE"."BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO" AS stations
JOIN "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS"."BOUNDARIES" AS neighborhoods
  ON ST_CONTAINS(
       ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"),
       ST_POINT(stations."lon", stations."lat")
     )
GROUP BY neighborhoods."neighborhood"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Adjustments:**

- **Replaced `ST_GEOGPOINT` with `ST_POINT`:**
  - `ST_POINT(longitude, latitude)` creates a `GEOGRAPHY` point in Snowflake.
  - Example: `ST_POINT(-122.4194, 37.7749)` creates a point for San Francisco.

- **Replaced `ST_GEOGFROMWKB` with `ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB`:**
  - `ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB(binary_wkb)` converts WKB to a `GEOGRAPHY` object.
  - This allows the `neighborhood_geom` field to be used in spatial functions.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Function Names:**
  - Be mindful that function names can vary between SQL implementations.
  - Always refer to the Snowflake documentation for the correct function names.

- **Data Types:**
  - Ensure that both inputs to `ST_CONTAINS` are of the `GEOGRAPHY` type.
  - `ST_POINT` returns a `GEOGRAPHY` object.
  - `ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB` outputs a `GEOGRAPHY` object from WKB data.

**Completing the Task:**

To fulfill your original task of providing the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood, you can combine the counts for both bike share stations and crime incidents.

**Combining Station and Incident Counts:**

```sql
WITH station_counts AS (
  SELECT neighborhoods."neighborhood", COUNT(*) AS "station_count"
  FROM "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE"."BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO" AS stations
  JOIN "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS"."BOUNDARIES" AS neighborhoods
    ON ST_CONTAINS(
         ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"),
         ST_POINT(stations."lon", stations."lat")
       )
  GROUP BY neighborhoods."neighborhood"
),
incident_counts AS (
  SELECT neighborhoods."neighborhood", COUNT(*) AS "incident_count"
  FROM "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_SFPD_INCIDENTS"."SFPD_INCIDENTS" AS incidents
  JOIN "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS"."BOUNDARIES" AS neighborhoods
    ON ST_CONTAINS(
         ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"),
         ST_POINT(incidents."longitude", incidents."latitude")
       )
  GROUP BY neighborhoods."neighborhood"
)
SELECT sc."neighborhood", sc."station_count", ic."incident_count"
FROM station_counts AS sc
JOIN incident_counts AS ic ON sc."neighborhood" = ic."neighborhood"
ORDER BY sc."neighborhood"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**
  - `station_counts`: Counts bike share stations per neighborhood.
  - `incident_counts`: Counts crime incidents per neighborhood.

- **Joining Counts:**
  - The final `SELECT` joins the two counts on the neighborhood name.
  - This ensures that only neighborhoods with at least one bike share station **and** at least one crime incident are included.

**Output Format:**

The query will produce results in the following format:

```csv
neighborhood_name,bike_share_station_count,crime_incident_count
Neighborhood A,station_count_A,incident_count_A
Neighborhood B,station_count_B,incident_count_B
...
```

- **Columns:**
  - `neighborhood_name`: Name of the neighborhood.
  - `bike_share_station_count`: Total number of bike share stations in the neighborhood.
  - `crime_incident_count`: Total number of crime incidents in the neighborhood.

**Example Output:**

```csv
neighborhood_name,bike_share_station_count,crime_incident_count
Mission,5,120
Financial District,3,85
...
```

**Final Notes:**

- **Ensure Data Integrity:**
  - Verify that the longitude and latitude values in your data are valid and not null.
  - Exclude any records with missing or invalid spatial data to avoid errors.

- **Function Availability:**
  - If you encounter any further "unknown function" errors, double-check the function names and availability in your version of Snowflake.
  - Refer to the [Snowflake Spatial Data Functions Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions-spatial.html) for detailed information.

- **Testing the Query:**
  - Run the individual CTEs (`station_counts` and `incident_counts`) separately to ensure they work correctly.
  - This can help isolate any issues before combining them.

By adjusting your query with the correct function names, you should be able to retrieve the desired counts per neighborhood.

2025-02-12 07:33:25 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the same issue as before: the `ST_CONTAINS` function is being called with arguments of incompatible data types.

**Issue Explanation:**

- The field `neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"` is of type `BINARY(8388608)`, which stores the neighborhood geometry in Well-Known Binary (WKB) format.
- The function `ST_POINT(incidents."longitude", incidents."latitude")` returns a `GEOGRAPHY` object.
- The `ST_CONTAINS` function requires both arguments to be of the same spatial data type (`GEOGRAPHY` or `GEOMETRY`).

**Solution:**

To resolve this error, you need to convert the `neighborhood_geom` from WKB to a `GEOGRAPHY` type using `ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB`, ensuring both arguments to `ST_CONTAINS` are `GEOGRAPHY` objects.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT neighborhoods."neighborhood", COUNT(*) AS "incident_count"
FROM "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_SFPD_INCIDENTS"."SFPD_INCIDENTS" AS incidents
JOIN "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS"."BOUNDARIES" AS neighborhoods
  ON ST_CONTAINS(
       ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"),
       ST_POINT(incidents."longitude", incidents."latitude")
     )
GROUP BY neighborhoods."neighborhood"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Convert Neighborhood Geometry to GEOGRAPHY:**
  - `ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom")` converts the binary WKB geometry into a `GEOGRAPHY` object.
- **Create GEOGRAPHY Point for Incidents:**
  - `ST_POINT(incidents."longitude", incidents."latitude")` creates a `GEOGRAPHY` point representing the location of each incident.
- **Use Compatible Data Types in ST_CONTAINS:**
  - Both arguments to `ST_CONTAINS` are now `GEOGRAPHY` types, allowing the function to operate correctly.

**Additional Information:**

- **Consistency with Previous Queries:**
  - In your earlier successful query for bike share stations, you used `ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB` to convert the neighborhood geometry. Applying the same approach here will resolve the error.
- **Data Integrity:**
  - Ensure that the `longitude` and `latitude` fields in the `SFPD_INCIDENTS` table are not `NULL` and contain valid geographic coordinates.
- **Verification:**
  - Before running the full query, you might want to test it with a smaller dataset or check the individual components to ensure everything works as expected.

**Example Usage:**

Once corrected, your query should run successfully and provide you with the count of crime incidents per neighborhood. This will enable you to combine it with the bike share station counts, fulfilling your original task.

**Combining Results for the Final Task:**

To retrieve the neighborhood names along with the total counts of bike share stations and crime incidents where both are present, you can use the following combined query:

```sql
WITH station_counts AS (
  SELECT neighborhoods."neighborhood", COUNT(*) AS "station_count"
  FROM "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE"."BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO" AS stations
  JOIN "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS"."BOUNDARIES" AS neighborhoods
    ON ST_CONTAINS(
         ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"),
         ST_POINT(stations."lon", stations."lat")
       )
  GROUP BY neighborhoods."neighborhood"
),
incident_counts AS (
  SELECT neighborhoods."neighborhood", COUNT(*) AS "incident_count"
  FROM "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_SFPD_INCIDENTS"."SFPD_INCIDENTS" AS incidents
  JOIN "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS"."BOUNDARIES" AS neighborhoods
    ON ST_CONTAINS(
         ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"),
         ST_POINT(incidents."longitude", incidents."latitude")
       )
  GROUP BY neighborhoods."neighborhood"
)
SELECT sc."neighborhood", sc."station_count", ic."incident_count"
FROM station_counts AS sc
JOIN incident_counts AS ic ON sc."neighborhood" = ic."neighborhood"
ORDER BY sc."neighborhood"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Final Output Format:**

```csv
neighborhood_name,bike_share_station_count,crime_incident_count
Neighborhood A,station_count_A,incident_count_A
Neighborhood B,station_count_B,incident_count_B
...
```

- This will list all neighborhoods where there is at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident.
- The counts will help you analyze the distribution of both features across neighborhoods.

**Ensure Function Availability:**

- If you encounter an error indicating that `ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB` or `ST_POINT` is unknown, verify that your Snowflake environment supports these spatial functions.
- Refer to the [Snowflake Spatial Data Functions Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions-spatial.html) for detailed information.

**Conclusion:**

By adjusting your query to correctly convert data types and using compatible spatial functions, you should be able to retrieve the desired information without errors.

2025-02-12 07:36:23 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to a mismatch in data types being used with the `ST_CONTAINS` function. Let's analyze the issue and provide a corrected SQL query.

---

**Issue Explanation:**

- **Data Types:**
  - **`neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"`** is of type `BINARY(8388608)`, which contains the geometry in Well-Known Binary (WKB) format.
  - **`ST_POINT(incidents."longitude", incidents."latitude")`** returns a `GEOGRAPHY` object.

- **Function Requirement:**
  - The `ST_CONTAINS` function requires both arguments to be of the same spatial data type, either `GEOGRAPHY` or `GEOMETRY`.

- **Error Message:**
  - The error indicates that `ST_CONTAINS` is being called with arguments of types `(BINARY(8388608), GEOGRAPHY)`, which are incompatible.

---

**Solution:**

To resolve this error, we need to:

1. **Convert the Neighborhood Geometry to a `GEOGRAPHY` Type:**

   - Use the `ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB` function to convert the WKB binary data into a `GEOGRAPHY` object.

2. **Ensure Both Arguments to `ST_CONTAINS` Are of the Same Type (`GEOGRAPHY`):**

   - Since `ST_POINT` returns a `GEOGRAPHY` object, converting the neighborhood geometry to `GEOGRAPHY` ensures compatibility.

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT incidents."unique_key", incidents."category", neighborhoods."neighborhood"
FROM "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_SFPD_INCIDENTS"."SFPD_INCIDENTS" AS incidents
JOIN "SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS"."SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS"."BOUNDARIES" AS neighborhoods
  ON ST_CONTAINS(
       ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom"),
       ST_POINT(incidents."longitude", incidents."latitude")
     )
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **`ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB(neighborhoods."neighborhood_geom")`:**
  - Converts the binary WKB geometry into a `GEOGRAPHY` object.
  - Now, both the neighborhood geometry and the point are `GEOGRAPHY` types.

- **`ST_POINT(incidents."longitude", incidents."latitude")`:**
  - Creates a `GEOGRAPHY` point from the incident's longitude and latitude.

- **`ST_CONTAINS(...)`:**
  - Checks if the neighborhood geometry contains the incident's point.

**Result:**

- This query selects incident records along with the neighborhood they are located in.
- The `LIMIT 100` clause limits the output to 100 records.

---

**Additional Information:**

- **Data Integrity:**
  - Ensure that the `incidents."longitude"` and `incidents."latitude"` fields contain valid numeric values and are not `NULL`.
  - Invalid or `NULL` values can cause the `ST_POINT` function to fail or return unexpected results.

- **Testing the Query:**
  - Before running the full query, consider testing it with a smaller dataset or adding `WHERE` clauses to filter specific records.
  - For example, you can add:
    ```sql
    WHERE incidents."longitude" IS NOT NULL AND incidents."latitude" IS NOT NULL
    ```
    to ensure only incidents with valid coordinates are processed.

---

**Conclusion:**

By converting the neighborhood geometry to a `GEOGRAPHY` type using `ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB`, we align the data types required by the `ST_CONTAINS` function. This correction should resolve the error and allow the query to execute successfully.

---

Task: For each neighborhood in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, provide the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To identify neighborhoods in San Francisco where both bike share stations and crime incidents are present, we can associate each station and incident with a neighborhood based on their geographic locations. The following table provides the neighborhood names along with the total counts of bike share stations and crime incidents in each:

```csv
neighborhood_name,bike_share_station_count,crime_incident_count
neighborhood1:str,station_count1:int,incident_count1:int
neighborhood2:str,station_count2:int,incident_count2:int
...
```

- **neighborhood_name**: The name of the San Francisco neighborhood (string).
- **bike_share_station_count**: The total number of bike share stations located in the neighborhood (integer).
- **crime_incident_count**: The total number of crime incidents that have occurred in the neighborhood (integer).

This output format lists the neighborhoods satisfying the conditions, along with the respective counts of bike share stations and crime incidents..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS': {'SAN_FRANCISCO_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATION_STATUS', 'BIKESHARE_REGIONS', 'BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_FILM_LOCATIONS': ['FILM_LOCATIONS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS': ['BOUNDARIES'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_SFFD_SERVICE_CALLS': ['SFFD_SERVICE_CALLS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_SFPD_INCIDENTS': ['SFPD_INCIDENTS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_TRANSIT_MUNI': ['CALENDAR', 'FARES', 'SHAPES', 'VEHICLE_MONITORING', 'STOPS', 'STOP_TIMES', 'TRIPS', 'ROUTES', 'STOP_MONITORING'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_TREES': ['STREET_TREES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-12 07:40:46 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each neighborhood in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, provide the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To identify neighborhoods in San Francisco where both bike share stations and crime incidents are present, we can associate each station and incident with a neighborhood based on their geographic locations. The following table provides the neighborhood names along with the total counts of bike share stations and crime incidents in each:

```csv
neighborhood_name,bike_share_station_count,crime_incident_count
neighborhood1:str,station_count1:int,incident_count1:int
neighborhood2:str,station_count2:int,incident_count2:int
...
```

- **neighborhood_name**: The name of the San Francisco neighborhood (string).
- **bike_share_station_count**: The total number of bike share stations located in the neighborhood (integer).
- **crime_incident_count**: The total number of crime incidents that have occurred in the neighborhood (integer).

This output format lists the neighborhoods satisfying the conditions, along with the respective counts of bike share stations and crime incidents. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
