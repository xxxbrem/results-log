2025-02-10 09:11:57 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates that the database object you're trying to access does not exist, likely due to an incorrect table reference in your SQL query.

In your query, you've specified the table as:

```sql
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
```

However, according to the table structure information provided, the correct hierarchy is:

- **Database Name**: `WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT`
- **Schema Name**: `CYBERSYN`
- **Table Name**: `FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX`

Including `CYBERSYN` twice in the table path is causing the error.

### Corrected SQL Query

Please adjust your SQL query to remove the extra `CYBERSYN` in the table reference:

```sql
SELECT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
LIMIT 100;
```

This corrected query should resolve the error by accurately pointing to the existing table.

### Explanation

- **Issue**: The table path included the schema name `CYBERSYN` twice.
- **Resolution**: Remove the redundant `CYBERSYN` to correctly reference the table.

### Moving Forward

After correcting the table reference, you can proceed with the other queries you have. Here's an example of the query adjusted accordingly:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "DATE_OF_LOSS") AS "Year", SUM("BUILDING_DAMAGE_AMOUNT") AS "Total_Building_Damage", SUM("CONTENTS_DAMAGE_AMOUNT") AS "Total_Contents_Damage"
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
WHERE "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME" = 'City Of New York'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "DATE_OF_LOSS") BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019
GROUP BY "Year"
ORDER BY "Year"
LIMIT 100;
```

This query will provide you with the total building damage amounts and total contents damage amounts reported under the National Flood Insurance Program for the NFIP community named 'City Of New York,' grouped by each year of loss from 2010 through 2019.

2025-02-10 09:12:37 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering a syntax error with your SQL query. Let's analyze your query and the error message to pinpoint the issue.

### Your Query:

```sql
SELECT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
   FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
   LIMIT 100;
```

### Error Message:

```
001003 (42000): 01ba4bc7-0004-932b-0001-11c3010c1da6: SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'FROM'.
```

### Analysis:

The error message indicates a syntax error at line 1, position 0, unexpected `'FROM'`. This suggests that the SQL parser is reading `'FROM'` at the very beginning of your query, implying that the `'SELECT'` keyword might be missing or not properly recognized.

However, in your query, you have:

```sql
SELECT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
   FROM ...
```

This hints that there may be some hidden characters or formatting issues affecting the parsing of your query.

Additionally, the table reference includes `'CYBERSYN'` twice:

- **Incorrect Table Reference**:

    ```sql
    WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
    ```

   This might cause the SQL compiler to misinterpret the table path.

### Recommendations:

#### 1. Correct the Table Reference

Remove the extra `'CYBERSYN'` from the table path:

- **Correct Table Reference**:

    ```sql
    WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
    ```

#### 2. Check for Hidden Characters

There might be hidden characters or formatting issues in your query. To resolve this:

- **Re-type the Query**: Manually re-type the entire query in your SQL editor to eliminate any hidden characters or copy-paste artifacts.

#### 3. Verify Quotation Marks

Ensure that you're using the correct quotation marks:

- Use double quotes `"` for identifiers (such as column and table names) in Snowflake.
- Use single quotes `'` for string literals.

#### 4. Test a Simplified Query

Try running a basic query to see if the error persists:

```sql
SELECT 1;
```

If this runs without error, proceed to test your query step by step.

### Corrected Query:

Here's the corrected version of your query:

```sql
SELECT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
LIMIT 100;
```

### Additional Steps:

After correcting the table reference and ensuring there are no hidden characters, try running the query again. If you still encounter errors, consider the following:

- **Check Your SQL Editor**: Some SQL clients may introduce formatting issues. Try using a different editor or client.
- **Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table.
- **Session Context**: Verify that your session is set to the correct database and schema, or use fully qualified names as above.

### Example of Full Query for Your Task

To address your original task, here's the complete query adjusted accordingly:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "DATE_OF_LOSS") AS "Year",
       SUM("BUILDING_DAMAGE_AMOUNT") AS "Total_Building_Damage_Amount",
       SUM("CONTENTS_DAMAGE_AMOUNT") AS "Total_Contents_Damage_Amount"
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
WHERE "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME" = 'City Of New York'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "DATE_OF_LOSS") BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019
GROUP BY "Year"
ORDER BY "Year"
LIMIT 100;
```

### Conclusion

By correcting the table reference and ensuring there are no hidden characters or formatting issues, you should be able to resolve the syntax error. If you continue to experience problems, please double-check your SQL client or provide additional details, and I'll be happy to help further.

2025-02-10 09:13:24 - root - INFO - It seems you're still encountering the error:

```
002043 (02000): 01ba4bc8-0004-932b-0001-11c3010c1dc6: SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

This error indicates that the SQL compiler cannot find the specified object—in this case, the table you're trying to access. Let's work through this step by step to resolve the issue.

### **1. Verify the Correct Table Reference**

Based on the table structure information you provided, the table `FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX` is located in:

- **Database**: `WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT`
- **Schema**: `CYBERSYN`

Therefore, the correct fully qualified table name is:

```
WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
```

**Issue**: In your query, the schema name `CYBERSYN` is included **twice**, which is causing the error.

**Incorrect Table Reference**:

```sql
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
```

**Correct Table Reference**:

```sql
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
```

### **2. Corrected SQL Query**

Please adjust your SQL query to remove the extra `CYBERSYN`:

```sql
SELECT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
LIMIT 100;
```

### **3. Ensure Proper Case Sensitivity**

In Snowflake, identifiers enclosed in double quotes are case-sensitive. Ensure that your database, schema, table, and column names match exactly, including the case.

- **Database**: `WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT`
- **Schema**: `CYBERSYN`
- **Table**: `FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX`
- **Column**: `NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME`

### **4. Confirm Your Session Context**

Ensure that your session is pointing to the correct database and schema. You can set them explicitly:

```sql
USE DATABASE "WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT";
USE SCHEMA "CYBERSYN";
```

### **5. Verify Table Existence and Permissions**

If the error persists, it's possible that:

- The table does not exist.
- You do not have the required permissions to access the table.

**To verify if the table exists**:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN;
```

Look for `FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX` in the list of tables.

**To check your permissions**:

```sql
-- Check if you have usage privileges on the database and schema
SHOW GRANTS TO USER CURRENT_USER();

-- Check grants on the table
SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX;
```

If you lack the necessary permissions, you may need to contact your database administrator to gain access.

### **6. Possible Typographical Errors**

Double-check for any typos in your table or column names. Ensure that:

- All names are spelled correctly.
- There are no extra spaces or characters.
- Quotation marks are properly closed.

### **7. Example of a Full Query**

Assuming the table exists and you have the necessary permissions, here is the full corrected query for your task:

```sql
USE DATABASE "WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT";
USE SCHEMA "CYBERSYN";

SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "DATE_OF_LOSS") AS "Year",
  SUM("BUILDING_DAMAGE_AMOUNT") AS "Total_Building_Damage_Amount",
  SUM("CONTENTS_DAMAGE_AMOUNT") AS "Total_Contents_Damage_Amount"
FROM "FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX"
WHERE "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME" = 'City Of New York'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "DATE_OF_LOSS") BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019
GROUP BY "Year"
ORDER BY "Year";
```

### **8. Test with a Simple Query**

To ensure that you can access the table, try running a simple query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX;
```

If this also results in an error, it's likely a permissions or existence issue.

### **9. Recap and Next Steps**

- **Remove Extra Schema Reference**: Ensure only one `CYBERSYN` in the table path.
- **Set Correct Session Context**: Use `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands.
- **Verify Table Existence**: Use `SHOW TABLES` to confirm the table is available.
- **Check Permissions**: Verify that you have access to the database, schema, and table.

### **Conclusion**

By adjusting your query to reference the correct table path and verifying your session context and permissions, you should be able to resolve the "Object does not exist" error. If issues persist after these steps, please consult your database administrator to ensure that the table exists and that you have the appropriate access rights.

002043 (02000): 01ba4bc9-0004-91d9-0001-11c3010c2016: SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

This error indicates that the database object you're trying to access does not exist or cannot be found. Let's work through this step by step to identify and resolve the issue.

---

### **1. Verify the Table Reference**

**Problem**: The table path in your query includes the schema name `CYBERSYN` **twice**, which is causing the error.

**Your Query**:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
LIMIT 100;
```

**Issue**:

- The table reference includes `CYBERSYN` twice: `CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN`.

**Solution**:

- Remove the extra `CYBERSYN` from the table path.

**Corrected Table Reference**:

```sql
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
```

---

### **2. Check Case Sensitivity**

In Snowflake, when identifiers (such as table and column names) are enclosed in double quotes (`"`), they are case-sensitive. Ensure that the database, schema, table, and column names match exactly in terms of spelling and casing.

- **Database Name**: `WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT`
- **Schema Name**: `CYBERSYN`
- **Table Name**: `FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX`
- **Column Name**: `NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME`

---

### **3. Corrected SQL Query**

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **4. Set Database and Schema Context (Optional but Recommended)**

To simplify your queries and reduce potential errors, you can set the database and schema for your session:

```sql
USE DATABASE "WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT";
USE SCHEMA "CYBERSYN";
```

After setting the context, you can reference the table without the fully qualified path:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
FROM "FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **5. Verify Table Existence**

To confirm that the table exists in the specified schema, run:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN;
```

Look for `FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX` in the list of tables. If it's not listed, the table may not exist in that schema or you might not have access to it.

---

### **6. Check Your Permissions**

If the table exists but you still receive an error, you might not have the necessary permissions to access the table.

**To check your privileges:**

```sql
SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX;
```

If you don't have `SELECT` privileges on the table, you'll need to contact your database administrator to grant you the necessary access.

---

### **7. Test with a Simple Query**

Try running a simple query to see if you can access other tables in the schema:

```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'CYBERSYN'
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### **8. Recap and Next Steps**

- **Remove Extra Schema Reference**: Ensure your table path does not duplicate the schema name.
- **Verify Case Sensitivity**: Match the exact casing of database, schema, table, and column names.
- **Set Session Context**: Use `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` to simplify your queries.
- **Confirm Table Existence**: Use `SHOW TABLES` to verify the table is present.
- **Check Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary privileges to access the table.

---

### **Example of Corrected Query Executed Step by Step**

1. **Set Database and Schema**:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT";
   USE SCHEMA "CYBERSYN";
   ```

2. **Verify Table Exists**:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES LIKE 'FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX';
   ```

3. **Run the Query**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
   FROM "FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

### **If the Problem Persists**

If you've verified the table name and ensured that you have the correct permissions but still encounter the error, consider the following:

- **Different Table Name**: The table might have a slightly different name. Double-check the spelling and casing.

- **Alternative Table**: Based on the table names you've provided, it's possible that the data you're seeking is in a different table.

  For example, perhaps the correct table is:

  - `FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_POLICY_INDEX`

- **Contact Administrator**: If you're unable to resolve the issue, reach out to your database administrator or support team. They can verify table existence and permissions.

---

### **Final Thoughts**

The error you're receiving is due to the database engine not finding the specified object. By correcting the table path and ensuring correct casing and permissions, you should be able to execute your query successfully.

- You can get the list of columns in the table by running:

    ```sql
    DESC TABLE WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX;
    ```

- Confirm that `"NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"` is listed.

---

### **9. Test with a Simple Query**

Try running a basic query to see if you can access any data from the table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
LIMIT 1;
```

**If this results in the same error, it further indicates an issue with table access or existence.**

---

### **10. Contact Your Database Administrator**

If you've tried the steps above and continue to receive the error, I recommend reaching out to your database administrator or support team. They can:

- Confirm whether the table exists.
- Check if there are any access restrictions.
- Provide you with the necessary permissions.

---

### **Summary**

The "Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed" error typically indicates one of the following:

- **Incorrect Table Reference**: Ensure the table path is correct and does not include redundant schema names.
- **Table Does Not Exist**: Confirm the table exists in the specified schema.
- **Lack of Permissions**: Verify that you have the necessary privileges to access the database, schema, and table.
- **Typographical Errors**: Check for any spelling mistakes in database, schema, table, or column names.
- **Session Context**: Setting the correct database and schema context can prevent misreferences.

2025-02-10 09:15:55 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering errors with your SQL query. Let's analyze the problem step by step to identify the issue and find a solution.

---

### **Error Message:**

```
001003 (42000): 01ba4bca-0004-932b-0001-11c3010c1dea: SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'FROM'.
```

**Interpretation:**

- **`syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'FROM'`**: This means that the SQL compiler is seeing the keyword `FROM` at the very beginning of your query, which is not expected. In SQL, queries typically start with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or other command keywords—not `FROM`.

---

### **Possible Causes and Solutions:**

#### **1. Check for Unintended 'FROM' at the Beginning**

**Issue:**

- You might have accidentally added an extra `FROM` at the beginning of your query, or your SQL client/editor might be misinterpreting the query input.

**Action:**

- Ensure that your query starts with `SELECT`, not `FROM`.

**Correct Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
LIMIT 100;
```

---

#### **2. Remove the Extra 'CYBERSYN' in the Table Reference**

**Issue:**

- In your query, the table path includes `CYBERSYN` twice:

  ```sql
  FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
  ```

- This can cause the SQL compiler to misinterpret the table reference and lead to errors.

**Action:**

- Remove the extra `CYBERSYN` to correctly reference the table.

**Correct Table Reference:**

```sql
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
```

---

#### **3. Ensure Correct Syntax and No Hidden Characters**

**Issue:**

- Hidden characters, such as invisible control characters or incorrect line breaks, might be causing the syntax error.

**Action:**

- Re-type the query manually to eliminate any hidden characters.

- Ensure there are no extra semicolons (`;`), quotes, or other characters before the `SELECT` statement.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
FROM WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX
LIMIT 100;
```

---

#### **4. Verify the SQL Editor or Client Behavior**

**Issue:**

- Some SQL clients or editors might have settings or behaviors causing them to misinterpret pasted queries.

**Action:**

- Try running the query in a different SQL client or editor.

- Ensure that when you paste the query, it starts with `SELECT` and not `FROM`.

- Check for any pre-existing text or commands in your SQL editor that might be affecting the execution.

---

#### **5. Test with a Simple Query**

**Issue:**

- There might be a broader issue with your SQL session or connection.

**Action:**

- Run a simple query to test your SQL environment:

  ```sql
  SELECT 1;
  ```

- If this simple query fails, there might be an issue with your SQL environment or session that needs to be addressed.

---

#### **6. Confirm Table Existence and Access Permissions**

**Issue:**

- The table might not exist in the specified schema, or you might not have the necessary permissions to access it.

**Action:**

- Verify that the table exists:

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN;
  ```

- Check if `FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX` is listed.

- If it's not listed, the table might have a slightly different name, or you might not have access to it.

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to query the table.

---

#### **7. Set the Correct Database and Schema Context**

**Issue:**

- Your session might not be set to the correct database and schema, causing the table reference to fail.

**Action:**

- Set the database and schema context at the beginning of your session:

  ```sql
  USE DATABASE WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT;
  USE SCHEMA CYBERSYN;
  ```

- Then run your query without the fully qualified table name:

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
  FROM "FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

---

### **Summary and Next Steps**

Based on the error message and the information provided, here's what you should do:

1. **Ensure Your Query Starts with 'SELECT'**:

   - There should be no `FROM` keyword at the beginning of your query.

2. **Correct the Table Path**:

   - Remove the extra `CYBERSYN` in the table reference.

3. **Check for Hidden Characters**:

   - Re-type the query to eliminate any hidden or unintended characters.

4. **Set Session Context**:

   - Use `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands to set the correct context.

5. **Test with Simple Queries**:

   - Run `SELECT 1;` to ensure your SQL environment is functioning correctly.

6. **Verify Table Existence and Permissions**:

   - Use `SHOW TABLES` to confirm the table exists.
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the table.

---

### **Example of the Corrected Query**

```sql
-- Set the database and schema context
USE DATABASE WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT;
USE SCHEMA CYBERSYN;

-- Run the query
SELECT DISTINCT "NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME"
FROM "FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **If the Issue Persists**

- **Contact Your Database Administrator**:

  - If you've tried all the above steps and still encounter the error, it's advisable to reach out to your database administrator or support team for assistance. They can check for any underlying issues with your account permissions or the database itself.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Copying and Pasting**:

  - When copying and pasting queries, ensure that no extra characters or lines are inadvertently included.

- **SQL Client Behavior**:

  - Some SQL clients may add or omit parts of the query unintentionally. Ensure that the entire query is being executed as intended.

- **Consistent Use of Quotations**:

  - Use double quotes (`"`) for identifiers (e.g., column and table names) and single quotes (`'`) for string literals.

- **Case Sensitivity**:

  - Remember that when identifiers are enclosed in double quotes, they become case-sensitive in Snowflake.

---

### **Final Thoughts**

The error you're encountering is likely due to one or a combination of the issues outlined above. By carefully reviewing and adjusting your query as suggested, you should be able to resolve the syntax error and successfully execute your SQL statement.

OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

table_name,FX_RATES_TIMESERIES
description,"Foreign exchange rates for currency pairs (base and quote currencies), with data from FRED, ECB, and BIS.

Foreign exchange (FX) rates are the rates at which one currency can be exchanged for another. These rates fluctuate based on various factors including economic indicators, market sentiment, political events, and global financial stability. Foreign exchange rates are crucial for international trade and finance, as they determine how much of one currency is needed to buy a unit of another currency. These rates can be floating, changing continuously based on market forces, or they might be pegged (fixed) to another major currency or basket of currencies, managed by a country's central bank. FX rates data is provided historically by FRED (pre-2000) and by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for 2000 onwards. To note, these data sources often do not publish the exchange rate every day.

Provides historical values for each currency pair collected by BASE_CURRENCY_ID and QUOTE_CURRENCY_ID.

Each row represents a distinct timeseries, date, and value by currency pair."

Task: For each year from 2010 through 2019, what were the total building damage amounts and total contents damage amounts reported under the National Flood Insurance Program for the NFIP community named 'City Of New York,' grouped by each year of loss?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Total_Building_Damage_Amount,Total_Contents_Damage_Amount
2010,total_building_damage_2010:float,total_contents_damage_2010:float
2011,total_building_damage_2011:float,total_contents_damage_2011:float
2012,total_building_damage_2012:float,total_contents_damage_2012:float
2013,total_building_damage_2013:float,total_contents_damage_2013:float
2014,total_building_damage_2014:float,total_contents_damage_2014:float
2015,total_building_damage_2015:float,total_contents_damage_2015:float
2016,total_building_damage_2016:float,total_contents_damage_2016:float
2017,total_building_damage_2017:float,total_contents_damage_2017:float
2018,total_building_damage_2018:float,total_contents_damage_2018:float
2019,total_building_damage_2019:float,total_contents_damage_2019:float
```

The table above presents the total building damage amounts and total contents damage amounts reported under the National Flood Insurance Program for the NFIP community named 'City Of New York,' grouped by each year of loss from 2010 through 2019. Each year's totals are calculated by summing the `BUILDING_DAMAGE_AMOUNT` and `CONTENTS_DAMAGE_AMOUNT` for all claims in the `FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX` table where the `NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME` is 'City Of New York' and the `DATE_OF_LOSS` falls within the respective year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

The table above presents the total building damage amounts and total contents damage amounts reported under the National Flood Insurance Program for the NFIP community named 'City Of New York,' grouped by each year of loss from 2010 through 2019. Each year's totals are calculated by summing the `BUILDING_DAMAGE_AMOUNT` and `CONTENTS_DAMAGE_AMOUNT` for all claims in the `FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX` table where the `NFIP_COMMUNITY_NAME` is 'City Of New York' and the `DATE_OF_LOSS` falls within the respective year. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
