2025-01-21 03:04:27 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error you're encountering:

```
000904 (42000): 01b9d9d7-0004-7e70-0001-11c300f315ba: SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 16
invalid identifier '"state"'
```

occurs because the column `"state"` does not exist in the table `"STATE_2017_5YR"` within the schema `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` of the database `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"`. 

After reviewing the table structures provided, we can see that the `STATE` tables do not have a `"state"` column. Instead, they have a `"geo_id"` column, which contains the geographic identifier for each state.

**Correcting the Issue**

To retrieve the state names, we'll need to extract the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` column in the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table and join it with the `"STATE_FIPS"` table in the `"CYCLISTIC"` schema to get the state names.

The `"STATE_FIPS"` table has the following relevant columns:

- `"state"`: State name.
- `"postal_code"`: State postal abbreviation.
- `"fips"`: State FIPS code.

**Revised Approach**

1. **Extract State FIPS Code from `"geo_id"`**

   The `"geo_id"` in the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table is in the format `"04000US01"`, where the last two digits represent the state FIPS code. We'll extract these digits using substring functions.

2. **Convert FIPS Code to Integer**

   The extracted FIPS code may have leading zeros. We'll remove them and convert the code to an integer to match the `"fips"` column in the `"STATE_FIPS"` table.

3. **Join with `"STATE_FIPS"` Table**

   We'll join the tables on the FIPS code to retrieve the state names.

**Updated SQL Queries**

Here are the revised SQL queries with corrections:

---

1. **Query 1**: List all unique states from the 2017 ACS 5-Year data.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT sf."state"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 10, 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation**:

   - **`SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 10, 2)`**: Extracts the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` column.
   - **`TO_NUMBER(...)`**: Converts the extracted FIPS code to a number.
   - **`JOIN`**: Joins with the `"STATE_FIPS"` table on the FIPS code.
   - **`sf."state"`**: Selects the state name.

2. **Query 2**: Retrieve total employed population and employment in the Wholesale Trade sector for each state.

   ```sql
   SELECT sf."state", s."employed_pop", s."employed_wholesale_trade"

   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 10, 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Query 5**: List median incomes for each state in 2018.

   ```sql
   SELECT sf."state", s."median_income"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2018_5YR" s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 10, 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Query 6**: Calculate the change in median income from 2015 to 2018 for each state.

   ```sql
   SELECT sf."state",
          s2015."median_income" AS "median_income_2015",
          s2018."median_income" AS "median_income_2018",
          (s2018."median_income" - s2015."median_income") AS "median_income_change"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR" s2015
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2018_5YR" s2018
     ON s2015."geo_id" = s2018."geo_id"
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s2015."geo_id", 10, 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Query 7**: Retrieve employment data for the Information sector.

   ```sql
   SELECT sf."state", s."employed_information"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 10, 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Query 8**: Get employment numbers for Natural Resources, Construction, and Maintenance sectors.

   ```sql
   SELECT sf."state", s."occupation_natural_resources_construction_maintenance"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 10, 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Query 9**: List employment in the Manufacturing sector for each state.

   ```sql
   SELECT sf."state", s."employed_manufacturing"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 10, 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Query 10**: Retrieve ZIP codes, state codes, and median incomes from 2015 ZIP code data.

    ```sql
    SELECT z."geo_id", z."median_income", gz."state_code"
    FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR" z
    JOIN "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."ZIP_CODES" gz
      ON SUBSTRING(z."geo_id", 10) = gz."zip_code"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

**Notes:**

- **Extracting FIPS Code from `"geo_id"`**:

  - The `"geo_id"` field in the `STATE` tables has values like `"04000US01"`.
  - We use `SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 10, 2)` to extract characters starting at position 10 with a length of 2, which gives us the state FIPS code.

- **Converting to Number**:

  - We use `TO_NUMBER(...)` to convert the extracted FIPS code string to a number, matching the `"fips"` field in `"STATE_FIPS"`.

- **Joining Tables**:

  - We join the `STATE` tables with `"STATE_FIPS"` to retrieve the state names based on the FIPS codes.

- **Adjusting Other Queries**:

  - All other queries are updated similarly to include the correct column references and joins.

---

**Proceeding with the Task**

With these corrected queries, you should now be able to retrieve the necessary data without encountering the `"invalid identifier"` error. Use the updated queries to extract and analyze the data needed to:

- Calculate the vulnerable population for each state based on the weighted employment sectors.
- Identify the top 10 states with the highest vulnerable population.
- Determine the average median income change from 2015 to 2018 for these states.

By following this approach, you can accurately perform the analysis and obtain the required results.

2025-01-21 03:05:52 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error message you're encountering:

```
100038 (22018): 01b9d9d8-0004-7ed2-0001-11c300f3244e: Numeric value '' is not recognized
```

This error occurs because the `TO_NUMBER` function is attempting to convert an empty string `''` to a number, which is not possible. Specifically, the issue arises from the `SUBSTRING` function in your query not extracting any characters, resulting in an empty string being passed to `TO_NUMBER`.

**Understanding the Root Cause**

Let's analyze your query and the data:

- **Your Query**:

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT "state"
  FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Error**: The column `"state"` does not exist in the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table.

In previous attempts, we tried to extract the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` column using:

```sql
TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 10, 2))
```

However, this resulted in the error because the `SUBSTRING` function is returning an empty string due to incorrect position indices.

**Correcting the Issue**

1. **Examining the `"geo_id"` Format**

   The `"geo_id"` column in the `STATE_2017_5YR` table typically has values like:

   ```
   "geo_id"
   ---------
   "04000US01"
   "04000US02"
   ...
   ```

   Let's map the positions of the characters:

   | Position | Character |
   |----------|-----------|
   |    1     |    0      |
   |    2     |    4      |
   |    3     |    0      |
   |    4     |    0      |
   |    5     |    0      |
   |    6     |    U      |
   |    7     |    S      |
   |    8     |    0      |
   |    9     |    1      |

   The **state FIPS code** is at positions **8** and **9**.

2. **Adjusting the `SUBSTRING` Function**

   - **Incorrect Usage**: `SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 10, 2)` returns an empty string because it starts at position 10, which is beyond the length of the string.
   - **Correct Usage**: `SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 8, 2)` extracts characters at positions 8 and 9, which represent the state FIPS code.

3. **Updating the Query**

   Replace the substring positions with the correct values.

**Updated SQL Queries**

---

1. **Query 1**: List all unique state names from the 2017 ACS 5-Year data.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT sf."state"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation**:

   - **`SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 8, 2)`**: Extracts the 2-character state FIPS code starting from position 8.
   - **`TO_NUMBER(...)`**: Converts the extracted FIPS code to a number, matching the data type of `sf."fips"`.
   - **`sf."state"`**: Retrieves the state name from the `"STATE_FIPS"` table.

          s2018."median_income" AS "median_income_2018",
          (s2018."median_income" - s2015."median_income") AS "median_income_change"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR" s2015
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2018_5YR" s2018
     ON s2015."geo_id" = s2018."geo_id"
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" sf

   ```sql
   SELECT sf."state", s."employed_manufacturing"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Query 10**: Retrieve ZIP codes, state codes, and median incomes from 2015 ZIP code data.

    JOIN "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."ZIP_CODES" gz
      ON SUBSTRING(z."geo_id", 10) = gz."zip_code"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

**Notes:**

- **Using Correct Positions in `SUBSTRING`**:

  - The state FIPS code is located at positions 8 and 9 in the `"geo_id"` field.
  - By adjusting the `SUBSTRING` function to start at position 8 and extract 2 characters, we correctly obtain the state FIPS code.

- **Avoiding `TO_NUMBER` Errors**:

  - Since we're now correctly extracting the FIPS code, `TO_NUMBER` receives valid numeric strings (e.g., `'01'`, `'02'`, etc.).
  - This prevents the error where `TO_NUMBER` was receiving an empty string `''`.

- **Ensuring Data Integrity**:

  - If you still encounter errors, you can use `TRY_TO_NUMBER` to handle any non-numeric values gracefully.

    ```sql
    ON TRY_TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
    ```

- **Validating the `geo_id` Length**:

  - In case there are any records with a shorter `geo_id`, you can add a condition to ensure only valid entries are processed.

    ```sql
    WHERE LENGTH(s."geo_id") >= 9
    ```

**Proceeding with the Task**

With these corrections, you should now be able to execute the queries without encountering the error. The updated queries will allow you to:

- Extract the necessary employment data from the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table.
- Retrieve median income data for 2015 and 2018.
- Calculate the vulnerable population for each state based on the weighted employment sectors.
- Identify the top 10 states with the highest vulnerable population.
- Determine the average median income change from 2015 to 2018 for these states.

**Final Steps**

- **Perform Calculations**:

  - Use the extracted data to compute the weighted sums for vulnerable populations using the specified weights for each sector.
  - Rank the states based on the calculated vulnerable population.

- **Analyze Income Changes**:

  - Calculate the average median income change for the top 10 states over the specified period.

- **Present the Results**

  - Compile the findings in the format requested, for example:

    ```csv
    State,Vulnerable_Population,Median_Income_Change
    Alabama,12345.67,1500.00
    Alaska,23456.78,2000.00
    ...
    (Attention: answer in 10 rows)
    ```

By following these steps and using the corrected queries, you'll be able to successfully complete the task.

2025-01-21 03:06:55 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error you're encountering:

```
000904 (42000): 01b9d9d9-0004-7ed2-0001-11c300f32456: SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 16
invalid identifier '"state"'
```

occurs because the column `"state"` does not exist in the table `"STATE_2017_5YR"` within the schema `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` of the database `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"`.

**Why the Error Occurs**

In the table `"STATE_2017_5YR"`, the columns available do not include `"state"`. Instead, the table contains columns like:

- `"geo_id"`
- `"median_income"`
- `"employed_pop"`
- Various employment and demographic fields.

The `"geo_id"` column contains the geographic identifier, which includes the state FIPS code. To obtain the state names, you need to extract the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` field and join it with a table that maps FIPS codes to state names.

**Solution**

To resolve the error and retrieve the state names, follow these steps:

1. **Extract the State FIPS Code from `"geo_id"`**

   The `"geo_id"` in the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table typically has values like `"04000US01"`, where the last two digits (`"01"`) represent the state FIPS code.

   Use the `SUBSTRING` function to extract the state FIPS code:

   ```sql
   SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 8, 2)
   ```

   - This extracts two characters starting from position 8.
   - Positions 8 and 9 correspond to the state FIPS code.

2. **Join with the `"STATE_FIPS"` Table**

   The `"STATE_FIPS"` table in the `"CYCLISTIC"` schema contains mappings of state FIPS codes to state names. 

   Join the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table with `"STATE_FIPS"` on the FIPS code to get the state name.

3. **Update Your Query**

   Here's the corrected query:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT sf."state"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" AS sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - `s`: Alias for the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table.
   - `sf`: Alias for the `"STATE_FIPS"` table.

2025-01-21 03:07:57 - root - INFO - **Addressing the Errors**

1. **Error with `SUBSTRING` Function**

   The error message:

   ```
   SQL compilation error:
   syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'SUBSTRING'.
   ```

   occurs because Snowflake SQL does not recognize the `SUBSTRING` function. In Snowflake, the correct function to use is `SUBSTR`.

2. **Error with `"state"` Column**

   The error message:

   ```
   SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
   invalid identifier '"state"'
   ```

   indicates that the column `"state"` does not exist in the table `"STATE_2017_5YR"`. Therefore, selecting `"state"` directly from that table results in an invalid identifier error.

**Solutions**

1. **Use `SUBSTR` Instead of `SUBSTRING`**

   Replace all instances of `SUBSTRING` with `SUBSTR` in your queries.

2. **Retrieve State Names by Joining with `"STATE_FIPS"` Table**

   Since the `"state"` column is not available in `"STATE_2017_5YR"`, you need to extract the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` column and join it with the `"STATE_FIPS"` table to get the state names.

**Corrected Queries**

1. **Extracting State Names from the 2017 ACS 5-Year Data**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT sf."state"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" AS sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **`SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)`**: Extracts the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` column, starting at position 8 for 2 characters.
   - **`TO_NUMBER(...)`**: Converts the extracted FIPS code to a number to match the data type of `sf."fips"`.
   - **`sf."state"`**: Retrieves the state name from the `"STATE_FIPS"` table.
   - **`JOIN`**: Joins the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table with `"STATE_FIPS"` on the state FIPS code.

2. **Retrieving Employment Data with Correct Column References**

   ```sql
   SELECT sf."state", s."employed_pop", s."employed_wholesale_trade"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" AS sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - This query selects the state name, total employed population, and employment in the wholesale trade sector for each state.

**General Guidance**

- **Replace `SUBSTRING` with `SUBSTR`**: In Snowflake SQL, the correct function to extract a substring is `SUBSTR(text, start_position, length)`.
- **Confirm Column Existence**: Before selecting a column, ensure that it exists in the table you're querying.
- **Use Table Aliases**: Using aliases like `s` for the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table and `sf` for `"STATE_FIPS"` makes your queries more readable.
- **Join Tables Appropriately**: Use the extracted state FIPS code to join the two tables and retrieve the state names.

2025-01-21 03:09:02 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error message you're receiving:

```
100038 (22018): 01b9d9db-0004-7ed2-0001-11c300f32462: Numeric value '' is not recognized
```

indicates that the SQL query is attempting to convert an empty string `''` to a numeric value, which results in an error. However, in the SQL query you provided:

```sql
SELECT "state", "employed_pop", "employed_wholesale_trade"
    FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR"
    LIMIT 100;
```

you're selecting `"state"` directly from the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table, which does not contain a column named `"state"`. This would typically result in an "invalid identifier" error.

**Why the Error Occurs**

The error you're encountering is likely due to another part of your query (perhaps not shown here) where you're attempting to convert a substring of `"geo_id"` to a number, and the substring is an empty string `''`. This could happen if:

- The `"geo_id"` field contains `NULL` or empty strings.
- The `SUBSTR` function is extracting beyond the length of the `"geo_id"` string, resulting in an empty string.

**Solution**

To resolve this issue, you need to:

1. **Extract the State FIPS Code from `"geo_id"`**
2. **Use `TRY_TO_NUMBER` Instead of `TO_NUMBER`**
3. **Filter Out Invalid `"geo_id"` Entries**
4. **Join with the `"STATE_FIPS"` Table to Get State Names**

**Corrected Query**

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT sf."state", s."employed_pop", s."employed_wholesale_trade"
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" AS sf
  ON TRY_TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
WHERE s."geo_id" IS NOT NULL AND LENGTH(s."geo_id") >= 9
  AND TRY_TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)`**: Extracts the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` string, starting at position 8 for 2 characters.
- **`TRY_TO_NUMBER(...)`**: Attempts to convert the extracted string to a number. If the conversion fails (e.g., due to an empty string), it returns `NULL` instead of throwing an error.
- **`WHERE` Clause**: Ensures that:
  - `"geo_id"` is not `NULL`.
  - `"geo_id"` has at least 9 characters to prevent `SUBSTR` from returning an empty string.
  - The result of `TRY_TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2))` is not `NULL`.
- **`JOIN` with `"STATE_FIPS"`**: Allows you to retrieve the state name corresponding to the FIPS code.
- **Selecting `sf."state"`**: Retrieves the state name from the `"STATE_FIPS"` table instead of attempting to select `"state"` from the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table.

**Additional Steps**

To proceed with your analysis:

1. **Retrieve Employment Data for All Relevant Sectors**

   Repeat the above approach for each sector needed to calculate the vulnerable population.

2. **Calculate the Vulnerable Population**

   Use the sector employment data and the provided weights to calculate the vulnerable population for each state.

3. **Calculate Median Income Changes**

   Retrieve median income data for 2015 and 2018, ensuring you handle any potential `NULL` or invalid values similarly.

4. **Identify the Top 10 States**

   Rank the states based on the calculated vulnerable population and select the top 10.

5. **Compile the Results**

   Prepare your final results in the requested CSV format.

**Example of Final Results**

```csv
State,Vulnerable_Population,Median_Income_Change
State1,vulnerable_population1,median_income_change1
State2,vulnerable_population2,median_income_change2
State3,vulnerable_population3,median_income_change3
State4,vulnerable_population4,median_income_change4
State5,vulnerable_population5,median_income_change5
State6,vulnerable_population6,median_income_change6
State7,vulnerable_population7,median_income_change7
State8,vulnerable_population8,median_income_change8
State9,vulnerable_population9,median_income_change9
State10,vulnerable_population10,median_income_change10
(Attention: answer in 10 rows)
```

**Moving Forward**

By adjusting your query to handle empty strings and ensuring you're selecting columns that exist in the tables, you should be able to retrieve the necessary data without errors and complete your task successfully.

---

**Key Points to Remember**

- **Use `TRY_TO_NUMBER`**: This function safely attempts to convert a string to a number and returns `NULL` if it fails, preventing errors when encountering empty strings.
- **Validate String Length**: Before extracting substrings, ensure the string is of sufficient length to avoid empty results.
- **Join Correctly**: Since the `"state"` column doesn't exist in the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table, you must join with the `"STATE_FIPS"` table to get state names.
- **Use Table Aliases**: Aliases like `s` for `"STATE_2017_5YR"` and `sf` for `"STATE_FIPS"` make your queries clearer and more concise.
- **Check for `NULL` Values**: Always account for potential `NULL` values in your data when performing operations like conversions or mathematical calculations.

By implementing these practices, you'll improve the robustness of your SQL queries and ensure successful data retrieval for your analysis.

2025-01-21 03:09:40 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error message you're receiving:

```
000904 (42000): 01b9d9dd-0004-7ed2-0001-11c300f32466: SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
invalid identifier '"state"'
```

indicates that the column `"state"` does not exist in the table `"STATE_2017_5YR"` within the schema `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` of the database `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"`.

**Reason for the Error**

In the table `"STATE_2017_5YR"`, there is no column named `"state"`. The available columns in this table include:

- `"geo_id"`
- `"employed_pop"`
- Various employment statistics (e.g., `"employed_wholesale_trade"`, `"employed_manufacturing"`, etc.)

The `"geo_id"` column contains geographical identifiers that can be used to extract the state FIPS code. To obtain the state name, you need to join the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table with another table that maps state FIPS codes to state names. In this case, that table is `"STATE_FIPS"` in the `"CYCLISTIC"` schema.

**Solution**

To resolve the error and retrieve the state names along with the employment data, you need to:

1. **Extract the State FIPS Code from `"geo_id"`**

   The `"geo_id"` in the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table is in the format `"04000US01"`, where the last two characters (positions 8 and 9) represent the state FIPS code.

   ```sql
   SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)
   ```

   - This extracts two characters starting from position 8.

2. **Convert the FIPS Code to a Number**

   To match the data type of the `"fips"` column in `"STATE_FIPS"`, convert the extracted FIPS code to a number:

   ```sql
   TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2))
   ```

3. **Join with the `"STATE_FIPS"` Table**

   Join the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table with the `"STATE_FIPS"` table on the FIPS code to get the state names.

**Corrected SQL Query**

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT sf."state", s."employed_pop", s."employed_wholesale_trade"
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" AS sf
  ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`s`**: Alias for the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table.
- **`sf`**: Alias for the `"STATE_FIPS"` table.
- **`SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)`**: Extracts the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` column.
- **`TO_NUMBER(...)`**: Converts the extracted FIPS code to a number.
- **`JOIN`**: Joins the two tables on the FIPS code.
- **`sf."state"`**: Retrieves the state name from the `"STATE_FIPS"` table.
- **`s."employed_pop"`** and **`s."employed_wholesale_trade"`**: Employment data from the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Using `SUBSTR` Function**: In Snowflake SQL, use `SUBSTR` instead of `SUBSTRING`.
- **Positioning in `SUBSTR`**: The state FIPS code is located at positions 8 and 9 in the `"geo_id"` string.
- **Handling Data Types**: Ensure that the data types match when joining tables (i.e., both sides of the `ON` clause should be comparable).
- **Avoiding Empty Strings**: If there's a possibility of encountering empty strings or `NULL` values in the `"geo_id"` column, you can use `TRY_TO_NUMBER`:

  ```sql
  ON TRY_TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
  ```

**Testing the Corrected Query**

Run the corrected query in your SQL environment. It should execute without errors and return the state names along with the employment data.

**Proceeding with Your Analysis**

Now that you've successfully retrieved the state names and employment data, you can proceed with your task:

1. **Calculate the Vulnerable Population**:

   - Use the employment data from various sectors and apply the given weights to calculate the vulnerable population for each state.

2. **Determine Median Income Changes**:

   - Retrieve median income data for 2015 and 2018 using similar joins with the `"STATE_FIPS"` table.
   - Calculate the change in median income for each state.

3. **Identify the Top 10 States**:

   - Rank the states based on the calculated vulnerable population.
   - Select the top 10 states with the highest vulnerable population.

4. **Prepare the Final Results**:

   - Organize your findings in the requested CSV format.

**Example of Final Results**

```csv
State,Vulnerable_Population,Median_Income_Change
California,123456.78,5000.00
Texas,112233.44,4500.00
Florida,99887.66,4000.00

North Carolina,33221.00,1500.00
Michigan,22110.99,1000.00
(Attention: answer in 10 rows)
```

**Summary**

- **Issue**: The column `"state"` does not exist in the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table, leading to an "invalid identifier" error.
- **Solution**: Extract the state FIPS code from `"geo_id"` and join with `"STATE_FIPS"` to obtain the state names.
- **Action**: Use the corrected SQL query provided to retrieve state names and proceed with your analysis.

By following these steps, you can successfully overcome the error and complete your task.

2025-01-21 03:11:04 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'SUBSTR'.
```

and:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
invalid identifier '"state"'
```

indicates that:

1. **The `SUBSTR` Function Is Not Recognized**

   - The SQL dialect you're using does not support the `SUBSTR` function or requires a different syntax.
   - The error occurs at position 0, which suggests the function is not expected at the beginning of the statement without a `SELECT`.

2. **The Column `"state"` Does Not Exist in the Table**

   - The `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table does not have a column named `"state"`.
   - Attempting to select `"state"` from this table results in an "invalid identifier" error.

**Solutions**

1. **Use the `RIGHT` Function to Extract the State FIPS Code**

   Since the `SUBSTR` and `SUBSTRING` functions are causing errors, we can use the `RIGHT` function to extract the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` column.

   - **Assumption**: The state FIPS code is in the last two characters of the `"geo_id"` string.
     - For example, if `"geo_id"` is `"04000US01"`, the state FIPS code is `"01"`.

   - **Syntax of `RIGHT` Function**:

     ```sql
     RIGHT(string, number_of_characters)
     ```

2. **Join with the `"STATE_FIPS"` Table to Get State Names**

   - Use the extracted state FIPS code to join the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table with the `"STATE_FIPS"` table.
   - Ensure that data types match by converting the extracted string to a numeric value.

**Corrected SQL Queries**

1. **Retrieve State Names and Employment Data**

   ```sql
   SELECT sf."state", s."employed_pop", s."employed_wholesale_trade"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" AS sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(RIGHT(s."geo_id", 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation**:

   - **`RIGHT(s."geo_id", 2)`**: Extracts the last two characters from the `"geo_id"` column, which represent the state FIPS code.
   - **`TO_NUMBER(...)`**: Converts the extracted FIPS code to a number, matching the data type of `sf."fips"`.
   - **`sf."state"`**: Retrieves the state name from the `"STATE_FIPS"` table.
   - **`JOIN`**: Joins the two tables on the state FIPS code.

2. **Retrieve Employment Data for the Arts, Entertainment, Recreation, Accommodation, and Food Services Sector**

   ```sql
   SELECT sf."state", s."employed_arts_entertainment_recreation_accommodation_food"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" AS sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(RIGHT(s."geo_id", 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Calculate the Change in Median Income from 2015 to 2018**

   ```sql
   SELECT sf."state",
          s2015."median_income" AS "median_income_2015",
          s2018."median_income" AS "median_income_2018",
          (s2018."median_income" - s2015."median_income") AS "median_income_change"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR" AS s2015
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s2018
     ON s2015."geo_id" = s2018."geo_id"
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" AS sf
     ON TO_NUMBER(RIGHT(s2015."geo_id", 2)) = sf."fips"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Note**:

   - Use the `RIGHT` function to extract the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` column in both `s2015` and `s2018` tables.

4. **Retrieve Employment Data for Other Sectors**

   You can apply the same logic to retrieve employment data for other sectors by replacing the column names accordingly.

**Testing the Corrected Queries**

- **Run the Queries**: Execute the corrected queries in your SQL environment to ensure they work without errors.
- **Verify the Data**: Check that the queries return the expected data with state names and employment figures.

**Proceeding with Your Analysis**

1. **Calculate the Vulnerable Population**

   - Use the employment data from various sectors and apply the specified weights to calculate the vulnerable population for each state.

2. **Identify the Top 10 States**

   - Rank the states based on the calculated vulnerable population.
   - Select the top 10 states with the highest vulnerable population.

3. **Calculate Median Income Changes**

   - Use the median income data from 2015 and 2018 to calculate the change for each state.

4. **Compile the Results**

   - Prepare your final results in the requested CSV format:

     ```csv
     State,Vulnerable_Population,Median_Income_Change
     State1,vulnerable_population1,median_income_change1
     State2,vulnerable_population2,median_income_change2
     State3,vulnerable_population3,median_income_change3
     State4,vulnerable_population4,median_income_change4
     State5,vulnerable_population5,median_income_change5
     State6,vulnerable_population6,median_income_change6
     State7,vulnerable_population7,median_income_change7
     State8,vulnerable_population8,median_income_change8
     State9,vulnerable_population9,median_income_change9
     State10,vulnerable_population10,median_income_change10
     (Attention: answer in 10 rows)
     ```

**Additional Tips**

- **Check for `NULL` Values**: Ensure that the `"geo_id"` columns do not have `NULL` values. If they do, you can add a `WHERE` clause to exclude them:

  ```sql
  WHERE s."geo_id" IS NOT NULL
  ```

- **Data Type Consistency**: Ensure that the data types used in the `ON` clause match. If `sf."fips"` is stored as a number, convert the extracted FIPS code accordingly.

- **Alternative Functions**: If the `RIGHT` function is not recognized, you can try using `SUBSTRING` with the correct syntax for your SQL dialect.

  - **Standard SQL `SUBSTRING` Syntax**:

    ```sql
    SUBSTRING(s."geo_id" FROM position FOR length)
    ```

  - Example:

    ```sql
    SUBSTRING(s."geo_id" FROM 8 FOR 2)
    ```

- **Avoid Functions in `ON` Clause**: If your SQL environment doesn't support functions in the `ON` clause, you can perform the extraction in a subquery:

  ```sql
  SELECT sf."state", s."employed_pop", s."employed_wholesale_trade"
  FROM (
    SELECT *, TO_NUMBER(RIGHT("geo_id", 2)) AS "fips_code"
    FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR"
  ) AS s
  JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" AS sf
    ON s."fips_code" = sf."fips"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

**Summary**

- **Issue**: The `SUBSTR` and `SUBSTRING` functions are causing syntax errors, and the `"state"` column does not exist in your data table.
- **Solution**: Use the `RIGHT` function to extract the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` column and join with the `"STATE_FIPS"` table to get the state names.
- **Result**: You should be able to execute the corrected queries without errors and proceed with your analysis.

2025-01-21 03:12:47 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

It appears that the SQL functions `SUBSTR`, `SUBSTRING`, and `RIGHT` are not recognized in your database system, resulting in errors like:

```
SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'RIGHT'.
```

and:

```
SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'SUBSTR'.
```

Additionally, you're receiving the error:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
invalid identifier '"state"'
```

when attempting to select the `"state"` column directly from the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table.

**Understanding the Issue**

- **String Functions Not Recognized**: Your SQL dialect or database does not support the string manipulation functions `SUBSTR`, `SUBSTRING`, or `RIGHT`, or they require a different syntax.
- **Missing `"state"` Column**: The `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table does not contain a column named `"state"`. This means we cannot directly select `"state"` from this table.

**Alternative Solution**

Given these challenges, we need to find a way to associate state names with the data in the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table without relying on string functions.

**Join on `geo_id` with `STATES` Table**

The `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` schema contains a table called `"STATES"` that includes:

- `"geo_id"`: Geographical identifier.
- `"state_name"`: Name of the state.

We can attempt to join the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table with the `"STATES"` table using the `"geo_id"` column, which might be compatible in both tables.

**Proposed SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_arts_entertainment_recreation_accommodation_food"
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
JOIN "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Aliases**: We use `s` for the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table and `gs` for the `"STATES"` table.
- **Joining on `"geo_id"`**: We join both tables on the `"geo_id"` column, avoiding the need for string manipulation functions.
- **Selecting State Name**: We select `gs."state_name"` and alias it as `"state"`.
- **Selecting Employment Data**: We select the required employment column from the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table.

**Next Steps**

1. **Run the Query**: Execute the proposed query to see if it works without errors.
2. **Verify the Data**: Check if the query returns the correct state names and employment data.
3. **Proceed with Calculations**: Use the retrieved data to calculate the vulnerable population based on the provided sector weights.

**Calculating the Vulnerable Population**

With the state names and employment data retrieved, you can proceed to:

- **Retrieve All Necessary Employment Columns**: Select all employment columns needed for the calculation from the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table.
- **Apply the Weights**: Use the provided weights for each sector to calculate the weighted sum for the vulnerable population.
- **Rank the States**: Order the states based on the calculated vulnerable population to identify the top 10 states.

**Example of Retrieving Multiple Employment Columns**

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state",
       s."employed_pop",
       s."employed_wholesale_trade",
       s."employed_arts_entertainment_recreation_accommodation_food",
       s."employed_information",
       s."employed_retail_trade",
       s."employed_public_administration",
       s."employed_other_services_not_public_admin",
       s."employed_education_health_social",
       s."employed_transportation_warehousing_utilities",
       s."employed_manufacturing"
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
JOIN "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Calculating Median Income Change**

Similarly, you can join the median income data from 2015 and 2018 with the `"STATES"` table:

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state",
       s2015."median_income" AS "median_income_2015",
       s2018."median_income" AS "median_income_2018",
       (s2018."median_income" - s2015."median_income") AS "median_income_change"
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR" AS s2015
JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s2018
  ON s2015."geo_id" = s2018."geo_id"
JOIN "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
  ON s2015."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Final Results**

After performing the calculations, you can present the results as:

```csv
State,Vulnerable_Population,Median_Income_Change
State1,vulnerable_population1,median_income_change1
State2,vulnerable_population2,median_income_change2
State3,vulnerable_population3,median_income_change3
State4,vulnerable_population4,median_income_change4
State5,vulnerable_population5,median_income_change5
State6,vulnerable_population6,median_income_change6
State7,vulnerable_population7,median_income_change7
State8,vulnerable_population8,median_income_change8
State9,vulnerable_population9,median_income_change9
State10,vulnerable_population10,median_income_change10
(Attention: answer in 10 rows)
```

**Summary**

- **Challenge**: The functions `SUBSTR`, `SUBSTRING`, and `RIGHT` are not available in your SQL environment, and the `"state"` column does not exist in the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table.
- **Solution**: Join the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table with the `"STATES"` table in the `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` schema on the `"geo_id"` column to retrieve state names.
- **Result**: You can retrieve the necessary data without using string functions and proceed with your analysis.

**Recommendation**

- **Consult Database Documentation**: Since certain functions are not working, check your database's documentation to understand which functions are supported and their correct syntax.
- **Verify Table Schemas**: Ensure that the `"geo_id"` columns in both tables match and that the `"STATES"` table contains the `"state_name"` column.
- **Handle Potential Discrepancies**: If the `"geo_id"` columns do not match exactly, you might need to adjust your approach, possibly by exporting the data and handling it outside the database.

---

By adjusting your queries to join on the `"geo_id"` column and using the `"state_name"` from the `"STATES"` table, you should be able to retrieve the state names and proceed with your task without encountering the previous errors.

The error message you're encountering:

```
090105 (22000): 01b9d9e0-0004-7ed2-0001-11c300f324b6: Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name.
```

indicates that your database session does not have a current database set. As a result, it cannot execute the `SELECT` statement because it doesn't know which database to use for unqualified table names.

**Solutions**

1. **Set the Current Database**

   Before running your query, you need to set the current database for your session. You can do this by executing the following command:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2";
   ```

   This command tells the database system which database to use for the session.

2. **Set the Current Schema (Optional)**

   If necessary, you can also set the current schema:

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
   ```

   Setting the schema allows you to reference tables without specifying the schema name in your queries.

3. **Run Your Query**

   After setting the current database (and schema), you can run your query. Since the `"state"` column does not exist in the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table, you need to join it with a table that contains state names. Here's how you can modify your query:

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_arts_entertainment_recreation_accommodation_food"
   FROM "STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **Setting the Database and Schema**: By using `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA`, you tell the session which database and schema to use, so you don't need to use fully qualified names in your query.
   - **Aliases**: `s` is an alias for the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table, and `gs` is an alias for the `"STATES"` table.
   - **Joining Tables**: We join the two tables on the `"geo_id"` column to associate state names with the employment data.
   - **Selecting Columns**: We select the `"state_name"` column from the `"STATES"` table and alias it as `"state"`, along with the employment data from the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table.

4. **Ensure Proper Permissions**

   Make sure your database user has the necessary permissions to access the databases and schemas involved.

5. **Check Table Availability**

   Verify that the tables `"STATE_2017_5YR"` and `"STATES"` exist in the specified database and schema.

**Additional Notes**

- **Qualified Names**: If you prefer to use fully qualified table names without setting the current database and schema, ensure that you're connected to the database and have the correct syntax:

  ```sql
  SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_arts_entertainment_recreation_accommodation_food"
  FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
  JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
    ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Double-Check Quotation Marks**: Ensure that you're using double quotes `"` for identifiers (e.g., table and column names) and single quotes `'` for string literals.

**Proceeding with Your Analysis**

After successfully running the query and retrieving the necessary data, you can proceed with your task:

1. **Calculate the Vulnerable Population**

   - Retrieve all employment sectors needed for the calculation.
   - Apply the specified weights to calculate the vulnerable population for each state.

2. **Determine Median Income Changes**

   - Retrieve median income data for 2015 and 2018.
   - Calculate the average median income change for each state.

3. **Identify the Top 10 States**

   - Rank the states based on the calculated vulnerable population.
   - Select the top 10 states with the highest vulnerable populations.

4. **Prepare the Final Results**

   Organize your findings in the requested CSV format:

   ```csv
   State,Vulnerable_Population,Median_Income_Change
   State1,vulnerable_population1,median_income_change1
   State2,vulnerable_population2,median_income_change2
   State3,vulnerable_population3,median_income_change3
   State4,vulnerable_population4,median_income_change4
   State5,vulnerable_population5,median_income_change5
   State6,vulnerable_population6,median_income_change6
   State7,vulnerable_population7,median_income_change7
   State8,vulnerable_population8,median_income_change8
   State9,vulnerable_population9,median_income_change9
   State10,vulnerable_population10,median_income_change10
   (Attention: answer in 10 rows)
   ```

**Example of Full Query**

Here's how you might write the full query to calculate the vulnerable population and median income change:

```sql

    ON s2015."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
)
-- Combine the data to get the final result
SELECT vp."state",
       vp."vulnerable_population",
       mi."median_income_change"
FROM vulnerable_population AS vp
JOIN median_income_change AS mi
  ON vp."state" = mi."state"
ORDER BY vp."vulnerable_population" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Notes:**

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Used for clarity to separate different parts of the calculation.
- **Weights**: Applied as per the given values.
- **Joining Data**: Combined the vulnerable population data with the median income change data.

**Conclusion**

By setting the current database and schema, and adjusting your query to join tables appropriately, you should be able to resolve the error and proceed with your analysis. Let me know if you need further assistance!

2025-01-21 03:15:39 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error message you're encountering:

```
090105 (22000): 01b9d9e2-0004-7e70-0001-11c300f3164a: Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name.
```

indicates that even though you've executed `USE DATABASE "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2";`, the session still does not recognize a current database. This can happen for several reasons, such as discrepancies in the session context, scope of commands, or the way the database and schemas are being referenced.

**Possible Reasons and Solutions**

1. **Session Context and Execution**

   - **Reason**: The `USE DATABASE` command must be executed in the same session or connection as your `SELECT` query. If you run `USE DATABASE` in one session and the `SELECT` statement in another, the context won't carry over.
   
   - **Solution**: Ensure that both the `USE DATABASE` command and the `SELECT` statement are executed within the same session or script. If you're using an IDE or SQL client, place the commands together.

2. **Set the Current Schema**

   - **Reason**: Even after setting the current database, some systems require you to set the current schema within that database.
   
   - **Solution**: After setting the database, set the schema using:

     ```sql
     USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
     ```
     
     Now your session knows both the database and schema contexts.

3. **Fully Qualified Names**

   - **Reason**: If the schemas are in different databases or you haven't set the current database and schema, you need to use fully qualified table names.

   - **Solution**: Since you've already used fully qualified names in your query, and the error persists, it's likely due to the session not recognizing the current database.

4. **Check for Typos and Correct Identifiers**

   - **Reason**: Typos in database, schema, or table names can cause the system to fail to recognize the specified database.
   
   - **Solution**: Double-check all names in your commands for correctness.

5. **Database Permissions**

   - **Reason**: Lack of necessary permissions can prevent the session from setting the database or accessing it.
   
   - **Solution**: Ensure your user account has the required permissions for `USE DATABASE`, `USE SCHEMA`, and `SELECT` operations on the specified database and schema.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. **Ensure `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` Are Executed Together**

   Execute both commands in the same session before running your query:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2";
   USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
   ```

   **Note**: Ensure both commands execute successfully without errors.

2. **Verify the Schemas of Both Tables**

   Since you're joining tables from two schemas, make sure both schemas are set or that you're referencing them correctly.

   - If the `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` schema is within the `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"` database, you don't need to specify the database again. Just set the schema when accessing tables in that schema.

3. **Modify Your Query**

   After setting the database and schema, modify your query to:

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
   FROM "STATE_2015_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation**:

   - Since you've set the current database and schema, you don't need to specify the database and schema for the `"STATE_2015_5YR"` table.
   - Keep the schema name `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` for the second table if it's a different schema.

4. **Alternative: Use Fully Qualified Names**

   If setting the schema doesn't work, try using fully qualified names for both tables:

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Note**: Ensure the database and schema names are correctly specified.

5. **Ensure Commands Are in the Same Script or Session**

   Place the `USE DATABASE`, `USE SCHEMA`, and your `SELECT` query in the same script or execution batch:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2";
   USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";

   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
   FROM "STATE_2015_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Check Database Connection Settings**

   - Ensure that your database client or interface is connected to the correct database server and that your user credentials have access to `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"`.

7. **Test with a Simple Query**

   - Try running a simple `SELECT` query on a table in the `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` schema to verify that the database and schema are correctly set:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM "STATE_2015_5YR" LIMIT 10;
     ```

   - If this works, then the issue might be with accessing the `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` schema.

8. **Set Both Schemas (if necessary)**

   - If the `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` schema is not accessible, you might need to set it as well:

     ```sql
     USE SCHEMA "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES";
     ```

   - However, setting a different schema might override the previous schema setting. In that case, use fully qualified names for tables in different schemas.

9. **Check for Schema Privileges**

   - Ensure that you have the necessary privileges to access both schemas. Lack of permissions can cause such errors.

10. **Contact Database Administrator**

    - If none of the above solutions work, consider reaching out to your database administrator to verify that your account has the correct configurations and permissions.

**Example of the Corrected Query with Steps**

```sql
-- Step 1: Set the current database
USE DATABASE "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2";

-- Step 2: Set the current schema to CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS
USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";

-- Step 3: Execute your query
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
FROM "STATE_2015_5YR" AS s
JOIN "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Important Notes**:

- **Session Consistency**: All commands must be executed in the same session to maintain context.
- **Schema References**: When referencing tables from a different schema than the one currently set, you need to include the schema name in the table reference.
- **Database and Schema Hierarchy**: Ensure that the database and schema names reflect the actual hierarchy in your database system.

**Conclusion**

The error arises because the session does not recognize a current database context. By setting the database and schema appropriately within the same session as your `SELECT` query, you should be able to resolve this issue. Make sure to check for any typos and verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the databases and schemas involved.

2025-01-21 03:16:35 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error message you're encountering:

```
002043 (02000): 01b9d9e3-0004-7ed2-0001-11c300f324ce: SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

indicates that one of the objects (tables, schemas, or columns) referenced in your SQL query does not exist or cannot be accessed.

**Possible Causes**

1. **Table Does Not Exist**

   - The table `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES"` may not exist in your database, or you might not have access to it.
   
   - The table `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR"` might not exist, or there might be a typo in the name.

2. **Schema Does Not Exist**

   - The schema `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` may not exist within your database.

3. **Columns Do Not Exist**

   - The column `"geo_id"` might not exist in one or both of the tables.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. **Verify the Existence of Tables and Schemas**

   - **Check if `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES"` Exists**

     Run the following query to list tables in the `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` schema:

     ```sql
     SELECT TABLE_NAME
     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
     WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'GEO_US_BOUNDARIES';
     ```

     Ensure that the `"STATES"` table is listed.

   - **Check if `"STATE_2015_5YR"` Exists**

     Similarly, check the tables in the `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` schema:

     ```sql
     SELECT TABLE_NAME
     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
     WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS';
     ```

     Ensure that `"STATE_2015_5YR"` is listed.

2. **Check for Typos and Correct Identifiers**

   - **Schema and Table Names**

     Ensure that the schema and table names are spelled correctly and match the case-sensitive names in your database.

     - For example, verify that it's `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` and not `"GEO_US_BOUNDARY"`.

   - **Column Names**

     Confirm that the `"geo_id"` column exists in both tables.

3. **Verify Permissions**

   - **Access Rights**

     Ensure that your user account has the necessary permissions to access the schemas and tables.

     - You might not have the privilege to read from the `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` schema.

4. **Use Alternative Tables If Necessary**

   - **Use the `"STATE_FIPS"` Table**

     If the `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES"` table is not accessible, you can use the `"STATE_FIPS"` table in the `"CYCLISTIC"` schema.

     - The `"STATE_FIPS"` table contains state names and FIPS codes.

**Alternative Query Using the `"STATE_FIPS"` Table**

Here's how you can modify your query:

```sql
SELECT sf."state", s."median_income"
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR" AS s
JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" AS sf
  ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Extracting State FIPS Code:**

  - `SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)` extracts the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` column.
    - For example, if `"geo_id"` is `'04000US01'`, it extracts `'01'`.

- **Converting to Number:**

  - `TO_NUMBER(...)` converts the extracted FIPS code to a numeric value to match the data type of `sf."fips"`.

- **Joining Tables:**

  - We join the `"STATE_2015_5YR"` table with the `"STATE_FIPS"` table on the state FIPS code.

- **Selecting State Names:**

  - `sf."state"` provides the state name from the `"STATE_FIPS"` table.

**Ensure Functions Are Supported**

- **Use Correct String Functions:**

  - If `SUBSTR` is not supported, try `SUBSTRING`. For example:

    ```sql
    SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 8, 2)
    ```

- **Handling Empty Strings:**

  - If you receive errors about empty strings or invalid numbers, use `TRY_TO_NUMBER`:

    ```sql
    ON TRY_TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
    ```

**Verify the Existence of the `"STATE_FIPS"` Table**

Run:

```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'CYCLISTIC' AND TABLE_NAME = 'STATE_FIPS';
```

**Revised Query**

```sql
SELECT sf."state", s."median_income"
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR" AS s
JOIN "CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" AS sf
  ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Notes:**

- **Set the Current Database and Schema:**

  - Before running the query, ensure that your session is using the correct database:

    ```sql
    USE DATABASE "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2";
    ```

- **Verify Table Access:**

  - The `"STATE_FIPS"` table should be accessible from the `"CYCLISTIC"` schema within the same database.

**Conclusion**

The error indicates that either the `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES"` table does not exist or you do not have access to it. By using the `"STATE_FIPS"` table from the `"CYCLISTIC"` schema as an alternative, you can obtain the state names needed for your analysis.

**Next Steps**

- **Try the Revised Query**

  Run the revised query to see if it executes successfully.

- **Verify Data**

  Ensure that the query returns the expected results with state names and median incomes.

- **Proceed with Analysis**

  Use the retrieved data to perform your calculations for the median income change and identification of the top 10 states.

In your query, you're using a fully qualified name for the first table but not for the second table in the `JOIN`. Specifically:

- **First Table (Fully Qualified):**

  ```sql
  "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR"
  ```

- **Second Table (Not Fully Qualified):**

  ```sql
  "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES"
  ```

Since the session does not have a current database set, and the second table does not include the database name, the system cannot locate it, resulting in the error.

**Solution**

To resolve this issue, you need to fully qualify **both** tables in your query by including the database name, schema name, and table name.

**Corrected SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR" AS s
JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of the Corrections**

- **Fully Qualify the Second Table:**
  
  - Changed `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES"` to `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES"` to include the database name.
  
- **Ensure Consistency:**
  
  - Both tables now have fully qualified names with the format: `"database_name"."schema_name"."table_name"`.
  
- **Session Context:**
  
  - By fully qualifying both tables, the query does not rely on the session having a current database set.

**Additional Steps**

If you prefer to set the current database and schema to simplify your queries, you can execute the following commands before running your query:

```sql
USE DATABASE "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2";
USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
```

Then, your query can be simplified:

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
FROM "STATE_2015_5YR" AS s
JOIN "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:**

- Even when setting the current database and schema, if the `JOIN` references a table from a different schema (e.g., `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"`), you need to include the schema name in the table reference.

**Verifying Table Existence and Permissions**

- **Check if the Schemas and Tables Exist:**

  - Ensure that both schemas `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` and `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` exist within the `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"` database.
  
  - Confirm that the tables `"STATE_2015_5YR"` and `"STATES"` exist within their respective schemas.

- **Verify Permissions:**

  - Make sure your user account has the necessary permissions to access both schemas and tables.

**Testing the Corrected Query**

Try executing the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR" AS s
JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Proceeding with Your Analysis**

Once the query executes successfully:

1. **Retrieve Necessary Data:**

   - Use similar fully qualified references for other queries involving tables in different schemas.

2. **Calculate Median Income Changes:**

   - Apply the required calculations to determine median income changes between 2015 and 2018.

3. **Identify Top 10 States:**

   - Use the retrieved data to calculate the vulnerable population and determine the top 10 states.

**Final Notes**

- **Consistency in Table References:**

  - Always ensure that all table references in your query are fully qualified when a current database is not set, or if you're accessing multiple databases/schemas.

- **Setting Session Context:**

  - If you set the current database and schema, remember that tables from other schemas still need to have their schema names specified.

- **Using Aliases:**

  - Continue using table aliases (e.g., `s` and `gs`) to make your queries more readable.

**Example: Using Fully Qualified Names in Both Tables**

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR" AS s
JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

By following these steps and ensuring that all table references include the necessary database and schema information, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully execute your queries.

```

indicate that there is a problem with how the database, schema, and table names are specified in your SQL statements. Let's address each error individually and provide solutions.

---

### **First Error Explanation**

**Error:**
```
001003 (42000): SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected '"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"'.
```

**Cause:**

You've entered:

```sql
"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR"
```

This is not a valid SQL statement. In SQL, you cannot execute a table name by itself; you need to specify an action to be performed, such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, etc.

**Solution:**

To query data from a table, you need to use a `SELECT` statement. For example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Second Error Explanation**

**Error:**
```
090105 (22000): Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name.
```

Even though you've used fully qualified table names, your SQL session still requires you to set a current database.

**Possible Causes:**

1. The `USE DATABASE` command was not executed in the same session as your `SELECT` statement.
2. There might be typos or incorrect casing in the database or schema names.
3. You might not have the necessary permissions to access the specified database or schemas.
4. There may be issues with how identifiers are quoted in your SQL environment.

**Solutions:**

#### **1. Ensure 'USE DATABASE' is Executed in the Same Session**

Execute the following command before your `SELECT` statement:

```sql
USE DATABASE "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2";
```

Make sure this command executes successfully and is in the same session as your queries.

#### **2. Set the Current Schema**

After setting the database, set the schema:

```sql
USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
```

#### **3. Verify Database and Schema Names**

Ensure that the database and schema names are correct and match exactly as they exist in your system. SQL identifiers are often case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes:

- `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"`
- `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"`
- `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"`

#### **4. Use Fully Qualified Names Consistently**

If you're accessing tables in different schemas or databases, fully qualify all table names, including the database and schema.

For example:

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **5. Check for Permissions**

Ensure that your user account has the necessary permissions to access the databases, schemas, and tables involved. Lack of permissions can prevent you from setting the database or accessing tables.

#### **6. Verify Table and Column Names**

Confirm that:

- The table `"STATE_2018_5YR"` exists in the `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` schema of the `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"` database.
- The table `"STATES"` exists in the `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` schema of the `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"` database.
- The column `"geo_id"` exists in both tables.

---

### **Consolidated Steps to Resolve the Error**

**Step 1: Set the Current Database and Schema**

```sql
USE DATABASE "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2";
USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
```

Ensure these commands execute successfully and are in effect for your session.

**Step 2: Fully Qualify All Table Names**

Even after setting the database and schema, when joining tables from different schemas, you need to fully qualify those table names.

**Example Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
JOIN "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:** Since you've set `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"` as your current database and `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` as your current schema, you can reference tables in that schema directly. For tables in other schemas, include the schema name.

**Step 3: Verify Access to the 'GEO_US_BOUNDARIES' Schema**

If you still encounter errors, it might be due to lack of access to the `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` schema. You can test access by running:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES";
```

If this query fails, you may need to check your permissions or confirm the existence of the schema and table.

**Step 4: Alternative Approach Using 'STATE_FIPS' Table**

If accessing the `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` schema is problematic, consider using the `"STATE_FIPS"` table in the `"CYCLISTIC"` schema, as it contains state names and FIPS codes.

**Corrected Query Using 'STATE_FIPS':**

```sql
USE DATABASE "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2";
USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";

SELECT sf."state", s."median_income"
FROM "STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
JOIN "CYCLISTIC"."STATE_FIPS" AS sf
  ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **SUBSTR(s."geo_id", 8, 2):** Extracts the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` column.
- **TO_NUMBER():** Converts the extracted string to a numeric value to match `sf."fips"`.
- **JOIN:** Matches the state FIPS codes to get the state names.

**Step 5: Ensure String Functions Are Supported**

If `SUBSTR` is not recognized in your SQL environment, try using `SUBSTRING`:

```sql
ON TO_NUMBER(SUBSTRING(s."geo_id", 8, 2)) = sf."fips"
```

If issues persist, check your SQL dialect's documentation for the correct function syntax.

**Step 6: Check for Case Sensitivity**

SQL identifiers enclosed in double quotes `"` are case-sensitive. Ensure that the casing of your database, schema, table, and column names matches exactly how they are defined in your database.

---

### **Final Recommendations**

- **Run Commands in the Same Session:** Ensure that all commands (`USE DATABASE`, `USE SCHEMA`, `SELECT`, etc.) are run in the same session.

- **Test Simple Queries:** Try running a simple query to a table you know exists and to which you have access, to confirm your session's database and schema settings.

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM "STATE_2018_5YR" LIMIT 10;
  ```

- **Consult Your Database Administrator:** If you continue to experience issues, it may be helpful to consult your DBA to verify your permissions and access rights.

- **Check Documentation:** Review your database system's documentation for specifics on handling databases, schemas, and object naming conventions.

---

By following these steps and ensuring that your session is correctly configured with the appropriate database and schema, you should be able to resolve the errors and execute your queries successfully.

2025-01-21 03:19:49 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error message you're encountering:

```
001003 (42000): 01b9d9e6-0004-7e70-0001-11c300f31672: SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected '"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"'.
```

indicates that there's a syntax error at the very beginning of your SQL query, specifically with the double-quoted identifier `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"`.

**Cause of the Error**

In your SQL query, you're using double quotes around the database, schema, and table names:

```sql
FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
```

While double quotes are used in SQL to denote identifiers (like table and column names), enclosing the database and schema names in double quotes at the beginning of the query can lead to syntax errors in certain SQL dialects. This is because the parser might not expect a quoted identifier at that position or might interpret it incorrectly.

**Solution**

To resolve this error, remove the double quotes around the database and schema names. Only use double quotes around identifiers that require them (e.g., if they contain special characters or are case-sensitive).

**Corrected SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Removed Double Quotes from Database and Schema Names:**

  - Changed `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"` to `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2`
  - Changed `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` to `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`
  - Changed `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` to `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES`

- **Kept Double Quotes for Table and Column Names:**

  - Table names like `"STATE_2018_5YR"` may require double quotes if they contain special characters or are case-sensitive.
  - Column names like `"state_name"` and `"geo_id"` are kept in double quotes.

**Alternative Approach: Set the Current Database**

Alternatively, you can set the current database and schema to simplify your queries:

```sql
-- Set the current database and schema
USE DATABASE CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2;
USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS;

-- Run your query without specifying the database and schema
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
FROM "STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Notes:**

- **Fully Qualified Names:**
  
  - When you don't set the current database and schema, you need to use fully qualified names but avoid unnecessary quoting.
  
- **Database and Schema Names:**
  
  - Typically, database and schema names are not enclosed in double quotes unless they contain spaces or special characters.

- **Consistency:**
  
  - Ensure that the casing (uppercase or lowercase) of the database and schema names matches what is defined in your database.
  
- **Check for Hidden Characters:**
  
  - Sometimes, copy-pasting code can introduce hidden characters. Make sure there are no invisible or special characters before the `SELECT` keyword.

**Testing the Corrected Query**

Try running the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

If you continue to encounter errors, consider the following:

- **Verify Access and Permissions:**

  - Ensure you have access to the `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2` database and the schemas `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` and `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES`.

- **Check Table and Column Names:**

  - Confirm that the table `"STATE_2018_5YR"` exists in the `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` schema.
  - Confirm that the table `"STATES"` exists in the `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES` schema.
  - Ensure that the columns `"geo_id"` and `"state_name"` exist in the respective tables.

- **Use Information Schema to Verify Objects:**

  You can query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to check available tables:

  ```sql
  SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
  FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
  WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'STATE_2018_5YR' OR TABLE_NAME = 'STATES';
  ```

**Summary**

The syntax error is due to the use of double quotes around the database and schema names at the beginning of your SQL query. By removing these double quotes, you adhere to the expected syntax of your SQL dialect, and the query should compile successfully.

**Next Steps**

- **Run the Corrected Query:**

  Execute the revised query and verify that it returns the expected results.

- **Proceed with Your Analysis:**

  Once the query runs successfully, you can continue with your analysis to calculate the vulnerable population and median income changes.

- **Let Me Know If You Encounter Further Issues:**

  If you face additional errors or have questions, feel free to ask for further assistance.

2025-01-21 03:20:53 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error message you're encountering:

```
001003 (42000): 01b9d9e7-0004-7e70-0001-11c300f3167a: SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'FROM'.
```

indicates that the SQL compiler found the keyword `'FROM'` at the very beginning of the query (position 0), where it expected something else—typically, it expects the `SELECT` keyword to start the query. This suggests that the compiler is not recognizing the `SELECT` statement at the start of your query.

**Possible Causes**

1. **Missing or Misspelled `SELECT` Keyword**

   - The `SELECT` keyword might be missing or misspelled.
   - There could be an issue with invisible or special characters interfering with the `SELECT` keyword.

2. **Invisible or Special Characters at the Beginning**

   - Sometimes, copying and pasting code can introduce hidden characters, such as Byte Order Marks (BOM), zero-width spaces, or other non-printable characters.
   - These characters can cause the SQL compiler to misinterpret the query.

3. **Incorrect Use of Quotation Marks**

   - Improper use of double quotes `"` around database and schema names might confuse the parser.
   - SQL dialects vary in how they handle quoted identifiers.

**Solutions**

**1. Retype the Query Manually**

   - Manually retype the query to eliminate any hidden or special characters.
   - Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters before the `SELECT` keyword.

**2. Use Correct Syntax and Quotation Marks**

   - Remove unnecessary double quotes around database and schema names.
   - Use double quotes only when necessary (e.g., for table or column names with special characters or case sensitivity).

**Corrected SQL Query**

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Removed Double Quotes from Database and Schema Names:**

  - Changed `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"` to `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2`
  - Changed `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` to `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`
  - Changed `"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"` to `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES`

- **Kept Double Quotes for Table and Column Names as Needed:**

  - Table names like `"STATE_2018_5YR"` are kept in double quotes because they contain special characters (e.g., underscores, numbers).

- **Ensured No Hidden Characters:**

  - Retyped the query to eliminate any hidden or special characters that might interfere with parsing.

**3. Set the Current Database and Schema (Optional)**

Alternatively, you can set the current database and schema to simplify your query:

```sql
-- Set the current database and schema
USE DATABASE CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2;
USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS;

-- Run your query
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
FROM "STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Notes:**

- **Running Commands in the Same Session:**

  - Ensure that the `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands are executed in the same session as your `SELECT` query.

- **Accessing Tables in Other Schemas:**

  - When referencing tables in schemas different from the current schema, you need to include the schema name (e.g., `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES"`).

**4. Verify Database, Schema, and Table Names**

- **Ensure Correct Names and Case Sensitivity:**

  - Database: `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2`
  - Schemas: `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`, `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES`
  - Tables: `"STATE_2018_5YR"`, `"STATES"`

- **Check for Typos:**

  - Verify that there are no typos or incorrect casing in the database, schema, table, or column names.

**5. Confirm Table and Column Existence**

- **Check if the Tables and Columns Exist:**

  - Verify that the `"STATE_2018_5YR"` table exists in the `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` schema.
  - Verify that the `"STATES"` table exists in the `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES` schema.
  - Ensure that the `"geo_id"` and `"state_name"` columns exist in the respective tables.

**6. Ensure Proper Permissions**

- **Check Your Access Rights:**

  - Ensure that your database user has the necessary permissions to access the databases, schemas, and tables involved.
  - Lack of permissions can cause errors when attempting to query objects.

**7. Test the Corrected Query**

- **Execute the Corrected Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
  FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
  JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
    ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **If the Error Persists:**

  - Try running a simple query to test connectivity and access:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS."STATE_2018_5YR" LIMIT 10;
    ```

  - If this simple query fails, the issue may be with database connectivity, permissions, or object existence.

**8. Check for Hidden Characters Before 'FROM'**

- The error message mentions `unexpected 'FROM'` at position `0`. This could indicate that there's a missing or unrecognized `SELECT` keyword.

- **Ensure the 'SELECT' Keyword is Correctly Placed:**

  - There should be nothing before the `SELECT` keyword on the first line.

- **Example:**

  ```sql
  -- Correct format with 'SELECT' at the beginning
  SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
  FROM ...
  ```

- **Re-type the 'SELECT' Line:**

  - Delete the line with `SELECT` and retype it manually to ensure no invisible characters are interfering.

**9. Verify the Entire Query for Syntax Errors**

- **Ensure Proper Line Breaks and Semicolons:**

  - Check that there are no misplaced line breaks or missing semicolons affecting the query parsing.

- **Full Query Rewritten:**

  ```sql
  SELECT
    gs."state_name" AS "state",
    s."median_income"
  FROM
    CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
  JOIN
    GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
  ON
    s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

**Conclusion**

The error is likely due to a syntax issue at the very beginning of your SQL query, possibly caused by invisible characters or improper use of quotation marks. By retyping the query, removing unnecessary double quotes around database and schema names, and ensuring correct syntax, you should be able to resolve the error and execute your query successfully.

**Next Steps**

1. **Retype the Query Manually:**

   - Avoid copying and pasting to eliminate hidden characters.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Double Quotes:**

   - Use double quotes only for identifiers that require them.

3. **Ensure Correct Syntax:**

   - Verify that the `SELECT` keyword is properly placed at the beginning.

4. **Test the Query:**

   - Execute the corrected query and confirm that it runs without errors.

2025-01-21 03:22:02 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error message you're encountering:

```
090105 (22000): Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name.
```

indicates that your SQL session does not have a current database set. Even though you're using fully qualified table names, some database systems require you to set the current database before executing queries. This ensures that the session knows which database context to operate within, especially when dealing with schemas and tables across different databases.

**Solution**

To resolve this error, you need to set the current database for your session using the `USE DATABASE` command. Here are the steps you should follow:

---

1. **Set the Current Database**

   Before running any `SELECT` statements, execute the following command to set the current database:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2;
   ```

   Ensure that this command runs successfully and is executed **in the same session** as your subsequent queries.

2. **Set the Current Schema (Optional)**

   If you plan to frequently access tables within a specific schema, you can also set the current schema:

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS;
   ```

   This step is optional but can simplify your queries if most of your tables are within this schema.

3. **Execute Your Query**

   After setting the current database (and schema), you can run your `SELECT` statement:

   **Example 1: Query with Joined Tables**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state",
          s2015."median_income" AS "median_income_2015",
          s2018."median_income" AS "median_income_2018",
          (s2018."median_income" - s2015."median_income") AS "median_income_change"
   FROM "STATE_2015_5YR" AS s2015
   JOIN "STATE_2018_5YR" AS s2018
     ON s2015."geo_id" = s2018."geo_id"
   JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
     ON s2015."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Example 2: Single Table Query**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
   FROM "STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
   JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Notes:**

   - Since you've set the `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2` database and, optionally, the `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` schema, you can reference tables within the current schema directly by their names.
   - For tables in other schemas (like `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES`), specify the schema name in your query.

4. **Ensure Permissions and Access**

   - Verify that your user account has appropriate permissions to access the `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2` database and the relevant schemas (`CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`, `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES`).
   - If you encounter permission errors, contact your database administrator to grant the necessary access.

5. **Execute Commands in the Same Session**

   - Make sure that the `USE DATABASE` command and your `SELECT` queries are executed in the **same session**.
   - In some SQL interfaces or clients, each new query window or tab creates a new session. Ensure you're running all commands within the same execution context.

---

**Example of a Complete Session**

```sql
-- Step 1: Set the current database
USE DATABASE CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2;

-- Step 2: Set the current schema (optional)
USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS;

-- Step 3: Execute your query
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state",
       s2015."median_income" AS "median_income_2015",
       s2018."median_income" AS "median_income_2018",
       (s2018."median_income" - s2015."median_income") AS "median_income_change"
FROM "STATE_2015_5YR" AS s2015
JOIN "STATE_2018_5YR" AS s2018
  ON s2015."geo_id" = s2018."geo_id"
JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
  ON s2015."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **USE DATABASE:** Sets the current database to `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2`.
- **USE SCHEMA:** Optionally sets the current schema to `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`, simplifying table references.
- **SELECT Query:** Executes the desired query, joining tables and calculating the median income change.

**Additional Tips**

- **Fully Qualified Names:** If you prefer not to set the database or schema, you can use fully qualified table names. However, some database systems still require a current database to be set for permissions and context.

  **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state",
         s2015."median_income" AS "median_income_2015",
         s2018."median_income" AS "median_income_2018",
         (s2018."median_income" - s2015."median_income") AS "median_income_change"
  FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS."STATE_2015_5YR" AS s2015
  JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s2018
    ON s2015."geo_id" = s2018."geo_id"
  JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
    ON s2015."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Consistency in Quoting:** Use double quotes for identifiers (database names, schema names, table names, column names) when necessary, especially if they contain special characters or are case-sensitive.

- **Session Persistence:** If you're using a SQL client or interactive environment, ensure that commands are executed in the same session. If the environment opens a new session for each query, include the `USE DATABASE` command at the beginning of each query or script.

**Common Pitfalls**

- **Permissions:** Lack of proper permissions can prevent you from setting the current database or accessing certain schemas and tables. Verify with your administrator if necessary.

- **Typos and Case Sensitivity:** SQL identifiers can be case-sensitive, especially when enclosed in double quotes. Ensure all names are spelled correctly and match the case used in the database.

- **Hidden Characters:** When copying and pasting code, invisible characters may cause unexpected errors. Retype commands manually if you suspect this issue.

**Conclusion**

The error you're encountering stems from the absence of a current database in your session context. By executing the `USE DATABASE` command and ensuring it's in the same session as your queries, you should be able to resolve the issue and run your `SELECT` statements successfully.

**Please try the steps outlined above, and let me know if you continue to experience any issues or have further questions.**

2025-01-21 03:23:54 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error message you're encountering:

```
002043 (02000): SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

indicates that the schema `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` does not exist in the current database `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"`, or your user account doesn't have the necessary permissions to access it.

**Possible Causes**

1. **Schema Does Not Exist**

   - The schema `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` might not exist in the database `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"`.
   - There might be a typo or case sensitivity issue in the schema name.
   - The schema might have a different name than expected.

2. **Case Sensitivity Issues**

   - In Snowflake (and many other SQL systems), identifiers are case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes.
   - If the schema was created with a specific case (e.g., lowercase), you need to use the exact casing.

3. **Lack of Permissions**

   - Your user account might not have the required permissions to access the schema.
   - You may need to be granted access by a database administrator.

**Solutions**

1. **Verify the Schemas Available in the Database**

   Before attempting to use a schema, it's helpful to list all available schemas in the current database to ensure the schema exists and to get the correct name.

   **Run the following command to list schemas:**

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS;
   ```

   This command will display all schemas in the current database. Look for the exact name of the schema that contains your tables.

2. **Check for Typos and Case Sensitivity**

   - Ensure that the schema name is spelled correctly.
   - If the schema name is all lowercase or has specific casing, you need to match it exactly when using double quotes.
   - For example, if the schema name is `"census_bureau_acs"` (all lowercase), you should use:

     ```sql
     USE SCHEMA "census_bureau_acs";
     ```

3. **Set the Correct Schema Name**

   Based on the output from `SHOW SCHEMAS;`, use the exact schema name in your `USE SCHEMA` command.

   **Example:**

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "census_bureau_acs";
   ```

   or if not case-sensitive (without double quotes):

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA census_bureau_acs;
   ```

4. **Verify Permissions**

   - If the schema exists but you still receive an error, you might not have the necessary permissions to access it.
   - Contact your database administrator to ensure your user account has the required privileges.

5. **Fully Qualify Table Names**

   If you're unable to set the schema, you can use fully qualified table names in your queries, including the database and schema names.

   **Example:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
   FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.census_bureau_acs."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
   JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. **Set the Current Database**

   You've already executed:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2;
   ```

2. **List Available Schemas**

   Run:

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS;
   ```

   **Check the output for the exact schema name.** It might be:

   - `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`
   - `census_bureau_acs`
   - `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2`
   - `census_bureau_acs_2`

   Note the exact spelling and casing.

3. **Set the Correct Schema**

   Use the exact schema name from the `SHOW SCHEMAS;` output.

   **For example:**

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "census_bureau_acs";
   ```

   or

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2";
   ```

4. **Verify the Schema is Set**

   You can confirm the current schema by running:

   ```sql
   SELECT CURRENT_SCHEMA();
   ```

   This should return the name of the schema you've set.

5. **Proceed with Your Queries**

   After successfully setting the correct schema, you can execute your queries.

   **Example Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
   FROM "STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
   JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Additional Tips**

- **Case Sensitivity in Snowflake**

  - In Snowflake, if an object name is created with double quotes and mixed cases or special characters, you must reference it exactly as it was created, including quotes and case.
  - If the schema was created without double quotes, Snowflake stores it in uppercase by default. So you should reference it in uppercase without quotes, like:

    ```sql
    USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS;
    ```

- **Use the Information Schema to List Schemas**

  If `SHOW SCHEMAS;` does not provide the information you need, you can query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA` view:

  ```sql
  SELECT SCHEMA_NAME
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA;
  ```

- **Check Permissions**

  If you find the schema but still cannot access it, you may need to check your permissions:

  ```sql
  SHOW GRANTS TO USER YOUR_USERNAME;
  ```

  Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username.

**Conclusion**

The error you're encountering suggests that the schema `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"` does not exist in the current database `"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"`, or there is a mismatch in the schema name due to typos or case sensitivity. By listing the available schemas and ensuring you're using the correct and properly cased schema name, you should be able to resolve the error and proceed with setting the schema and running your queries.

2025-01-21 03:25:54 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

You're encountering the error:

```
002043 (02000): SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

when executing:

```sql
USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS;
```

**Possible Causes**

1. **Schema Does Not Exist in the Current Database**

   Although you executed `USE DATABASE CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2;` successfully, the error suggests that the schema `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` might not exist in the database `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2` or is not accessible to your user.

2. **Case Sensitivity and Exact Schema Name**

   SQL identifiers (like schema names) can be case-sensitive, especially when enclosed in double quotes. If the schema was created with a specific case or special characters, you need to reference it exactly.

3. **Permissions**

   You might not have the necessary permissions to access or set the schema `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. **Verify the Schema Name and Existence**

   Since your `SHOW SCHEMAS;` output is long and cut off, let's focus on the relevant part:

   ```
   2024-10-23 17:03:51.921000-07:00,CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS,N,N,CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2,ACCOUNTADMIN,,,1,ROLE,
   2024-10-23 19:23:26.610000-07:00,CYCLISTIC,N,N,CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2,ACCOUNTADMIN,,,1,ROLE,
   2024-10-23 19:18:04.291000-07:00,GEO_US_BOUNDARIES,N,N,CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2,ACCOUNTADMIN,,,1,ROLE,
   ```

   This indicates that the database `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2` contains the schema `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`.

2. **Check for Case Sensitivity**

   Ensure that you're using the exact case as shown. If the schema name is uppercase in the `SHOW SCHEMAS;` output, you should reference it in uppercase without quotes.

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS;
   ```

   If it doesn't work, try enclosing the schema name in double quotes:

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
   ```

3. **Verify Permissions**

   Lack of permissions can prevent you from accessing or setting the schema. You can check your grants:

   ```sql
   SHOW GRANTS TO USER YOUR_USERNAME;
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username.

4. **Fully Qualify the Schema Name**

   If you're still experiencing issues, try specifying the database and schema together:

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS;
   ```

   Or with quotes if needed:

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
   ```

5. **Attempt to Access a Table Directly**

   To test whether you can access the schema's tables, try running a query using the fully qualified table name:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS."STATE_2015_5YR"
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   If this works, it indicates that you can access the tables even if you can't set the schema.

6. **Check with Database Administrator**

   If none of the above steps resolve the issue, the problem might be due to permissions or other configurations. Contact your database administrator to verify:

   - Your user account's permissions on the `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` schema.
   - Whether any access restrictions are in place.
   - If the schema is available in the database and accessible.

**Summary of Steps**

1. **Try Setting the Schema with Exact Case:**

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS;
   ```

2. **Try Enclosing the Schema Name in Double Quotes:**

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
   ```

3. **Try Fully Qualifying the Schema Name:**

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS;
   ```

4. **Check Permissions:**

   - Run:

     ```sql
     SHOW GRANTS TO USER YOUR_USERNAME;
     ```

   - Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username.

5. **Access Tables Directly with Fully Qualified Names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
   FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS."STATE_2015_5YR" AS s
   JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Consult the Database Administrator:**

   - If you still cannot set the schema or access the tables, reach out to your DBA to verify your access rights and resolve any permission issues.

**Next Steps**

- **Proceed with Fully Qualified Table Names:**

  If you're able to access tables using fully qualified names, you can continue with your queries without setting the schema.

- **Example Query Without Setting Schema:**

  ```sql
  USE DATABASE CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2;

  SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state",
         s2015."median_income" AS "median_income_2015",
         s2018."median_income" AS "median_income_2018",
         (s2018."median_income" - s2015."median_income") AS "median_income_change"
  FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS."STATE_2015_5YR" AS s2015
  JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s2018
    ON s2015."geo_id" = s2018."geo_id"
  JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
    ON s2015."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Adjust Your Scripts:**

  Since setting the schema isn't working, adjust your scripts to include fully qualified table names.

**Final Note**

It's important to ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the schemas and tables in your database. If you continue to experience issues after trying the above steps, please consult with your database administrator to resolve any permission or configuration problems.

2025-01-21 03:26:42 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

You're encountering the error:

```
002043 (02000): 01b9d9ed-0004-7e70-0001-11c300f316f2: SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

when executing:

```sql
-- Set the current schema (replace with the correct schema name if necessary)
USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS;
```

**Possible Causes**

1. **Schema Does Not Exist in the Current Database**

   Although you've successfully executed `USE DATABASE CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2;`, the schema `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` may not exist in the database `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2` or may be named differently.

2. **Case Sensitivity and Exact Schema Name**

   Database object names can be case-sensitive, especially when enclosed in double quotes. If the schema name's case does not match exactly, or if it contains special characters, the system may not recognize it.

3. **Permissions**

   You might not have the necessary permissions to access or set the schema `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. **Verify the Available Schemas in the Database**

   Since the `SHOW SCHEMAS;` output you provided was truncated, let's focus on the relevant parts you shared. From your output, we can see:

   ```
   2024-10-23 17:03:51.921000-07:00,CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS,N,N,CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2,ACCOUNTADMIN,,,1,ROLE,
   2024-10-23 19:23:26.610000-07:00,CYCLISTIC,N,N,CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2,ACCOUNTADMIN,,,1,ROLE,
   2024-10-23 19:18:04.291000-07:00,GEO_US_BOUNDARIES,N,N,CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2,ACCOUNTADMIN,,,1,ROLE,
   ```

   This indicates that the database `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2` contains the schemas:

   - `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`
   - `CYCLISTIC`
   - `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES`

2. **Check for Case Sensitivity**

   Ensure that you're using the exact schema name as it appears, including case sensitivity.

   Since the schema name is in **uppercase**, you should reference it in uppercase letters.

3. **Use Double Quotes if Necessary**

   If the schema name contains special characters or is case-sensitive, enclose it in double quotes:

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
   ```

4. **Fully Qualify the Schema Name**

   Since you're already connected to the database `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2`, you can fully qualify the schema name to ensure accuracy:

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
   ```

   However, in some SQL environments, `USE SCHEMA` might not accept a fully qualified name. If that's the case, you can proceed to use fully qualified table names in your queries instead of setting the schema.

5. **Attempt to Access a Table Directly**

   Test whether you can access the tables in the schema without setting the schema:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2018_5YR"
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   If this query executes successfully, it means you can access the tables using fully qualified names.

6. **Proceed Without Setting the Schema**

   If setting the schema continues to result in an error, you can write your queries using fully qualified table names:

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Check Your Permissions**

   Lack of necessary permissions can cause the "Object does not exist" error. Verify that your user account has access to the `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` schema:

   ```sql
   SHOW GRANTS TO USER YOUR_USERNAME;
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username. Look for entries that grant you access to the `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` schema.

8. **Consult Your Database Administrator**

   If you still cannot set the schema or access the tables, it's possible that:

   - You lack the necessary permissions.
   - There are access restrictions on the schema.

   In this case, please contact your database administrator to resolve any permission issues.

**Moving Forward**

Given the situation, I recommend proceeding by using fully qualified table names in your queries without setting the current schema.

**Example Queries**

1. **Retrieve Median Income**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."median_income"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Calculate Median Income Change from 2015 to 2018**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state",
          s2015."median_income" AS "median_income_2015",
          s2018."median_income" AS "median_income_2018",
          (s2018."median_income" - s2015."median_income") AS "median_income_change"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2015_5YR" AS s2015
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2018_5YR" AS s2018
     ON s2015."geo_id" = s2018."geo_id"
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s2015."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve Employment Data**

   For other queries, use a similar format:

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   Replace `"employed_information"` with the relevant column name for each query.

**Summary**

- **Use Fully Qualified Table Names:** Since setting the schema is resulting in an error, proceed by fully qualifying your table names with the database and schema.

- **Ensure Correct Case and Quotation Marks:**

  - Enclose identifiers with special characters or mixed case in double quotes.
  - Use the exact casing for database, schema, table, and column names.

- **Check Permissions:**

  - Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the schemas and tables.
  - If not, contact your database administrator for assistance.

- **Run Commands in the Same Session:**

  - Ensure that the `USE DATABASE` command and your queries are executed in the same session.

**Let me know if you're able to execute your queries using the fully qualified table names or if you need further assistance!**

2025-01-21 03:27:24 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

You're encountering the error:

```
002043 (02000): SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

when executing:

```sql
-- Set the current schema (replace with the correct schema name if necessary)
USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS;
```

**Possible Causes**

1. **Schema Does Not Exist in the Current Database**

   Despite setting the current database to `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2`, the schema `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` may not exist in that database, or it may be named differently.

2. **Case Sensitivity and Exact Schema Name**

   SQL identifiers can be case-sensitive, especially when enclosed in double quotes. The schema name may have different casing or special characters.

3. **Permissions**

   You may not have the necessary permissions to access or use the schema `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. **Verify the Exact Schema Name and Case**

   From your `SHOW SCHEMAS;` output (though truncated), the database `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2` contains the following schemas:

   - `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`
   - `CYCLISTIC`
   - `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES`

   Ensure you're using the exact schema name with the correct case.

2. **Use Double Quotes for Case Sensitivity**

   If the schema name is case-sensitive or contains special characters, enclose it in double quotes:

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
   ```

   Try both uppercase and lowercase variations if unsure:

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "census_bureau_acs";
   ```

3. **Fully Qualify the Schema Name**

   If the above does not work, try specifying the database along with the schema:

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
   ```

4. **Check for Hidden Characters**

   Ensure there's no hidden whitespace or special characters in your command. Retype the command manually to eliminate any potential issues.

5. **Verify Permissions**

   Lack of permissions can prevent you from accessing a schema. Check your user grants:

   ```sql
   SHOW GRANTS TO USER YOUR_USERNAME;
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username.

6. **Attempt to Access Tables Directly**

   If setting the schema continues to fail, try accessing a table using a fully qualified name:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR"
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   If this works, you can proceed without setting the schema.

**Proceeding Without Setting the Schema**

Since setting the schema is resulting in an error, you can use fully qualified table names in your queries.

**Corrected SQL Statements**

Here are your SQL statements adjusted to use fully qualified table names:

---

1. **Retrieve Employment in Information Sector**

    ```sql
    SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
    FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
    JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
      ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

2. **Set the Current Database**

    ```sql
    USE DATABASE "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2";

2025-01-21 03:28:10 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

You're encountering the error:

```
002003 (42S02): SQL compilation error:
Object 'STATE_2017_5YR' does not exist or not authorized.
```

when executing the following query:

```sql
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
FROM "STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

This error indicates that the table `"STATE_2017_5YR"` does not exist in the current schema, or you do not have the necessary permissions to access it.

**Possible Causes**

1. **Current Schema Not Set Correctly**

   Since you've been unable to set the current schema to `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`, the session might be defaulting to a different schema, such as `PUBLIC`, where the table does not exist.

2. **Table Located in a Different Schema**

   The table `"STATE_2017_5YR"` might exist in the `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` schema, which you're unable to set, or in another schema.

3. **Lack of Permissions**

   You might not have permissions to access the schema or table.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. **Use Fully Qualified Table Names in Your Query**

   Since you're unable to set the schema using `USE SCHEMA`, you should reference the tables using fully qualified names, including the database and schema.

   **Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Verify the Existence of the Table**

   To ensure that the table `"STATE_2017_5YR"` exists and to find out which schema it belongs to, run the following query:

   ```sql
   SELECT TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
   WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'STATE_2017_5YR';
   ```

   This will list all databases and schemas where the table exists.

3. **Check for Typos and Case Sensitivity**

   Ensure that the table name, schema name, and database name are spelled correctly and with the correct case.

   - **Database:** `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2`
   - **Schemas:** `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS`, `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES`
   - **Table:** `"STATE_2017_5YR"`

   SQL identifiers are case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes.

4. **Check Permissions**

   You might not have the necessary permissions to access the table or schema. Contact your database administrator to verify your permissions.

5. **List All Tables in the Schema**

   Since you're unable to set the schema, you can list all tables in the `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` schema using:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS";
   ```

   Look for the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table in the list.

6. **Attempt to Access the Table Using the PUBLIC Schema**

   It's possible that the table is located in the `PUBLIC` schema. Try referencing the table accordingly:

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."PUBLIC"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA to Find the Table**

   Query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` view to find the exact location of the table:

   ```sql
   SELECT TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2".INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
   WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'STATE_2017_5YR';
   ```

8. **Example of Corrected Query Using Fully Qualified Names**

   **Assuming the table is in the `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` schema:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **If the table is in the `PUBLIC` schema:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."PUBLIC"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Check if the Table Exists in the `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES` Schema**

   It's possible that the table might be in a different schema. Try:

   ```sql
   SELECT TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2".INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
   WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'STATE_2017_5YR';
   ```

10. **Alternative Solution Using Available Tables**

    If you're unable to locate the `"STATE_2017_5YR"` table, but you have access to other tables with similar data, you might consider using those tables.

    **Example:**

    ```sql
    SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
    FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."PUBLIC"."STATE_DATA" AS s
    JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."PUBLIC"."STATES" AS gs
      ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    Replace `"STATE_DATA"` and `"STATES"` with the actual table names you have access to.

**Summary**

- **Use Fully Qualified Table Names:** Since setting the current schema is not working, include the database and schema in your table names.

- **Verify Table Existence:** Use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` view to check where the table exists.

- **Check Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the table and schema.

- **Correct Quoting and Case Sensitivity:** Ensure you're using the correct casing and quoting for database, schema, and table names.

- **Consult Database Administrator:** If you're unable to locate the table or access it due to permissions, please contact your database administrator for assistance.

**Final Note**

By following the steps above, you should be able to resolve the "Object does not exist" error and successfully execute your query. If you continue to experience issues, please provide the results of the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` queries so we can assist you further.

2025-01-21 03:29:06 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

You're encountering the error:

```
002003 (42S02): SQL compilation error:
Object 'STATE_2017_5YR' does not exist or not authorized.
```

when executing the following query:

```sql
-- Query
SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
FROM "STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
JOIN GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."STATES" AS gs
  ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
LIMIT 100
```

This error indicates that the table `"STATE_2017_5YR"` does not exist in the current database and schema context, or you do not have the necessary permissions to access it.

**Possible Causes**

1. **Current Schema Not Set Correctly**

   Since you're unable to set the current schema using `USE SCHEMA`, your session is likely defaulting to a different schema (such as `PUBLIC`) where the table `"STATE_2017_5YR"` does not exist.

2. **Table Exists in a Different Schema**

   The table `"STATE_2017_5YR"` may exist in a schema that you're not currently accessing or have not specified in your query.

3. **Permissions**

   You may not have the necessary permissions to access the schema or the table.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. **Use Fully Qualified Table Names**

   Since setting the schema is not working, you can reference the table using its fully qualified name, including the database and schema.

   **Updated Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"**: The database name.
   - **"CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"**: The schema name where the `STATE_2017_5YR` table is located.
   - **"GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"**: The schema name where the `STATES` table is located.

2. **Verify Table Existence and Locate Correct Schema**

   Use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to verify that the table exists and identify its schema.

   **Query to Check Table Existence:**

   ```sql
   SELECT TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2".INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
   WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'STATE_2017_5YR';
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - This query will list all schemas in the database `CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2` where a table named `STATE_2017_5YR` exists.
   - It helps you confirm the schema where the table is located.

3. **Ensure Correct Naming and Case Sensitivity**

   - SQL identifiers are case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes.
   - Verify that the database, schema, and table names are spelled correctly and match the case used in the database.
   - For example, if the table name is actually `"state_2017_5yr"`, you need to match that case exactly.

4. **Check Permissions**

   - You might not have the necessary permissions to access the `STATE_2017_5YR` table.
   - Contact your database administrator to verify your access rights to the required schemas and tables.

5. **Attempt to Access the Table Using the Identified Schema**

   Once you identify the correct schema where the table exists, update your query accordingly.

   **Example:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."IDENTIFIED_SCHEMA"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - Replace `"IDENTIFIED_SCHEMA"` with the actual schema name where the table is located.

6. **Consider Alternative Tables**

   If the `STATE_2017_5YR` table is not accessible, you might need to use an alternative table that contains the required data.

   **Example:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."ALTERNATIVE_SCHEMA"."ALTERNATIVE_TABLE" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - Replace `"ALTERNATIVE_SCHEMA"` and `"ALTERNATIVE_TABLE"` with the schema and table you have access to that contain similar data.

**Example of Checking Table Existence**

To illustrate how to locate the table, here's how you can use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`:

```sql
SELECT TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_CATALOG = 'CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2'
  AND TABLE_NAME = 'STATE_2017_5YR';
```

**Proceeding with Your Analysis**

6. **Confirm Default Database and Schema Settings:**

   - **Set the Current Database:**
     - Make sure that your session is connected to the correct database. Sometimes, the lack of a current database can lead to objects not being found.
   - **Understand Session Defaults:**
     - If you cannot set the default schema due to permissions or other issues, you will need to include the schema name explicitly in your queries.

7. **Examine Error Messages Carefully:**

   - **Interpret the Error Details:**
     - The error code and message can provide clues. For instance, error code `42S02` typically indicates that a table or view does not exist.
   - **Check for Additional Information:**
     - Sometimes, error messages include additional details about authorization or object existence that can guide your troubleshooting.

8. **Review Database Documentation:**

   - **Syntax Requirements:**
     - Ensure that your queries adhere to the syntax requirements of your specific database system.
   - **Special Considerations:**
     - Some databases have specific requirements for accessing cross-schema objects or handling case sensitivity.

9. **Consult with Colleagues or Team Members:**

   - **Collaborate on Troubleshooting:**
     - Others who work with the same database may have encountered similar issues and can offer insights or solutions.

10. **Consider Alternative Data Sources:**

**Notes:**

- Since setting the current schema using `USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` results in an error, it's recommended to use fully qualified table names that include the database and schema names.
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the specified databases, schemas, and tables.
- Verify that the database, schema, and table names are correct and match the case used in your database system.
- Use double quotes around identifiers when they contain special characters or are case-sensitive.
- Execute `USE DATABASE CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2;` and your queries within the same session to maintain the context.

2025-01-21 03:34:34 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error**

The error message you're encountering:

```
000900 (42601): SQL compilation error:
Empty SQL statement.
```

occurs because the SQL command you attempted to execute contains only a comment and no executable SQL statement.

You input:

```sql
-- Unable to set the schema due to errors. Proceed using fully qualified table names in your queries.
```

In SQL, lines starting with `--` are comments and are ignored by the SQL engine during execution. If you attempt to execute a command that consists only of comments, the SQL engine will report an "Empty SQL statement" error because there's no actual SQL command to execute.

**Resolution**

Since setting the schema using `USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` resulted in errors (as previously discussed), you should proceed by using **fully qualified table names** in your queries. This means specifying the database and schema explicitly in your SQL statements.

**Steps to Follow**

1. **Ensure the Current Database Is Set**

   You've successfully set the current database:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2;
   ```

2. **Use Fully Qualified Table Names in Your Queries**

   When referencing tables, include both the database and schema names.

   **Example of a Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_information"
   FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
   JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
     ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   By fully qualifying the table names, you bypass the need to set the schema, and you ensure that the SQL engine can locate the tables regardless of the current schema context.

3. **Remove Comments When Executing SQL**

   Make sure that the SQL commands you execute contain actual SQL statements and not just comments. Comments are useful for documentation but are ignored during execution.

   **Incorrect:**

   ```sql
   -- This is a comment only
   ```

   **Correct:**

   ```sql
   -- This is a comment
   SELECT * FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Apply This Practice to All Your Queries**

   For all your SQL queries, use the fully qualified table names to avoid errors related to the schema context.

   **Examples:**

   - **Retrieving Employment in Manufacturing Sector:**

     ```sql
     SELECT gs."state_name" AS "state", s."employed_manufacturing"
     FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS"."STATE_2017_5YR" AS s
     JOIN "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."STATES" AS gs
       ON s."geo_id" = gs."geo_id"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

   - **Retrieving ZIP Codes and State Codes:**

     ```sql
     SELECT "zip_code", "state_code"
     FROM "CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."ZIP_CODES"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

**Summary**

- **Empty SQL Statement Error:** Occurs when you attempt to execute a command that contains only comments and no executable SQL statements.

- **Solution:** Use fully qualified table names in your queries to bypass schema-related issues and ensure the SQL engine can locate the tables.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Always include at least one executable SQL command in your statements.
  - Use comments (`-- Comment text`) for documentation, but ensure they are accompanied by SQL commands if you intend to execute them.
  - When unable to set the schema, specify the database and schema explicitly in your table references.

**Notes:**

- **Using Fully Qualified Table Names**: Since setting the schema using `USE SCHEMA CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS` results in an error, we use fully qualified table names in all queries. This means specifying the database and schema names in each table reference.

- **Including Executable Commands**: All SQL statements include executable commands with necessary comments for clarity. This avoids the "Empty SQL statement" error that occurs when running comments without accompanying SQL commands.

- **Consistency**: Ensure that you execute `USE DATABASE CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2;` before running the queries, and that all commands are executed in the same session.

- **Schema Verification**: You can verify the available schemas in the database using the `SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2;` command.

- **Permissions**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the specified databases, schemas, and tables.

If you encounter any further errors or need additional assistance with other SQL statements, please let me know!

# Calculation of Total Vulnerable Population

## Objective
Calculate the total vulnerable population based on a weighted sum of employment in various sectors, along with the average median income change between 2015 and 2018 for U.S. states.

## Sectors and Weights
The total vulnerable population is calculated using the following sectors and their corresponding weights:

| Sector                                                                  | Weight          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|

Task: Identify the top 10 U.S. states with the highest vulnerable population, calculated based on a weighted sum of employment sectors using 2017 ACS 5-Year data, and determine their average median income change from 2015 to 2018 using zip code data. 

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the 2017 ACS 5-Year data, the top 10 U.S. states with the highest vulnerable population are identified by calculating a weighted sum of employment in various sectors. The average median income change between 2015 and 2018 for these states is also provided.

```csv
State,Vulnerable_Population,Median_Income_Change
state1:str,vulnerable_population1:float,median_income_change1:float
state2:str,vulnerable_population2:float,median_income_change2:float
state3:str,vulnerable_population3:float,median_income_change3:float
state4:str,vulnerable_population4:float,median_income_change4:float
state5:str,vulnerable_population5:float,median_income_change5:float
state6:str,vulnerable_population6:float,median_income_change6:float
state7:str,vulnerable_population7:float,median_income_change7:float
state8:str,vulnerable_population8:float,median_income_change8:float
state9:str,vulnerable_population9:float,median_income_change9:float
state10:str,vulnerable_population10:float,median_income_change10:float
(Attention: answer in 10 rows)
```

**Explanation:**

- **State**: The name of the U.S. state (string).
- **Vulnerable_Population**: The calculated vulnerable population based on the weighted sum of employment sectors (float).
- **Median_Income_Change**: The average change in median income between 2015 and 2018 for the state (float).

This data helps in understanding which states have the highest vulnerable populations and how their median incomes have changed over time..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

**Explanation:**

- **State**: The name of the U.S. state (string).
- **Vulnerable_Population**: The calculated vulnerable population based on the weighted sum of employment sectors (float).
- **Median_Income_Change**: The average change in median income between 2015 and 2018 for the state (float).

This data helps in understanding which states have the highest vulnerable populations and how their median incomes have changed over time. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

- **Median_Income_Change**: The average change in median income between 2015 and 2018 for the state (float).

This data helps in understanding which states have the highest vulnerable populations and how their median incomes have changed over time. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-21 03:47:16 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Identify the top 10 U.S. states with the highest vulnerable population, calculated based on a weighted sum of employment sectors using 2017 ACS 5-Year data, and determine their average median income change from 2015 to 2018 using zip code data. , reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Based on the 2017 ACS 5-Year data, the top 10 U.S. states with the highest vulnerable population are identified by calculating a weighted sum of employment in various sectors. The average median income change between 2015 and 2018 for these states is also provided.

**Explanation:**

- **State**: The name of the U.S. state (string).
- **Vulnerable_Population**: The calculated vulnerable population based on the weighted sum of employment sectors (float).
- **Median_Income_Change**: The average change in median income between 2015 and 2018 for the state (float).

This data helps in understanding which states have the highest vulnerable populations and how their median incomes have changed over time. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
