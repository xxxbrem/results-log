After analyzing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that answers the task.

**Reason:**

- **Comprehensive Extraction:** `2result.sql` handles imports from all three file types: Python, R, and IPython notebooks. It uses appropriate regular expressions to extract imported library or module names from each file type.
  
- **Accurate Counting:** It aggregates the counts of each library or module across all files, ensuring that the total occurrences are correctly tallied.
  
- **Correct Result:** By ordering the libraries/modules based on their total counts and selecting the second one (`rn = 2`), it correctly identifies the second most frequently imported or loaded library or module in the dataset.

Therefore, the SQL query in `2result.sql` is the correct one for determining the second most frequently imported or loaded library or module based on the extracted import statements.
