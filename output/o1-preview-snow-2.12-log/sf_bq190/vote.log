After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, here's the analysis:

**0result.sql**:

- **Date Range Filtering**: Uses the correct microsecond timestamps to filter users who signed up between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022.
- **Gender Mapping**: Maps 'M' and 'F' to 'Male' and 'Female' for clearer output.
- **Counts**: The counts for the youngest and oldest users per gender match expected values (485 females aged 12, 467 females aged 70, 432 males aged 12, 461 males aged 70).

**1result.sql**:

- **Date Range Filtering**: Uses `TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ` with 'YYYY-MM-DD', but the end date likely excludes users who signed up on April 30, 2022, because it doesn't include the entire day.
- **Counts**: Shows a discrepancy in the counts for females aged 70 (466 instead of 467), indicating it might be missing some users due to the date range issue.
- **Gender Mapping**: Maps 'M' and 'F' to 'Male' and 'Female'.

**2result.sql**:

- **Date Range Filtering**: Correctly filters the date range using microsecond timestamps.
- **Counts**: Matches the counts from `0result.sql`, indicating accurate calculations.
- **Gender Mapping**: Does not map 'M' and 'F' to 'Male' and 'Female'; output uses single-letter gender codes.

**Conclusion**:

- **`0result.sql`** is the most appropriate because it accurately filters the date range, correctly calculates the counts, and provides clear gender labels ('Male' and 'Female').

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
