2025-02-12 05:31:13 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering occurs because the `"created_at"` timestamps are in **microseconds**, not milliseconds. When we divided by `1000`, we were converting from microseconds to milliseconds, which still left us with invalid UNIX timestamps when passed to `TO_TIMESTAMP()`, resulting in the "date value out of range" error.

To correctly convert microseconds to seconds, we need to divide the `"created_at"` values by **1,000,000** instead of `1000`.

Let's address this step by step.

---

**Understanding the Timestamp Format:**

- **Original `"created_at"` values:**
  
  ```
  1653023760000000
  1680349680000000
  1602010500000000
  ```
  
- **Converting to seconds:**

  Divide by **1,000,000**:
  
  ```
  1653023760000000 / 1,000,000 = 1653023760
  ```

- **Converting to a human-readable date:**

  ```
  TO_TIMESTAMP(1653023760) â†’ '2022-05-20 09:36:00'
  ```

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Let's modify the query to divide by **1,000,000**:

```sql
SELECT "created_at", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000) AS "Sign_Up_Date"
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Converting Date Range to Microseconds:**

Now, let's convert the date range from **January 1, 2019** to **April 30, 2022** into microseconds.

- **Start Date:** January 1, 2019

  ```sql
  SELECT (UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2019-01-01 00:00:00')) * 1000000 AS "Start_Microseconds";
  ```
  
  Calculation:

  ```
  1546300800 seconds * 1,000,000 = 1546300800000000 microseconds
  ```

- **End Date:** April 30, 2022

  ```sql
  SELECT (UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2022-04-30 23:59:59')) * 1000000 AS "End_Microseconds";
  ```
  
  Calculation:

  ```
  1651363199 seconds * 1,000,000 = 1651363199000000 microseconds
  ```

---

**Updated Queries Incorporating Corrections:**

1. **Select a sample with corrected timestamp conversion:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "gender", "age", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000) AS "Sign_Up_Date"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find minimum and maximum "created_at" dates converted to readable format:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Earliest_Sign_Up_Date",
     MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Latest_Sign_Up_Date"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS;
   ```

3. **Select users who signed up between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "gender", "age", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000) AS "Sign_Up_Date"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   WHERE "created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800000000 AND 1651363199000000
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count the number of users per "gender" who signed up within the date range:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gender", COUNT(*) AS "User_Count"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   WHERE "created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800000000 AND 1651363199000000
   GROUP BY "gender";
   ```

5. **Find the minimum and maximum ages per "gender" among users signed up within the date range:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "gender", MIN("age") AS "Min_Age", MAX("age") AS "Max_Age"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   WHERE "created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800000000 AND 1651363199000000
   GROUP BY "gender";
   ```

6. **Count users at the minimum and maximum ages per "gender" within the date range:**

   ```sql
   WITH AgeStats AS (
     SELECT "gender", MIN("age") AS "Min_Age", MAX("age") AS "Max_Age"
     FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
     WHERE "created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800000000 AND 1651363199000000
     GROUP BY "gender"
   )
   SELECT
     u."gender",
     CASE
       WHEN u."age" = a."Min_Age" THEN 'Min_Age'
       WHEN u."age" = a."Max_Age" THEN 'Max_Age'
     END AS "Age_Category",
     COUNT(*) AS "User_Count"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS u
   JOIN AgeStats a ON u."gender" = a."gender"
   WHERE u."created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800000000 AND 1651363199000000
     AND u."age" IN (a."Min_Age", a."Max_Age")
   GROUP BY u."gender", "Age_Category";
   ```

7. **Final Result: Compile the data into the required format:**

   ```sql
   WITH AgeStats AS (
     SELECT "gender", MIN("age") AS "Min_Age", MAX("age") AS "Max_Age"
     FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
     WHERE "created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800000000 AND 1651363199000000
     GROUP BY "gender"
   ),
   MinAgeCount AS (
     SELECT "gender", "age" AS "Min_Age", COUNT(*) AS "Users_with_Min_Age"
     FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS u
     JOIN AgeStats a ON u."gender" = a."gender"
     WHERE u."created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800000000 AND 1651363199000000
       AND u."age" = a."Min_Age"
     GROUP BY "gender", "age"
   ),
   MaxAgeCount AS (
     SELECT "gender", "age" AS "Max_Age", COUNT(*) AS "Users_with_Max_Age"
     FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS u
     JOIN AgeStats a ON u."gender" = a."gender"
     WHERE u."created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800000000 AND 1651363199000000
       AND u."age" = a."Max_Age"
     GROUP BY "gender", "age"
   )
   SELECT
     a."gender",
     a."Min_Age",
     m."Users_with_Min_Age",
     a."Max_Age",
     x."Users_with_Max_Age"
   FROM AgeStats a
   LEFT JOIN MinAgeCount m ON a."gender" = m."gender"
   LEFT JOIN MaxAgeCount x ON a."gender" = x."gender"
   ORDER BY a."gender";
   ```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Step 1:** Correctly convert `"created_at"` from microseconds to seconds by dividing by `1,000,000`.
- **Step 2:** Convert epoch seconds to readable dates using `TO_TIMESTAMP()`.
- **Step 3:** Adjust the date range in the `WHERE` clause by converting the start and end dates to microseconds.
- **Step 4:** Use common table expressions (CTEs) to:
  - Calculate the minimum and maximum ages per gender within the date range (`AgeStats`).
  - Count the number of users at the minimum age per gender (`MinAgeCount`).
  - Count the number of users at the maximum age per gender (`MaxAgeCount`).
- **Step 5:** Join these results to produce the final table with the required columns.

---

**Final Answer in the Required Format:**

Assuming the above queries are executed and the results are obtained, the final answer would look like this:

```csv
Gender,Min_Age,Users_with_Min_Age,Max_Age,Users_with_Max_Age
Female,min_age_female:int,users_with_min_age_female:int,max_age_female:int,users_with_max_age_female:int
Male,min_age_male:int,users_with_min_age_male:int,max_age_male:int,users_with_max_age_male:int
```

**Note:** Replace `min_age_female:int`, `users_with_min_age_female:int`, etc., with the actual values obtained from the query.

---

**Summary:**

- The error occurred because we incorrectly assumed the timestamps were in milliseconds.
- Adjusted the division factor from `1000` to `1,000,000` to account for microseconds.
- Converted the date ranges accordingly.
- Provided corrected and comprehensive SQL queries to retrieve the necessary data.
- Ensured the final result aligns with the required format.

---

Please run the corrected queries, and you should be able to retrieve the desired information without encountering the previous error.

2025-02-12 05:32:26 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering the same error due to dividing the `"created_at"` timestamp by **1000** instead of **1,000,000**. As we've established earlier, the `"created_at"` field stores timestamps in **microseconds**, so we need to divide by **1,000,000** to convert them to seconds before using `TO_TIMESTAMP()`.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Issue:** Dividing by `1000` results in values that are still too large to be valid UNIX timestamps in seconds, hence the "date value out of range" error.
- **Solution:** Divide `"created_at"` by `1,000,000` to properly convert microseconds to seconds.

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "id", "gender", "age", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000) AS "Sign_Up_Date"
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation of Correction:**

- **Conversion:** By dividing `"created_at"` by `1,000,000`, we accurately convert the microsecond timestamps to seconds.
- **`TO_TIMESTAMP()` Function:** This function converts epoch time in seconds to a readable `TIMESTAMP` format.

---

**Example:**

Let's take a sample `"created_at"` value from your data:

- **Original Value:** `1653023760000000` microseconds
- **Divide by 1,000:** `1653023760000` seconds (Incorrect)
- **Divide by 1,000,000:** `1653023760` seconds (Correct)

**Converting to Date:**

- **Incorrect Timestamp Conversion:**
  - `TO_TIMESTAMP(1653023760000)` results in an out-of-range date.
- **Correct Timestamp Conversion:**
  - `TO_TIMESTAMP(1653023760)` results in `2022-05-20 05:16:00`.

---

**Why the Error Occurs:**

- When you divide by `1000`, you're converting microseconds to milliseconds, not to seconds.
- UNIX timestamps represent the number of **seconds** since January 1, 1970.
- Using an incorrect division factor results in a timestamp that's a thousand times larger than expected, leading to the "date value out of range" error.

---

**Action Items:**

- **Update Your Query:** Replace `/ 1000` with `/ 1000000` in the `TO_TIMESTAMP()` function.
- **Verify Other Queries:** Ensure all other queries that involve timestamp conversion are using the correct division factor.

---

**Summary:**

By adjusting the division factor to `1000000`, the `TO_TIMESTAMP()` function will correctly interpret the `"created_at"` values, and you should no longer encounter the "date value out of range" error.

---

**Feel free to run the corrected query, and let me know if you need further assistance!**

Task: Determine the number of users who are the youngest and oldest for each gender (male and female) separately, among those who signed up between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022. For each gender, identify the minimum and maximum ages within this date range, and count how many users fall into these respective age groups.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Gender,Min_Age,Users_with_Min_Age,Max_Age,Users_with_Max_Age
Male,min_age1:int,users_with_min_age1:int,max_age1:int,users_with_max_age1:int
Female,min_age2:int,users_with_min_age2:int,max_age2:int,users_with_max_age2:int
```

Among users who signed up between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022, this table shows, for each gender (Male and Female), the minimum and maximum ages, and the number of users who have those ages..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': {'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': ['DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS', 'ORDERS', 'USERS', 'EVENTS', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS', 'PRODUCTS', 'ORDER_ITEMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
