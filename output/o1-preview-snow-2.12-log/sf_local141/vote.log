Among the SQL queries provided, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice. This query accurately computes each salesperson's annual total sales and compares it to their annual sales quota. It provides the difference between their total sales and the quota for each year, organized by salesperson and year.

**Reasons for selecting `1result.sql`:**

- **Robust Data Parsing:** The query uses `TRY_TO_NUMBER` and `TRY_TO_DATE` functions to safely convert data types, handling any potential data format issues or null values without causing errors.
  
  - **Date Handling:** It safely parses dates using `TRY_TO_DATE("orderdate", 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS')`, ensuring that only valid dates are considered when extracting the year.
  
  - **Numeric Conversion:** It converts the `salespersonid` to a number using `TRY_TO_NUMBER("salespersonid")`, ensuring that the join on salesperson IDs is accurate and not affected by non-numeric values.

- **Data Integrity:** By including conditions to check for non-null and valid data, the query ensures that only relevant records are used in the calculations, leading to accurate results.
  
- **Full Outer Join Usage:** The use of a full outer join ensures that salespersons who have either sales data or quota data (but not both) are still included in the results, providing a comprehensive view.

**Here is the name of the correct SQL file:**
