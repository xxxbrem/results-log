**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **F1.F1.RESULTS**
   - `"race_id"`: To join with `F1.F1.RACES` and get the year of each race.
   - `"driver_id"`: To identify drivers; join with `F1.F1.DRIVERS` to get driver full names.
   - `"constructor_id"`: To identify constructors; join with `F1.F1.CONSTRUCTORS` to get constructor names.
   - `"points"`: To calculate total points for each driver and constructor.

2. **F1.F1.RACES**
   - `"race_id"`: To join with `F1.F1.RESULTS`.
   - `"year"`: To group results by year.

3. **F1.F1.DRIVERS**
   - `"driver_id"`: To join with `F1.F1.RESULTS`.
   - `"full_name"`: To retrieve the full names of drivers.

4. **F1.F1.CONSTRUCTORS**
   - `"constructor_id"`: To join with `F1.F1.RESULTS`.
   - `"name"`: To retrieve the names of constructors.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Joining tables on matching IDs (e.g., `RESULTS."race_id" = RACES."race_id"`).
- Filtering data by specific years using `WHERE` clauses.

Task: For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the driver and constructor who scored the most points each year, we aggregate the total points for each driver and constructor per year and select the ones with the highest totals. Below is the formatted result:

```csv
Year,Driver_Full_Name,Constructor_Name
year1:int,driver_name1:str,constructor_name1:str
year2:int,driver_name2:str,constructor_name2:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

    GROUP BY ra."year", r."constructor_id"

JOIN TopConstructorPerYear tcp ON tdp."year" = tcp."year"
JOIN F1.F1."CONSTRUCTORS" c ON tcp."constructor_id" = c."constructor_id"
ORDER BY tdp."year" ASC NULLS LAST;
```

This query calculates the total points for each driver and constructor per year, ranks them, and selects the top driver and constructor for each year. The `ROUND` function has been used to keep all decimals to four decimal places. The `NULLS LAST` clause ensures that null values are ordered last when sorting in ascending order.
