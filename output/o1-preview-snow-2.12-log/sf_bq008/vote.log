The correct answer is:

```plaintext
2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

After carefully reviewing the SQL queries and their results, `2result.sql` best answers the task:

- **Task Requirements:**
  - **Time Frame:** January 2017.
  - **Visitors:** Those whose campaign name contains 'Data Share'.
  - **Page Accessed:** Any page starting with '/home'.
  - **Questions:**
    1. Which page did they most commonly visit next?
    2. What is the maximum time (in seconds) they spent on the '/home' page before moving on?

- **Evaluation of SQL Queries:**

  **1. 0result.sql:**
  - **Approach:**
    - Combines sessions from all days in January.
    - Filters sessions where the campaign name contains 'Data Share' (using `ILIKE '%Data Share%'`).
    - Identifies hits where the pagePath starts with '/home%'.
    - Calculates the next page visited and the time spent on the '/home' page.
    - Does not exclude instances where the next page is also '/home'.
  - **Result:**
    - Next_Page: `/home`
    - Max_Time_On_Home_Page: `1547.9700` seconds
  - **Consideration:**
    - The most common next page is `/home` itself, indicating possible page refreshes or re-entries.

  **2. 1result.sql:**
  - **Approach:**
    - Combines sessions from selected days in January (not all days).
    - Filters sessions where the campaign name equals 'Data Share Promo' (using `=` instead of `ILIKE`).
    - Identifies hits where the pagePath starts with '/home%'.
    - Excludes instances where the next page is `/home` (using `WHERE "next_page" IS NOT NULL AND "next_page" != '/home'`).
  - **Result:**
    - Next_Page: `/home-2`
    - Max_Time_On_Home_Page: `8` seconds
  - **Consideration:**
    - By excluding `/home` as the next page, it provides the most common next page other than `/home`.
    - Time spent is significantly lower than other results.

  **3. 2result.sql (Selected as Correct):**
  - **Approach:**
    - Combines sessions from all days in January.
    - Filters sessions where the campaign name contains 'Data Share' (using `ILIKE '%Data Share%'`), aligning with the task requirement.
    - Identifies hits where the pagePath starts with '/home%'.
    - Calculates the next page visited and the maximum time spent on the '/home' page.
    - Does not exclude cases where the next page is `/home`, adhering strictly to the task.
  - **Result:**
    - Next_Page: `/home`
    - Max_Time_On_Home_Page: `1785` seconds
  - **Consideration:**
    - Addresses both questions accurately.
    - The maximum time is the highest among the results, indicating thorough data coverage.
    - Includes all relevant sessions and does not improperly filter out data.

- **Conclusion:**
  - `2result.sql` correctly implements the task requirements by:
    - Including all sessions in January.
    - Using `ILIKE '%Data Share%'` to match any campaign containing 'Data Share'.
    - Considering all instances where the next page could be `/home` or any other page.
    - Providing both the most common next page and the maximum time spent on the '/home' page before moving on.
  - The SQL logic and results directly answer the task without unnecessary exclusions or incomplete data.
