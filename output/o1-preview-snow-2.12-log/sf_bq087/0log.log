2025-02-12 03:01:20 - root - INFO - It appears that the error occurs because the column `"symptom_Anosmia"` does not exist in the table `"SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY"`. Based on the DDL provided, the symptom columns in this table are all in lowercase. Therefore, you should use `"symptom_anosmia"` instead.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "sub_region_2", "date", "symptom_anosmia" 
FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY" 
LIMIT 100;
```

Please try running this query. It should retrieve the `"sub_region_2"`, `"date"`, and `"symptom_anosmia"` columns without any errors.

**Explanation:**

- **Column Names:** In the `"SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY"` table, all symptom column names are in lowercase. For example:
  - `"symptom_abdominal_obesity"`
  - `"symptom_abdominal_pain"`
  - ...
  - `"symptom_anosmia"`
- **Case Sensitivity:** SQL column names are case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes. Using `"symptom_Anosmia"` (with an uppercase 'A') will result in an `invalid identifier` error if the actual column name is `"symptom_anosmia"` (all lowercase).
- **Recommendation:** Replace `"symptom_Anosmia"` with `"symptom_anosmia"` in your queries to match the exact column names in the table.

**Additional Note:**

When referencing columns in your queries, it's important to use the exact column names as defined in the table schema, including the correct casing if you are using double quotes. If you're unsure about the column names, you can retrieve the list of columns in the table using the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."COLUMNS"
WHERE "TABLE_NAME" = 'SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY'
  AND "TABLE_SCHEMA" = 'COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH'
ORDER BY "ORDINAL_POSITION";
```

This will display all the column names and their data types for the specified table, helping you verify the exact column names to use in your queries.

2025-02-12 03:03:21 - root - INFO - It appears that the error you're encountering is due to the column name `"symptom_Anosmia"` not matching the exact column name in the table. In your table, all symptom column names are in lowercase letters. Since SQL identifiers are case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes, using the correct casing is essential.

**Here's the corrected SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT "sub_region_2", "date", "symptom_anosmia" 
FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY" 
WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County') 
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Column Name Correction:** The column is named `"symptom_anosmia"` (all lowercase), not `"symptom_Anosmia"`. When identifiers are enclosed in double quotes in SQL, they become case-sensitive.

- **Case Sensitivity:** SQL generally defaults to case-insensitive identifiers unless they're quoted. However, when you use double quotes around identifiers, you must match the exact case used in the table definition.

**Please Update Other Queries Accordingly:**

For consistency and to avoid similar errors in other queries, please replace `"symptom_Anosmia"` with `"symptom_anosmia"` in all your SQL statements. Here are the corrected versions:

---

1. **Retrieve Data for Specified Counties:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "sub_region_2", "date", "symptom_anosmia"

     AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' THEN "symptom_anosmia" END) AS "average_2020",
     ((AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' THEN "symptom_anosmia" END) - AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' THEN "symptom_anosmia" END)) 
     / AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' THEN "symptom_anosmia" END)) * 100 AS "percentage_change"
   FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY"
   WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County')
   GROUP BY "sub_region_2"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Dates and 'Anosmia' Search Frequency for 2019:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "date", "sub_region_2", "symptom_anosmia" 
   FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY"
   WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County')
     AND "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31'
   ORDER BY "date" 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Weekly Average 'Anosmia' in 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "date", AVG("symptom_anosmia") AS "weekly_average_anosmia_2020" 
   FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY"
   WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County')
     AND "date" BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
   GROUP BY "date"
   ORDER BY "date"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Maximum 'Anosmia' Search Frequency in 2020:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "sub_region_2", MAX("symptom_anosmia") AS "max_anosmia_2020" 
    FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY"
    WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County')
      AND "date" BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
    GROUP BY "sub_region_2"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Monthly Averages of 'Anosmia' in 2019 and 2020:**

    ```sql
    SELECT 
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS "month",
      AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) = 2019 THEN "symptom_anosmia" END) AS "average_2019",
      AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) = 2020 THEN "symptom_anosmia" END) AS "average_2020"
    FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY"
    WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County')
      AND "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
    GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD'))
    ORDER BY "month"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    **Note:** If the `"date"` column is of type `VARCHAR`, you may need to convert it to `DATE` using `TO_DATE`.

12. **Total Number of Records for Specified Counties and Date Range:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS "total_records" 
    FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY"
    WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County')
      AND "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2020-12-31';
    ```

**Additional Tips:**

- **Verify Column Names:** Always ensure that the column names in your query match exactly those in the table schema, including the case if you're using double quotes.

- **Data Types:** If you encounter any issues with date comparisons, check if the `"date"` column is stored as a `DATE` or `VARCHAR`. If it's a `VARCHAR`, you may need to convert it using `TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')`.

- **Null Values:** Be mindful of null values when performing calculations. You might want to exclude nulls or handle them appropriately using `COALESCE` or filtering them out.

**Example Handling Nulls:**

```sql
SELECT 
  "sub_region_2",
  AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' THEN "symptom_anosmia" END) AS "average_2019",
  AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' THEN "symptom_anosmia" END) AS "average_2020",
  ((COALESCE(AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' THEN "symptom_anosmia" END), 0) - 
    COALESCE(AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' THEN "symptom_anosmia" END), 0)) / 
    NULLIF(COALESCE(AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' THEN "symptom_anosmia" END), 0), 0)) * 100 AS "percentage_change"
FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY"
WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County')
GROUP BY "sub_region_2"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Conclusion:**

Please update all your queries to use `"symptom_anosmia"` instead of `"symptom_Anosmia"`. This should resolve the `invalid identifier` error you're experiencing. If you have any further issues or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

2025-02-12 03:05:42 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering errors with your SQL queries. The issue arises because the column name `"symptom_Anosmia"` does not match the exact column name in the table. In your dataset, all symptom column names are in lowercase letters. Since SQL identifiers are case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes, it's crucial to use the exact column names as they appear in the table.

**Please replace all instances of `"symptom_Anosmia"` with `"symptom_anosmia"` in your queries.**

Here are the corrected SQL queries:

  AND "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2020-12-31';
```

**Explanation:**

- **Case Sensitivity:** In SQL, when column names are enclosed in double quotes, they become case-sensitive. This means `"symptom_Anosmia"` (with a capital 'A') is considered different from `"symptom_anosmia"` (all lowercase).
- **Correct Column Name:** The correct column name, as per your table schema, is `"symptom_anosmia"` (all lowercase).
- **Date Conversion (if needed):** If the `"date"` column is of type `VARCHAR`, you may need to convert it to a `DATE` data type using `TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')` for functions like `EXTRACT`.
  
**Additional Tips:**

- **Consistent Column Names:** Always ensure that the column names in your queries exactly match those in the table, including the use of uppercase and lowercase letters when using double quotes.
- **Data Type Checks:** Verify the data types of your columns to ensure that date comparisons and calculations work as expected.
- **Null Values:** Be mindful of `NULL` values in your data, especially when performing calculations. You can handle `NULL` values using functions like `COALESCE` or by adding conditions to exclude them.

**Example Handling Nulls:**

```sql
SELECT 
  "sub_region_2",
  AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' AND "symptom_anosmia" IS NOT NULL THEN "symptom_anosmia" END) AS "average_2019",
  AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' AND "symptom_anosmia" IS NOT NULL THEN "symptom_anosmia" END) AS "average_2020",
  ((AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' AND "symptom_anosmia" IS NOT NULL THEN "symptom_anosmia" END) - 
    AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' AND "symptom_anosmia" IS NOT NULL THEN "symptom_anosmia" END)) / 
    NULLIF(AVG(CASE WHEN "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' AND "symptom_anosmia" IS NOT NULL THEN "symptom_anosmia" END), 0)) * 100 AS "percentage_change"
FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY"
WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County')
GROUP BY "sub_region_2"
LIMIT 100;
```

This example includes checks for `NULL` values to prevent division by zero errors.

**Note:** The error in your SQL queries is due to the use of `"symptom_Anosmia"` (with an uppercase 'A') instead of the correct column name `"symptom_anosmia"` (all lowercase). When using double quotes in SQL, identifiers become case-sensitive. Please ensure that all instances of `"symptom_Anosmia"` are replaced with `"symptom_anosmia"` in your queries.

If you encounter any issues with date comparisons, and the `"date"` column is of type `VARCHAR`, you may need to convert it to a `DATE` data type using `TO_DATE`. For example:

```sql
AND TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
```

Let me know if you need further assistance with any other queries.

2025-02-12 03:11:13 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering an error. The issue arises because the column name `"symptom_Anosmia"` does not match the exact column name in your table. In your dataset, all symptom column names are in lowercase letters. When identifiers are enclosed in double quotes in SQL, they become case-sensitive. Therefore, you need to use the exact column name as it appears in the table.

**Here's the corrected SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT "sub_region_2", AVG("symptom_anosmia") AS "average_anosmia_2019" 
FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY" 
WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County') 
  AND "date" BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' 
GROUP BY "sub_region_2" 
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Column Name Correction:** Replace `"symptom_Anosmia"` with `"symptom_anosmia"` (all lowercase) to match the exact column name in the table.
- **Case Sensitivity:** When using double quotes, SQL treats identifiers as case-sensitive. It's essential to match the exact casing used in your table schema.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Ensure Correct Column Names:** Always verify that the column names in your query match exactly those in your table, including case sensitivity when using double quotes.
- **Date Column Format:** If the `"date"` column is stored as a `VARCHAR`, and you encounter issues with date comparisons, you may need to convert it to a `DATE` data type using `TO_DATE`:
  ```sql
  AND TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31'
  ```
  
- **Null Values:** Be mindful of `NULL` values in your data, especially when performing aggregations like `AVG()`. You may want to handle `NULL` values using `COALESCE` or by excluding them with a `WHERE` clause.

**Updated Query with Date Conversion (if needed):**

If you find that the `"date"` column is not in the correct format, you can modify the query as follows:

```sql
SELECT "sub_region_2", AVG("symptom_anosmia") AS "average_anosmia_2019" 
FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY" 
WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County') 
  AND TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' 
GROUP BY "sub_region_2" 
LIMIT 100;
```

**Conclusion:**

By correcting the column name to `"symptom_anosmia"`, your query should run without the `invalid identifier` error. If you continue to experience issues, please double-check the column names in your table schema or let me know, and I'll be happy to assist further.

2025-02-12 03:13:23 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're encountering this error. The issue arises because the column name `"symptom_Anosmia"` does not match the exact column name in your table. In your dataset, all symptom column names are in lowercase letters. When identifiers are enclosed in double quotes in SQL, they become case-sensitive. Therefore, you need to use the exact column name as it appears in the table.

**Here's the corrected SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT "sub_region_2", AVG("symptom_anosmia") AS "average_anosmia_2020" 
FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY" 
WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County') 
  AND "date" BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' 
GROUP BY "sub_region_2" 
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Column Name Correction:** Replace `"symptom_Anosmia"` with `"symptom_anosmia"` (all lowercase) to match the exact column name in your table.
- **Case Sensitivity:** When using double quotes around identifiers, SQL treats them as case-sensitive. It's essential to match the exact casing used in your table schema.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that all your queries use `"symptom_anosmia"` instead of `"symptom_Anosmia"` to avoid similar errors.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Date Column Format:** If you encounter any issues with date comparisons and the `"date"` column is stored as a `VARCHAR`, you may need to convert it to a `DATE` data type using `TO_DATE`:
  ```sql
  AND TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  ```
  This ensures that the date comparison operates correctly.

- **Handling Null Values:** Be aware of possible `NULL` values in the `"symptom_anosmia"` column, which can affect your average calculations. You might want to exclude `NULL` values explicitly:
  ```sql
  WHERE "symptom_anosmia" IS NOT NULL
  ```

**Updated Query with Date Conversion (if needed):**

```sql
SELECT "sub_region_2", AVG("symptom_anosmia") AS "average_anosmia_2020" 
FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY" 
WHERE "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County') 
  AND TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' 
GROUP BY "sub_region_2" 
LIMIT 100;
```

**I hope this helps resolve the error!** If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

Task: Please calculate the overall percentage change in the average weekly search frequency for the symptom 'Anosmia' across the five New York City counties—Bronx County, Queens County, Kings County, New York County, and Richmond County—by comparing the combined data from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019, with the combined data from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Percentage_change
percentage_change:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

The `percentage_change` value represents the overall percentage change in the average weekly search frequency for the symptom 'Anosmia' across the five New York City counties (Bronx County, Queens County, Kings County, New York County, and Richmond County) when comparing data from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019, to data from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH': {'COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH': ['SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_DAILY', 'SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_DAILY', 'SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_1_DAILY', 'SYMPTOM_SEARCH_COUNTRY_DAILY', 'SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_1_WEEKLY', 'SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_1_WEEKLY', 'SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY', 'SYMPTOM_SEARCH_COUNTRY_WEEKLY']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
