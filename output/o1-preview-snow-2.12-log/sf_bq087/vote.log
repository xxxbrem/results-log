Comparing the two SQL queries:

**First SQL (0result.sql):**

```sql
SELECT 
  ((AVG(CASE WHEN TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' THEN TRY_TO_DOUBLE("symptom_anosmia") END) -
    AVG(CASE WHEN TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' THEN TRY_TO_DOUBLE("symptom_anosmia") END)) /
    AVG(CASE WHEN TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' THEN TRY_TO_DOUBLE("symptom_anosmia") END)) * 100 AS "Percentage_change"
FROM "COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH"."SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY"
WHERE "sub_region_2" IN (
  'Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County'
);
```

- **Uses `TRY_TO_DOUBLE`** to convert `"symptom_anosmia"` to a numeric value, which gracefully handles non-numeric values without throwing an error.
- **Calculates the averages directly** within the SELECT statement and computes the percentage change in a single step.

**Second SQL (1result.sql):**

```sql
WITH avg_anosmia AS (
    SELECT
        AVG(CASE WHEN TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' THEN CAST("symptom_anosmia" AS FLOAT) END) AS "avg_2019",
        AVG(CASE WHEN TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' THEN CAST("symptom_anosmia" AS FLOAT) END) AS "avg_2020"
    FROM
        COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH.COVID19_SYMPTOM_SEARCH.SYMPTOM_SEARCH_SUB_REGION_2_WEEKLY
    WHERE
        "sub_region_2" IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County')
)
SELECT
    ROUND((("avg_2020" - "avg_2019") / "avg_2019") * 100, 4) AS "percentage_change"
FROM
    avg_anosmia;
```

- **Uses a Common Table Expression (CTE)** `avg_anosmia` to calculate the average values for 2019 and 2020 separately, improving readability and maintainability.
- **Uses `CAST` to convert `"symptom_anosmia"` to a FLOAT**, which assumes that the data is clean and numeric.
- **Rounds the final percentage change** to four decimal places for a cleaner presentation.

**Both queries correctly calculate the overall percentage change**, but there are some reasons to prefer the second one:

1. **Readability and Maintainability**: The use of a CTE in the second SQL makes the query structure clearer. Separating the calculation of averages improves readability and makes it easier to modify or extend the query in the future.

2. **Precision Control**: The second query rounds the result to four decimal places, which is generally sufficient for percentage change calculations and provides a cleaner output.

3. **Consistency in Data Types**: Using `CAST` ensures that the values are explicitly converted to FLOAT, making the data types consistent throughout the calculation.

Therefore, **the second SQL (`1result.sql`) is the preferred and correct answer** for calculating the overall percentage change.
