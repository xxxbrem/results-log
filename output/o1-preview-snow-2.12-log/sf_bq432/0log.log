External knowledge that might be helpful: 
#### Food Events Cleansing

1. **`report_number`**: A unique identifier for each reported food event.



2. **`reactions`**: A list of reactions associated with the food event.

   \- Each reaction is separated into individual entries from a comma-delimited string to facilitate easier analysis and access.



3. **`outcomes`**: A list of outcomes associated with the food event.

   \- Outcomes are individually listed by breaking down the comma-separated values into distinct elements for clear interpretation and usage.


4. **`products_brand_name`**: A list of product brand names, modified to address patterns where numeric sequences followed by commas could disrupt list separation.
   - Commas followed by a space within these patterns are replaced with double hyphens (` -- `) to ensure accurate parsing and to maintain the integrity of brand names.

5. **`products_industry_code`**: List of industry codes.
   - Commas followed by a space, which typically separate these codes, are replaced with double hyphens (` -- `) to ensure each code is distinctly recognized.

6. **`products_industry_role`**: List of roles associated with the product.
   - To ensure clear delineation, commas followed by a space that typically separate these roles are replaced with double hyphens (` -- `).

7. **`products_industry_name`**: List of industry names.
   - Commas followed by a space, which typically separate these names, are replaced with double hyphens (` -- `) to prevent any misinterpretation of industry names.




8. **`date_created`**: The date the event was created in the system.



9. **`date_started`**: The date when the adverse event started.



10. **`consumer_gender`**: Gender of the consumer involved in the event.



11. **`consumer_age`**: Age of the consumer involved in the event.



12. **`consumer_age_unit`**: Unit for the consumer's age (e.g., year, month).



13. **`industry_code_length`**: Represents the total number of distinct industry codes associated with the product.
    - The count is derived by transforming the `products_industry_code` field. Commas followed by a space are replaced with double hyphens (` -- `) to ensure that composite codes are not incorrectly split. The total number of industry codes is then determined by measuring the length of the resulting array.

14. **`brand_name_length`**: Reflects the number of unique brand names listed for the product.
    - This value is computed by first modifying the `products_brand_name` to accommodate special formats, such as numeric sequences that may include commas followed by a space. These commas are replaced with double hyphens (` -- `) to ensure proper parsing. The total count of brand names is obtained by calculating the length of the array after this transformation.

Here are the relevant columns and their potential usage:

- **"report_number"**: Unique identifier for each reported food event.
- **"date_created"**: Used to filter events that occurred in January 2015.
- **"reactions"**: Lists reactions associated with the food event.
- **"outcomes"**: Lists outcomes associated with the food event.
- **"products_brand_name"**: Lists of product brand names.
- **"products_industry_code"**: Lists of industry codes.
- **"products_role"**: Roles associated with the product.

Task: Could you provide me with the cleansed data of food events in January 2015 as listed in the cleansing documentation?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Here is the cleansed data of food events in January 2015, as per the cleansing documentation:

```csv
report_number,reactions,outcomes,products_brand_name,products_industry_code,products_role,products_industry_name,date_created,date_started,consumer_gender,consumer_age,consumer_age_unit,industry_code_length,brand_name_length
report_number1:str,reactions1:str,outcomes1:str,brand_name1:str,industry_code1:str,product_role1:str,industry_name1:str,date_created1:date,date_started1:date,gender1:str,age1:float,age_unit1:str,industry_code_length1:int,brand_name_length1:int

...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'FDA': {'CENSUS_UTILITY': ['FIPS_CLASS_CODE', 'FIPS_CODES_ALL', 'FIPS_CODES_STATES', 'FUNCTIONAL_STATUS_CODES', 'LSAD_CODES', 'MTFCC_FEATURE_CLASS_CODES'], 'FDA_FOOD': ['FOOD_ENFORCEMENT', 'FOOD_EVENTS'], 'FDIC_BANKS': ['INSTITUTIONS', 'LOCATIONS'], 'GEO_CENSUS_BLOCKGROUPS': ['BLOCKGROUPS_01', 'BLOCKGROUPS_02', 'BLOCKGROUPS_04', 'BLOCKGROUPS_05', 'BLOCKGROUPS_06', 'BLOCKGROUPS_08', 'BLOCKGROUPS_09', 'BLOCKGROUPS_10', 'BLOCKGROUPS_11', 'BLOCKGROUPS_12', 'BLOCKGROUPS_13', 'BLOCKGROUPS_15', 'BLOCKGROUPS_16', 'BLOCKGROUPS_17', 'BLOCKGROUPS_18', 'BLOCKGROUPS_19', 'BLOCKGROUPS_20', 'BLOCKGROUPS_21', 'BLOCKGROUPS_22', 'BLOCKGROUPS_23', 'BLOCKGROUPS_24', 'BLOCKGROUPS_25', 'BLOCKGROUPS_26', 'BLOCKGROUPS_27', 'BLOCKGROUPS_28', 'BLOCKGROUPS_29', 'BLOCKGROUPS_30', 'BLOCKGROUPS_31', 'BLOCKGROUPS_32', 'BLOCKGROUPS_33', 'BLOCKGROUPS_34', 'BLOCKGROUPS_35', 'BLOCKGROUPS_36', 'BLOCKGROUPS_37', 'BLOCKGROUPS_38', 'BLOCKGROUPS_39', 'BLOCKGROUPS_40', 'BLOCKGROUPS_41', 'BLOCKGROUPS_42', 'BLOCKGROUPS_44', 'BLOCKGROUPS_45', 'BLOCKGROUPS_46', 'BLOCKGROUPS_47', 'BLOCKGROUPS_48', 'BLOCKGROUPS_49', 'BLOCKGROUPS_50', 'BLOCKGROUPS_51', 'BLOCKGROUPS_53', 'BLOCKGROUPS_54', 'BLOCKGROUPS_55', 'BLOCKGROUPS_56', 'BLOCKGROUPS_60', 'BLOCKGROUPS_66', 'BLOCKGROUPS_69', 'BLOCKGROUPS_72', 'BLOCKGROUPS_78', 'US_BLOCKGROUPS_NATIONAL'], 'GEO_US_BOUNDARIES': ['ADJACENT_COUNTIES', 'ADJACENT_STATES', 'CBSA', 'CNECTA', 'COASTLINE', 'CONGRESS_DISTRICT_115', 'CONGRESS_DISTRICT_116', 'COUNTIES', 'CSA', 'METROPOLITAN_DIVISIONS', 'NATIONAL_OUTLINE', 'NWS_FORECAST_REGIONS', 'RAILWAYS', 'STATES', 'URBAN_AREAS', 'ZIP_CODES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 12:58:22 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide me with the cleansed data of food events in January 2015 as listed in the cleansing documentation?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Here is the cleansed data of food events in January 2015, as per the cleansing documentation:

```csv
report_number,reactions,outcomes,products_brand_name,products_industry_code,products_role,products_industry_name,date_created,date_started,consumer_gender,consumer_age,consumer_age_unit,industry_code_length,brand_name_length

...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
