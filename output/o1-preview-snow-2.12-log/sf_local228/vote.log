After comparing both SQL queries and their outputs, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Tie-Breaking Logic:** The task specifies that in the event of ties in runs or wickets, the tie should be broken using the smaller `player_id`. To achieve this, we need to ensure that each player is assigned a unique rank based on their total runs or wickets, considering the `player_id` for tie-breaks.
  
- **Use of `ROW_NUMBER()`:** In `0result.sql`, the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function is used with an `ORDER BY` clause that orders by `total_runs` (or `total_wickets`) in descending order and then by `player_id` in ascending order. This approach assigns a unique rank to each player, effectively breaking ties using `player_id`.

  ```sql
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY "season_id"
      ORDER BY "total_runs" DESC NULLS LAST, "player_id" ASC
  ) AS "rank"
  ```

- **Use of `RANK()`:** In `1result.sql`, the `RANK()` function is used instead. The `RANK()` function assigns the same rank to players with equal values and skips subsequent ranks. This behavior does not fulfill the tie-breaking requirement because it does not assign unique ranks when there are ties, and the tie-breaker (`player_id`) may not be properly utilized.

  ```sql
  RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY m."season_id"
      ORDER BY SUM(bs."runs_scored") DESC NULLS LAST, b."striker" ASC
  ) AS "position"
  ```

- **Result Consistency:** Although both queries produce the same final output in this particular dataset, `0result.sql` adheres to the specified tie-breaking rule, ensuring correctness regardless of the data. `1result.sql` might not break ties correctly in datasets where multiple players have the same total runs or wickets and different `player_id`s.
