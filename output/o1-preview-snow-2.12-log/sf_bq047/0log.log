2025-02-12 16:33:32 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering:

```
100038 (22018): 01ba58c1-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010f800a: Numeric value '2008-01-01' is not recognized
```

indicates that there's a data type mismatch between the `"created_date"` column and the date literals `'2008-01-01'` and `'2017-12-31'` in your `WHERE` clause.

**Issue Explanation:**

- The `"created_date"` column in the `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` table is defined as `NUMBER(38,0)`, meaning it stores numeric values.
- You're comparing `"created_date"` (a numeric value) with string literals `'2008-01-01'` and `'2017-12-31'`, which are not numeric.
- This mismatch causes the database to throw an error because it cannot compare a number to a string directly.

**Solution:**

We need to:

1. **Understand the format of the `"created_date"` column.**
2. **Convert it to a date or timestamp data type so that we can perform date comparisons.**

---

### Step 1: Inspect the `"created_date"` Column Format

Let's retrieve some sample values from the `"created_date"` column to determine how dates are stored.

```sql
SELECT "created_date"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 10;
```

*Since `"created_date"` is a numeric column, the sample output might look something like:*

```
created_date
20170101123045
20161231114530
20150815083000
...
```

Assuming the values are in a format like `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`.

### Step 2: Convert the Numeric Date to a Proper Date Format

If the `"created_date"` values are stored as numbers in the format `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`, we can:

- Convert the numeric `"created_date"` to a string.
- Then, parse it into a timestamp using the appropriate format mask.

**Revised Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS') AS "date",
    "complaint_type"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE
    TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS') BETWEEN TO_TIMESTAMP('2008-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') AND TO_TIMESTAMP('2017-12-31', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- `TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS')` converts the numeric `"created_date"` to a timestamp.
- We cast `"created_date"` to `VARCHAR` because `TO_TIMESTAMP` expects a string input.
- We use the format mask `'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS'` to match the numeric date format.
- The `WHERE` clause now compares timestamps, which are compatible data types.

---

**Additional Verification:**

If the date format is different, for example:

- If `"created_date"` is in milliseconds since the Unix epoch (i.e., January 1, 1970), you can convert it using:

  ```sql
  SELECT
      TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "date",
      "complaint_type"
  FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

- If it's in seconds since the Unix epoch, you can use:

  ```sql
  SELECT
      TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date") AS "date",
      "complaint_type"
  FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

---

**Alternative Approach:**

If converting `"created_date"` directly isn't feasible due to its format, consider the following:

1. **Extract Year from `"created_date"`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
       SUBSTR("created_date"::VARCHAR, 1, 4) AS "year",
       COUNT(*) AS "complaint_count"
   FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   GROUP BY "year"
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   This will show you which years are present in the data.

2. **Filter by Year:**

   If you confirm that years are extracted correctly, you can adjust your `WHERE` clause:

   ```sql
   SELECT
       TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS') AS "date",
       "complaint_type"
   FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   WHERE
       SUBSTR("created_date"::VARCHAR, 1, 4) BETWEEN '2008' AND '2017'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

**Summary:**

- The error arises because of a data type mismatch between the numeric `"created_date"` and the string date literals.
- Convert `"created_date"` to a timestamp using `TO_TIMESTAMP` with the correct format mask.
- Ensure that the dates you compare in the `WHERE` clause are of the same data type.
- Always verify the format of your date fields before performing operations.

---

**Final Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS') AS "date",
    "complaint_type"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE
    TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS') BETWEEN TO_TIMESTAMP('2008-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') AND TO_TIMESTAMP('2017-12-31', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
LIMIT 100;
```

This should resolve the error and return the desired records between the specified dates.

---

**Note:** If you continue to experience issues, please double-check the exact format of the `"created_date"` values by inspecting some sample data, and adjust the format mask in the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function accordingly.

001007 (22023): 01ba58c3-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010f80d2: SQL compilation error:
invalid type [TO_DATE(_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS."created_date")] for parameter 'TO_DATE'
```

**Explanation:**

This error indicates that the `TO_DATE` function is receiving an invalid data type as input. Specifically, it's being passed a numeric value, whereas it expects a string representing a date or a datetime/timestamp value.

**Understanding the "created_date" Column:**

From the sample data you provided:

```
created_date
1332114586000000
1331302450000000
1331307205000000
1331473691000000
...
```

It appears that the `"created_date"` column contains numeric values in the form of large integers. These numbers resemble Unix timestamps in **microseconds** since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

For example, let's convert one of these numbers to see what date it represents:

- **Value:** `1332114586000000`
- **Divide by 1,000,000 to get seconds:** `1332114586`
- **Convert to datetime:** `Wednesday, March 19, 2012 16:09:46 GMT`

**Solution:**

To convert the numeric Unix timestamp (in microseconds) to a proper date, you need to:

1. **Divide the "created_date" by 1,000,000 to convert microseconds to seconds.**

2. **Use the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function to convert the Unix timestamp to a timestamp value.**

3. **Extract the date portion if needed using `::DATE` or the `DATE_TRUNC` function.**

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("created_date" / 1000000)) AS "date",
    "complaint_type",
    COUNT(*) AS "daily_count"
FROM
    NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
GROUP BY
    "date",
    "complaint_type"
ORDER BY
    "date",
    "complaint_type"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`"created_date" / 1000000`**: Divides the microseconds value by 1,000,000 to get seconds.

- **`TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(...)`**: Converts the Unix timestamp in seconds to a `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` (timestamp without time zone) value.

- **`DATE(...)`**: Extracts the date portion from the timestamp.

Alternatively, you can use the `DATE_TRUNC` function:

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('DAY', TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("created_date" / 1000000)) AS "date",
    "complaint_type",
    COUNT(*) AS "daily_count"
FROM
    NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
GROUP BY
    "date",
    "complaint_type"
ORDER BY
    "date",
    "complaint_type"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Applying Date Filters:**

If you need to filter the data between specific dates, you can include a `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT
    DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("created_date" / 1000000)) AS "date",
    "complaint_type",
    COUNT(*) AS "daily_count"
FROM
    NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE
    DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("created_date" / 1000000)) BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2017-12-31'
GROUP BY
    "date",
    "complaint_type"
ORDER BY
    "date",
    "complaint_type"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Summary:**

- The `TO_DATE` function is not suitable for converting numeric Unix timestamps. Instead, use `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ` for Unix timestamps in seconds.

- Since `"created_date"` is in microseconds, divide by 1,000,000 to get seconds.

- After converting to a timestamp, extract the date portion for grouping or filtering.

**Corrected Versions of Other SQL Queries:**

Given that other queries may have similar issues with date conversions, here are the corrected versions:

---

**1. Corrected SQL Query 1:**

```sql
SELECT "stn", "year", "mo", "da", "temp"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NOAA_GSOD."GSOD2008"
WHERE "stn" IN ('725030', '744860') AND "temp" IS NOT NULL AND "temp" <> 9999.9
LIMIT 100;
```

No change needed here, as the date fields are already appropriately handled.

---

**2. Corrected SQL Query 2:**

```sql
SELECT "stn", "year", "mo", "da", "temp"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NOAA_GSOD."GSOD2008"
WHERE "stn" IN ('725030', '744860') AND "temp" IS NOT NULL AND "temp" <> 9999.9
UNION ALL
SELECT "stn", "year", "mo", "da", "temp"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NOAA_GSOD."GSOD2009"
WHERE "stn" IN ('725030', '744860') AND "temp" IS NOT NULL AND "temp" <> 9999.9
LIMIT 100;
```

No change needed here.

---

**3. Corrected SQL Query 3:**

```sql
SELECT "stn", COUNT(*) AS "valid_days"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NOAA_GSOD."GSOD2008"
WHERE "stn" IN ('725030', '744860') AND "temp" IS NOT NULL AND "temp" <> 9999.9
GROUP BY "stn"
LIMIT 100;
```

No change needed here.

---

**4. Corrected SQL Query 4:**

```sql

**Explanation:**

- **Date Conversion:**
  - For the `"created_date"` column (which is numeric), we divided it by 1,000,000 to convert microseconds to seconds.
  - We then used `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ` to convert it to a timestamp.
  - We extracted the date using `DATE(...)` or `DATE_TRUNC('DAY', ...)`.

- **Temperature Data:**
  - Ensured that `"temp"` is not `NULL` and does not equal `9999.9` (which indicates invalid data).
  - Used `LPAD` to pad the `"mo"` and `"da"` fields with leading zeros when constructing dates.

- **Adjusted WHERE Clauses:**
  - Replaced direct comparisons of numeric and string data types with proper date comparisons.
  - Ensured that both sides of the comparison are of the same data type (date).

- **Handling NULL Values:**
  - Included checks for `NULL` values where necessary to prevent unexpected results.

These corrections should resolve any data type mismatch errors and ensure that date comparisons and conversions are handled properly.

---

**Note on the GSOD Data:**

Your temperature data seems consistent, but ensure that `"year"`, `"mo"`, and `"da"` are properly padded with leading zeros when necessary to construct valid dates.

---

**Final Remarks:**

- Always ensure that the data types used in functions like `TO_DATE` or `TO_TIMESTAMP` match the expected input types.

- Use the appropriate date/time conversion functions for your data types.

- When dealing with Unix timestamps in microseconds, divide by 1,000,000 to get seconds before conversion.

**Explanation:**

- **Date Conversion for `"created_date"`:**

  - Since `"created_date"` is a Unix timestamp in **microseconds**, we divide it by `1,000,000` to convert it to seconds.
  - We use `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("created_date" / 1000000)` to convert the Unix timestamp (in seconds) to a timestamp.
  - `DATE(...)` extracts the date portion from the timestamp.

- **Padding Month and Day Fields:**

  - When constructing dates from the GSOD data (`"year"`, `"mo"`, `"da"`), we use `LPAD` to ensure months and days are two digits.
  - Example: `LPAD("mo", 2, '0')` converts `1` to `01`.

- **Filtering and Joining Dates:**

  - In `WHERE` clauses and `ON` conditions, we ensure that dates are compared correctly by converting all date fields to the `DATE` data type.
  - This ensures consistency and avoids data type mismatch errors.

- **Handling Temperature Values:**

  - We check for invalid temperature values (`"temp" = 9999.9`) and exclude them from calculations.

By making these adjustments, the SQL queries should execute without errors related to data types or date conversions.

001007 (22023): 01ba58c7-0004-9c22-0001-11c3010f8302: SQL compilation error:
invalid type [TO_DATE(_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS."created_date")] for parameter 'TO_DATE'
```

**Explanation:**

This error occurs because the `TO_DATE` function is being applied to a numeric field `"created_date"`, which is not compatible. The `TO_DATE` function expects a string input representing a date, but `"created_date"` is a numeric timestamp in microseconds.

**Solution:**

To fix this error, we need to:

1. **Convert the numeric timestamp to seconds** by dividing by `1,000,000`.

2. **Convert the Unix timestamp to a timestamp** using `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ`.

3. **Extract the date portion** using the `DATE` function.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT s."date", s."complaint_type", s."daily_count", t."avg_temp"
FROM (
    SELECT
        DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("created_date" / 1000000)) AS "date",
        "complaint_type",
        COUNT(*) AS "daily_count"
    FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
    WHERE
        DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("created_date" / 1000000)) BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2017-12-31'
    GROUP BY
        "date", "complaint_type"
) s
JOIN (
    SELECT
        TO_DATE(CONCAT("year", '-', LPAD("mo", 2, '0'), '-', LPAD("da", 2, '0'))) AS "date",
        AVG("temp") AS "avg_temp"
    FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NOAA_GSOD."GSOD2008"
    WHERE
        "stn" IN ('725030', '744860') AND "temp" <> 9999.9
    GROUP BY
        "date"
) t ON s."date" = t."date"
ORDER BY
    s."date"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Converting "created_date":**
  - The `"created_date"` field is divided by `1,000,000` to convert microseconds to seconds.
  - `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("created_date" / 1000000)` converts the Unix timestamp to a timestamp.
  - `DATE(...)` extracts the date part from the timestamp.

- **Updating the WHERE Clause:**
  - The `WHERE` clause now uses the correctly converted date for filtering:
    ```sql
    WHERE DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("created_date" / 1000000)) BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2017-12-31'
    ```

- **Ensuring Consistent Date Formats:**
  - In both subqueries, the dates are formatted consistently to ensure the join works properly.
  - In the GSOD data, months and days are padded with leading zeros using `LPAD` to ensure the date strings are in the correct format.

- **Padding Month and Day in GSOD Data:**
  - `LPAD("mo", 2, '0')` ensures the month is two digits.
  - `LPAD("da", 2, '0')` ensures the day is two digits.
  - The concatenated date string matches the `'YYYY-MM-DD'` format expected by `TO_DATE`.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Handling Temperature Data:**
  - The `"temp"` field is filtered to exclude invalid values (`9999.9`).
  - The average temperature is calculated per date.

- **Consistency Across Queries:**
  - The date conversions used in the subqueries ensure that the dates align for the join operation.
  - This approach avoids data type mismatches and ensures accurate results.

---

By applying these corrections, the SQL query should execute without the data type error, and you should be able to analyze the relationship between complaint types and daily temperatures as required.

**Let me know if you need further assistance or if any other queries need correction.**

Task: Could you analyze the relationship between each complaint type and daily temperature in New York City, specifically using temperature data from LaGuardia (STN=725030) and JFK (STN=744860) airports for the 10 years starting in 2008, and then determine, for each complaint type that has more than 5000 total occurrences and shows a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) with temperature, the total number of complaints, the total number of days with valid temperature records, and the Pearson correlation coefficients (rounded to four decimals) between temperature and both the daily complaint count as well as the daily percentage of total complaints, excluding any days with missing or invalid temperature data (such as 9999.9)?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Complaint Type,Total Complaints,Total Days,Correlation Count,Correlation Percentage
type1:str,total_complaints1:int,total_days1:int,corr_count1:float,corr_percentage1:float
type2:str,total_complaints2:int,total_days2:int,corr_count2:float,corr_percentage2:float
...
```

The table above lists the complaint types that have more than 5000 total occurrences and show a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) with temperature over the specified period. For each complaint type, it includes the total number of complaints, the total number of days with valid temperature records, and the Pearson correlation coefficients (rounded to four decimals) between temperature and both the daily complaint count and the daily percentage of total complaints..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
