After comparing the two SQL queries, I have determined that `2result.sql` is the correct one for the following reasons:

**Reasoning:**

1. **Accurate Data Union:**
   - In `2result.sql`, the `temp_data` Common Table Expression (CTE) explicitly selects and unions data from each year's GSOD table (`GSOD2008` to `GSOD2017`) individually. This ensures that all temperature data from 2008 to 2017 is accurately included.
   - Each subquery in the union includes a specific `WHERE` clause filtering by station (`'725030'`, `'744860'`) and excluding invalid temperature data (`"temp" <> 9999.9`), which aligns with the task requirements.

2. **Precise Date Construction:**
   - The date in `temp_data` is constructed using `DATE_FROM_PARTS(CAST("year" AS INT), CAST("mo" AS INT), CAST("da" AS INT))`, ensuring that dates are correctly formed and compatible for joining with complaint data.
   - In `complaints_data`, the `created_date` is converted using `DATE(CONVERT_TIMEZONE('UTC', TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("created_date" / 1e6)))`, which accurately transforms the timestamp into a date.

3. **Comprehensive Data Handling:**
   - `2result.sql` includes all necessary data transformations and joins, including calculating daily complaint counts, total daily complaints across all types, and integrating temperature data.
   - It filters complaint types with more than 5,000 total occurrences, as specified in the task.

4. **Accurate Calculations:**
   - The Pearson correlation coefficients between temperature and both the daily complaint count and the daily percentage of total complaints are calculated using `CORR` functions.
   - Results are rounded to four decimals, adhering to the requirement.

5. **Meets Task Criteria:**
   - The final `SELECT` statement filters complaint types to those with absolute correlation coefficients greater than 0.5, as specified.
   - The output includes the total number of complaints, total number of days with valid temperature records, and the rounded correlation coefficients, fulfilling all elements of the task.

**Conclusion:**

`2result.sql` meticulously follows the task instructions, ensuring accurate data retrieval, transformation, and analysis. Therefore, it is the correct SQL script to use for analyzing the relationship between complaint types and daily temperature in New York City from 2008 to 2017.
