After comparing the SQL queries and their results, here's an analysis:

**Query 0 (`0result.sql`):**

- **Definition of Last 7 Days:** Includes events from **January 1 to January 7, 2021**.
- **Definition of Last 2 Days:** Includes events from **January 6 and January 7, 2021**.
- **Logic:** Counts unique pseudo users active in the last 7 days but excludes those active in the last 2 days by performing a `LEFT JOIN` and filtering where users are not present in the last 2 days.

**Query 1 (`1result.sql`) and Query 2 (`2result.sql`):**

- **Definition of Last 7 Days:** Only includes events from **January 1 to January 5, 2021**.
- **Definition of Last 2 Days:** Includes events from **January 6 and January 7, 2021** (same as Query 0).
- **Logic:** Counts unique pseudo users active in the 5 days (excluding the last 2 days) and excludes those active in the last 2 days.

**Reasoning:**

The task asks for the number of pseudo users who were **active in the last 7 days** but **inactive in the last 2 days** as of January 7, 2021. Therefore, the "last 7 days" period should include **January 1 to January 7, 2021**.

- **Query 0** correctly includes all events from **January 1 to January 7** in the "last 7 days".
- **Queries 1 and 2** incorrectly exclude events from **January 6 and January 7** in the "last 7 days", considering only **January 1 to January 5**.

**Conclusion:**

- **Query 0 (`0result.sql`)** is the correct SQL query because it properly defines the "last 7 days" period as per the task's requirements and accurately calculates the number of pseudo users active in the last 7 days but inactive in the last 2 days.
