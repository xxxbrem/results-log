After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is **`1result.sql`**.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Filtering:** The query in `1result.sql` correctly joins the `ACCIDENT_2015` and `PERSON_2015` tables using the `"consecutive_number"` key. It filters accidents that occurred between January and August (`"month_of_crash" BETWEEN 1 AND 8`), ensuring only relevant accidents are considered.
  
- **Correct Grouping:** It groups the data by each accident (`a."consecutive_number"`) and calculates:
  - The total number of persons involved in each accident (`person_count`).
  - The total number of individuals with severe injuries (`severe_injury_count`), where `"injury_severity" = 4`.
  
- **Proper Conditions:** The `HAVING` clause filters accidents involving more than one distinct person (`HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p."person_number") > 1`). This satisfies the condition of accidents involving multiple persons.

- **Accurate Calculation:** The query computes the percentage by:
  - Calculating the total number of accidents meeting the criteria (`total_accidents`).
  - Counting the number of accidents where more than one person sustained severe injuries (`accidents_with_multiple_severe_injuries` where `severe_injury_count > 1`).
  - Dividing the number of accidents with multiple severe injuries by the total number of accidents and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.
  
- **Clarity and Readability:** The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) like `accidents`, `total_accidents`, and `accidents_with_multiple_severe_injuries` makes the query more organized and easier to understand.

- **Consistency in Results:** The calculated percentage in `1result.csv` matches the expected outcome and aligns with the logic required for the problem.

**Note:** The `2result.sql` query may not be accurate because it filters on `"month_of_crash"` directly from the `PERSON_2015` table, which, based on the data schema provided, does not contain the `"month_of_crash"` column. This could lead to incorrect filtering of data.
