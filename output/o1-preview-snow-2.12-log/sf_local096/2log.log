Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **MOVIE**
  - `"MID"`: Movie ID, used to identify movies and join with other tables.
  - `"year"`: The release year of the movie, used to group movies by year.
- **M_CAST**
  - `"MID"`: Movie ID, used to link cast members to movies.
  - `"PID"`: Person ID, used to link to the `PERSON` table.
- **PERSON**
  - `"PID"`: Person ID, used to identify actors.
  - `"Gender"`: Gender of the person, used to determine if actors are female.

**Potential Conditions:**

- Filter persons where `"Gender"` is 'Female' or 'Male'.
- Group movies by `"MID"` and check if all cast members are female.
- Join tables on `"MID"` and `"PID"` to associate movies with actors and their genders.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List distinct release years of movies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.MOVIE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve total number of movies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total_Movies"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.MOVIE;
   ```

3. **List distinct genders in the PERSON table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Gender"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count of persons by gender:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Gender", COUNT(*) AS "Person_Count"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON
   GROUP BY "Gender"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve movie IDs with their titles and years:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "MID", "title", "year"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.MOVIE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List cast members for each movie:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "MID", "PID"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Join M_CAST and PERSON to get genders of cast members:**
   ```sql
   SELECT m."MID", m."PID", p."Gender"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST m
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON p ON m."PID" = p."PID"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find movies that have male cast members:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT m."MID"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST m
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON p ON m."PID" = p."PID"
   WHERE p."Gender" = 'Male'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count total cast members per movie:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "MID", COUNT(*) AS "Total_Cast"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST
   GROUP BY "MID"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count female cast members per movie:**
    ```sql
    SELECT m."MID", COUNT(*) AS "Female_Cast_Count"
    FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST m
    JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON p ON m."PID" = p."PID"
    WHERE p."Gender" = 'Female'
    GROUP BY m."MID"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Identify movies with only female cast members (simple check):**
    ```sql
    SELECT m."MID"
    FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST m
    LEFT JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON p ON m."PID" = p."PID"
    GROUP BY m."MID"
    HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN p."Gender" = 'Male' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Retrieve movies along with their release years and total cast count:**
    ```sql
    SELECT mo."MID", mo."year", COUNT(mc."PID") AS "Total_Cast"
    FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.MOVIE mo
    JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST mc ON mo."MID" = mc."MID"
    GROUP BY mo."MID", mo."year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List movies with counts of male and female cast members:**
    ```sql
    SELECT m."MID",
           SUM(CASE WHEN p."Gender" = 'Male' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "Male_Cast_Count",
           SUM(CASE WHEN p."Gender" = 'Female' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "Female_Cast_Count"
    FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST m
    JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON p ON m."PID" = p."PID"
    GROUP BY m."MID"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Find movies without any gender information for cast members:**
    ```sql
    SELECT m."MID"
    FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST m
    LEFT JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON p ON m."PID" = p."PID"
    WHERE p."Gender" IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Get names and genders of cast members for a specific movie:**
    ```sql
    SELECT p."Name", p."Gender"
    FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.M_CAST m
    JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB.PERSON p ON m."PID" = p."PID"
    WHERE m."MID" = 'specific_movie_id'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Proportion of Female-Actor-Only Films,Total Number of All Films
year1:int,proportion1:float, total_films1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float, total_films2:int
...
```

This table shows, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors, along with the total number of all films released in those years..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'DB_IMDB': {'DB_IMDB': ['COUNTRY', 'GENRE', 'LANGUAGE', 'LOCATION', 'MOVIE', 'M_CAST', 'M_COUNTRY', 'M_DIRECTOR', 'M_GENRE', 'M_LANGUAGE', 'M_LOCATION', 'M_PRODUCER', 'PERSON']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 17:05:44 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Proportion of Female-Actor-Only Films,Total Number of All Films
year1:int,proportion1:float, total_films1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float, total_films2:int
...
```

This table shows, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors, along with the total number of all films released in those years. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
