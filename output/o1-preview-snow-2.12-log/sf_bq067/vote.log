After comparing the SQL scripts and their results, **1result.sql** best fulfills the specified requirements for creating the labeled dataset.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accident Involvement Criteria:** All three SQL scripts correctly identify accidents involving more than one distinct person.

- **Label Calculation:** They all accurately assign the label as 1 if an accident has more than one person with an injury severity code of 4 (fatal injury), and 0 otherwise.

- **Predictor Inclusion:**
  - **State Number, Number of Drunk Drivers, Day of Week, Hour of Crash, Work Zone Indicator:** All scripts include these predictors appropriately.
  - **Vehicle Body Type:**
    - *0result.sql* selects the body type of the first vehicle per accident, which may not be representative.
    - *1result.sql* and *2result.sql* compute the most frequent (mode) body type per accident, providing a better representation of the vehicles involved. This approach aligns more closely with the requirement to include the **vehicle body_type**.
  - **Average Speed Difference and Categorization:**
    - All scripts calculate the average absolute difference between travel speed and speed limit per accident using the specified conditions.
    - They correctly categorize this average speed difference into levels from 0 to 4 in 20 mph increments.

- **Data Accuracy and Compliance:**
  - *1result.sql* ensures that null values are handled appropriately and prioritizes body types with higher counts and lower numeric codes in case of ties.
  - It joins data tables effectively to compile the final dataset without losing relevant records.

Given these points, **1result.sql** is the most accurate and comprehensive in meeting all the specifications for the dataset creation.
