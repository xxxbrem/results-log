After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL solution for the following reasons:

1. **Use of Window Functions for Accurate Computation:**
   - `1result.sql` employs window functions such as `FIRST_VALUE`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `ROW_NUMBER` to compute the first and last trip durations, as well as the highest and lowest trip durations, per year-month grouping.
   - The use of `ORDER BY "start_date" ASC` and `ORDER BY "start_date" DESC` within the window functions ensures that the first and last trips are accurately determined based on the chronological order of `start_date`.

2. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - The query is structured using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and subqueries, making it easier to read and understand each step of the computation.
   - By calculating `ROW_NUMBER()` over each `YearMonth` partition and filtering with `WHERE rn = 1`, the query ensures that only one row per year-month is returned, which aligns with the task requirement.

3. **Avoiding Potential Issues with Negative Values:**
   - In `0result.sql`, the use of `MIN_BY` with a negative `start_date` (`MIN_BY("duration_sec", -"start_date")`) to find the last trip might lead to potential confusion or errors, especially if negative values are not handled consistently in all database systems.
   - `1result.sql` avoids this by directly ordering the `start_date` in descending order to find the last trip, which is more intuitive and less error-prone.

4. **Compliance with Standard SQL Practices:**
   - The use of window functions and CTEs in `1result.sql` aligns with standard SQL practices, making the query more portable and understandable across different SQL databases.
   - It ensures accurate results even if there are duplicate `start_date` values, as `ROW_NUMBER()` will still provide a unique ranking for each row.

5. **Correct and Consistent Results:**
   - Both queries produce the same results; however, `1result.sql` achieves this through methods that are more reliable and standard-compliant.
   - By explicitly specifying the ordering and partitioning in window functions, `1result.sql` provides a robust solution that is less likely to be affected by anomalies in data.

**Therefore, `1result.sql` is the correct and preferred solution.**
