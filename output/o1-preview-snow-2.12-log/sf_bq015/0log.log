6571728,"I recently learned Slick, and it was a  hellish ride. First of all, a large part of the problems I had were an unbelievable terrible documentation. Sometimes, in order to do even the simplest things, I had to look into particular unit tests deep within the sources of the project, or follow stackoverflow discussions with multiple proposals, only one of which actually worked.
Oftentimes this was for things which I considered granted and implemented. The certainly best example is getting an object by id. I would have thought that this, being the most basic operation, should be possible through some kind of default operation like &quot;get&quot; or &quot;getById&quot; or &quot;objectById&quot; or something else. Instead, you have stackoverflow answers like this:<p>def findById(userId: Int)(implicit session: Session): Option[User] = {
  val query = for{
    u &lt;- Users if u.id === userId
  } yield u
  query.firstOption
}<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16461260/select-single-row-based-on-id-in-slick"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;16461260&#x2F;select-single-ro...</a><p>However, that&#x27;s not even the brink of the iceberg. Try finding out how to update multiple fields in an object. Say you retrieve a User object, and you want to set a new email, zip, and address. I&#x27;d suppose, this would work with simple getters and setters, i.e.:<p>user = Users.get(user_id)
user.email = new_mail
user.zip = new_zip
user.address = new_address<p>Instead, you have to do this:<p>val map = Query(User)
  .filter(_.id === user_id)
  .map(ab =&gt; ab.email ~ ab.zip ~ ab.address)<p>map.update((new_mail, new_zip, new_address))<p>And even that only works with updateable result sets. See:

2025-02-11 19:46:41 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is because the table `"some_temp_table"` does not exist in your database. In your query, you need to replace `"some_temp_table"` with an actual subquery or table that contains the `"question_id"`s extracted from the Hacker News comments.

Based on your previous queries, you can extract the Stack Overflow question IDs directly from the `"text"` of the `COMMENTSV2` table. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT "id", "title", "tags"
FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
WHERE "id" IN (
    SELECT TRY_TO_NUMBER(
        REGEXP_SUBSTR("text", 'stackoverflow\.com/questions/([0-9]+)', 1, 1, 'e', 1)
    ) AS "question_id"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
    WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
)
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Inner Query:** Extracts question IDs from the Hacker News comments.
  - `REGEXP_SUBSTR` is used to find the question ID in the comment text.
    - The pattern `'stackoverflow\.com/questions/([0-9]+)'` matches URLs containing question IDs.
    - The `'e'` parameter enables extraction of the first capturing group `([0-9]+)`, which represents the numeric question ID.
  - `TRY_TO_NUMBER` converts the extracted ID from text to a numeric type.
- **Outer Query:** Retrieves questions from the `POSTS_QUESTIONS` table where the `"id"` matches any of the extracted question IDs.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the `REGEXP_SUBSTR` function and its parameters are compatible with your SQL dialect. In Snowflake, the parameters are formatted as shown.
- If any question IDs are `NULL` or invalid, you might want to add a condition to filter them out:
  
  ```sql
  SELECT "id", "title", "tags"
  FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
  WHERE "id" IN (
      SELECT TRY_TO_NUMBER(
          REGEXP_SUBSTR("text", 'stackoverflow\.com/questions/([0-9]+)', 1, 1, 'e', 1)
      ) AS "question_id"
      FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
      WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
        AND REGEXP_SUBSTR("text", 'stackoverflow\.com/questions/([0-9]+)', 1, 1, 'e', 1) IS NOT NULL
  )
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

**Additional Steps:**

- After retrieving the questions and their tags, you can proceed to split the `"tags"` column by the '|' delimiter using appropriate string functions. This will allow you to group by individual tags and count the total mentions.
- For example, you can use `SPLIT` and `FLATTEN` functions to explode the tags into separate rows.

**Example of Exploding Tags:**

```sql
WITH question_ids AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT TRY_TO_NUMBER(
      REGEXP_SUBSTR("text", 'stackoverflow\.com/questions/([0-9]+)', 1, 1, 'e', 1)
  ) AS "question_id"

```

**Explanation:**

- **`question_ids` CTE:** Extracts and deduplicates question IDs from comments.
- **`question_tags` CTE:** Retrieves tags for the extracted question IDs.
- **`exploded_tags` CTE:** Splits the `"tags"` column into individual tags.
- **Final Query:** Counts the number of times each tag is associated with the questions mentioned in Hacker News comments.

**Final Result Format:**

```csv
Tag,TotalMentions
tag1:str,count1:int
tag2:str,count2:int
tag3:str,count3:int
tag4:str,count4:int
tag5:str,count5:int
tag6:str,count6:int
tag7:str,count7:int
tag8:str,count8:int
tag9:str,count9:int
tag10:str,count10:int
(Attention: answer in 10 rows, ordered by TotalMentions descending)
```

**Summary:**

- Replace `"some_temp_table"` with an appropriate subquery that extracts the question IDs.
- Use the corrected query to retrieve the questions and their tags.
- Split the tags and group by individual tags to count mentions.
- Present the top 10 tags as per the task requirements.

2025-02-11 19:47:51 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is because the column `"word"` does not exist in the subquery `"word_list"`. In your subquery, you are selecting `"words"` (which is an array resulting from the `SPLIT` function), but you need to flatten this array to access individual words.

To fix the error, you should use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to split the array into individual rows. Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT f.value AS "word", COUNT(*) AS "word_count"
FROM (
  SELECT LOWER("text") AS "text"
  FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
  WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
) AS t,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(t."text", ' ')) AS f
GROUP BY "word"
ORDER BY "word_count" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Subquery `t`:**
  - Selects the `"text"` column, converts it to lowercase for uniformity, and aliases it as `"text"`.
  - Filters comments that mention Stack Overflow questions.
- **`LATERAL FLATTEN`:**
  - Takes the `"text"` column and splits it into an array of words using `SPLIT(t."text", ' ')`.
  - The `LATERAL FLATTEN` function explodes the array into multiple rows, one for each word.
  - `f.value` holds each word from the text.
- **Main Query:**
  - Selects each word (`f.value AS "word"`) and counts their occurrences.
  - Groups by `"word"` to aggregate the counts.
  - Orders the results by `"word_count"` in descending order to get the most frequent words.
  - Limits the output to the top 100 words.

**Note:**

- The function `SPLIT` splits the text into an array based on spaces.
- Using `LOWER` ensures that words are counted in a case-insensitive manner.
- Ensure that punctuation is handled appropriately; you may want to remove punctuation for accurate word counts. You can use `REGEXP_REPLACE` to remove punctuation:

  ```sql
  SELECT f.value AS "word", COUNT(*) AS "word_count"
  FROM (
    SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER("text"), '[^\w\s]', '') AS "text"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
    WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
  ) AS t,
  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(t."text", ' ')) AS f
  WHERE f.value <> ''
  GROUP BY "word"
  ORDER BY "word_count" DESC
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

  - The `REGEXP_REPLACE` function removes all non-word characters.
  - The `WHERE f.value <> ''` clause excludes any empty strings resulting from consecutive spaces.

**Example Result Format:**

```csv
word,word_count
the,150
to,120
and,110
a,100
is,95
of,90
in,85
for,80
it,75
that,70
...
```

This corrected query will provide you with the top 100 most frequent words from the comments that mention Stack Overflow questions, helping you analyze the common words used in those comments.

6553950,"So we&#x27;ve built Feedly for our startup Fashiolista.com
It&#x27;s quite a large project for a team of 4 though. Therefor we are actively looking for more contributors. Let us know if you&#x27;re interested in helping out.",
6553680,"Nothing to do with the feed reader at feedly.com though? Granted all the names are taken everywhere for everything, but this seems confusing.",
6554013,"It took me a minute to understand that this wasn&#x27;t feedly.com open-sourcing their backend.<p>You have a PR problem with this name, with risk of elevating into a legal problem.",
6554406,"<i>Feedly allows you to build newsfeed and notification systems using Cassandra and&#x2F;or Redis.</i><p>Suggestion: That the library is a Python library is just as, if not more, important that working with Cassandra and&#x2F;or Redis. You should mention that in the first sentence, for example, &quot;Feedly is a Python library that allows you to easily build newsfeed and notification systems on top of Cassandra and&#x2F;or Redis.&quot;<p>-----<p>More notes:<p>It&#x27;s also not particularly clear what approach Feedly actually implemented. You mention &quot;push&quot; and &quot;push&#x2F;pull&quot;, and say what Fashionista <i>used</i> to use, but never actually mention the approach Feedly has taken.<p>Without looking at the code, i.e. just from the README, I&#x27;d guess you&#x27;re doing full fanout (i.e. &quot;push&quot;), with no pull for inactive users (i.e. what Twitter does for users inactive for 30 days). That&#x27;s fine, except...<p>...you don&#x27;t really discuss how Feedly handles the power law problem (publishing to Lady Gaga&#x27;s feed), which is the only difficult engineering issue with these kinds of systems. If Feedly&#x27;s approach is to ignore it, and just push all 30 million subtasks into Celery, how will that impact all of the updates to the other user&#x27;s feeds, which are happening concurrently? How will that impact memory usage? I couldn&#x27;t tell just by reading the docs.<p>Finally, the stream itself is actually the easiest part (other than the power law problem). Production systems need monitoring, along with some kind of recommendation system for getting users connected to each other. Integrating all that is obviously a separate project, but I&#x27;d be reluctant to build on top of Feedly until I saw at least <i>some</i> hooks for incorporating that stuff.<p>Otherwise, good work. I&#x27;ve been implementing this stuff recently, and the only other semi-full featured open source project out there for activity streams when I started was written in PHP, so it&#x27;s nice to see something a bit more hacker-friendly. Bonus points for Redis and Cassandra, two of the coolest NoSQL database out there!",
6555352,"At Fashiolista we went through a few phases.<p>A.) In the early days we simply pulled everything together by querying the database which worked quite well.<p>B.) After that we switched to using redis and in a similar approach to twitter&#x27;s pushed only to active users and pulled the feed for inactive users.<p>C.) Now our requirements slowly changed and it became harder to fit everything in memory (or fallback) that&#x27;s why we switched to Cassandra.<p>Feedly offers you a framework, but allows you to make your own decisions regarding the tradeoffs.<p>- you can change the fanout to hit only active users (twitter, yahoo paper approach)<p>- you can chose to store the full activity in the feed or only an id (memory usage vs extra lookups)<p>- you can customize the priority of tasks<p>These are all things we&#x27;ve done at one point or another. You can chose your own approach with Feedly.<p>For Fashiolista we currently use celery with rabbitmq and have different queues and worker clusters for low and high priority fanout tasks.<p>In your example with Lady Gaga memory usage would go up on the rabbitmq server. Since rabbit also stores to disk it won&#x27;t run out easily. After that the celery machines will handle the updates and autoscaling will kick in more machines if needed.",
6553698,"Yeay sucks a bit, project started more than a year ago, before the google reader shutdown and feedly&#x27;s rise to fame.",
6553716,"Yes, you can use solely Redis. In fact this is the suggested way to start with Feedly (the example app uses only Redis).",
6553729,"We currently support Redis and Cassandra fully. Cassandra has a very high maintenance overhead so we definitely recommend you to start with Redis.<p>More info here:

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS': {'HACKERNEWS': ['FULL_201510', 'FULL_PARTITIONED', 'COMMENTSV2', 'FULL_PARTITION_EXTRA', 'COMMENTS', 'STORIESV2', 'COMMENTS_CONVOLUTION', 'STORIES'], 'STACKOVERFLOW': ['BADGES', 'POSTS_ORPHANED_TAG_WIKI', 'POST_LINKS', 'USERS', 'POSTS_QUESTIONS', 'COMMENTS', 'POSTS_PRIVILEGE_WIKI', 'TAGS', 'VOTES', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI_EXCERPT', 'POSTS_WIKI_PLACEHOLDER', 'POSTS_ANSWERS', 'POSTS_MODERATOR_NOMINATION', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI', 'POST_HISTORY', 'STACKOVERFLOW_POSTS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we'll first identify the relevant tables, columns, and conditions:

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `"STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"`
   - **"text"**: Contains the content of Hacker News comments; may include references to Stack Overflow questions.
   - **"timestamp"**: Unix timestamp of the comment; used to filter comments from 2014 onwards.
   - **"id"**: Unique identifier of the comment.

2. **Table:** `"STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"`
   - **"id"**: Stack Overflow question ID; used to match with question IDs extracted from comments.
   - **"tags"**: Tags associated with each question; delimited by '|'; used to group and count tags.
   - **"title"**: Title of the question; may aid in understanding the content.
   - **"view_count"**: Number of views; could be used for additional insights.

**Potential Usage:**

- **Extract Stack Overflow question IDs** from the `"text"` of comments that mention `stackoverflow.com/questions/`.
- **Filter comments** using `"timestamp" >= 1388534400` to get comments from January 1, 2014, onwards.
- **Split the `"tags"`** column by the '|' delimiter to analyze individual tags.
- **Count occurrences** of each question ID to determine how many times each was mentioned.
- **Group by tags** to rank the top 10 tags based on the total mentions of associated questions.

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. **View sample comments with their timestamps:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "text", "timestamp"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve comments from 2014 onwards:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "text", "timestamp"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
   WHERE "timestamp" >= 1388534400
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find comments mentioning Stack Overflow questions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "text"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
   WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve comments from 2014 onwards mentioning Stack Overflow questions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "text", "timestamp"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
   WHERE "timestamp" >= 1388534400
     AND "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Extract distinct timestamps to understand the date range:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "timestamp"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
   ORDER BY "timestamp" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Examine the format of tags in Stack Overflow questions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "tags"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   WHERE "tags" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List distinct tags from Stack Overflow questions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "tags"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   WHERE "tags" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Identify comments with non-null URLs to check for direct links:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "url", "text"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
   WHERE "url" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Check how "tags" are delimited in the questions table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "tags"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   WHERE "tags" LIKE '%|%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve questions with a specific tag pattern (e.g., containing 'python'):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "tags"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
    WHERE "tags" LIKE '%|python|%' OR "tags" LIKE 'python|%' OR "tags" LIKE '%|python' OR "tags" = 'python'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Explore the distribution of comments over the years:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("timestamp")) AS "year", COUNT(*) AS "comment_count"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
    GROUP BY "year"
    ORDER BY "year" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    *Note: Use of `TO_TIMESTAMP` assumes "timestamp" is in Unix time.*

12. **Find the top commented Stack Overflow question IDs in Hacker News comments:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "text"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
    WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Extract Stack Overflow question IDs from comments (requires parsing, shown conceptually):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", REGEXP_SUBSTR("text", 'stackoverflow\.com/questions/([0-9]+)') AS "question_url"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
    WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Count how many times each Stack Overflow question is mentioned (conceptual, needs adjustment):**

    ```sql
    SELECT REGEXP_SUBSTR("text", 'stackoverflow\.com/questions/([0-9]+)') AS "question_url", COUNT(*) AS "mention_count"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
    WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
    GROUP BY "question_url"
    ORDER BY "mention_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Get the titles of Stack Overflow questions (assuming we have question IDs):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "title", "tags"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
    WHERE "id" IN (SELECT DISTINCT "question_id" FROM "some_temp_table")
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    *Note: Replace `"some_temp_table"` with the actual source of question IDs.*

16. **Analyze the length of comments mentioning Stack Overflow:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", LENGTH("text") AS "text_length"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
    WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

17. **Find Stack Overflow questions with high view counts:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "title", "tags", "view_count"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
    WHERE "view_count" > 100000
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

18. **Check for Stack Overflow questions with a large number of tags:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "tags", ARRAY_SIZE(SPLIT("tags", '|')) AS "tag_count"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    *Note: `ARRAY_SIZE` and `SPLIT` functions may vary; adjust as per SQL dialect.*

19. **Identify the most frequent words in comments mentioning Stack Overflow (conceptual):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "word", COUNT(*) AS "word_count"
    FROM (
      SELECT SPLIT(LOWER("text"), ' ') AS "words"
      FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
      WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
    ) AS "word_list"
    GROUP BY "word"
    ORDER BY "word_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    *Note: String splitting and aggregation functions depend on SQL dialect.*

20. **Retrieve comments with high scores (if "score" exists):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "text", "score"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTSV2"
    WHERE "score" > 10
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help explore the data and understand the relationships between Hacker News comments and Stack Overflow questions. They showcase different aspects, such as filtering, pattern matching, grouping, and aggregating, which are essential steps toward solving the task.

6571728,"I recently learned Slick, and it was a  hellish ride. First of all, a large part of the problems I had were an unbelievable terrible documentation. Sometimes, in order to do even the simplest things, I had to look into particular unit tests deep within the sources of the project, or follow stackoverflow discussions with multiple proposals, only one of which actually worked.
Oftentimes this was for things which I considered granted and implemented. The certainly best example is getting an object by id. I would have thought that this, being the most basic operation, should be possible through some kind of default operation like &quot;get&quot; or &quot;getById&quot; or &quot;objectById&quot; or something else. Instead, you have stackoverflow answers like this:<p>def findById(userId: Int)(implicit session: Session): Option[User] = {
  val query = for{
    u &lt;- Users if u.id === userId
  } yield u
  query.firstOption
}<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16461260/select-single-row-based-on-id-in-slick"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;16461260&#x2F;select-single-ro...</a><p>However, that&#x27;s not even the brink of the iceberg. Try finding out how to update multiple fields in an object. Say you retrieve a User object, and you want to set a new email, zip, and address. I&#x27;d suppose, this would work with simple getters and setters, i.e.:<p>user = Users.get(user_id)
user.email = new_mail
user.zip = new_zip
user.address = new_address<p>Instead, you have to do this:<p>val map = Query(User)
  .filter(_.id === user_id)
  .map(ab =&gt; ab.email ~ ab.zip ~ ab.address)<p>map.update((new_mail, new_zip, new_address))<p>And even that only works with updateable result sets. See:

"&#62; Rely on the old mantra: If you think of <i>it</i> as a separate idea or object, represent it directly in the program; model real-world objects, and abstractions directly in code.<p>I think this is terrible advice.  Thinking of object-oriented programming as ""world modeling"" leads to complicated designs that came from someone's pointless ontological analysis rather than practical considerations of what will make the best, easiest-to-understand program.<p>A simple example of this is the OO conundrum: should square derive from rectangle?  After all a square is-a rectangle.  If we're world-modeling, then the inheritance relationship is a beautiful and consistent expression of this platonic idea that a square is a special kind of rectangle.<p>But in practice, this inheritance relationship has lots of problems.

6553689,"This...isn&#x27;t the same as the Feedly RSS newsreader.<p>Cool idea, but I would be reluctant to adopt Cassandra, but it looks like you can use solely redis?",
6553950,"So we&#x27;ve built Feedly for our startup Fashiolista.com
It&#x27;s quite a large project for a team of 4 though. Therefor we are actively looking for more contributors. Let us know if you&#x27;re interested in helping out.",
6553680,"Nothing to do with the feed reader at feedly.com though? Granted all the names are taken everywhere for everything, but this seems confusing.",
6554013,"It took me a minute to understand that this wasn&#x27;t feedly.com open-sourcing their backend.<p>You have a PR problem with this name, with risk of elevating into a legal problem.",
6554406,"<i>Feedly allows you to build newsfeed and notification systems using Cassandra and&#x2F;or Redis.</i><p>Suggestion: That the library is a Python library is just as, if not more, important that working with Cassandra and&#x2F;or Redis. You should mention that in the first sentence, for example, &quot;Feedly is a Python library that allows you to easily build newsfeed and notification systems on top of Cassandra and&#x2F;or Redis.&quot;<p>-----<p>More notes:<p>It&#x27;s also not particularly clear what approach Feedly actually implemented. You mention &quot;push&quot; and &quot;push&#x2F;pull&quot;, and say what Fashionista <i>used</i> to use, but never actually mention the approach Feedly has taken.<p>Without looking at the code, i.e. just from the README, I&#x27;d guess you&#x27;re doing full fanout (i.e. &quot;push&quot;), with no pull for inactive users (i.e. what Twitter does for users inactive for 30 days). That&#x27;s fine, except...<p>...you don&#x27;t really discuss how Feedly handles the power law problem (publishing to Lady Gaga&#x27;s feed), which is the only difficult engineering issue with these kinds of systems. If Feedly&#x27;s approach is to ignore it, and just push all 30 million subtasks into Celery, how will that impact all of the updates to the other user&#x27;s feeds, which are happening concurrently? How will that impact memory usage? I couldn&#x27;t tell just by reading the docs.<p>Finally, the stream itself is actually the easiest part (other than the power law problem). Production systems need monitoring, along with some kind of recommendation system for getting users connected to each other. Integrating all that is obviously a separate project, but I&#x27;d be reluctant to build on top of Feedly until I saw at least <i>some</i> hooks for incorporating that stuff.<p>Otherwise, good work. I&#x27;ve been implementing this stuff recently, and the only other semi-full featured open source project out there for activity streams when I started was written in PHP, so it&#x27;s nice to see something a bit more hacker-friendly. Bonus points for Redis and Cassandra, two of the coolest NoSQL database out there!",
6555352,"At Fashiolista we went through a few phases.<p>A.) In the early days we simply pulled everything together by querying the database which worked quite well.<p>B.) After that we switched to using redis and in a similar approach to twitter&#x27;s pushed only to active users and pulled the feed for inactive users.<p>C.) Now our requirements slowly changed and it became harder to fit everything in memory (or fallback) that&#x27;s why we switched to Cassandra.<p>Feedly offers you a framework, but allows you to make your own decisions regarding the tradeoffs.<p>- you can change the fanout to hit only active users (twitter, yahoo paper approach)<p>- you can chose to store the full activity in the feed or only an id (memory usage vs extra lookups)<p>- you can customize the priority of tasks<p>These are all things we&#x27;ve done at one point or another. You can chose your own approach with Feedly.<p>For Fashiolista we currently use celery with rabbitmq and have different queues and worker clusters for low and high priority fanout tasks.<p>In your example with Lady Gaga memory usage would go up on the rabbitmq server. Since rabbit also stores to disk it won&#x27;t run out easily. After that the celery machines will handle the updates and autoscaling will kick in more machines if needed.",
6553698,"Yeay sucks a bit, project started more than a year ago, before the google reader shutdown and feedly&#x27;s rise to fame.",
6553716,"Yes, you can use solely Redis. In fact this is the suggested way to start with Feedly (the example app uses only Redis).",
6553729,"We currently support Redis and Cassandra fully. Cassandra has a very high maintenance overhead so we definitely recommend you to start with Redis.<p>More info here:

Task: Identify and rank the top 10 tags from Stack Overflow questions that were referenced in Hacker News comments on or after 2014 by counting how many times each question was mentioned, then splitting the questions’ tag strings by the '|' delimiter, grouping by tag

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To identify and rank the top 10 tags from Stack Overflow questions that were referenced in Hacker News comments on or after 2014, we:

1. Extracted Stack Overflow question IDs from the text of Hacker News comments dated 2014 or later.
2. Counted how many times each question was mentioned.
3. Retrieved the tags for each question from the `POSTS_QUESTIONS` table, splitting the tags by the '|' delimiter.
4. Grouped by tag and summed the counts of mentions.
5. Ranked the tags by total mentions in descending order and selected the top 10.

The results are presented in the following format:

```csv
Tag,TotalMentions
tag1:str,count1:int
tag2:str,count2:int
tag3:str,count3:int
tag4:str,count4:int
tag5:str,count5:int
tag6:str,count6:int
tag7:str,count7:int
tag8:str,count8:int
tag9:str,count9:int
tag10:str,count10:int
(Attention: answer in 10 rows, ordered by TotalMentions descending)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS': {'HACKERNEWS': ['FULL_201510', 'FULL_PARTITIONED', 'COMMENTSV2', 'FULL_PARTITION_EXTRA', 'COMMENTS', 'STORIESV2', 'COMMENTS_CONVOLUTION', 'STORIES'], 'STACKOVERFLOW': ['BADGES', 'POSTS_ORPHANED_TAG_WIKI', 'POST_LINKS', 'USERS', 'POSTS_QUESTIONS', 'COMMENTS', 'POSTS_PRIVILEGE_WIKI', 'TAGS', 'VOTES', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI_EXCERPT', 'POSTS_WIKI_PLACEHOLDER', 'POSTS_ANSWERS', 'POSTS_MODERATOR_NOMINATION', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI', 'POST_HISTORY', 'STACKOVERFLOW_POSTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 19:51:57 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Identify and rank the top 10 tags from Stack Overflow questions that were referenced in Hacker News comments on or after 2014 by counting how many times each question was mentioned, then splitting the questions’ tag strings by the '|' delimiter, grouping by tag, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To identify and rank the top 10 tags from Stack Overflow questions that were referenced in Hacker News comments on or after 2014, we:

1. Extracted Stack Overflow question IDs from the text of Hacker News comments dated 2014 or later.
2. Counted how many times each question was mentioned.
3. Retrieved the tags for each question from the `POSTS_QUESTIONS` table, splitting the tags by the '|' delimiter.
4. Grouped by tag and summed the counts of mentions.
5. Ranked the tags by total mentions in descending order and selected the top 10.

The results are presented in the following format:

```csv
Tag,TotalMentions
tag1:str,count1:int
tag2:str,count2:int
tag3:str,count3:int
tag4:str,count4:int
tag5:str,count5:int
tag6:str,count6:int
tag7:str,count7:int
tag8:str,count8:int
tag9:str,count9:int
tag10:str,count10:int
(Attention: answer in 10 rows, ordered by TotalMentions descending)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
