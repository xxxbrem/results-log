2025-02-11 19:46:31 - root - INFO - Based on the error message you encountered:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 44 at position 8
invalid identifier '"tag"'
```

The error suggests that there's an issue with the reference to `"tag"` in the final `SELECT` statement or within the query. Specifically, it seems that the `"tag"` identifier is not recognized due to case sensitivity or incorrect referencing.

In Snowflake, when using functions like `SPLIT_TO_TABLE`, the columns generated may require specific referencing. Here's how you can adjust the query:

1. **Correct the Reference to the Split Value:**

   In the `tag_counts` CTE, when accessing the `value` from `SPLIT_TO_TABLE`, you should reference it as `tag."VALUE"` (with uppercase `"VALUE"` and in double quotes), because Snowflake converts unquoted identifiers to uppercase by default.

2. **Consistent Identifier Referencing:**

   Ensure that the `"tag"` column is consistently referenced without unnecessary quotes if it doesn't contain special characters or reserved keywords.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
WITH comment_mentions AS (
    SELECT
        REGEXP_SUBSTR("text", 'stackoverflow\\.com/questions/([0-9]+)', 1, 1, 'e', 1) AS question_id
    FROM
        "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTS"
    WHERE
        "text" IS NOT NULL AND "text" != ''
        AND "time_ts" >= 1388534400
        AND "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
),
question_counts AS (
    SELECT
        question_id::NUMBER AS question_id,
        COUNT(*) AS mention_count
    FROM
        comment_mentions
    WHERE
        question_id IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
        question_id
),
question_tags AS (
    SELECT
        q."id",
        q."tags",
        qc.mention_count
    FROM
        "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS" q
    JOIN
        question_counts qc ON q."id" = qc.question_id
    WHERE
        q."tags" IS NOT NULL AND q."tags" != ''
),
tag_counts AS (
    SELECT
        TRIM(tag."VALUE") AS tag,
        qt.mention_count
    FROM
        question_tags qt,
        LATERAL SPLIT_TO_TABLE(qt."tags", '|') AS tag
),
final_counts AS (
    SELECT
        tag,
        SUM(mention_count) AS "TotalMentions"
    FROM
        tag_counts
    GROUP BY
        tag
    ORDER BY
        "TotalMentions" DESC
        LIMIT 10
)
SELECT
    tag,
    "TotalMentions"
FROM
    final_counts;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **Reference to `tag."VALUE"`:**

  In the `tag_counts` CTE, change:

  ```sql
  TRIM(tag.value) AS tag
  ```

  To:

  ```sql
  TRIM(tag."VALUE") AS tag
  ```

  This ensures that we're correctly accessing the `VALUE` column returned by `SPLIT_TO_TABLE`.

- **Consistent Use of Identifiers:**

  In the `final_counts` CTE and the final `SELECT` statement, reference `tag` without quotes unless necessary.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the functions and syntax used are compatible with Snowflake SQL.
- The `REGEXP_SUBSTR` function is used to extract the question ID from the comment text.
- The `SPLIT_TO_TABLE` function splits the tags string into multiple rows, which we then aggregate.

**Result:**

This corrected query should run without the previous error and provide the top 10 tags from Stack Overflow questions that were referenced in Hacker News comments on or after 2014, ranked by how many times each question was mentioned.

It was this comment on SO that made me go with Gearman.<p><i>I would say that Gearman is better for queuing ""jobs"" and RabbitMQ is better for queuing ""data"". Of course, they are both really the same thing, but the way it works out for me is that if you are trying to ""fan out"" work to be done, and the workers can work independently, Gearman is the better way to do it. But if you are trying to feed data from a lot of sources down into fewer data consumers, RabbitMQ is the better solution.</

3304809,"For some reason I found it was easier to learn a little Common Lisp first before moving to Clojure.  There are a few reasons for this, I think:<p>- CL has been around so long, there are TONS of good books and online documentation.  Clojure literature is just starting out, really<p>- Clojure places a strong emphasis on functional programming.  I have no doubt that this was the right decision, but trying to wrap your head around Lisp AND FP at the same time is... well... I hope you have plenty of headache medication because your brain's gonna hurt.  CL is at home in the imperative and  OOP style, so you can get your Lisp on first, then get hip to the functional jive.  A good thing about all Lisps though is that you naturally end up writing most things in a functional style anyway.  It just kinda happens.<p>- It's a bit unsettling to learn lisp by learning Clojure if you still have a bad taste in your mouth when it comes to Java.  When you use CL, you know you're on a pure Lisp platform, so when it comes time to learn Clojure you'll just ""know"" when you're doing something in idiomatic Clojure/Lisp vs punting to Java.<p>- Cl

2113094,"Great point, I added an edit to that effect.<p>How do you tell the good tech books from the bad?  Ask someone who is good at that technology.  Too shy?  O'Reilly and Pragmatic Programmer books are generally good, and you can often get good recommendations by searching on StackOverflow or SearchYC (<a href=""http://searchyc.com/rails+book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchyc.com/rails+book</a>).",1295292367000000
1185677,Thanks Tony. The site is useful for creating discussions in variety of categories and not limited to a single subject like stackoverflow is. This might look like a difficult aim to achieve. I am willing to take the risk. Later on I plan to set preferences for individual users so they get to see topics relevant to their own liking.,1268362685000000

It&#x27;s very much not wiki-like, and it&#x27;s very much not blog-like. And part of the reason to support those aspects was to provide precisely the experiences that I&#x27;ve found lacking, such as being able to use the site as a general education resource (like wikipedia).",1371844457000000

3555702,"Summary: Current peer review is not 100%; we need to think in terms of authors' motivations (tenure); try a hacker news model, possibly layered with badges-of-approval from editorial board.<p>The quality of peer review is only as good as the editorial board and reviewers make it -- often this is a lower standard than we expect.  This article lists several extreme examples of poor practices by a (previously-)prominent publisher:<p><a href=""http://blog.mathunion.org/journals/?no_cache=1&#38;tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5BshowUid%5D=30&#38;tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5Byear%5D=2012&#38;tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5Bmonth%5D=02&#38;tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5Bday%5D=05&#38;cHash=a2d6424f899302a7ea3b75b9bb591802"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mathunion.org/journals/?no_cache=1&#38;tx_t3blog...</a><p>The key to shifting academic quality control away from the present archaic model is through author's motivation.  The replacement needs to be a system that improves and filters incoming papers, and at the same time earns at least as much prestige for the authors who participate.<p>One idea is something like a combination hacker news and stackoverflow with academic articles in place of news articles / technical questions as the object of discussion.  Papers can be changed in response to comments.  High scores for either a paper or an author on such a site could replace the prestige granted by acceptance into a top-tier journal.  Points are awarded for reviews, and researchers are respected for their scores (closer to tenure), so there is more positive motivation to review than in today's system (which is: it's rude not to review when asked).<p>I think that alone could work.  Some academics might balk at a lack of editorial boards.  Fine, let's allow some editors in the mix.  An editorial board is an aggregator.  They choose what content fits their filter, and may open a discussion with an author on improvement

8913565,"I wasn&#x27;t a programmer (finance background), and I learnt enough SQL to be useful in perhaps 20 minutes. Reading just one Date book [1] took me a further 3 days and allowed me to solve pretty much everything I&#x27;ve encountered since, with the occasional googling for syntax. Aside from perhaps statistical learning (reading through ISL [2] takes perhaps half a day to a day if you are committed, another day for the labs, and then you are immediately useful to most SMEs), I can&#x27;t think of a field in computer science that has such a fast ROI. Both being able to query well, and being able to build simple but accurate statistical models, are valued quite highly by the marketplace right now and naturally lend themselves to a &quot;contractor&quot; relationship. The OP mentioned making money...<p>SQL is declarative which means if you can word it in your head, you can write the query (unlike with OO where you need to define what happens to your record). If you learn it properly, from the set theoretic perspective (aka the relational model, not using the RDBMS as a data dump without FKs, and treating rows as records the OO way), you can keep working like that almost indefinitely, and the problem solving is a lot of fun - &quot;how can I define my output in terms of my input in one go&quot;. Most importantly, you KNOW your code is correct (except logical errors) whereas the ORM does not guarantee as much (my first step when at a new company that uses an OO framework is enforcing all the implicit FK constraints and keeping track of the 1-3% of tuples missing bits). Most of the time it (sort of) doesn&#x27;t matter (click through rate being off by 0.2% isn&#x27;t going to change your life); when you&#x27;re calculating how much money you donate customers via discounts or matching your orders with cash flow, it does, and this is when companies start paying good money.<p>Unfortunately, based on interviewing 200+ applicants over a couple of years to data-related positions, I&#x27;ve started to think that the relational model is simply not taught anymore, and many popular frameworks actively encourage patterns that break the model (e.g. polymorphic associations in RoR [3]). I&#x27;m now happy just to see someone aware of why constraints might be useful, let alone being able to discuss 2 vs 3 or 4 valued logic or the usefulness of prenex normal form.<p>[1] SQL and Relational Theory, C.

3304809,"For some reason I found it was easier to learn a little Common Lisp first before moving to Clojure.  There are a few reasons for this, I think:<p>- CL has been around so long, there are TONS of good books and online documentation.  Clojure literature is just starting out, really<p>- Clojure places a strong emphasis on functional programming.  I have no doubt that this was the right decision, but trying to wrap your head around Lisp AND FP at the same time is... well... I hope you have plenty of headache medication because your brain's gonna hurt.  CL is at home in the imperative and  OOP style, so you can get your Lisp on first, then get hip to the functional jive.  A good thing about all Lisps though is that you naturally end up writing most things in a functional style anyway.  It just kinda happens.<p>- It's a bit unsettling to learn lisp by learning Clojure if you still have a bad taste in your mouth when it comes to Java.  When you use CL, you know you're on a pure Lisp platform, so when it comes time to learn Clojure you'll just ""know"" when you're doing something in idiomatic Clojure/Lisp vs punting to Java.<p>- Cl

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS': {'HACKERNEWS': ['FULL_201510', 'FULL_PARTITIONED', 'COMMENTSV2', 'FULL_PARTITION_EXTRA', 'COMMENTS', 'STORIESV2', 'COMMENTS_CONVOLUTION', 'STORIES'], 'STACKOVERFLOW': ['BADGES', 'POSTS_ORPHANED_TAG_WIKI', 'POST_LINKS', 'USERS', 'POSTS_QUESTIONS', 'COMMENTS', 'POSTS_PRIVILEGE_WIKI', 'TAGS', 'VOTES', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI_EXCERPT', 'POSTS_WIKI_PLACEHOLDER', 'POSTS_ANSWERS', 'POSTS_MODERATOR_NOMINATION', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI', 'POST_HISTORY', 'STACKOVERFLOW_POSTS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we begin by identifying the relevant tables, columns, and conditions.

---

### **Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Hacker News Comments Table:**

   - **Table:** `"STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTS"`
   - **Columns:**
     - `"text"`: Contains the comment text where Stack Overflow question IDs might be mentioned.
     - `"time_ts"`: Timestamp of the comment; used to filter comments on or after 2014 (in UNIX timestamp).

2. **Stack Overflow Questions Table:**

   - **Table:** `"STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"`
   - **Columns:**
     - `"id"`: The question ID; used to match with IDs mentioned in comments.
     - `"tags"`: Tags associated with the question; we can split the tag strings by the '|' delimiter.

---

### **Potential Conditions:**

- **Date Filter:** `"time_ts" >= 1388534400` (UNIX timestamp for January 1, 2014).
- **Text Search:** `"text"` contains `'stackoverflow.com/questions/'` (to find comments referencing Stack Overflow questions).

---

### **SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

Below are 15 SQL queries ranging from simple to complex to help understand the values in the related columns. Each query is different and limited to 100 rows where appropriate.

---

1. **Retrieve Sample Comments:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "text", "time_ts"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Purpose:* Get a basic understanding of the comment structure and content.

---

2. **Filter Comments On or After 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "text", "time_ts"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTS"
   WHERE "time_ts" >= 1388534400
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Purpose:* Ensure that the time filtering works as expected.

---

3. **Find Comments Mentioning Stack Overflow Questions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "text", "time_ts"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTS"
   WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Purpose:* Identify comments that reference Stack Overflow question URLs.

---

4. **Find Comments Mentioning Stack Overflow Questions On or After 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "text", "time_ts"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTS"
   WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
     AND "time_ts" >= 1388534400
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Purpose:* Combine time and text conditions to focus on relevant comments.

---

5. **Retrieve Unique Stack Overflow Question Links Mentioned in Comments:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "text"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTS"
   WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
     AND "time_ts" >= 1388534400
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Purpose:* Find unique comment texts containing Stack Overflow question links.

---

6. **Retrieve Sample Stack Overflow Questions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "title", "tags"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Purpose:* Explore the structure and content of Stack Overflow questions.

---

7. **Retrieve Questions with Non-Null Tags:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "title", "tags"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   WHERE "tags" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Purpose:* Focus on questions that have tags associated with them.

---

8. **Check Format of Tags (Looking for '|' Delimiter):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "tags"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   WHERE "tags" LIKE '%|%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Purpose:* Verify if the tags are delimited by '|', as specified.

---

9. **Retrieve Recent Stack Overflow Questions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "title", "tags", "creation_date"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   WHERE "creation_date" >= 1388534400
   ORDER BY "creation_date" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Purpose:* Get Stack Overflow questions created on or after 2014.

---

10. **Identify the Range of 'time_ts' Values in Comments:**

    ```sql
    SELECT MIN("time_ts") AS "min_time", MAX("time_ts") AS "max_time"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTS";
    ```
    *Purpose:* Understand the time span of the comments dataset.

---

11. **List Comments Containing 'stackoverflow' Keyword:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "text", "time_ts"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTS"
    WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```
    *Purpose:* Identify comments mentioning Stack Overflow in any context.

---

12. **Retrieve Tags for a Specific Question ID:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "tags"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
    WHERE "id" = 12345;
    ```
    *Purpose:* Example of how to get tags for a specific question (replace `12345` with an actual `id`).

---

13. **Count Number of Comments Mentioning Stack Overflow Questions On or After 2014:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS "total_comments"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTS"
    WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
      AND "time_ts" >= 1388534400;
    ```
    *Purpose:* Determine the total number of relevant comments.

---

14. **Retrieve Sample of Tags Split by '|' Delimiter:**

15. **Retrieve Comments with Extracted Stack Overflow Question IDs:**

    *(Note: Extracting question IDs from text may require string manipulation functions.)*

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "text", "time_ts"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTS"
    WHERE "text" ILIKE '%stackoverflow.com/questions/%'
      AND "time_ts" >= 1388534400
    LIMIT 100;
    ```
    *Purpose:* This query is a placeholder to show where we might extract question IDs from comments.

These queries help us understand the data structures, verify conditions, and explore the relevant values in the columns. Through these queries, we can gain insights necessary to perform the task of identifying and ranking the top 10 tags from Stack Overflow questions referenced in Hacker News comments on or after 2014.

[Note]: Since we are not to include any SQL beyond SELECT queries or write complex data extraction logic, some steps (like extracting question IDs from comment texts) are represented conceptually.Query:
SELECT "id", "text", "time_ts"
FROM "STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS"."HACKERNEWS"."COMMENTS"
WHERE "text" IS NOT NULL AND "text" != ''
  AND "time_ts" >= 1388534400

2468059,"&#62; So now you want to instantiate a variable of type ""A"", where ""A"" is a string that you read in from a configuration file. How do you do it in Python?<p>Depends on which kind of flexibility you want.  You can use a dict of name to type i.e.<p><pre><code>    d = {""A"":A, ""B"":B}
    variable = d[string_from_file] (arguments)
</code></pre>
or (perhaps slightly un-Pythonic, I guess)<p><pre><code>    variable = getattr(my_types_module, string_from_file) (arguments)
</code></pre>
where my_types_module is a module with your constructors.<p>The second version is somewhat closer to the PHP version, but still cleaner.<p>The problem with a system like<p><pre><code>    function call_me($arg) {} $func = 'call_me'; $func(1);
</code></pre>
is that it does not play well if you have several different functions of the same name but in different scopes.  Or if you want to generate functions on the fly.<p>That's a concern, but not too much of a concern in a language like Python.  I only chose Python because many people are somewhat familiar with it, and it does the Right Thing in this regard.<p>As an aside: Matlab recently changed from a PHP-like functions-passed-around-by-string-name system to functions-as-first-class-citizens system.  They even had to introduce a new bit of syntax for that---but they found it important enough to go through with it.

2113094,"Great point, I added an edit to that effect.<p>How do you tell the good tech books from the bad?  Ask someone who is good at that technology.  Too shy?  O'Reilly and Pragmatic Programmer books are generally good, and you can often get good recommendations by searching on StackOverflow or SearchYC (<a href=""http://searchyc.com/rails+book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchyc.com/rails+book</a>).",1295292367000000
1185677,Thanks Tony. The site is useful for creating discussions in variety of categories and not limited to a single subject like stackoverflow is. This might look like a difficult aim to achieve. I am willing to take the risk. Later on I plan to set preferences for individual users so they get to see topics relevant to their own liking.,1268362685000000
5920575,"Yes and no. The focus on tangible questions with definitive answers is certainly intentional, however they&#x27;ve missed the mark on some of their original goals.

It&#x27;s very much not wiki-like, and it&#x27;s very much not blog-like. And part of the reason to support those aspects was to provide precisely the experiences that I&#x27;ve found lacking, such as being able to use the site as a general education resource (like wikipedia).",1371844457000000

3555702,"Summary: Current peer review is not 100%; we need to think in terms of authors' motivations (tenure); try a hacker news model, possibly layered with badges-of-approval from editorial board.<p>The quality of peer review is only as good as the editorial board and reviewers make it -- often this is a lower standard than we expect.  This article lists several extreme examples of poor practices by a (previously-)prominent publisher:<p><a href=""http://blog.mathunion.org/journals/?no_cache=1&#38;tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5BshowUid%5D=30&#38;tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5Byear%5D=2012&#38;tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5Bmonth%5D=02&#38;tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5Bday%5D=05&#38;cHash=a2d6424f899302a7ea3b75b9bb591802"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mathunion.org/journals/?no_cache=1&#38;tx_t3blog...</a><p>The key to shifting academic quality control away from the present archaic model is through author's motivation.  The replacement needs to be a system that improves and filters incoming papers, and at the same time earns at least as much prestige for the authors who participate.<p>One idea is something like a combination hacker news and stackoverflow with academic articles in place of news articles / technical questions as the object of discussion.  Papers can be changed in response to comments.  High scores for either a paper or an author on such a site could replace the prestige granted by acceptance into a top-tier journal.  Points are awarded for reviews, and researchers are respected for their scores (closer to tenure), so there is more positive motivation to review than in today's system (which is: it's rude not to review when asked).<p>I think that alone could work.  Some academics might balk at a lack of editorial boards.  Fine, let's allow some editors in the mix.  An editorial board is an aggregator.  They choose what content fits their filter, and may open a discussion with an author on improvement

8913565,"I wasn&#x27;t a programmer (finance background), and I learnt enough SQL to be useful in perhaps 20 minutes. Reading just one Date book [1] took me a further 3 days and allowed me to solve pretty much everything I&#x27;ve encountered since, with the occasional googling for syntax. Aside from perhaps statistical learning (reading through ISL [2] takes perhaps half a day to a day if you are committed, another day for the labs, and then you are immediately useful to most SMEs), I can&#x27;t think of a field in computer science that has such a fast ROI. Both being able to query well, and being able to build simple but accurate statistical models, are valued quite highly by the marketplace right now and naturally lend themselves to a &quot;contractor&quot; relationship. The OP mentioned making money...<p>SQL is declarative which means if you can word it in your head, you can write the query (unlike with OO where you need to define what happens to your record). If you learn it properly, from the set theoretic perspective (aka the relational model, not using the RDBMS as a data dump without FKs, and treating rows as records the OO way), you can keep working like that almost indefinitely, and the problem solving is a lot of fun - &quot;how can I define my output in terms of my input in one go&quot;. Most importantly, you KNOW your code is correct (except logical errors) whereas the ORM does not guarantee as much (my first step when at a new company that uses an OO framework is enforcing all the implicit FK constraints and keeping track of the 1-3% of tuples missing bits). Most of the time it (sort of) doesn&#x27;t matter (click through rate being off by 0.2% isn&#x27;t going to change your life); when you&#x27;re calculating how much money you donate customers via discounts or matching your orders with cash flow, it does, and this is when companies start paying good money.<p>Unfortunately, based on interviewing 200+ applicants over a couple of years to data-related positions, I&#x27;ve started to think that the relational model is simply not taught anymore, and many popular frameworks actively encourage patterns that break the model (e.g. polymorphic associations in RoR [3]). I&#x27;m now happy just to see someone aware of why constraints might be useful, let alone being able to discuss 2 vs 3 or 4 valued logic or the usefulness of prenex normal form.<p>[1] SQL and Relational Theory, C.

There are a few reasons for this, I think:<p>- CL has been around so long, there are TONS of good books and online documentation.

I have no doubt that this was the right decision, but trying to wrap your head around Lisp AND FP at the same time is... well... I hope you have plenty of headache medication because your brain's gonna hurt.  CL is at home in the imperative and  OOP style, so you can get your Lisp on first, then get hip to the functional jive.  A good thing about all Lisps though is that you naturally end up writing most things in a functional style anyway.  It just kinda happens.<p>- It's a bit unsettling to learn lisp by learning Clojure if you still have a bad taste in your mouth when it comes to Java.  When you use CL, you know you're on a pure Lisp platform, so when it comes time to learn Clojure you'll just ""know"" when you're doing something in idiomatic Clojure/Lisp vs punting to Java.<p>- Cl

Task: Identify and rank the top 10 tags from Stack Overflow questions that were referenced in Hacker News comments on or after 2014 by counting how many times each question was mentioned, then splitting the questions’ tag strings by the '|' delimiter, grouping by tag

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To identify and rank the top 10 tags from Stack Overflow questions that were referenced in Hacker News comments on or after 2014, we:

1. Extracted Stack Overflow question IDs from the text of Hacker News comments dated 2014 or later.
2. Counted how many times each question was mentioned.
3. Retrieved the tags for each question from the `POSTS_QUESTIONS` table, splitting the tags by the '|' delimiter.
4. Grouped by tag and summed the counts of mentions.
5. Ranked the tags by total mentions in descending order and selected the top 10.

The results are presented in the following format:

```csv
Tag,TotalMentions
tag1:str,count1:int
tag2:str,count2:int
tag3:str,count3:int
tag4:str,count4:int
tag5:str,count5:int
tag6:str,count6:int
tag7:str,count7:int
tag8:str,count8:int
tag9:str,count9:int
tag10:str,count10:int
(Attention: answer in 10 rows, ordered by TotalMentions descending)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'STACKOVERFLOW_PLUS': {'HACKERNEWS': ['FULL_201510', 'FULL_PARTITIONED', 'COMMENTSV2', 'FULL_PARTITION_EXTRA', 'COMMENTS', 'STORIESV2', 'COMMENTS_CONVOLUTION', 'STORIES'], 'STACKOVERFLOW': ['BADGES', 'POSTS_ORPHANED_TAG_WIKI', 'POST_LINKS', 'USERS', 'POSTS_QUESTIONS', 'COMMENTS', 'POSTS_PRIVILEGE_WIKI', 'TAGS', 'VOTES', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI_EXCERPT', 'POSTS_WIKI_PLACEHOLDER', 'POSTS_ANSWERS', 'POSTS_MODERATOR_NOMINATION', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI', 'POST_HISTORY', 'STACKOVERFLOW_POSTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 19:49:24 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Identify and rank the top 10 tags from Stack Overflow questions that were referenced in Hacker News comments on or after 2014 by counting how many times each question was mentioned, then splitting the questions’ tag strings by the '|' delimiter, grouping by tag, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To identify and rank the top 10 tags from Stack Overflow questions that were referenced in Hacker News comments on or after 2014, we:

1. Extracted Stack Overflow question IDs from the text of Hacker News comments dated 2014 or later.
2. Counted how many times each question was mentioned.
3. Retrieved the tags for each question from the `POSTS_QUESTIONS` table, splitting the tags by the '|' delimiter.
4. Grouped by tag and summed the counts of mentions.
5. Ranked the tags by total mentions in descending order and selected the top 10.

The results are presented in the following format:

```csv
Tag,TotalMentions
tag1:str,count1:int
tag2:str,count2:int
tag3:str,count3:int
tag4:str,count4:int
tag5:str,count5:int
tag6:str,count6:int
tag7:str,count7:int
tag8:str,count8:int
tag9:str,count9:int
tag10:str,count10:int
(Attention: answer in 10 rows, ordered by TotalMentions descending)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
