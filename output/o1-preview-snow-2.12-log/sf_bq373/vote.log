After comparing both SQL queries, I conclude that **1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Year Filter:**
   - **1result.sql** filters data from the year **2014**, which aligns with the task requirement: *"Using the invoice date to determine each month of the year 2014"*.
   - **2result.sql** filters data from the year **1996**, which does not meet the task's criteria.

2. **Data Source:**
   - **1result.sql** queries the **ADVENTUREWORKS** database, specifically the `SALESORDERHEADER` table, which is suitable for sales and invoice data analysis.
   - **2result.sql** uses the **SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1** database, which is based on the TPC-H benchmark data. This dataset is more suited for performance benchmarking than for analyzing real-world sales data from 2014.

3. **Calculation Method:**
   - In **1result.sql**, the query:
     - Creates a list of all months in 2014.
     - Ensures that each customer has an entry for every month (even if they had zero spending), by performing a **CROSS JOIN** between customers and months.
     - Calculates the total spending per customer per month.
     - Computes the average monthly spending for each customer across all 12 months.
   - In **2result.sql**, the query:
     - Calculates the total spending per customer in 1996 and divides it by 12.
     - Does not account for months with zero spending.
     - Uses data from the wrong year.

4. **Result Validity:**
   - The median calculated in **1result.csv** (`38.23945`) is based on the correct dataset and methodology as per the task.
   - The median in **2result.csv** (`28728.69666667000`) is not valid for the task since it's based on data from 1996.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

1result.sql
