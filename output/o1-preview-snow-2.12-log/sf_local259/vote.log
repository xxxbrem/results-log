After carefully comparing the three SQL scripts (`0result.sql`, `1result.sql`, and `2result.sql`) and their respective outputs, I have determined that `2result.sql` is the correct and most accurate script for accomplishing the task. Here's the reasoning:

### **Analysis of the SQL Scripts**

1. **`0result.sql`:**

   - **Issue with Join Conditions:**
     - The script often *omits the `innings_no`* in the join conditions between tables like `BATSMAN_SCORED` and `BALL_BY_BALL`.
     - **Consequences:**
       - This leads to incorrect data aggregation due to matching records across different innings, causing inflated statistics.
       - For example, the `Total_Runs_Scored` and `Highest_Score_In_Single_Match` are significantly higher than realistic values (e.g., a score of 176 in a T20 match is improbable).

2. **`1result.sql`:**

   - **Correct Use of `innings_no`:**
     - The script includes `innings_no` in the join conditions, ensuring accurate data aggregation.
   - **Redundancy in Calculations:**
     - Separate Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for similar calculations (e.g., `MatchesOver30`, `MatchesOver50`, `MatchesOver100`) make the script longer and slightly less efficient.
   - **Accuracy:**
     - Produces accurate statistics without data duplication.

3. **`2result.sql`:**

   - **Correct Join Conditions:**
     - Like `1result.sql`, it properly includes `innings_no` in all join conditions, ensuring data integrity.
   - **Efficient Calculations:**
     - Combines calculations for matches scored over 30, 50, and 100 into a single CTE using `SUM(CASE WHEN ...)`, making the script more concise and efficient.
   - **Accurate and Clean:**
     - Provides accurate results similar to `1result.sql` but with cleaner syntax and better performance.

### **Conclusion**

- **`2result.sql`** stands out as the correct and optimal script because it:

  - Ensures data accuracy by correctly joining tables with all necessary keys, including `innings_no`.
  - Shows better coding practices by reducing redundancy and combining similar calculations.
  - Produces reliable and realistic statistics that align with expected values in cricket (e.g., plausible highest scores and totals).
