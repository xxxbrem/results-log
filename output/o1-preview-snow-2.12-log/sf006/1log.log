2025-02-10 09:46:46 - root - INFO - Certainly! Here's a simplified SQL query that removes some of the conditions to ensure data is returned:

```sql
SELECT "ID_RSSD", "BRANCH_NAME", "CITY", "START_DATE", "END_DATE"
FROM "FINANCE__ECONOMICS"."CYBERSYN"."FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES"
LIMIT 100;
```

This query selects the first 100 records from the `FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES` table without any filtering conditions. If you'd like to apply some filtering but keep it broad to ensure results, you can add a simple condition, such as filtering by state:

```sql
SELECT "ID_RSSD", "BRANCH_NAME", "CITY", "START_DATE", "END_DATE"
FROM "FINANCE__ECONOMICS"."CYBERSYN"."FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES"
WHERE "STATE_ABBREVIATION" = 'TX'
LIMIT 100;
```

Feel free to adjust the `"STATE_ABBREVIATION"` value or remove the `WHERE` clause altogether to retrieve data that fits your requirements.

table_name,COMPANY_SECURITY_RELATIONSHIPS
description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

Task: For each U.S. state, find how the number of active financial branch entities has changed from March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. An entity is considered active on a specific date if its start date is on or before that date and its end date is either null or on or after that date. For each state, calculate the number of entities active on March 1, 2020, the number of entities active on December 31, 2021, and the percentage change in these counts

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: For each U.S. state, the number of active financial branch entities on March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, along with the percentage change between these dates, are provided in the table below.

```csv
State,Num_Entities_Mar_1_2020,Num_Entities_Dec_31_2021,Percentage_Change
state_name:str,num_entities_2020:int,num_entities_2021:int,percentage_change:float
...
```

- **State**: The name of the U.S. state.
- **Num_Entities_Mar_1_2020**: Number of active financial branch entities as of March 1, 2020.
- **Num_Entities_Dec_31_2021**: Number of active financial branch entities as of December 31, 2021.
- **Percentage_Change**: The percentage change in the number of active entities between these two dates. Calculated as `((Num_Entities_Dec_31_2021 - Num_Entities_Mar_1_2020) / Num_Entities_Mar_1_2020) * 100`..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 09:48:09 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each U.S. state, find how the number of active financial branch entities has changed from March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. An entity is considered active on a specific date if its start date is on or before that date and its end date is either null or on or after that date. For each state, calculate the number of entities active on March 1, 2020, the number of entities active on December 31, 2021, and the percentage change in these counts, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: For each U.S. state, the number of active financial branch entities on March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, along with the percentage change between these dates, are provided in the table below.

```csv
State,Num_Entities_Mar_1_2020,Num_Entities_Dec_31_2021,Percentage_Change
state_name:str,num_entities_2020:int,num_entities_2021:int,percentage_change:float
...
```

- **State**: The name of the U.S. state.
- **Num_Entities_Mar_1_2020**: Number of active financial branch entities as of March 1, 2020.
- **Num_Entities_Dec_31_2021**: Number of active financial branch entities as of December 31, 2021.
- **Percentage_Change**: The percentage change in the number of active entities between these two dates. Calculated as `((Num_Entities_Dec_31_2021 - Num_Entities_Mar_1_2020) / Num_Entities_Mar_1_2020) * 100`. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-10 09:48:44 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each U.S. state, find how the number of active financial branch entities has changed from March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. An entity is considered active on a specific date if its start date is on or before that date and its end date is either null or on or after that date. For each state, calculate the number of entities active on March 1, 2020, the number of entities active on December 31, 2021, and the percentage change in these counts, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: For each U.S. state, the number of active financial branch entities on March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, along with the percentage change between these dates, are provided in the table below.

```csv
State,Num_Entities_Mar_1_2020,Num_Entities_Dec_31_2021,Percentage_Change
state_name:str,num_entities_2020:int,num_entities_2021:int,percentage_change:float
...
```

- **State**: The name of the U.S. state.
- **Num_Entities_Mar_1_2020**: Number of active financial branch entities as of March 1, 2020.
- **Num_Entities_Dec_31_2021**: Number of active financial branch entities as of December 31, 2021.
- **Percentage_Change**: The percentage change in the number of active entities between these two dates. Calculated as `((Num_Entities_Dec_31_2021 - Num_Entities_Mar_1_2020) / Num_Entities_Mar_1_2020) * 100`. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
