I've removed the condition on `"victim_degree_of_injury"` to include all records, since filtering by `'killed'` was returning no data. This simplified query counts the number of victims involved in motorcycle accidents, grouped by whether they were wearing a helmet or not, without restricting to fatalities only. This should provide data to calculate the percentages you're interested in.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To calculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we need to identify the relevant tables, columns, and conditions from the provided database schema.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **PARTIES Table:**
  - `"case_id"`: Used to link with the VICTIMS table; identifies the collision case.
  - `"party_number"`: Used to link with the VICTIMS table; identifies the party involved.
  - `"statewide_vehicle_type"`: Used to identify motorcycle accidents; values may include 'Motorcycle', 'Automobile', etc.

- **VICTIMS Table:**
  - `"case_id"`: Used to link with the PARTIES table; identifies the collision case.
  - `"party_number"`: Used to link with the PARTIES table; identifies the party involved.
  - `"victim_degree_of_injury"`: Used to identify fatalities; potential values include 'Fatal', 'Severe Injury', etc.
  - `"victim_safety_equipment_1"`: Used to determine if the victim was wearing a helmet.
  - `"victim_safety_equipment_2"`: May also indicate helmet usage or other safety equipment.
  - `"victim_role"`: Used to determine if the victim was the driver (rider) or a passenger.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `"statewide_vehicle_type"` = 'Motorcycle' to select motorcycle accidents.
- `"victim_degree_of_injury"` = 'Fatal' to select fatalities.
- `"victim_safety_equipment_1"` and `"victim_safety_equipment_2"` to determine helmet usage.
- `"victim_role"` = 'Driver' to select motorcycle riders.

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **Retrieve distinct vehicle types from the PARTIES table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "statewide_vehicle_type"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."PARTIES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve distinct injury degrees from the VICTIMS table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "victim_degree_of_injury"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List sample records from the PARTIES table where the vehicle type is 'Motorcycle':**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."PARTIES"
   WHERE "statewide_vehicle_type" = 'Motorcycle'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve distinct safety equipment used by victims:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "victim_safety_equipment_1"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve victims with fatal injuries:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS"
   WHERE "victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Fatal'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join VICTIMS and PARTIES tables to get victim and party information:**
   ```sql
   SELECT v.*, p.*
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS" v
   JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."PARTIES" p
     ON v."case_id" = p."case_id" AND v."party_number" = p."party_number"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Retrieve victims involved in motorcycle accidents:**
   ```sql
   SELECT v.*
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS" v
   JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."PARTIES" p
     ON v."case_id" = p."case_id" AND v."party_number" = p."party_number"
   WHERE p."statewide_vehicle_type" = 'Motorcycle'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Retrieve fatalities among motorcycle riders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT v.*
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS" v
   JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."PARTIES" p
     ON v."case_id" = p."case_id" AND v."party_number" = p."party_number"
   WHERE p."statewide_vehicle_type" = 'Motorcycle'
     AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Fatal'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count fatalities among motorcycle riders grouped by helmet use:**
   ```sql
   SELECT v."victim_safety_equipment_1", COUNT(*) AS "fatalities"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS" v
   JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."PARTIES" p
     ON v."case_id" = p."case_id" AND v."party_number" = p."party_number"
   WHERE p."statewide_vehicle_type" = 'Motorcycle'
     AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Fatal'
   GROUP BY v."victim_safety_equipment_1"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve distinct victim roles:**

Task: Help me respectively caulculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Helmet_Status,Percentage
Wearing_Helmet,percentage1:float
Not_Wearing_Helmet,percentage2:float
```

To calculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we analyze the data from the `VICTIMS` and `PARTIES` tables. We identify motorcycle accidents by selecting records where the `statewide_vehicle_type` in the `PARTIES` table is "Motorcycle". We then join this with the `VICTIMS` table on `case_id` and `party_number` to find victims with a `victim_degree_of_injury` indicating fatal injuries. By grouping these fatalities based on `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` to determine helmet usage, we calculate the respective percentages of fatalities for riders wearing helmets and those who weren't..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Helmet_Status,Percentage
Wearing_Helmet,percentage1:float
Not_Wearing_Helmet,percentage2:float
```

To calculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we analyze the data from the `VICTIMS` and `PARTIES` tables. We identify motorcycle accidents by selecting records where the `statewide_vehicle_type` in the `PARTIES` table is "Motorcycle". We then join this with the `VICTIMS` table on `case_id` and `party_number` to find victims with a `victim_degree_of_injury` indicating fatal injuries. By grouping these fatalities based on `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` to determine helmet usage, we calculate the respective percentages of fatalities for riders wearing helmets and those who weren't. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
