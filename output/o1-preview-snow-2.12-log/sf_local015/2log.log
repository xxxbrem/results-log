The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure, let's identify the relevant tables, columns, and conditions for the task.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `PARTIES`
  - **"case_id"**: Used to join with the `VICTIMS` table.
  - **"party_number"**: Used to join with the `VICTIMS` table.
  - **"statewide_vehicle_type"**: To identify motorcycle accidents.

- **Table:** `VICTIMS`
  - **"case_id"**: Used to join with the `PARTIES` table.
  - **"party_number"**: Used to join with the `PARTIES` table.
  - **"victim_degree_of_injury"**: To identify fatalities.
  - **"victim_safety_equipment_1"**: To determine helmet usage.
  - **"victim_safety_equipment_2"**: Additional information on helmet usage.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Identifying Motorcycle Accidents:**
  - `"statewide_vehicle_type" ILIKE '%MOTORCYCLE%'`: To find records involving motorcycles.

- **Identifying Fatalities:**
  - `"victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'`: To select records where the victim was killed.
  - Alternatively, check for codes representing fatalities if 'Killed' is not the exact value.

- **Determining Helmet Usage:**
  - `"victim_safety_equipment_1" ILIKE '%HELMET%'`: To identify victims wearing helmets.
  - `"victim_safety_equipment_1" IS NULL OR "victim_safety_equipment_1" NOT ILIKE '%HELMET%'`: To identify victims not wearing helmets.

   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Select sample records of parties involved in motorcycle accidents:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."PARTIES"
   WHERE "statewide_vehicle_type" ILIKE '%MOTORCYCLE%'
   LIMIT 100;

   SELECT *
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS"
   WHERE "victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join PARTIES and VICTIMS tables to find victims in motorcycle accidents:**

   ```sql
   SELECT v.*
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS" v
   JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."PARTIES" p
     ON v."case_id" = p."case_id" AND v."party_number" = p."party_number"
   WHERE p."statewide_vehicle_type" ILIKE '%MOTORCYCLE%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find victims who were fatally injured in motorcycle accidents:**

   ```sql
   SELECT v.*
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS" v
   JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."PARTIES" p
     ON v."case_id" = p."case_id" AND v."party_number" = p."party_number"
   WHERE p."statewide_vehicle_type" ILIKE '%MOTORCYCLE%'
     AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Check helmet usage among fatalities in motorcycle accidents:**

   ```sql
   SELECT v."victim_safety_equipment_1", v."victim_safety_equipment_2"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS" v
   JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."PARTIES" p
     ON v."case_id" = p."case_id" AND v."party_number" = p."party_number"
   WHERE p."statewide_vehicle_type" ILIKE '%MOTORCYCLE%'
     AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count total fatalities in motorcycle accidents:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "total_fatalities"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."VICTIMS" v
   JOIN "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."PARTIES" p
     ON v."case_id" = p."case_id" AND v."party_number" = p."party_number"
   WHERE p."statewide_vehicle_type" ILIKE '%MOTORCYCLE%'
     AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed';
   ```

10. **Count fatalities with and without helmet usage:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      CASE
        WHEN v."victim_safety_equipment_1" ILIKE '%HELMET%' THEN 'Wearing Helmet'
        ELSE 'Not Wearing Helmet'

Task: Help me respectively caulculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Helmet_Status,Percentage
Wearing_Helmet,percentage1:float
Not_Wearing_Helmet,percentage2:float
```

To calculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we analyze the data from the `VICTIMS` and `PARTIES` tables. We identify motorcycle accidents by selecting records where the `statewide_vehicle_type` in the `PARTIES` table is "Motorcycle". We then join this with the `VICTIMS` table on `case_id` and `party_number` to find victims with a `victim_degree_of_injury` indicating fatal injuries. By grouping these fatalities based on `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` to determine helmet usage, we calculate the respective percentages of fatalities for riders wearing helmets and those who weren't..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 07:04:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Help me respectively caulculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Helmet_Status,Percentage
Wearing_Helmet,percentage1:float
Not_Wearing_Helmet,percentage2:float
```

To calculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we analyze the data from the `VICTIMS` and `PARTIES` tables. We identify motorcycle accidents by selecting records where the `statewide_vehicle_type` in the `PARTIES` table is "Motorcycle". We then join this with the `VICTIMS` table on `case_id` and `party_number` to find victims with a `victim_degree_of_injury` indicating fatal injuries. By grouping these fatalities based on `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` to determine helmet usage, we calculate the respective percentages of fatalities for riders wearing helmets and those who weren't. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
