2025-01-25 05:48:14 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to a data type mismatch between the numeric `date_inserted` column and the string date `'2024-01-01'`. Here's how to resolve the issue.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Error Message:** `Numeric value '2024-01-01' is not recognized`
- **Cause:** The `"date_inserted"` column is of type `NUMBER(38,0)`, and you're comparing it to a string date `'2024-01-01'`. This results in a data type mismatch.

**Details:**

- **"date_inserted" Column:** This column is of numeric type and likely stores the date as a Unix timestamp (number of seconds since January 1, 1970).
- **String Date Comparison:** Directly comparing a numeric column to a string date causes an error because the database cannot implicitly convert between these types.

---

**Solutions:**

1. **Convert the String Date to a Numeric Timestamp:**

   - **Step 1:** Convert `'2024-01-01'` to its equivalent Unix timestamp.
     - `'2024-01-01'` corresponds to Unix timestamp **1704067200**.
   - **Step 2:** Use this numeric value in your query.
   - **Revised Query:**

     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS"
     WHERE "date_inserted" >= 1704067200
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

2. **Convert "date_inserted" to a Date Type for Comparison:**

   - **Step 1:** Use the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function to convert `"date_inserted"` from a numeric value to a timestamp.
   - **Step 2:** Compare it with the string date `'2024-01-01'`.
   - **Revised Query:**

     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS"
     WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

3. **Use the "date_normal" Column Instead:**

   - **Note:** The `"date_normal"` column is of type `DATE`, allowing for direct date comparisons.
   - **Revised Query:**

     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS"
     WHERE "date_normal" >= '2024-01-01'
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

---

**Applying the Solution to Your Task:**

To retrieve the venue titles of publications inserted from 2024 onwards, associated with research organizations in 'Qianjiang', while prioritizing the venue titles as specified, here's how you can adjust your query.

**Step 1:** Correct the Date Comparison.

- Use `TO_TIMESTAMP("date_inserted")` to convert the numeric timestamp to a date for comparison.

**Step 2:** Flatten the `research_org_city_names` array to search for 'Qianjiang'.

- Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to unnest the `research_org_city_names` array.

**Step 3:** Retrieve and Prioritize Venue Titles.

- Use `COALESCE` to prioritize the venue titles from `journal`, then `proceedings_title`, `book_title`, and `book_series_title`.

**Final Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  COALESCE("p"."journal"::STRING, "p"."proceedings_title"::STRING, "p"."book_title"::STRING, "p"."book_series_title"::STRING) AS "venue_title"
FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_org_city_names") AS "city"
WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
  AND "city"."value"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation of the Query:**

- **`SELECT DISTINCT`:** Ensures that duplicate venue titles are not returned.
- **`COALESCE(...) AS "venue_title"`:** Selects the first non-null venue title in the order of priority.
- **`LATERAL FLATTEN`:** Unnests the `research_org_city_names` array to access individual city names.
- **`TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'`:** Converts the numeric `date_inserted` to a timestamp for comparison.
- **`"city"."value"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'`:** Filters for publications associated with 'Qianjiang'.
- **`LIMIT 100`:** Limits the result set to 100 records.

---

**Alternate Query Using "date_normal":**

If you prefer to use the `date_normal` column:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  COALESCE("p"."journal"::STRING, "p"."proceedings_title"::STRING, "p"."book_title"::STRING, "p"."book_series_title"::STRING) AS "venue_title"
FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_org_city_names") AS "city"
WHERE "p"."date_normal" >= '2024-01-01'
  AND "city"."value"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Additional Notes:**

- **Understanding "date_inserted":** It's crucial to know the format and timezone of the `date_inserted` values. If they are in milliseconds, you may need to adjust by dividing by 1000.
- **Verifying Data Types:** Always ensure that the data types you're comparing are compatible. Use appropriate conversion functions when necessary.
- **Testing with Sample Data:** It may help to retrieve some sample `date_inserted` values to confirm their format:

  ```sql
  SELECT "date_inserted"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS"
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

---

**Final Output Format:**

Based on your task, the output should be in CSV format with the venue titles:

```csv
venue_title
title1:str
title2:str
...
```

---

**Summary:**

- **Error Cause:** Data type mismatch between numeric `date_inserted` and string date.
- **Solution:** Convert `date_inserted` to a date or convert the string date to a numeric timestamp.
- **Adjusted Query:** Use `TO_TIMESTAMP` or use `date_normal` for date comparisons.
- **Output:** Retrieve the prioritized venue titles in CSV format.

  ""preferred"": ""Governments create contests to allocate resources to stakeholders, e.g., grants, contracts. The actions of these stakeholders can generate a positive externality for themselves—the contest winner can attract additional outside funding and donations from third-parties who want to jump on the winner’s bandwagon. Herein we examine the externalities arising from these contests created by governance and their impact on a virtuous circle of governance contests. Among various conditions that make governance virtuous, we focus on the equilibrium expected payoffs of stakeholders, the difference in them, and the rent-dissipation rates. Our study shows that the impact of externalities on the efficiency of governance depends on two key factors: (i) the choice of governance contests, the player-externality and the winner-externality, and (ii) the relative efficiency of stakeholders’ efforts.""

2025-01-25 05:50:07 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 26
invalid identifier '"city"."value"'
```

indicates that the identifier `"city"."value"` is invalid. This is due to a mismatch in the column name casing or incorrect quoting of identifiers.

In Snowflake, identifiers (such as table names, column names, aliases) are case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes. Also, the `FLATTEN` function returns columns with uppercase names unless explicitly defined otherwise.

When you use `LATERAL FLATTEN`, the output columns are:

- `INDEX`
- `KEY`
- `PATH`
- `VALUE`
- `THIS`
- `SEQ`

By default, these columns are in uppercase unless they were created with double quotes in a specific case.

**Cause of the Error:**

- You're referencing `"city"."value"` in your SELECT and WHERE clauses.
- However, since `FLATTEN` returns the column `VALUE` in uppercase, you need to reference it as `"VALUE"` or without quotes (assuming it's uppercase in the schema).

**Corrected Query:**

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "p"."id", "city"."VALUE"::STRING AS "city_name"
FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_org_city_names") AS "city"
WHERE "city"."VALUE"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **Changed `"city"."value"` to `"city"."VALUE"`:**
  - The `VALUE` column from `FLATTEN` is in uppercase by default.
  - Using the correct case ensures the identifier is valid.

- **Consistent Use of Double Quotes:**
  - Since you've used double quotes for identifiers, you need to maintain the exact case.
  - If the column names are in uppercase, they must be referenced in uppercase when quoted.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Alternative Without Double Quotes:**
  - If you prefer, you can omit double quotes and use uppercase identifiers:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT p.id, city.VALUE::STRING AS city_name
    FROM DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19.DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19.PUBLICATIONS AS p,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => p.research_org_city_names) AS city
    WHERE city.VALUE::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

- **Verifying Column Names:**
  - You can run a sample query to verify the column names returned by `FLATTEN`:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS p,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_org_city_names") AS city
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

    This will display the columns and help confirm the correct casing.

- **Understanding IDENTIFIER Case Sensitivity:**
  - In Snowflake:
    - Unquoted identifiers are converted to uppercase.
    - Quoted identifiers are case-sensitive.
  - Therefore, using double quotes requires exact casing.

**Summary:**

- **Issue:** Invalid identifier due to incorrect casing of the column name.
- **Solution:** Reference the `VALUE` column in uppercase as `"VALUE"` when using double quotes.
- **Corrected Query Provided.**

---

By making this correction, your query should execute without the `invalid identifier` error, allowing you to retrieve the desired data.

2025-01-25 05:55:23 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 26
invalid identifier '"city"."value"'
```

indicates that the identifier `"city"."value"` is invalid. This is because, in Snowflake, when using `LATERAL FLATTEN`, the output columns are in uppercase by default unless explicitly specified otherwise.

The `FLATTEN` function generates the following columns (by default in uppercase):

- `SEQ`
- `KEY`
- `PATH`
- `INDEX`
- `VALUE`
- `THIS`

Therefore, the correct column name to reference is `"VALUE"` (uppercase), not `"value"` (lowercase).

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "p"."id", "city"."VALUE"::STRING AS "city_name"
FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_org_city_names") AS "city"
WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
  AND "city"."VALUE"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
LIMIT 100;
```

By changing `"city"."value"` to `"city"."VALUE"` in both the `SELECT` clause and the `WHERE` clause, the query should execute without the error.

**Summary:**

- Replace `"city"."value"` with `"city"."VALUE"` wherever it appears.
- Ensure that column identifiers match the case used by Snowflake's `FLATTEN` function.

2025-01-25 06:03:42 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you received:

```
000630 (57014): None: Statement reached its statement or warehouse timeout of 200 second(s) and was canceled.
```

indicates that your SQL query exceeded the maximum execution time allowed (200 seconds) and was canceled by the system. This often happens when a query is processing a large volume of data or is not optimized efficiently.

**Possible Causes:**

- **Complex Joins and Flattens:** The query involves joining large tables (`PUBLICATIONS` and `GRID`) and uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` on nested `VARIANT` columns, which can be resource-intensive.
- **Large Data Volumes:** Both tables might contain a significant amount of data, leading to long processing times.
- **Inefficient Filtering:** Filters are applied after the joins and flattens, causing unnecessary data processing.

**Suggestions to Optimize the Query:**

1. **Filter Early:** Apply filters to reduce the dataset before performing joins and flattens.
2. **Limit Data Retrieval:** Retrieve only the necessary columns instead of using `SELECT DISTINCT` with all columns.
3. **Use Subqueries or CTEs:** Break down the query using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to process data in steps.
4. **Ensure Proper Joins:** Verify that the join conditions are correct to avoid unnecessary data combinations.

**Optimized Query:**

Here’s an optimized version of your query:

```sql
WITH filtered_grid AS (
  SELECT "g"."id", "g"."name"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."GRID" AS "g",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "g"."address") AS "a"
  WHERE "a"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"city"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
),
pub_orgs AS (
  SELECT "p"."id", "ro"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"id"::STRING AS "org_id"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_orgs") AS "ro"
  WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
)
SELECT DISTINCT "pub_orgs"."id", "filtered_grid"."name", 'Qianjiang' AS "city"
FROM pub_orgs
JOIN filtered_grid
  ON pub_orgs."org_id" = filtered_grid."id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **CTE `filtered_grid`:**
  - Filters the `GRID` table to include only organizations located in 'Qianjiang'.
  - Uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` to access the `city` field within the `address` column.
  - Reduces the dataset size before the join.

- **CTE `pub_orgs`:**
  - Filters the `PUBLICATIONS` table to include publications inserted from 2024 onwards.
  - Uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` to extract organization IDs from the `research_orgs` column.

- **Final Query:**
  - Joins the filtered publications with the filtered organizations based on matching organization IDs.
  - Selects the publication ID, organization name, and sets the city to 'Qianjiang'.
  - Uses `LIMIT 100` to restrict the result set.

**Benefits of This Approach:**

- **Efficiency:** By filtering data early, the query processes fewer records, reducing execution time.
- **Clarity:** Breaking the query into CTEs makes it easier to read and maintain.
- **Performance:** Joining smaller datasets improves performance and reduces the likelihood of timeouts.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Increase the Warehouse Size:** If possible, use a larger compute warehouse to handle the query.
- **Optimize Data Structures:** Ensure that the relevant columns are properly indexed to accelerate joins.
- **Monitor Execution Plans:** Use query profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.

**Alternative Approach:**

If CTEs are not preferred, you can refactor the query using subqueries:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "p"."id", "g"."name", 'Qianjiang' AS "city"
FROM (
  SELECT "id", "ro"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"id"::STRING AS "org_id"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_orgs") AS "ro"
  WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
) AS "p"
JOIN (
  SELECT "g"."id", "g"."name"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."GRID" AS "g",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "g"."address") AS "a"
  WHERE "a"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"city"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
) AS "g"
ON "p"."org_id" = "g"."id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:**

- The `LIMIT 100` is applied after the join to ensure you retrieve up to 100 matching records.
- Adjust the query based on your data volume and performance requirements.

**Conclusion:**

The timeout error occurs due to the heavy processing required by the original query. By filtering data early and optimizing the query structure, you can reduce execution time and prevent timeouts. Implement the optimized query and monitor its performance. If necessary, further optimize by indexing or adjusting warehouse resources.

2025-01-25 06:04:43 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 13 at position 16
invalid identifier '"pub_orgs"."id"'
```

indicates that the identifier `"pub_orgs"."id"` is invalid. This suggests that there is an issue with how the CTE (`pub_orgs`) is being referenced in your query.

**Cause of the Error:**

In the SQL query, you are using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) named `filtered_grid` and `pub_orgs`. When referencing these CTEs in the main `SELECT` statement and the `JOIN`, you should not enclose the CTE names in double quotes unless they were created with case-sensitive identifiers (which is generally not recommended).

In Snowflake:

- Unquoted identifiers are automatically converted to uppercase.
- Quoted identifiers preserve the case and are case-sensitive.

If your CTEs are defined without quotes (which is standard practice), you should reference them without quotes or ensure that the casing matches exactly.

**Corrected Query:**

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
WITH filtered_grid AS (
  SELECT "g"."id", "g"."name"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."GRID" AS "g",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "g"."address") AS "a"
  WHERE "a"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"city"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
),
pub_orgs AS (
  SELECT "p"."id", "ro"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"id"::STRING AS "org_id"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_orgs") AS "ro"
  WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
)
SELECT DISTINCT "pub_orgs"."id", "filtered_grid"."name", 'Qianjiang' AS "city"
FROM "pub_orgs"
JOIN "filtered_grid"
  ON "pub_orgs"."org_id" = "filtered_grid"."id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **Enclose CTE Names in Double Quotes:**
  - Since we're using double quotes for identifiers throughout the query, and the CTE names are in lowercase, we need to enclose the CTE names in double quotes to preserve their case sensitivity.
  - In the `SELECT` clause and the `JOIN`, I've enclosed `"pub_orgs"` and `"filtered_grid"` in double quotes to match their definitions.

- **Consistent Use of Identifiers:**
  - Ensure that the casing and quoting of identifiers are consistent throughout the query.
  - If you define a CTE or table alias with double quotes and lowercase letters, you must reference it exactly the same way.

**Alternative Solution:**

If you prefer to avoid case sensitivity issues, you can define your CTEs and references in uppercase without quotes:

```sql
WITH PUB_ORGS AS (
  SELECT P.ID, RO.VALUE::VARIANT:"id"::STRING AS ORG_ID
  FROM DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19.DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19.PUBLICATIONS AS P,
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => P.RESEARCH_ORGS) AS RO
  WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP(P.DATE_INSERTED) >= '2024-01-01'
),
FILTERED_GRID AS (
  SELECT G.ID, G.NAME
  FROM DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19.DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19.GRID AS G,
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => G.ADDRESS) AS A
  WHERE A.VALUE::VARIANT:"city"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
)
SELECT DISTINCT PUB_ORGS.ID, FILTERED_GRID.NAME, 'Qianjiang' AS CITY
FROM PUB_ORGS
JOIN FILTERED_GRID
  ON PUB_ORGS.ORG_ID = FILTERED_GRID.ID
LIMIT 100;
```

**Notes:**

- **Avoid Quoting Identifiers Unless Necessary:**
  - If you avoid using double quotes for identifiers, Snowflake will automatically convert them to uppercase, and you won't face case sensitivity issues.
  - This can simplify your queries and reduce the likelihood of identifier errors.

- **Consistency is Key:**
  - If you choose to use double quotes and lowercase identifiers, ensure that you reference them exactly as defined, including case and quotes.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Check CTE Definitions:**
  - Ensure that the CTEs `pub_orgs` and `filtered_grid` are correctly defined and that there are no typos in the names.
  
- **Verify Column Names:**
  - Make sure that all column names used in the `SELECT`, `JOIN`, and other clauses match the columns defined in your CTEs and tables.

- **Sample Execution:**
  - Before running the full query, you might test each CTE separately to ensure they return the expected results.

**Summary:**

The error was caused by inconsistent referencing of the CTE identifiers due to case sensitivity and quoting. By properly enclosing the CTE names in double quotes and matching the case used in their definitions, we resolve the invalid identifier error.

**Final Corrected Query:**

```sql
WITH filtered_grid AS (
  SELECT "g"."id", "g"."name"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."GRID" AS "g",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "g"."address") AS "a"
  WHERE "a"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"city"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
),
pub_orgs AS (
  SELECT "p"."id", "ro"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"id"::STRING AS "org_id"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_orgs") AS "ro"
  WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
)
SELECT DISTINCT "pub_orgs"."id", "filtered_grid"."name", 'Qianjiang' AS "city"
FROM "pub_orgs"
JOIN "filtered_grid"
  ON "pub_orgs"."org_id" = "filtered_grid"."id"
LIMIT 100;
```

By executing this corrected query, you should be able to retrieve the desired data without encountering the `invalid identifier` error.

2025-01-25 06:05:36 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering is:

```
002003 (42S02): 01b9f10c-0004-8038-0001-11c300f9ffa2: SQL compilation error:
Object '"pub_orgs"' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error indicates that the object `"pub_orgs"` does not exist in the current context, or you don't have the necessary permissions to access it.

**Cause of the Error:**

- **Missing CTE Definition:** The error occurs because the Common Table Expression (CTE) named `"pub_orgs"` is not defined in your query.
- In your input SQL, you're referencing `"pub_orgs"` in the `FROM` clause without defining it beforehand.
- **Case Sensitivity and Quoting:** If the CTE is defined but not referenced correctly due to case sensitivity or incorrect quoting, Snowflake cannot recognize it.

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, ensure that you include the full query with the `WITH` clause that defines the CTEs (`pub_orgs` and `filtered_grid`).

**Corrected Query:**

Here is the complete query, including the CTE definitions:

```sql
WITH "pub_orgs" AS (
  SELECT "p"."id", "ro"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"id"::STRING AS "org_id"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_orgs") AS "ro"
  WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
),
"filtered_grid" AS (
  SELECT "g"."id", "g"."name"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."GRID" AS "g",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "g"."address") AS "a"
  WHERE "a"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"city"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
)
SELECT DISTINCT "pub_orgs"."id", "filtered_grid"."name", 'Qianjiang' AS "city"
FROM "pub_orgs"
JOIN "filtered_grid"
  ON "pub_orgs"."org_id" = "filtered_grid"."id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **CTEs (`WITH` Clause):**
  - **`"pub_orgs"` CTE:** Extracts publication IDs and associated organization IDs from the `PUBLICATIONS` table where the `date_inserted` is from 2024 onwards.
  - **`"filtered_grid"` CTE:** Retrieves organization IDs and names from the `GRID` table where the address city is 'Qianjiang'.
- **Main Query:**
  - Joins `"pub_orgs"` and `"filtered_grid"` on the organization ID.
  - Selects the publication ID, organization name, and sets the city as 'Qianjiang'.
  - Uses `LIMIT 100` to restrict the result set.
- **Quoting and Case Sensitivity:**
  - Since you're using double quotes and lowercase identifiers, you must consistently use double quotes when referencing CTEs and ensure the case matches exactly.

**Important Notes:**

- **Ensure Full Query Execution:**
  - You must execute the entire query, including the `WITH` clause. If you only execute the `SELECT` statement without the CTE definitions, the CTEs (`"pub_orgs"` and `"filtered_grid"`) won't exist, resulting in the error.
- **Consistency in Quoting:**
  - If you define CTEs or aliases with double quotes and lowercase letters, you must reference them exactly in the same way throughout your query.
- **Case Sensitivity:**
  - Snowflake treats unquoted identifiers as uppercase by default. Quoted identifiers are case-sensitive.
  - If you prefer to avoid case sensitivity issues, you can write your query without quotes and use uppercase identifiers.

**Alternative Query Without Quotes:**

```sql
WITH PUB_ORGS AS (
  SELECT P.ID, RO.VALUE::VARIANT:"id"::STRING AS ORG_ID
  FROM DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19.DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19.PUBLICATIONS AS P,
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => P.RESEARCH_ORGS) AS RO
  WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP(P.DATE_INSERTED) >= '2024-01-01'
),
FILTERED_GRID AS (
  SELECT G.ID, G.NAME
  FROM DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19.DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19.GRID AS G,
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => G.ADDRESS) AS A
  WHERE A.VALUE::VARIANT:"city"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
)
SELECT DISTINCT PUB_ORGS.ID, FILTERED_GRID.NAME, 'Qianjiang' AS CITY
FROM PUB_ORGS
JOIN FILTERED_GRID
  ON PUB_ORGS.ORG_ID = FILTERED_GRID.ID
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- By removing double quotes and using uppercase for identifiers, the query avoids case sensitivity issues. Snowflake automatically treats unquoted identifiers as uppercase.
- Ensure that all identifiers (table names, column names, aliases) are in uppercase if you choose this approach.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Check Permissions:**
   - Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the `DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19` database, `DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19` schema, and the `PUBLICATIONS` and `GRID` tables.

2. **Verify Table and Column Names:**
   - Ensure that all table names, column names, and aliases are correctly spelled and match exactly with your database's schema.

3. **Consistent Use of Identifiers:**
   - Be consistent with how you reference identifiers throughout your query. Mixing quoted and unquoted identifiers or inconsistent casing can lead to errors.

4. **Execute the Entire Query:**
   - Always execute the full query, including any CTEs or subqueries it depends on.

**Summary:**

- The error occurs because the CTE `"pub_orgs"` is not recognized, likely due to not including the `WITH` clause in your query execution.
- Ensure you include the full query with the CTE definitions.
- Be consistent with quoting and casing to avoid identifier errors.
- If preferred, use unquoted identifiers in uppercase to simplify the query and reduce the chance of errors.

**Final Corrected Query:**

```sql
WITH "pub_orgs" AS (
  SELECT "p"."id", "ro"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"id"::STRING AS "org_id"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_orgs") AS "ro"
  WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
),
"filtered_grid" AS (
  SELECT "g"."id", "g"."name"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."GRID" AS "g",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "g"."address") AS "a"
  WHERE "a"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"city"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
)
SELECT DISTINCT "pub_orgs"."id", "filtered_grid"."name", 'Qianjiang' AS "city"
FROM "pub_orgs"
JOIN "filtered_grid"
  ON "pub_orgs"."org_id" = "filtered_grid"."id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Action Steps:**

- Copy the entire query, including the `WITH` clause.
- Execute the full query in your SQL editor or interface.
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and that all identifiers are correctly specified.

This should resolve the error and return the desired results.

2025-01-25 06:09:54 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering:

```
000630 (57014): None: Statement reached its statement or warehouse timeout of 200 second(s) and was canceled.
```

indicates that your SQL query exceeded the maximum execution time allowed (200 seconds) and was canceled by the system. This often happens when a query is processing a large volume of data or is not optimized efficiently.

**Possible Causes:**

- **Complex Joins and Flattens:** The query involves joining large tables (`PUBLICATIONS` and `GRID`) and uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` on nested `VARIANT` columns, which can be resource-intensive.
- **Large Data Volumes:** Both tables might contain a significant amount of data, leading to long processing times.
- **Inefficient Filtering:** Filters are applied after the joins and flattens, causing unnecessary data processing.

---

**Suggestions to Optimize the Query:**

To resolve the timeout issue, you can optimize the query by:

1. **Filtering Early:** Apply filters before joining tables to reduce the data volume.
2. **Avoiding Unnecessary Joins:** Minimize joins by using subqueries or exists clauses.
3. **Limiting Data Retrieval:** Select only the necessary columns.
4. **Using Subqueries Instead of Joins:** Since you prefer not to use CTEs, we can utilize subqueries.

---

**Optimized Query Without CTEs:**

Here's an optimized version of your query using subqueries:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p."id", g."name", 'Qianjiang' AS "city"
FROM (
  SELECT "p"."id", ro."VALUE"::VARIANT:"id"::STRING AS "org_id"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_orgs") AS ro
  WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
) AS p
JOIN (
  SELECT "g"."id", "g"."name"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."GRID" AS "g",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "g"."address") AS "a"
  WHERE "a"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"city"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
) AS g
ON p."org_id" = g."id"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Subquery `p`:**
  - Extracts publication IDs and their associated organization IDs from the `PUBLICATIONS` table where `date_inserted` is from 2024 onwards.
  - Uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` to unnest the `research_orgs` array.

- **Subquery `g`:**
  - Extracts organization IDs and names from the `GRID` table where the city is 'Qianjiang'.
  - Uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` to access the `city` field within the `address` column.

- **Main Query:**
  - Joins the two subqueries on the organization ID.
  - Selects the publication ID, organization name, and sets the city to 'Qianjiang'.

---

**Benefits of This Approach:**

- **Reduced Data Volume:** By filtering data in subqueries, the join operates on smaller datasets, reducing execution time.
- **Early Filtering:** Applying filters before joins prevents unnecessary data processing.
- **Avoiding CTEs:** Aligns with your preference to avoid Common Table Expressions.

---

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Increase Warehouse Size (If Possible):**
   - A larger warehouse can process queries faster, reducing the likelihood of timeouts.

2. **Adjust Timeout Settings:**
   - If you have permission, increase the statement timeout setting to allow longer query execution.

3. **Test with Smaller Date Ranges:**
   - Try limiting the date range to see if the query executes successfully with less data.

   ```sql
   WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
   ```

4. **Monitor Query Profile:**
   - Use Snowflake's query profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in your query.

---

**Alternative Approach Using `EXISTS`:**

As another optimization, you can use the `EXISTS` clause to avoid large joins:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "p"."id", 'Qianjiang' AS "city"
FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_orgs") AS ro
WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."GRID" AS "g",
         LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "g"."address") AS "a"
    WHERE "a"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"city"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
      AND ro."VALUE"::VARIANT:"id"::STRING = "g"."id"
  )
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- Checks for the existence of an organization in `GRID` with a city matching 'Qianjiang' and an ID matching the publication's organization.

- This method can be more efficient as it avoids joining large tables.

---

**Final Recommendations:**

- **Test the Optimized Query:**
  - Run the optimized query to see if it completes within the allowed time.

- **Consider Data Volume:**
  - If data volume is still too large, further limit the date range or add additional filters.

- **Consult Database Administrator:**
  - If timeouts persist, consult with your database administrator to adjust warehouse resources or investigate further optimizations.

---

**Additional Note:**

- **Data Availability:**
  - The message "No data found for the specified query" suggests that there may be no publications inserted from 2024 onwards with associated organizations in 'Qianjiang'.

- **Verify Data:**
  - Confirm that the data you're querying exists by running simpler queries without date filters or with broader criteria.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT p."id"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p"
  WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

---

**Summary:**

- The timeout occurs due to heavy processing required by the original query.
- Optimizing the query by filtering early and reducing data in joins can help.
- The provided optimized query should run more efficiently and avoid timeouts.
- If no data is returned, verify the data availability and adjust filters accordingly.

---

**Example Optimized Query to Retrieve Venue Titles:**

Since your primary goal is to retrieve the venue titles of publications inserted from 2024 onwards, associated with 'Qianjiang', you can combine the optimizations:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  COALESCE(
    "p"."journal"::VARIANT:"title"::STRING,
    "p"."proceedings_title"::VARIANT:"preferred"::STRING,
    "p"."book_title"::VARIANT:"preferred"::STRING,
    "p"."book_series_title"::VARIANT:"preferred"::STRING
  ) AS "venue_title"
FROM (
  SELECT "p"."id", ro."VALUE"::VARIANT:"id"::STRING AS "org_id",
         "p"."journal", "p"."proceedings_title", "p"."book_title", "p"."book_series_title"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_orgs") AS ro
  WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
) AS p
JOIN (
  SELECT "g"."id"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."GRID" AS "g",
       LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "g"."address") AS "a"
  WHERE "a"."VALUE"::VARIANT:"city"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
) AS g
ON p."org_id" = g."id"
LIMIT 100;
```

- This query retrieves the venue titles with the specified priority and filters.

  ""preferred"": ""Governments create contests to allocate resources to stakeholders, e.g., grants, contracts. The actions of these stakeholders can generate a positive externality for themselves—the contest winner can attract additional outside funding and donations from third-parties who want to jump on the winner’s bandwagon. Herein we examine the externalities arising from these contests created by governance and their impact on a virtuous circle of governance contests. Among various conditions that make governance virtuous, we focus on the equilibrium expected payoffs of stakeholders, the difference in them, and the rent-dissipation rates. Our study shows that the impact of externalities on the efficiency of governance depends on two key factors: (i) the choice of governance contests, the player-externality and the winner-externality, and (ii) the relative efficiency of stakeholders’ efforts.""

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Retrieve the venue titles of publications inserted from 2024 onwards, where the associated grid's city is 'Qianjiang', prioritizing the venue titles from journal first, then proceedings, book, or book series titles.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To retrieve the venue titles of publications inserted from 2024 onwards, where the associated grid's city is 'Qianjiang', we select the relevant publications and prioritize their venue titles from journals first, then proceedings, book, or book series titles.

The result is:

```csv
venue_title
title1:str
title2:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19': {'DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19': ['CLINICAL_TRIALS', 'DATASETS', 'GRANTS', 'GRID', 'PATENTS', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
