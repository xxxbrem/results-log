```

This query selects the actor's name and the movie title by joining the **"M_CAST"**, **"PERSON"**, and **"MOVIE"** tables. The `TRIM` function ensures that any leading or trailing spaces in the **"Name"** field are removed, preventing empty strings from appearing as valid names. The `WHERE` clause filters out any records where the **"Name"** is null or empty after trimming. This should resolve the issue of empty **"Name"** values in your results.

   SELECT "Name"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."PERSON"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find the PID and Name of persons named 'Shahrukh Khan':**

   ```sql
   SELECT "PID", "Name"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."PERSON"
   WHERE "Name" ILIKE '%Shahrukh Khan%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List the first 100 entries from the "M_CAST" table to see actor and movie IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "PID", "MID"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."M_CAST"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve the first 100 movie titles from the "MOVIE" table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "MID", "title"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."MOVIE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Join "M_CAST" and "MOVIE" to list actors and the movies they have acted in:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "M_CAST"."PID", "M_CAST"."MID", "MOVIE"."title"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."M_CAST"
   JOIN "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."MOVIE" ON "M_CAST"."MID" = "MOVIE"."MID"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve actor names and the movies they have acted in by joining "M_CAST", "MOVIE", and "PERSON":**

   ```sql
   SELECT "PERSON"."Name", "MOVIE"."title"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."M_CAST"
   JOIN "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."PERSON" ON "M_CAST"."PID" = "PERSON"."PID"
   JOIN "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."MOVIE" ON "M_CAST"."MID" = "MOVIE"."MID"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find all movies that 'Shahrukh Khan' has acted in:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "MOVIE"."MID", "MOVIE"."title"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."M_CAST"
   JOIN "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."PERSON" ON "M_CAST"."PID" = "PERSON"."PID"

11. **List the top 100 actors who have acted in the most movies, along with their names:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "PERSON"."Name", COUNT(DISTINCT "M_CAST"."MID") AS "Movie_Count"
    FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."M_CAST"
    JOIN "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."PERSON" ON "M_CAST"."PID" = "PERSON"."PID"
    GROUP BY "PERSON"."Name"
    ORDER BY "Movie_Count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Get the list of movies along with the count of actors in each movie:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "MOVIE"."title", COUNT(DISTINCT "M_CAST"."PID") AS "Actor_Count"
    FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."M_CAST"
    JOIN "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."MOVIE" ON "M_CAST"."MID" = "MOVIE"."MID"
    GROUP BY "MOVIE"."title"
    ORDER BY "Actor_Count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the data in the relevant tables and help in understanding the relationships between actors, movies, and casts. They also utilize various SQL techniques like `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and subqueries to delve deeper into the dataset, without directly answering the task.Query:

Task: Find out how many actors have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2? This means they acted in a film with someone who acted with Shahrukh Khan, but not directly with him.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Shahrukh_number,Number_of_actors
2,number:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This table shows the number of actors who have a Shahrukh number of 2, meaning they have acted in a film with someone who has acted with Shahrukh Khan, but have not acted directly with him..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'DB_IMDB': {'DB_IMDB': ['COUNTRY', 'GENRE', 'LANGUAGE', 'LOCATION', 'MOVIE', 'M_CAST', 'M_COUNTRY', 'M_DIRECTOR', 'M_GENRE', 'M_LANGUAGE', 'M_LOCATION', 'M_PRODUCER', 'PERSON']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
