After comparing the SQL queries and results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL file because:

1. **Complete Date Range Coverage**: `1result.sql` includes data from **all days between June 1, 2017, and July 31, 2017**. The `all_sessions` CTE uses `UNION ALL` to combine data from every day's table (`GA_SESSIONS_YYYYMMDD`), ensuring the entire date range is covered. This is crucial to accurately reflect the analysis period specified in the task.

2. **Correct Filtering of Sessions with Non-Null Pageviews**: In the `session_data` CTE, it filters sessions to include only those where `"totals":"pageviews"` is not null:
   ```sql
   WHERE "totals":"pageviews" IS NOT NULL
   ```
   This aligns with the task requirement to consider only sessions with non-null pageviews.

3. **Accurate Session Classification**: It correctly classifies each session as 'purchase' if it has at least one transaction, or 'non_purchase' otherwise:
   ```sql
   CASE
     WHEN TRY_TO_NUMBER("totals":"transactions"::STRING) >= 1 THEN 'purchase'
     ELSE 'non_purchase'
   END AS "session_type",
   ```
   This ensures that sessions are categorized based on the presence of transactions.

4. **Aggregation of Total Pageviews per Visitor under Each Classification**: The `visitor_monthly_pageviews` CTE sums each visitor's total pageviews under each classification and month:
   ```sql
   SUM("pageviews") AS total_pageviews
   ```
   This aligns with the task's requirement to sum pageviews per visitor per classification per month.

5. **Calculation of Average Pageviews per Visitor for Each Group**: The final `SELECT` statement computes the average pageviews per visitor for both 'purchase' and 'non_purchase' groups in each month, presenting the results side by side:
   ```sql
   ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN "session_type" = 'purchase' THEN total_pageviews END), 4) AS "Average_Pageviews_Purchase",
   ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN "session_type" = 'non_purchase' THEN total_pageviews END), 4) AS "Average_Pageviews_Non_Purchase"
   ```
   This directly addresses the task's objective.

6. **Correct Presentation of Results**: The results are ordered by month and display both 'purchase' and 'non_purchase' average pageviews, as required.

In contrast, **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** have limitations:

- They do **not include data from all dates** in the specified range, potentially missing important sessions and skewing the results.
- The months in `0result.sql` are incorrectly formatted (e.g., "F06onth 2017" instead of "June 2017"), indicating a potential issue in date handling.

Therefore, considering the accurate data coverage and proper implementation of the task requirements, the correct SQL file is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```
