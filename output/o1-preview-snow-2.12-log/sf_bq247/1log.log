15. **Get the publication numbers and abstracts for a specific family_id (e.g., '12345678').**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      p."publication_number",
      a."abstract"
    FROM
      PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS p
      JOIN PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.ABS_AND_EMB a ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
    WHERE
      p."family_id" = '12345678'
      AND a."abstract" IS NOT NULL
      AND a."abstract" <> ''
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the data by selecting relevant columns, applying necessary conditions, and joining tables to understand the relationships between publications, family IDs, and abstracts. Each query utilizes different SQL clauses and functions to provide insight into the data structure and content without directly solving the initial task.Query:
SELECT
     "family_id"
   FROM
     PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 100;

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: From the publications dataset, first identify the top six families with the most publications whose family_id is not '-1'. Then, using the abs_and_emb table (joined on publication_number), provide each of those families’ IDs alongside every non-empty abstract associated with their publications.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the top six families with the most publications where `family_id` is not '-1', we first count the number of publications per family in the `PUBLICATIONS` table, exclude those with `family_id = '-1'`, and select the top six families. Then, we join these results with the `ABS_AND_EMB` table on `publication_number` to retrieve the non-empty abstracts associated with their publications.

Here is the list of these families' IDs alongside every non-empty abstract associated with their publications:

```csv
family_id,abstract
family_id1:str,abstract1:str
family_id1:str,abstract2:str
family_id1:str,abstract3:str

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'PATENTS_GOOGLE': {'PATENTS_GOOGLE': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS', 'ABS_AND_EMB']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
