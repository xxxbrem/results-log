US-5596790-A,"The invention relates to a hose clamp (1) with a clamp body (3) which encloses a hose end (2) essentially in a ring with overlapping end areas (4,5). In the clamped state, the clamp body has an initial diameter, and using a clamping tool, the clamp body (3) can be spread to a second, larger diameter against its own spring force. In a first end area (4), there is a catch projection (6) which is offset rearward relative to its outer front edge (7) and which can be engaged with a second end area (5) of the clamp body (3) to achieve the spread state. The second end area (5) has a longitudinally extended recess (8) which holds first end area (4) which is correspondingly narrower. To be able to easily spread and release hose clamp (1), in a way which enables the attainment of the spread state is to be easily recognizable, a catch projection (6) is provided on the first end area (4,) in the spread state of the clamp body, rests against the front edge (10) of the second end area (5)."
US-5614871-A,"There is disclosed a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit capable of being operated at low power supply voltages and accomplishing low electric power consumption. The circuit permits the duty cycle to be controlled well. The circuit is capable of operating at high speeds. The circuit comprises a first and a second dynamic latch circuits producing oscillation output. Each dynamic latch circuit consists of a series combination of a P-channel MOS transistor and an N-channel MOS transistor. An output terminal is connected to the junction of these two transistors. The output from each latch circuit is inverted according to the voltage at the gate of each MOS transistor and dynamically latches the state of the output. This inversion is performed by turning on the MOS transistors by first and second capacitive elements and by first and second comparator circuits. The capacitive elements are charged and discharged by the outputs from the dynamic latch circuits. Voltages for charging the capacitive elements are applied to the comparator circuits. The switching operation is performed at a higher speed than where a flop-flop is used. Consequently, the oscillation frequency is improved. These MOS transistors do not simultaneously conduct and so electric currents passing through the transistors can be suppressed. Since the timing at which the inversion is made is determined by the charging rates of the capacitive elements, the duty cycle can be controlled well."
US-5635026-A,"Chemical (typically kraft) pulp having enhanced intrinsic fiber strength and bleachability compared to pulp produced using conventional or modified kraft cooking is produced by using high alkali and/or pH cooking. After being impregnated with a first cooking liquor (e.g. white liquor) having low effective alkali, the first liquor is extracted from the pulp, and it is impregnated with a second cooking liquor having an effective alkali concentration of at least 25 g/l and cooked at cooking temperature (e.g. 140°-190° C.) to produce a spent second cooking liquor having a residual effective alkali concentration of at least about 15 g/l, which is then extracted from the pulp. The spent second liquor may be used to preheat incoming white liquor, and then flashed and used as the first liquor. The pH of the first liquor is typically less than about 13.0, and the residual pH of the spent second liquor is about 13.0 or more."

"In a physical memory space, a pinned memory region is defined at one end of the space and a non-pinned region is defined at the other end of the space. A free region is between the pinned and non-pinned regions. Requests for pinned memory allocations are satisfied either by using holes in the pinned region or by appending the requested block to the end of the pinned region in the free region. The free region may be widened to accommodate pinned memory allocations. Requests for non-pinned memory allocations are satisfied by holes in the non-pinned region, by being appended to the non-pinned region in the free region or by filling holes in the pinned region, in that order."

2025-02-12 21:51:25 - root - INFO - It appears that the error you're encountering is due to the column `"publication_number_formatted"` not being recognized in the `"PUBLICATIONS"` table. According to the DDL you provided, the `"PUBLICATIONS"` table should include a column named `"publication_number_formatted"`. However, the error suggests that this column may not exist in your actual dataset, or there might be a typo.

**Here's how you can resolve this issue:**

1. **Use `"publication_number"` Instead of `"publication_number_formatted"`:**

   Since `"publication_number_formatted"` is not recognized, let's use the `"publication_number"` column for joining the tables.

2. **Handle Formatting Differences Between Publication Numbers:**

   The `"publication_number"` in the `"PUBLICATIONS"` table and the `"publication_number"` in the `"ABS_AND_EMB"` table might have different formats (e.g., special characters like hyphens or prefixes like country codes). To ensure a correct join, we can remove non-alphanumeric characters from the publication numbers using `REGEXP_REPLACE`.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT p."family_id", a."title", a."abstract"
FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p
JOIN "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
  ON REGEXP_REPLACE(p."publication_number", '[^A-Za-z0-9]', '') = REGEXP_REPLACE(a."publication_number", '[^A-Za-z0-9]', '')
WHERE p."family_id" = 'YOUR_FAMILY_ID'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`REGEXP_REPLACE(p."publication_number", '[^A-Za-z0-9]', '')`:**
  This expression removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the `publication_number` in the `PUBLICATIONS` table.
  
- **`REGEXP_REPLACE(a."publication_number", '[^A-Za-z0-9]', '')`:**
  This does the same for the `publication_number` in the `ABS_AND_EMB` table.

- **Joining the Cleaned Publication Numbers:**
  By cleaning both publication numbers, we increase the chances of matching records that may have different formatting.

- **`WHERE p."family_id" = 'YOUR_FAMILY_ID'`:**
  Replace `'YOUR_FAMILY_ID'` with one of the top six family IDs you identified earlier (e.g., `'6140325'`, `'41059586'`, `'49877054'`, `'33135106'`, `'22795013'`, `'53408550'`).

**Example with a Specific Family ID:**

```sql
SELECT p."family_id", a."title", a."abstract"
FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p
JOIN "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
  ON REGEXP_REPLACE(p."publication_number", '[^A-Za-z0-9]', '') = REGEXP_REPLACE(a."publication_number", '[^A-Za-z0-9]', '')
WHERE p."family_id" = '6140325'
LIMIT 100;
```

This query will retrieve the family ID, title, and abstract for all publications in family `'6140325'` that have non-empty abstracts.

**Note:**

- Ensure that all column names are correctly spelled and match the columns in your actual tables.
- If you continue to receive errors, double-check that the columns exist in your tables by running a simple `SELECT` query:

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS"
  LIMIT 1;
  ```

  This will show you all the column names in the `"PUBLICATIONS"` table.

- If the column `"publication_number_formatted"` does not exist, you can confirm by checking the table schema or DDL.

**Conclusion:**

By adjusting the SQL query to account for the potential absence of `"publication_number_formatted"` and handling formatting differences in the publication numbers, you should be able to retrieve the desired data without encountering errors.

---

**Final SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT p."family_id", a."title", a."abstract"
FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p
JOIN "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
  ON REGEXP_REPLACE(p."publication_number", '[^A-Za-z0-9]', '') = REGEXP_REPLACE(a."publication_number", '[^A-Za-z0-9]', '')
WHERE p."family_id" IN ('6140325', '41059586', '49877054', '33135106', '22795013', '53408550')
  AND a."abstract" IS NOT NULL
  AND a."abstract" != ''
LIMIT 100;
```

**This query will:**

- Retrieve the family IDs alongside every non-empty abstract associated with the publications of the top six families with the most publications (excluding `family_id = '-1'`).
- Ensure that you get the correct matches by normalizing the publication numbers.

---

**Sample Output Format:**

```csv
family_id,title,abstract
6140325,Title1,Abstract1
6140325,Title2,Abstract2
41059586,Title3,Abstract3
41059586,Title4,Abstract4
...
```

In the clamped state, the clamp body has an initial diameter, and using a clamping tool, the clamp body (3) can be spread to a second, larger diameter against its own spring force. In a first end area (4), there is a catch projection (6) which is offset rearward relative to its outer front edge (7) and which can be engaged with a second end area (5) of the clamp body (3) to achieve the spread state. The second end area (5) has a longitudinally extended recess (8) which holds first end area (4) which is correspondingly narrower. To be able to easily spread and release hose clamp (1), in a way which enables the attainment of the spread state is to be easily recognizable, a catch projection (6) is provided on the first end area (4,) in the spread state of the clamp body, rests against the front edge (10) of the second end area (5)."
26334804,"There is disclosed a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit capable of being operated at low power supply voltages and accomplishing low electric power consumption. The circuit permits the duty cycle to be controlled well. The circuit is capable of operating at high speeds. The circuit comprises a first and a second dynamic latch circuits producing oscillation output. Each dynamic latch circuit consists of a series combination of a P-channel MOS transistor and an N-channel MOS transistor. An output terminal is connected to the junction of these two transistors. The output from each latch circuit is inverted according to the voltage at the gate of each MOS transistor and dynamically latches the state of the output. This inversion is performed by turning on the MOS transistors by first and second capacitive elements and by first and second comparator circuits. The capacitive elements are charged and discharged by the outputs from the dynamic latch circuits. Voltages for charging the capacitive elements are applied to the comparator circuits. The switching operation is performed at a higher speed than where a flop-flop is used. Consequently, the oscillation frequency is improved. These MOS transistors do not simultaneously conduct and so electric currents passing through the transistors can be suppressed. Since the timing at which the inversion is made is determined by the charging rates of the capacitive elements, the duty cycle can be controlled well."

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'PATENTS_GOOGLE': {'PATENTS_GOOGLE': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS', 'ABS_AND_EMB']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to analyze the `PUBLICATIONS` and `ABS_AND_EMB` tables from the `PATENTS_GOOGLE` database and schema.

**Relevant tables and columns:**

- **Table:** `"PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS"`
  - `"family_id"`: Used to group publications into patent families; we'll identify the top six families with the most publications.
  - `"publication_number"`: Unique identifier for each publication; used to join with the `ABS_AND_EMB` table.
- **Table:** `"PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB"`
  - `"publication_number"`: Used to join with the `PUBLICATIONS` table.
  - `"abstract"`: Contains the abstract text for each publication; we'll retrieve non-empty abstracts associated with the top families.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Only consider records where `"family_id"` is not `'-1'`.
- Identify the top six families based on the count of publications.
- Retrieve non-empty abstracts (`"abstract"` is not NULL or empty).

Below are SQL queries to explore and understand the data:

1. **List distinct `family_id`s where `family_id` is not '-1'**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "family_id"
   FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS"
   WHERE "family_id" != '-1'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the number of publications per family excluding `family_id` '-1'**

   ```sql
   SELECT "family_id", COUNT(*) AS "publication_count"
   FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS"
   WHERE "family_id" != '-1'
   GROUP BY "family_id"
   ORDER BY "publication_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Identify the top six families with the most publications**

   ```sql
   SELECT "family_id", COUNT(*) AS "publication_count"
   FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS"
   WHERE "family_id" != '-1'
   GROUP BY "family_id"
   ORDER BY "publication_count" DESC
   LIMIT 6;
   ```

4. **List publication numbers for a specific family ID**

   Replace `'FAMILY_ID_HERE'` with an actual family ID from the top six families.

   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number"
   FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS"
   WHERE "family_id" = 'FAMILY_ID_HERE'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Join `PUBLICATIONS` and `ABS_AND_EMB` tables on `publication_number`**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."publication_number", a."abstract"
   FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p
   JOIN "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
     ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve abstracts for publications belonging to a specific family**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."family_id", a."abstract"
   FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p
   JOIN "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
     ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
   WHERE p."family_id" = 'FAMILY_ID_HERE'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find non-empty abstracts for publications of a specific family**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."family_id", a."abstract"
   FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p
   JOIN "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
     ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
   WHERE p."family_id" = 'FAMILY_ID_HERE' 
     AND a."abstract" IS NOT NULL 
     AND a."abstract" != ''
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count the number of non-empty abstracts per family**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."family_id", COUNT(a."abstract") AS "non_empty_abstracts"
   FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p
   JOIN "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
     ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
   WHERE p."family_id" != '-1' 
     AND a."abstract" IS NOT NULL 
     AND a."abstract" != ''
   GROUP BY p."family_id"
   ORDER BY "non_empty_abstracts" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve all non-empty abstracts for the top six families**

   First, identify the top six family IDs (e.g., `'FAMILY_ID_1'`, `'FAMILY_ID_2'`, ..., `'FAMILY_ID_6'`).

   ```sql
   SELECT p."family_id", a."abstract"
   FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p
   JOIN "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
     ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
   WHERE p."family_id" IN ('FAMILY_ID_1', 'FAMILY_ID_2', 'FAMILY_ID_3', 'FAMILY_ID_4', 'FAMILY_ID_5', 'FAMILY_ID_6')
     AND a."abstract" IS NOT NULL 
     AND a."abstract" != ''
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Explore the distribution of the `abstract_translated` flag**

    ```sql
    SELECT a."abstract_translated", COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
    GROUP BY a."abstract_translated"
    ORDER BY "count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **View sample abstracts from the `ABS_AND_EMB` table**

    ```sql
    SELECT a."abstract"
    FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
    WHERE a."abstract" IS NOT NULL 
      AND a."abstract" != ''
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **List publication numbers and their corresponding family IDs**

    ```sql
    SELECT "publication_number", "family_id"
    FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Retrieve publications where the abstract is translated**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."publication_number", a."abstract", a."abstract_translated"
    FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p
    JOIN "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
      ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
    WHERE a."abstract_translated" = TRUE
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Find the languages of abstracts in the `PUBLICATIONS` table**

    Assuming `"abstract_localized"` contains language information in a VARIANT column.

    ```sql
    SELECT p."publication_number", f.value:"language"::STRING AS "language"
    FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p,
         LATERAL FLATTEN(input => p."abstract_localized") f
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Extract abstract text from the `abstract_localized` VARIANT column**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."publication_number", f.value:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
    FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p,
         LATERAL FLATTEN(input => p."abstract_localized") f
    WHERE f.value:"text" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

16. **Compare abstract lengths to find unusually long abstracts**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."publication_number", LENGTH(a."abstract") AS "abstract_length"
    FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p
    JOIN "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
      ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
    WHERE a."abstract" IS NOT NULL 
      AND a."abstract" != ''
    ORDER BY "abstract_length" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

17. **Identify publications without abstracts in the `ABS_AND_EMB` table**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."publication_number"
    FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p
    LEFT JOIN "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
      ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
    WHERE a."abstract" IS NULL 
      OR a."abstract" = ''
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

18. **Count total number of publications per family including those with `family_id` '-1'**

    ```sql
    SELECT "family_id", COUNT(*) AS "publication_count"
    FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS"
    GROUP BY "family_id"
    ORDER BY "publication_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

19. **Retrieve `title` and `abstract` for publications in a specific family**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."family_id", a."title", a."abstract"
    FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PUBLICATIONS" p
    JOIN "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a
      ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
    WHERE p."family_id" = 'FAMILY_ID_HERE'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

20. **Explore the structure of the `cpc` VARIANT column in `ABS_AND_EMB`**

    ```sql
    SELECT a."publication_number", f.value::STRING AS "cpc_code"
    FROM "PATENTS_GOOGLE"."PATENTS_GOOGLE"."ABS_AND_EMB" a,
         LATERAL FLATTEN(input => a."cpc") f
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries provide a deeper understanding of the data and help in preparing to fulfill the task of identifying the top six families with the most publications and retrieving the associated non-empty abstracts.Query:

25389838,"In a physical memory space, a pinned memory region is defined at one end of the space and a non-pinned region is defined at the other end of the space. A free region is between the pinned and non-pinned regions. Requests for pinned memory allocations are satisfied either by using holes in the pinned region or by appending the requested block to the end of the pinned region in the free region. The free region may be widened to accommodate pinned memory allocations.

US-5614871-A,"There is disclosed a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit capable of being operated at low power supply voltages and accomplishing low electric power consumption. The circuit permits the duty cycle to be controlled well. The circuit is capable of operating at high speeds. The circuit comprises a first and a second dynamic latch circuits producing oscillation output. Each dynamic latch circuit consists of a series combination of a P-channel MOS transistor and an N-channel MOS transistor. An output terminal is connected to the junction of these two transistors. The output from each latch circuit is inverted according to the voltage at the gate of each MOS transistor and dynamically latches the state of the output. This inversion is performed by turning on the MOS transistors by first and second capacitive elements and by first and second comparator circuits. The capacitive elements are charged and discharged by the outputs from the dynamic latch circuits. Voltages for charging the capacitive elements are applied to the comparator circuits. The switching operation is performed at a higher speed than where a flop-flop is used. Consequently, the oscillation frequency is improved. These MOS transistors do not simultaneously conduct and so electric currents passing through the transistors can be suppressed. Since the timing at which the inversion is made is determined by the charging rates of the capacitive elements, the duty cycle can be controlled well."

22733415,"A basecoat for a nonstick coating system wherein the basecoat comprises a high temperature binder resin, preferably polyamideimide resin, and a filamentary powder, preferably a nickel powder, which is combined with the high temperature binder to yield a spongelike coating which with appropriate application has a rough surface and an internal structure containing interlocking channels. These channels may be impregnated by subsequently applied coatings, especially nonstick fluoropolymer coatings."
23802347,"An efficient distributed queueing random access method and network system provide, in the medium access control layer in networks with broadcast channels, for conserving reservation bandwidth and concomitantly providing immediate transmission access, wherein, prior to receiving a first time slot, a plurality of reservation slot parameters are initialized by a user."
6533792,"The invention relates to a hose clamp (1) with a clamp body (3) which encloses a hose end (2) essentially in a ring with overlapping end areas (4,5). In the clamped state, the clamp body has an initial diameter, and using a clamping tool, the clamp body (3) can be spread to a second, larger diameter against its own spring force. In a first end area (4), there is a catch projection (6) which is offset rearward relative to its outer front edge (7) and which can be engaged with a second end area (5) of the clamp body (3) to achieve the spread state. The second end area (5) has a longitudinally extended recess (8) which holds first end area (4) which is correspondingly narrower. To be able to easily spread and release hose clamp (1), in a way which enables the attainment of the spread state is to be easily recognizable, a catch projection (6) is provided on the first end area (4,) in the spread state of the clamp body, rests against the front edge (10) of the second end area (5)."
26334804,"There is disclosed a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit capable of being operated at low power supply voltages and accomplishing low electric power consumption. The circuit permits the duty cycle to be controlled well. The circuit is capable of operating at high speeds. The circuit comprises a first and a second dynamic latch circuits producing oscillation output. Each dynamic latch circuit consists of a series combination of a P-channel MOS transistor and an N-channel MOS transistor. An output terminal is connected to the junction of these two transistors. The output from each latch circuit is inverted according to the voltage at the gate of each MOS transistor and dynamically latches the state of the output. This inversion is performed by turning on the MOS transistors by first and second capacitive elements and by first and second comparator circuits. The capacitive elements are charged and discharged by the outputs from the dynamic latch circuits. Voltages for charging the capacitive elements are applied to the comparator circuits. The switching operation is performed at a higher speed than where a flop-flop is used. Consequently, the oscillation frequency is improved. These MOS transistors do not simultaneously conduct and so electric currents passing through the transistors can be suppressed. Since the timing at which the inversion is made is determined by the charging rates of the capacitive elements, the duty cycle can be controlled well."
24228375,"Chemical (typically kraft) pulp having enhanced intrinsic fiber strength and bleachability compared to pulp produced using conventional or modified kraft cooking is produced by using high alkali and/or pH cooking. After being impregnated with a first cooking liquor (e.g. white liquor) having low effective alkali, the first liquor is extracted from the pulp, and it is impregnated with a second cooking liquor having an effective alkali concentration of at least 25 g/l and cooked at cooking temperature (e.g. 140°-190° C.) to produce a spent second cooking liquor having a residual effective alkali concentration of at least about 15 g/l, which is then extracted from the pulp. The spent second liquor may be used to preheat incoming white liquor, and then flashed and used as the first liquor. The pH of the first liquor is typically less than about 13.0, and the residual pH of the spent second liquor is about 13.0 or more."
21707604,"The subject invention, provides arylhydrazone compounds having the Formula 1: ##STR1## wherein A and B are independently aryl or heteroaryl and A and B independently are substituted with at least one group selected from alkyl, halogen, CN, COOR 7 , NR 7  R 8 , CONR 7  R 8 , NO 2 , SR 7 , SOR 7 , SO 2  R 7 , NHCOR 7 , NHSO 2  R 7 , OR 7 , hydroxyalkyl, and aminoalkyl. The compounds of this invention are useful for treating a wide variety of bacterial infections, including diseases of the skin, e.g., acne and skin ulcers, gastroenteritis, colitis, meningitis, keratinitis, conjunctivitis, diseases of the urinary and genital tracts, etc."

Task: From the publications dataset, first identify the top six families with the most publications whose family_id is not '-1'. Then, using the abs_and_emb table (joined on publication_number), provide each of those families’ IDs alongside every non-empty abstract associated with their publications.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the top six families with the most publications where `family_id` is not '-1', we first count the number of publications per family in the `PUBLICATIONS` table, exclude those with `family_id = '-1'`, and select the top six families. Then, we join these results with the `ABS_AND_EMB` table on `publication_number` to retrieve the non-empty abstracts associated with their publications.

Here is the list of these families' IDs alongside every non-empty abstract associated with their publications:

```csv
family_id,abstract
family_id1:str,abstract1:str
family_id1:str,abstract2:str
family_id1:str,abstract3:str

```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'PATENTS_GOOGLE': {'PATENTS_GOOGLE': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS', 'ABS_AND_EMB']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
