   - **"member_gender"**: Gender of the member; used for reporting and to exclude trips where it's not specified.

   **Conditions:**
   - Exclude trips where "start_station_name", "member_birth_year", or "member_gender" is not specified (`IS NOT NULL`).
   - Filter trips that started between July 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017 (using appropriate date conversion on "start_date").
   - Order by "duration_sec" in descending order to find the longest trips.

2. **Table:** `SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO`

   - **"station_id"**: Used to join with "start_station_id" from trips to get station details.
   - **"name"**: Name of the station; confirms station details.
   - **"region_id"**: Used to join with regions to get the region name.

3. **Table:** `SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_REGIONS`

   - **"region_id"**: Used to join with station info to get the region name.
   - **"name"**: The name of the region; required for reporting.

Task: Could you provide the details of the top 5 longest bike share trips that started between July 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017, including the trip ID, duration in seconds, start date, start station name, route (derived from start station name to end station name), bike number, subscriber type, member's birth year, the member's current age (calculated using the current year), an age classification based on whether the member is younger than 40, between 40 and 60, or older than 60, the member's gender, and the name of the region of the start station? Please exclude any trips where the start station name, member's birth year, or member's gender is not specified.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv

(Attention: answer in five rows)
```

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the details of the top 5 longest bike share trips that started between July 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017. Each row represents one trip and includes the following information:

- **trip_id**: The unique identifier for the trip (string).
- **duration_sec**: The duration of the trip in seconds (integer).
- **start_date**: The date when the trip started (date).
- **start_station_name**: The name of the station where the trip began (string).
- **route**: The route taken during the trip, derived from the start station name to the end station name, formatted as "start_station_name - end_station_name" (string).
- **bike_number**: The identifier of the bike used for the trip (integer).
- **subscriber_type**: The type of subscriber (e.g., "Subscriber" or "Customer") (string).
- **member_birth_year**: The birth year of the member (integer).
- **member_current_age**: The current age of the member, calculated using the current year (integer).
- **age_classification**: Classification based on the member's age:
  - 'Young (<40 Y.O)' for members younger than 40
  - 'Adult (40-60 Y.O)' for members between 40 and 60
  - 'Senior Adult (>60 Y.O)' for members older than 60 (string).
- **member_gender**: The gender of the member (string).
- **region_name**: The name of the region where the start station is located (string).

Trips where the start station name, member's birth year, or member's gender were not specified have been excluded from this list. The trips are ordered by their duration in descending order, showcasing the top 5 longest trips during the specified period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS': {'SAN_FRANCISCO_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATION_STATUS', 'BIKESHARE_REGIONS', 'BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_FILM_LOCATIONS': ['FILM_LOCATIONS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS': ['BOUNDARIES'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_SFFD_SERVICE_CALLS': ['SFFD_SERVICE_CALLS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_SFPD_INCIDENTS': ['SFPD_INCIDENTS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_TRANSIT_MUNI': ['CALENDAR', 'FARES', 'SHAPES', 'VEHICLE_MONITORING', 'STOPS', 'STOP_TIMES', 'TRIPS', 'ROUTES', 'STOP_MONITORING'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_TREES': ['STREET_TREES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the details of the top 5 longest bike share trips that started between July 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017. Each row represents one trip and includes the following information:

- **trip_id**: The unique identifier for the trip (string).
- **duration_sec**: The duration of the trip in seconds (integer).
- **start_date**: The date when the trip started (date).
- **start_station_name**: The name of the station where the trip began (string).
- **route**: The route taken during the trip, derived from the start station name to the end station name, formatted as "start_station_name - end_station_name" (string).
- **bike_number**: The identifier of the bike used for the trip (integer).
- **subscriber_type**: The type of subscriber (e.g., "Subscriber" or "Customer") (string).
- **member_birth_year**: The birth year of the member (integer).
- **member_current_age**: The current age of the member, calculated using the current year (integer).
- **age_classification**: Classification based on the member's age:
  - 'Young (<40 Y.O)' for members younger than 40
  - 'Adult (40-60 Y.O)' for members between 40 and 60
  - 'Senior Adult (>60 Y.O)' for members older than 60 (string).
- **member_gender**: The gender of the member (string).
- **region_name**: The name of the region where the start station is located (string).

Trips where the start station name, member's birth year, or member's gender were not specified have been excluded from this list. The trips are ordered by their duration in descending order, showcasing the top 5 longest trips during the specified period. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
