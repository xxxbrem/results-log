Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **SOLUTION**

   - `"name"`: Represents the problem name. Used to identify problems.
   - `"version"`: Version number of the solution. Used to match versions in other tables.

2. **MODEL_SCORE**

   - `"name"`: Represents the problem name. Used to identify problems.
   - `"version"`: Version number of the model score. Used to match versions in other tables.
   - `"step"`: Step number. Used to filter steps 1, 2, and 3.
   - `"model"`: Model name (e.g., "Stack" or other models). Used to identify "Stack" and non-"Stack" models.
   - `"test_score"`: Test score of the model. Used to compare performance between models.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filtering for steps 1, 2, and 3: `WHERE "step" IN (1, 2, 3)`
- Excluding steps 1, 2, and 3: `WHERE "step" NOT IN (1, 2, 3)`
- Filtering for "Stack" models: `WHERE "model" = 'Stack'`
- Filtering for non-"Stack" models: `WHERE "model" != 'Stack'`
- Comparing test scores between models
- Grouping by problem name to count occurrences

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Select distinct problem names from the SOLUTION table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."SOLUTION"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count total occurrences of each problem in the SOLUTION table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", COUNT(*) AS "total_occurrences"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."SOLUTION"
   GROUP BY "name"
   ORDER BY "total_occurrences" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select distinct steps from the MODEL_SCORE table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "step"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count occurrences of each problem in MODEL_SCORE for steps 1, 2, and 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", COUNT(*) AS "occurrences_steps_1_3"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
   WHERE "step" IN (1, 2, 3)
   GROUP BY "name"
   ORDER BY "occurrences_steps_1_3" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count occurrences of each problem in MODEL_SCORE for steps other than 1, 2, and 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", COUNT(*) AS "occurrences_other_steps"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
   WHERE "step" NOT IN (1, 2, 3)
   GROUP BY "name"
   ORDER BY "occurrences_other_steps" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List all models and their test scores for each problem in steps 1, 2, and 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "step", "model", "test_score"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
   WHERE "step" IN (1, 2, 3)
   ORDER BY "name", "version", "step", "model"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get the maximum test_score for non-"Stack" models per problem, version, and step in steps 1, 2, and 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
   WHERE "step" IN (1, 2, 3) AND "model" != 'Stack'
   GROUP BY "name", "version", "step"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get the test_score for "Stack" models per problem, version, and step in steps 1, 2, and 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score" AS "stack_score"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
   WHERE "step" IN (1, 2, 3) AND "model" = 'Stack'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Compare "Stack" model's test_score with the maximum non-"Stack" test_score per problem, version, and step:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
       ms_stack."name",
       ms_stack."version",
       ms_stack."step",
       ms_stack."test_score" AS "stack_score",
       ms_non_stack."max_non_stack_score"
   FROM
       (
           SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score"
           FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
           WHERE "step" IN (1, 2, 3) AND "model" = 'Stack'
       ) ms_stack
   JOIN
       (
           SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
           FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
           WHERE "step" IN (1, 2, 3) AND "model" != 'Stack'
           GROUP BY "name", "version", "step"
       ) ms_non_stack

   AND ms_stack."version" = ms_non_stack."version"
   AND ms_stack."step" = ms_non_stack."step"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Identify problems where the "Stack" model's test_score exceeds the maximum non-"Stack" test_score in steps 1, 2, and 3:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT ms_stack."name"
    FROM
        (
            SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score"
            FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
            WHERE "step" IN (1, 2, 3) AND "model" = 'Stack'
        ) ms_stack
    JOIN
        (
            SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
            FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
            WHERE "step" IN (1, 2, 3) AND "model" != 'Stack'
            GROUP BY "name", "version", "step"
        ) ms_non_stack
    ON ms_stack."name" = ms_non_stack."name"
    AND ms_stack."version" = ms_non_stack."version"
    AND ms_stack."step" = ms_non_stack."step"
    WHERE ms_stack."test_score" > ms_non_stack."max_non_stack_score"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help to understand the data and identify the problems that meet the specified criteria in the task. Each query explores different aspects of the data, such as counting occurrences, filtering by steps and models, and comparing test scores.

*Note: Please adjust the database, schema, and table names according to your actual database structure if they differ from "STACKING"."STACKING". Also, ensure that all column names are enclosed in double quotations as per Snowflake SQL syntax.*Query:

Task: Which problems exceed the total number of times they appear in the solution table when counting all occurrences, across steps 1, 2, and 3, where any non-"Stack" model's maximum test score is lower than the "Stack" model's test score for the same step and version?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the given task, the problems that meet the specified criteria are:

```csv
Problem_Name
name1:str
name2:str
...
```

**Explanation:**

We have listed the problems where:

- The total number of times they appear in the `SOLUTION` table across steps 1, 2, and 3 exceeds the total number of times they appear elsewhere in the `SOLUTION` table.
- For these problems, in any given step (1, 2, or 3) and version, the maximum `test_score` of any non-"Stack" model from the `MODEL_SCORE` table is lower than the `test_score` of the "Stack" model for the same step and version.

Since the actual data is not provided, the problem names are represented as placeholders (`name1`, `name2`, etc.)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'STACKING': {'STACKING': ['FEATURE_IMPORTANCE', 'PROBLEM', 'SOLUTION', 'MODEL', 'MODEL_IMPORTANCE', 'EDA', 'MODEL_SCORE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
