{'STACKING': {'STACKING': ['FEATURE_IMPORTANCE', 'PROBLEM', 'SOLUTION', 'MODEL', 'MODEL_IMPORTANCE', 'EDA', 'MODEL_SCORE']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **SOLUTION Table (`STACKING.STACKING.SOLUTION`)**
   - `"name"`: To identify the problem name associated with each solution.
   - `"version"`: To match solutions across different versions.

2. **MODEL_SCORE Table (`STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE`)**
   - `"name"`: To identify the problem name associated with each model score entry.
   - `"version"`: To match model scores across different versions.
   - `"step"`: To filter for steps 1, 2, and 3.
   - `"model"`: To differentiate between "Stack" and non-"Stack" models.
   - `"test_score"`: To obtain the test score for comparison.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filter for steps 1, 2, and 3 using `WHERE "step" IN (1, 2, 3)`.
- Identify "Stack" models using `WHERE "model" = 'Stack'` and non-"Stack" models with `WHERE "model" <> 'Stack'`.
- Compare the maximum `test_score` of non-"Stack" models with the `test_score` of the "Stack" model for the same `name`, `version`, and `step`.
- Count the number of occurrences of each `name` in the `SOLUTION` table.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct problem names from the `SOLUTION` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.SOLUTION
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the total number of times each problem appears in the `SOLUTION` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", COUNT(*) AS "total_occurrences"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.SOLUTION
   GROUP BY "name"
   ORDER BY "total_occurrences" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve records from the `MODEL_SCORE` table for steps 1, 2, and 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
   WHERE "step" IN (1, 2, 3)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get the test scores of "Stack" models for steps 1, 2, and 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
   WHERE "model" = 'Stack' AND "step" IN (1, 2, 3)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get the maximum test scores of non-"Stack" models grouped by `name`, `version`, and `step`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
   WHERE "model" <> 'Stack' AND "step" IN (1, 2, 3)
   GROUP BY "name", "version", "step"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Compare the "Stack" model's test score with the maximum non-"Stack" model's test score for each `name`, `version`, and `step`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s."name", s."version", s."step", s."test_score" AS "stack_test_score", ns."max_non_stack_score"
   FROM (
     SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score"
     FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
     WHERE "model" = 'Stack' AND "step" IN (1, 2, 3)
   ) s
   JOIN (
     SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
     FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
     WHERE "model" <> 'Stack' AND "step" IN (1, 2, 3)
     GROUP BY "name", "version", "step"
   ) ns
   ON s."name" = ns."name" AND s."version" = ns."version" AND s."step" = ns."step"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find instances where the "Stack" model's test score is higher than the maximum non-"Stack" model's test score:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s."name", s."version", s."step", s."test_score" AS "stack_test_score", ns."max_non_stack_score"
   FROM (
     SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score"
     FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
     WHERE "model" = 'Stack' AND "step" IN (1, 2, 3)
   ) s
   JOIN (
     SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
     FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
     WHERE "model" <> 'Stack' AND "step" IN (1, 2, 3)
     GROUP BY "name", "version", "step"
   ) ns
   ON s."name" = ns."name" AND s."version" = ns."version" AND s."step" = ns."step"
   WHERE s."test_score" > ns."max_non_stack_score"
   LIMIT 100;

8. **Count the number of times each problem meets the condition where the "Stack" model's test score is higher:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s."name", COUNT(*) AS "times_stack_higher"
   FROM (
     SELECT s."name", s."version", s."step", s."test_score", ns."max_non_stack_score"
     FROM (
       SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score"

       WHERE "model" = 'Stack' AND "step" IN (1, 2, 3)
     ) s
     JOIN (
       SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
       FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
       WHERE "model" <> 'Stack' AND "step" IN (1, 2, 3)

   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count the total occurrences of each problem in the `SOLUTION` table for steps 1, 2, and 3 (assuming step information can be derived or joined):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", COUNT(*) AS "total_occurrences_steps_1_3"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.SOLUTION
   WHERE "version" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "version"
     FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE

   )
   GROUP BY "name"
   ORDER BY "total_occurrences_steps_1_3" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List problems where the count of times the "Stack" model's test score is higher exceeds the total occurrences in the `SOLUTION` table:**

    ```sql

        WHERE s."test_score" > ns."max_non_stack_score"
      ) s
      GROUP BY s."name"
    ) th
    JOIN (
      SELECT "name", COUNT(*) AS "total_occurrences"
      FROM STACKING.STACKING.SOLUTION

Task: Which problems exceed the total number of times they appear in the solution table when counting all occurrences, across steps 1, 2, and 3, where any non-"Stack" model's maximum test score is lower than the "Stack" model's test score for the same step and version?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the given task, the problems that meet the specified criteria are:

```csv
Problem_Name
name1:str
name2:str
...
```

**Explanation:**

We have listed the problems where:

- The total number of times they appear in the `SOLUTION` table across steps 1, 2, and 3 exceeds the total number of times they appear elsewhere in the `SOLUTION` table.
- For these problems, in any given step (1, 2, or 3) and version, the maximum `test_score` of any non-"Stack" model from the `MODEL_SCORE` table is lower than the `test_score` of the "Stack" model for the same step and version.

Since the actual data is not provided, the problem names are represented as placeholders (`name1`, `name2`, etc.)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'STACKING': {'STACKING': ['FEATURE_IMPORTANCE', 'PROBLEM', 'SOLUTION', 'MODEL', 'MODEL_IMPORTANCE', 'EDA', 'MODEL_SCORE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Based on the given task, the problems that meet the specified criteria are:

```csv
Problem_Name
