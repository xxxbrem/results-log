**SQL Queries:**

1. **Get the total number of times each problem appears in the SOLUTION table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", COUNT(*) AS "total_occurrences"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."SOLUTION"
   GROUP BY "name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get the number of times each problem and version appear in the SOLUTION table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", COUNT(*) AS "occurrences"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."SOLUTION"
   GROUP BY "name", "version"
   ORDER BY "name", "version"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all distinct problems and versions in the MODEL_SCORE table for steps 1, 2, and 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name", "version"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
   WHERE "step" IN (1, 2, 3)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get the maximum test_score of non-"Stack" models for each problem, version, and step:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_test_score"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
   WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
   GROUP BY "name", "version", "step"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get the test_score of "Stack" models for each problem, version, and step:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score" AS "stack_test_score"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
   WHERE "model" = 'Stack'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find problems where "Stack" model's test_score exceeds the maximum test_score of non-"Stack" models for the same problem, version, and step:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s."name", s."version", s."step", s."test_score" AS "stack_test_score", ns."max_non_stack_test_score"
   FROM
     (SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score"
      FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
      WHERE "model" = 'Stack') s
   JOIN
     (SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_test_score"
      FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
      WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
      GROUP BY "name", "version", "step") ns
     ON s."name" = ns."name" AND s."version" = ns."version" AND s."step" = ns."step"
   WHERE s."test_score" > ns."max_non_stack_test_score"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count the number of times each problem appears in the SOLUTION table for steps 1, 2, and 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT sol."name", COUNT(*) AS "occurrences_in_steps_1_2_3"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."SOLUTION" sol
   JOIN "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE" ms
     ON sol."name" = ms."name" AND sol."version" = ms."version"
   WHERE ms."step" IN (1, 2, 3)
   GROUP BY sol."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count the number of times each problem appears in the SOLUTION table for steps other than 1, 2, and 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT sol."name", COUNT(*) AS "occurrences_in_other_steps"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."SOLUTION" sol
   JOIN "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE" ms
     ON sol."name" = ms."name" AND sol."version" = ms."version"
   WHERE ms."step" NOT IN (1, 2, 3)
   GROUP BY sol."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Identify problems where occurrences in steps 1, 2, and 3 exceed occurrences in other steps:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s_occurrences."name"
   FROM
     (SELECT sol."name", COUNT(*) AS "occurrences_in_steps_1_2_3"
      FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."SOLUTION" sol
      JOIN "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE" ms
        ON sol."name" = ms."name" AND sol."version" = ms."version"
      WHERE ms."step" IN (1, 2, 3)
      GROUP BY sol."name") s_occurrences
   LEFT JOIN
     (SELECT sol."name", COUNT(*) AS "occurrences_in_other_steps"
      FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."SOLUTION" sol
      JOIN "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE" ms
        ON sol."name" = ms."name" AND sol."version" = ms."version"
      WHERE ms."step" NOT IN (1, 2, 3)
      GROUP BY sol."name") o_occurrences
     ON s_occurrences."name" = o_occurrences."name"
   WHERE s_occurrences."occurrences_in_steps_1_2_3" > COALESCE(o_occurrences."occurrences_in_other_steps", 0)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List all models (excluding "Stack") for steps 1, 2, and 3 to understand available models:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "model"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL_SCORE"
    WHERE "model" != 'Stack' AND "step" IN (1, 2, 3)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Which problems exceed the total number of times they appear in the solution table when counting all occurrences, across steps 1, 2, and 3, where any non-"Stack" model's maximum test score is lower than the "Stack" model's test score for the same step and version?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the given task, the problems that meet the specified criteria are:

```csv
Problem_Name
name1:str
name2:str
...
```

**Explanation:**

We have listed the problems where:

- The total number of times they appear in the `SOLUTION` table across steps 1, 2, and 3 exceeds the total number of times they appear elsewhere in the `SOLUTION` table.
- For these problems, in any given step (1, 2, or 3) and version, the maximum `test_score` of any non-"Stack" model from the `MODEL_SCORE` table is lower than the `test_score` of the "Stack" model for the same step and version.

Since the actual data is not provided, the problem names are represented as placeholders (`name1`, `name2`, etc.)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'STACKING': {'STACKING': ['FEATURE_IMPORTANCE', 'PROBLEM', 'SOLUTION', 'MODEL', 'MODEL_IMPORTANCE', 'EDA', 'MODEL_SCORE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 11:44:16 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which problems exceed the total number of times they appear in the solution table when counting all occurrences, across steps 1, 2, and 3, where any non-"Stack" model's maximum test score is lower than the "Stack" model's test score for the same step and version?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Based on the given task, the problems that meet the specified criteria are:

```csv
Problem_Name
name1:str
name2:str
...
```

**Explanation:**

We have listed the problems where:

- The total number of times they appear in the `SOLUTION` table across steps 1, 2, and 3 exceeds the total number of times they appear elsewhere in the `SOLUTION` table.
- For these problems, in any given step (1, 2, or 3) and version, the maximum `test_score` of any non-"Stack" model from the `MODEL_SCORE` table is lower than the `test_score` of the "Stack" model for the same step and version.

Since the actual data is not provided, the problem names are represented as placeholders (`name1`, `name2`, etc.). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

**Explanation:**

We have listed the problems where:

- **Occurrence Condition:** The total number of times they appear in the `SOLUTION` table across steps 1, 2, and 3 exceeds the total number of times they appear in other steps.
- **Test Score Condition:** For these problems, in any given step (1, 2, or 3) and version, the `test_score` of the "Stack" model from the `MODEL_SCORE` table is higher than the maximum `test_score` of any non-"Stack" model for the same step and version.
