After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Artist Identification:** `1result.sql` uses the `ArtistId` to uniquely identify the artists, ensuring there is no ambiguity due to artists having the same name. This reduces the risk of incorrect joins or aggregations.

- **Proper Tie-Breaking Implementation:** The query correctly orders the artists by total sales and then by artist name in ascending order to break ties, as per the requirement.

- **Structured Approach with CTEs:** It utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for better readability and organization of the query. This makes it easier to follow the logic and verify each step.

- **Correct Calculations:** The query accurately calculates the total sales per artist, the amount each customer spent on the top-selling and lowest-selling artists, the average spending per customer for each artist, and finally, the absolute difference between these averages.

- **Consistent Results:** The result from `1result.sql` matches the expected output, providing an absolute difference of `4.1433`.

**Result:**
