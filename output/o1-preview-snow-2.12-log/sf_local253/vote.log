After carefully comparing the SQL scripts and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the most appropriate choice for the following reasons:

1. **Use of `TRY_TO_NUMBER` Function**: `1result.sql` utilizes the `TRY_TO_NUMBER` function to convert the cleaned salary values to numeric. This function returns `NULL` when the conversion fails instead of throwing an error, making it safer and more robust than using `CAST` or `TO_NUMBER` alone. This ensures that any non-convertible salary values do not cause the entire query to fail.

2. **Consistent and Accurate Data Cleaning**: The script effectively removes non-numeric characters from the "Salary" column using `REGEXP_REPLACE`, ensuring that only numeric values are used in calculations.

3. **Logical Structure and Clarity**: The SQL script is well-organized with clear Common Table Expressions (CTEs) that break down each step:
   - `cleaned_data`: Cleans and converts the salary data.
   - `avg_salary_state`: Calculates the average salary by company and location for the specified cities.
   - `avg_salary_country`: Calculates the average salary by company nationwide.
   - `ranked_companies`: Ranks companies within each city based on average salary.

4. **Correct Application of Window Functions**: The use of `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` correctly identifies the top 5 companies by average salary in each city.

5. **Accurate Final Output**: The final SELECT statement retrieves the required columns and orders the results appropriately, matching the task's requirements.

6. **Matching Results with the Task's Requirements**: The output displays the top 5 companies in each of the specified cities, along with their average salaries in the state and nationwide, as requested.

Given these points, **`1result.sql`** provides a comprehensive and error-tolerant solution that aligns perfectly with the task's objectives.
