**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS`

   - **"station_id"**: Potential usage - Unique identifier for each station; used to join with trips and identify stations.
   - **"status"**: Potential usage - Indicates whether a station is currently active; used to filter active stations.

2. **Table:** `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS`

   - **"start_station_id"**: Potential usage - Identifies the station where each trip starts; used to count trips per station.
   - **"trip_id"**: Potential usage - Unique identifier for each trip; used to count total trips.
   - **"duration_minutes"**: Potential usage - Duration of each trip in minutes; used to calculate average trip duration.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Filter active stations:** `"status" = 'active'`
- **Join condition:** `"start_station_id" = "station_id"`

---

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve all stations with their status:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get distinct station statuses to understand possible values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "status"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS;
   ```

3. **List trips with their starting station IDs and durations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "trip_id", "start_station_id", "duration_minutes"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count the number of trips starting at each station:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "start_station_id", COUNT(*) AS "total_trips"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
   GROUP BY "start_station_id"
   ORDER BY "total_trips" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List active stations and the total number of trips that start at each:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s."station_id", COUNT(t."trip_id") AS "total_trips"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s
   JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t ON s."station_id" = t."start_station_id"
   WHERE s."status" = 'active'
   GROUP BY s."station_id"
   ORDER BY "total_trips" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate the average trip duration for trips starting at each active station:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s."station_id", AVG(t."duration_minutes") AS "average_duration"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s
   JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t ON s."station_id" = t."start_station_id"
   WHERE s."status" = 'active'
   GROUP BY s."station_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get the total number of trips starting from active stations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(t."trip_id") AS "total_active_station_trips"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t
   JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s ON t."start_station_id" = s."station_id"
   WHERE s."status" = 'active';
   ```

8. **List active stations with total trips and average trip durations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s."station_id", COUNT(t."trip_id") AS "total_trips", AVG(t."duration_minutes") AS "average_duration"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s
   JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t ON s."station_id" = t."start_station_id"
   WHERE s."status" = 'active'
   GROUP BY s."station_id"
   ORDER BY "total_trips" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Compute the percentage of trips starting at each active station out of total trips from active stations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
       s."station_id",
       COUNT(t."trip_id") AS "total_trips",
       (COUNT(t."trip_id") * 100.0) / (
           SELECT COUNT(t2."trip_id")
           FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t2
           JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s2 ON t2."start_station_id" = s2."station_id"
           WHERE s2."status" = 'active'
       ) AS "percentage_of_total_trips"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s
   JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t ON s."station_id" = t."start_station_id"
   WHERE s."status" = 'active'
   GROUP BY s."station_id"
   ORDER BY "total_trips" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Identify the top 15 active stations based on total starting trips (including ties):**

    ```sql
    SELECT s."station_id", COUNT(t."trip_id") AS "total_trips"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s
    JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t ON s."station_id" = t."start_station_id"
    WHERE s."status" = 'active'
    GROUP BY s."station_id"
    HAVING COUNT(t."trip_id") >= (
        SELECT MIN(sub."total_trips")
        FROM (
            SELECT COUNT(t2."trip_id") AS "total_trips"
            FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s2
            JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t2 ON s2."station_id" = t2."start_station_id"
            WHERE s2."status" = 'active'
            GROUP BY s2."station_id"
            ORDER BY COUNT(t2."trip_id") DESC
            LIMIT 15
        ) sub
    )
    ORDER BY "total_trips" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Check for any trips starting from stations that are not active:**

    ```sql
    SELECT s."station_id", s."status", COUNT(t."trip_id") AS "total_trips"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s
    JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t ON s."station_id" = t."start_station_id"
    WHERE s."status" <> 'active'
    GROUP BY s."station_id", s."status"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **List trips that have a duration longer than 60 minutes starting from active stations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT t."trip_id", t."start_station_id", t."duration_minutes"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t
    JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s ON t."start_station_id" = s."station_id"
    WHERE s."status" = 'active' AND t."duration_minutes" > 60
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Retrieve the distribution of trip durations for trips starting at active stations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT t."duration_minutes", COUNT(*) AS "trip_count"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t
    JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s ON t."start_station_id" = s."station_id"
    WHERE s."status" = 'active'
    GROUP BY t."duration_minutes"
    ORDER BY t."duration_minutes"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Find the number of trips per subscriber type starting from active stations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT t."subscriber_type", COUNT(*) AS "trip_count"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t
    JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s ON t."start_station_id" = s."station_id"
    WHERE s."status" = 'active'
    GROUP BY t."subscriber_type"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **List all active stations without any trips starting from them:**

    ```sql
    SELECT s."station_id"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s
    LEFT JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t ON s."station_id" = t."start_station_id"
    WHERE s."status" = 'active' AND t."trip_id" IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the data related to active bike share stations and trips. They help in understanding the values within the relevant columns and set the groundwork for formulating the final answer to the task.Query:

Task: Among all stations that are currently active, identify those that rank in the top 15 (including ties) based on the total number of trips that start at each station. For each of these stations, return the station ID, the total number of starting trips, the percentage of those trips out of the overall starting trips from active stations, and the average trip duration in minutes. Order the results by the station’s rank.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Station_ID,Total_Starting_Trips,Percentage_of_Total_Starting_Trips,Average_Trip_Duration_Minutes
station_id1:int,total_trips1:int,percentage1:float,average_duration1:float
station_id2:int,total_trips2:int,percentage2:float,average_duration2:float
...
```

This table displays the top 15 active bike share stations ranked by the total number of trips that start at each station (including ties). For each station, the following information is provided:

- **Station_ID**: The unique identifier of the station.
- **Total_Starting_Trips**: The total number of trips that started at the station.
- **Percentage_of_Total_Starting_Trips**: The percentage of the station's starting trips out of all starting trips from active stations.
- **Average_Trip_Duration_Minutes**: The average duration of trips starting from the station, measured in minutes.

The results are ordered by the total number of starting trips, reflecting each station's rank among the top 15 active stations..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'AUSTIN': {'AUSTIN_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'AUSTIN_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_TRIPS', 'BIKESHARE_STATIONS'], 'AUSTIN_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'AUSTIN_INCIDENTS': ['INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2011', 'INCIDENTS_2016', 'INCIDENTS_2008', 'INCIDENTS_2009'], 'AUSTIN_WASTE': ['WASTE_AND_DIVERSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
