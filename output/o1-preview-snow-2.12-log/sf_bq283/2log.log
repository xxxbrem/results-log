Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS`
  - **"station_id"**: Unique identifier for each station; used to join with trips and identify stations.
  - **"status"**: Indicates whether a station is currently active; used to filter active stations.
  - **"name"**: Name of the station; useful for readability in results.
  
- **Table:** `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS`
  - **"start_station_id"**: Identifier of the station where a trip starts; used to count trips per station.
  - **"duration_minutes"**: Duration of a trip in minutes; used to calculate average trip duration.
  
**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Filter Active Stations:** `"status" = 'Active'` or check possible values in the "status" column to identify active stations.
- **Join Condition:** `"start_station_id" = "station_id"` to combine trip data with station data.
  
---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve All Stations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "name", "status"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List Distinct Station Statuses:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "status"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS;
   ```

3. **List All Active Stations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "name"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE "status" = 'Active'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count Trips Starting from Each Station:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "start_station_id", COUNT(*) AS "total_trips"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
   GROUP BY "start_station_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate Average Trip Duration per Station:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "start_station_id", AVG("duration_minutes") AS "average_duration"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
   GROUP BY "start_station_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join Trips with Station Names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT t."start_station_id", s."name", COUNT(*) AS "total_trips"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t
   JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s
     ON t."start_station_id" = s."station_id"
   GROUP BY t."start_station_id", s."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List Trips from Active Stations Only:**
   ```sql
   SELECT t."start_station_id", s."name", t."duration_minutes"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t
   JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s
     ON t."start_station_id" = s."station_id"
   WHERE s."status" = 'Active'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count Trips from Active Stations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT t."start_station_id", COUNT(*) AS "total_trips"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t
   JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s
     ON t."start_station_id" = s."station_id"

Answer:
000904 (42000): 01ba51e9-0004-96e7-0001-11c3010d8aba: SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
invalid identifier 'T.START_STATION_ID'End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Among all stations that are currently active, identify those that rank in the top 15 (including ties) based on the total number of trips that start at each station. For each of these stations, return the station ID, the total number of starting trips, the percentage of those trips out of the overall starting trips from active stations, and the average trip duration in minutes. Order the results by the station’s rank.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Station_ID,Total_Starting_Trips,Percentage_of_Total_Starting_Trips,Average_Trip_Duration_Minutes
station_id1:int,total_trips1:int,percentage1:float,average_duration1:float
station_id2:int,total_trips2:int,percentage2:float,average_duration2:float
...
```

This table displays the top 15 active bike share stations ranked by the total number of trips that start at each station (including ties). For each station, the following information is provided:

- **Station_ID**: The unique identifier of the station.
- **Total_Starting_Trips**: The total number of trips that started at the station.
- **Percentage_of_Total_Starting_Trips**: The percentage of the station's starting trips out of all starting trips from active stations.
- **Average_Trip_Duration_Minutes**: The average duration of trips starting from the station, measured in minutes.

The results are ordered by the total number of starting trips, reflecting each station's rank among the top 15 active stations..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'AUSTIN': {'AUSTIN_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'AUSTIN_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_TRIPS', 'BIKESHARE_STATIONS'], 'AUSTIN_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'AUSTIN_INCIDENTS': ['INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2011', 'INCIDENTS_2016', 'INCIDENTS_2008', 'INCIDENTS_2009'], 'AUSTIN_WASTE': ['WASTE_AND_DIVERSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 11:22:07 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Among all stations that are currently active, identify those that rank in the top 15 (including ties) based on the total number of trips that start at each station. For each of these stations, return the station ID, the total number of starting trips, the percentage of those trips out of the overall starting trips from active stations, and the average trip duration in minutes. Order the results by the station’s rank., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Station_ID,Total_Starting_Trips,Percentage_of_Total_Starting_Trips,Average_Trip_Duration_Minutes
station_id1:int,total_trips1:int,percentage1:float,average_duration1:float
station_id2:int,total_trips2:int,percentage2:float,average_duration2:float
...
```

This table displays the top 15 active bike share stations ranked by the total number of trips that start at each station (including ties). For each station, the following information is provided:

- **Station_ID**: The unique identifier of the station.
- **Total_Starting_Trips**: The total number of trips that started at the station.
- **Percentage_of_Total_Starting_Trips**: The percentage of the station's starting trips out of all starting trips from active stations.
- **Average_Trip_Duration_Minutes**: The average duration of trips starting from the station, measured in minutes.

The results are ordered by the total number of starting trips, reflecting each station's rank among the top 15 active stations. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
