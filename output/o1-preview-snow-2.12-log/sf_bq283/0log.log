**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table**: `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS`
  - **"station_id"**: Used to uniquely identify each station and join with trips.
  - **"status"**: Indicates if a station is currently active; used to filter active stations.
  - **"name"**: Provides the name of the station; useful for identification.
  - **"modified_date"**: Shows when the station information was last updated; could help determine current status.

- **Table**: `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS`
  - **"start_station_id"**: Identifies the station where each trip began; used to aggregate trips per station.
  - **"duration_minutes"**: Records the duration of each trip in minutes; used to calculate average trip duration.
  - **"trip_id"**: Unique identifier for each trip; can be used to count trips.
  - **"start_time"**: Timestamp of when the trip started; could be used for time-based analyses.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter stations where **"status"** is 'active' to include only currently active stations.
- Join `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` and `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` on **"start_station_id"** = **"station_id"**.
- Calculate the total number of trips starting from each active station.
- Compute the percentage of trips from each station relative to the total trips from all active stations.
- Calculate the average trip duration for trips starting at each station.
- Order results by the total number of starting trips to determine the top 15 stations (including ties).

Task: Among all stations that are currently active, identify those that rank in the top 15 (including ties) based on the total number of trips that start at each station. For each of these stations, return the station ID, the total number of starting trips, the percentage of those trips out of the overall starting trips from active stations, and the average trip duration in minutes. Order the results by the station’s rank.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Station_ID,Total_Starting_Trips,Percentage_of_Total_Starting_Trips,Average_Trip_Duration_Minutes
station_id1:int,total_trips1:int,percentage1:float,average_duration1:float
station_id2:int,total_trips2:int,percentage2:float,average_duration2:float
...
```

This table displays the top 15 active bike share stations ranked by the total number of trips that start at each station (including ties). For each station, the following information is provided:

- **Station_ID**: The unique identifier of the station.
- **Total_Starting_Trips**: The total number of trips that started at the station.
- **Percentage_of_Total_Starting_Trips**: The percentage of the station's starting trips out of all starting trips from active stations.
- **Average_Trip_Duration_Minutes**: The average duration of trips starting from the station, measured in minutes.

The results are ordered by the total number of starting trips, reflecting each station's rank among the top 15 active stations..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'AUSTIN': {'AUSTIN_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'AUSTIN_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_TRIPS', 'BIKESHARE_STATIONS'], 'AUSTIN_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'AUSTIN_INCIDENTS': ['INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2011', 'INCIDENTS_2016', 'INCIDENTS_2008', 'INCIDENTS_2009'], 'AUSTIN_WASTE': ['WASTE_AND_DIVERSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
