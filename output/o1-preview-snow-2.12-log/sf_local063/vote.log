After reviewing and comparing the three SQL scripts and their results, the correct SQL script that answers the task is **`0result.sql`**. Here's the reasoning:

### **Comparison and Analysis:**

**1. 0result.sql**

- **Approach:**
  - **Identifies** cities in the United States where sales increased by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020.
  - Filters sales **with `promo_id = 999`** in these cities.
  - **Calculates** the total sales per product and the total sales overall in these cities for each quarter.
  - **Computes** the share of each product's sales relative to the total sales per quarter.
  - **Determines** the percentage-point change in product sales share between the two quarters.
  - **Ranks** products based on total sales to identify the top 20%.
  - **Selects** the product from the top 20% with the smallest absolute percentage-point change in sales share.

- **Result:**
  - **Product ID:** 40
  - **Product Name:** Team shirt
  - **Percentage-Point Change:** -0.0028

**2. 1result.sql**

- **Approach:**
  - Similar steps as `0result.sql`, but the computations result in a different product.
  - **Result:**
    - **Product ID:** 130
    - **Product Name:** Pro Maple Youth Bat
    - **Percentage-Point Change:** -0.0095

**3. 2result.sql**

- **Approach:**
  - Similar steps, but there seems to be a miscalculation in the percentage-point change.
  - **Result:**
    - **Product ID:** 130
    - **Product Name:** Pro Maple Youth Bat
    - **Percentage-Point Change:** -0.9545 (which is unusually large and suggests a possible error)

### **Reasoning:**

- **Smallest Percentage-Point Change:**
  - **Product ID 40** has a percentage-point change of **-0.0028**, which is smaller in absolute value compared to **-0.0095** for Product ID 130 in `1result.sql`.
  - The percentage-point change in `2result.sql` is **-0.9545**, which is significantly larger and likely indicates a calculation error.

- **Top 20% of Total Sales:**
  - **Product ID 40** (Team shirt) is within the top 20% of total sales, satisfying the condition.
  - The SQL in `0result.sql` properly ranks the products and filters accordingly.

- **Accurate Calculations:**
  - The calculations in `0result.sql` correctly follow the task requirements, ensuring that:
    - Only relevant cities and sales data are considered.
    - The percentage-point change is accurately computed.
    - The product with the smallest such change is identified among the top 20% by total sales.

### **Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, **`0result.sql`** correctly answers the task by identifying the product in the top 20% of total sales with the smallest percentage-point change in sales share between Q4 2019 and Q4 2020.
