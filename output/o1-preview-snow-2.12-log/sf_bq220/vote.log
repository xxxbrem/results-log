After comparing the two SQL queries, I have chosen **`2result.sql`** as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

The SQL in `2result.sql` accurately implements the required joins and filters to fulfill the task's conditions:

- **Proper Filtering on `evaluation_type`**: It joins the `POPULATION_EVALUATION` and `POPULATION_EVALUATION_TYPE` tables to ensure that only records with `evaluation_type` set to `'EXPCURR'` are included. This is critical for meeting the task's requirement of considering only data associated with the `'EXPCURR'` evaluation type.

- **Accurate Joins**: The query correctly joins the `CONDITION`, `PLOT`, `POPULATION_STRATUM_ASSIGN`, `POPULATION_STRATUM`, `POPULATION_EVALUATION`, and `POPULATION_EVALUATION_TYPE` tables, ensuring that all necessary data is accurately linked.

- **Condition Status Code Filtering**: It filters conditions where `condition_status_code` equals `1`, as specified in the task.

- **Calculation of Sizes**: The query calculates the sizes using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Size} = E \times P \times A
  \]
  Where:
  - \( E \) is the expansion factor.
  - \( P \) is the unadjusted condition proportion.
  - \( A \) is the adjustment factor for the subplot or macroplot, depending on the `proportion_basis`.

- **Selection of Largest Average Sizes**: It computes the average sizes for each state and selects the state with the largest average size for each plot type and year.

- **Clarity and Efficiency**: The SQL is well-structured, making it easier to understand and ensures efficient execution.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**
