After carefully comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **1result.sql** emerges as the correct SQL query for the following reasons:

1. **Currency Conversion Before Growth Calculation**: The query in **1result.sql** converts the sales amounts to USD before calculating the growth rates and projecting the sales for 2021. This ensures that any currency fluctuations are considered in the growth rate calculations, providing a more accurate projection.

2. **Proper Handling of Division by Zero**: It includes checks to handle cases where the sales amount in 2019 is zero, preventing division by zero errors. This is achieved using the `NULLIF` function and appropriate `CASE` statements.

3. **Accurate Median Calculation**: The query uses the `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)` function to calculate the median, which is suitable for continuous data and provides an accurate median value of the projected sales.

4. **Comprehensive Joins and Filters**: It correctly joins all necessary tables and applies the specified filters, such as `country_name = 'France'`, `promo_total_id = 1`, and `channel_total_id = 1`, ensuring that only the relevant data is considered.

**Therefore, the correct SQL file is:**
