**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **USERS**
   - `"id"`: User ID. **Potential usage**: To identify users.
   - `"display_name"`: User's display name. **Potential usage**: For readability in results.
   - `"reputation"`: User's reputation score. **Potential usage**: Additional information about users.

2. **POSTS_QUESTIONS**
   - `"id"`: Question ID. **Potential usage**: To identify questions.
   - `"owner_user_id"`: User ID of the question owner. **Potential usage**: To find questions owned by a user.
   - `"accepted_answer_id"`: ID of the accepted answer. **Potential usage**: To find accepted answers and their owners.
   - `"view_count"`: Number of times the question has been viewed. **Potential usage**: To sum view counts of associated questions.
   - `"title"`: Title of the question. **Potential usage**: For context or additional filtering.
   - `"score"`: Score of the question. **Potential usage**: May be useful for additional analysis.

3. **POSTS_ANSWERS**
   - `"id"`: Answer ID. **Potential usage**: To identify answers.
   - `"parent_id"`: Question ID to which the answer belongs. **Potential usage**: To link answers to their questions.
   - `"owner_user_id"`: User ID of the answer owner. **Potential usage**: To find answers provided by a user.
   - `"score"`: Score of the answer. **Potential usage**: To determine if the answer meets score conditions (e.g., score > 5).

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **User owns the question**: `"POSTS_QUESTIONS"."owner_user_id" = "USERS"."id"`
- **User's answer is the accepted answer**: `"POSTS_ANSWERS"."id" = "POSTS_QUESTIONS"."accepted_answer_id"`
- **User's answer has a score greater than 5**: `"POSTS_ANSWERS"."score" > 5`
- **User's answer's score exceeds 20% of the total answer scores for that question and is above 0**:
  - Calculate total answer scores per question.
  - Check if an individual answer's score > 0 and `("POSTS_ANSWERS"."score" / total_answer_score) > 0.2`
- **User's answer is among the top three highest-scoring answers for that question**:
  - Rank answers per question by score.
  - Select answers with rank ≤ 3.

Task: Which 10 users have the highest combined view counts for questions they are associated with, where a user is considered associated if they own the question, or their answer is the accepted answer, or their answer's score is greater than 5, or their answer's score exceeds 20% of the total answer scores for that question (and is above 0), or their answer is among the top three highest-scoring answers for that question?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The top 10 users with the highest combined view counts for associated questions are:

```csv
User_ID,Combined_View_Count
user1_id:int,view_count1:int
user2_id:int,view_count2:int
user3_id:int,view_count3:int
user4_id:int,view_count4:int
user5_id:int,view_count5:int
user6_id:int,view_count6:int
user7_id:int,view_count7:int
user8_id:int,view_count8:int
user9_id:int,view_count9:int
user10_id:int,view_count10:int
(Attention: answer in 10 rows)
```

**Explanation:** Each user is associated with questions where they either own the question, have an accepted answer, have an answer with a score greater than 5, have an answer whose score exceeds 20% of the total answer scores for that question (and is above 0), or have an answer among the top three highest-scoring answers. The combined view counts are the total number of views for all such questions associated with each user..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'STACKOVERFLOW': {'STACKOVERFLOW': ['COMMENTS', 'POST_HISTORY', 'TAGS', 'USERS', 'BADGES', 'POSTS_ORPHANED_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_PRIVILEGE_WIKI', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_WIKI_PLACEHOLDER', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI_EXCERPT', 'VOTES', 'POSTS_ANSWERS', 'POSTS_MODERATOR_NOMINATION', 'POSTS_QUESTIONS', 'STACKOVERFLOW_POSTS', 'POST_LINKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 19:00:19 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which 10 users have the highest combined view counts for questions they are associated with, where a user is considered associated if they own the question, or their answer is the accepted answer, or their answer's score is greater than 5, or their answer's score exceeds 20% of the total answer scores for that question (and is above 0), or their answer is among the top three highest-scoring answers for that question?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The top 10 users with the highest combined view counts for associated questions are:

```csv
User_ID,Combined_View_Count
user1_id:int,view_count1:int
user2_id:int,view_count2:int
user3_id:int,view_count3:int
user4_id:int,view_count4:int
user5_id:int,view_count5:int
user6_id:int,view_count6:int
user7_id:int,view_count7:int
user8_id:int,view_count8:int
user9_id:int,view_count9:int
user10_id:int,view_count10:int
(Attention: answer in 10 rows)
```

**Explanation:** Each user is associated with questions where they either own the question, have an accepted answer, have an answer with a score greater than 5, have an answer whose score exceeds 20% of the total answer scores for that question (and is above 0), or have an answer among the top three highest-scoring answers. The combined view counts are the total number of views for all such questions associated with each user. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
