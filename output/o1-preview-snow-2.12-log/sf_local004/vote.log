Upon comparing the three SQL queries and their results, here's the analysis:

**0result.sql:**

- **Average Payment Calculation:** This query directly calculates the average payment per order using `AVG(p."payment_value")` from the `ORDER_PAYMENTS` table.
- **Issue:** If an order has multiple payment entries (e.g., split payments), this method treats each payment as separate, leading to an incorrect average by inflating the number of payments.
- **Lifespan Calculation:** The lifespan is calculated correctly using the difference between the earliest and latest purchase timestamps.

**1result.sql:**

- **Average Payment Calculation:** This query first sums all payments per order to get the total payment per order. It then calculates the average payment per order per customer using these totals.
- **Advantage:** By aggregating payments at the order level, it accurately handles orders with multiple payments, ensuring each order contributes once to the average.
- **Lifespan Calculation:** It correctly calculates the lifespan in days and converts it to weeks, setting it to 1.0 if less than one week.

**2result.sql:**

- **Average Payment Calculation:** Similar to `1result.sql`, it sums payments per order and then calculates the average per customer.
- **Structure:** It uses a slightly different subquery approach but achieves the same result as `1result.sql`.
- **Lifespan Calculation:** It also handles the lifespan calculation correctly.

**Conclusion:**

Both **`1result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** accurately calculate the average payment per order by properly aggregating payments per order before averaging. They correctly account for orders with multiple payments. However, **`1result.sql`** is more readable and straightforward in its approach.

**Therefore, I choose `1result.sql` as the correct answer because it provides accurate calculations and aligns well with the requirements.**
