To determine which SQL query correctly addresses the task, let's compare each of the provided SQL queries and understand how they fulfill the requirements.

**Task Summary**:

- **Filter job postings** where:
  - The job title contains 'Data Analyst' (`"job_title"` or `"job_title_short"` ILIKE '%Data Analyst%').
  - The job is remote (`"job_work_from_home" = 1`).
  - The annual average salary is not null (`"salary_year_avg" IS NOT NULL`).

- **Identify the top three most frequently demanded skills** among these filtered job postings.

- **Calculate the overall average salary** for job postings that require at least one of these top three skills.

### **Option 0: `0result.sql`**

```sql
WITH filtered_jobs AS (
  SELECT jpf."job_id", jpf."salary_year_avg"
  FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.JOB_POSTINGS_FACT jpf
  WHERE (jpf."job_title" ILIKE '%Data Analyst%' OR jpf."job_title_short" ILIKE '%Data Analyst%')
    AND jpf."salary_year_avg" IS NOT NULL
    AND jpf."job_work_from_home" = 1
),
top_skills AS (
  SELECT sd."skills", COUNT(*) AS "skill_count"
  FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.SKILLS_DIM sd
  JOIN CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.SKILLS_JOB_DIM sjd ON sd."skill_id" = sjd."skill_id"
  JOIN filtered_jobs fj ON sjd."job_id" = fj."job_id"
  GROUP BY sd."skills"
  ORDER BY "skill_count" DESC NULLS LAST
  LIMIT 3
),
jobs_with_top_skills AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT fj."job_id", fj."salary_year_avg"
  FROM filtered_jobs fj
  JOIN CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.SKILLS_JOB_DIM sjd ON fj."job_id" = sjd."job_id"
  JOIN CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.SKILLS_DIM sd ON sjd."skill_id" = sd."skill_id"
  JOIN top_skills ts ON sd."skills" = ts."skills"
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(jobs_with_top_skills."salary_year_avg"), 4) AS "average_salary"
FROM jobs_with_top_skills;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **filtered_jobs**: Filters the job postings based on title, remote status, and non-null salary.
  - **top_skills**: Identifies the top three skills among these filtered jobs by counting occurrences.
  - **jobs_with_top_skills**: Selects jobs that require at least one of the top three skills.
  - **Final SELECT**: Calculates the average salary of these jobs.

### **Option 1: `1result.sql`**

```sql
WITH filtered_jobs AS (
    SELECT jp."job_id", jp."salary_year_avg"
    FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION."JOB_POSTINGS_FACT" jp
    WHERE (jp."job_title" ILIKE '%Data Analyst%' OR jp."job_title_short" ILIKE '%Data Analyst%')
      AND jp."job_work_from_home" = 1
      AND jp."salary_year_avg" IS NOT NULL
),
top_skills AS (
    SELECT sd."skill_id"
    FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION."SKILLS_JOB_DIM" sj
    JOIN filtered_jobs fj ON sj."job_id" = fj."job_id"
    JOIN CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION."SKILLS_DIM" sd ON sj."skill_id" = sd."skill_id"
    GROUP BY sd."skill_id"
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 3
),
jobs_with_top_skills AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT fj."job_id", fj."salary_year_avg"
    FROM filtered_jobs fj
    JOIN CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION."SKILLS_JOB_DIM" sj ON fj."job_id" = sj."job_id"
    WHERE sj."skill_id" IN (SELECT "skill_id" FROM top_skills)
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG("salary_year_avg"), 4) AS "average_salary"
FROM jobs_with_top_skills;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Similar steps to Option 0 but focuses on `"skill_id"` instead of `"skills"` for identifying top skills.
  - Uses COUNT(*) on `"skill_id"` to find the top three skills.
  - Calculations and logic are equivalent to Option 0.

### **Option 2: `2result.sql`**

```sql
SELECT AVG("salary_year_avg") AS "average_salary"
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT jp."job_id", jp."salary_year_avg"
  FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION."JOB_POSTINGS_FACT" jp
  JOIN CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION."SKILLS_JOB_DIM" sj
    ON jp."job_id" = sj."job_id"
  JOIN CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION."SKILLS_DIM" sd
    ON sj."skill_id" = sd."skill_id"
  WHERE (jp."job_title" LIKE '%Data Analyst%' OR jp."job_title_short" LIKE '%Data Analyst%')
    AND jp."salary_year_avg" IS NOT NULL
    AND jp."job_work_from_home" = 1
    AND sd."skills" IN (
      SELECT "skills"
      FROM (
        SELECT sd2."skills", COUNT(*) AS cnt
        FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION."SKILLS_DIM" sd2
        JOIN CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION."SKILLS_JOB_DIM" sj2
          ON sd2."skill_id" = sj2."skill_id"
        JOIN CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION."JOB_POSTINGS_FACT" jp2
          ON sj2."job_id" = jp2."job_id"
        WHERE (jp2."job_title" LIKE '%Data Analyst%' OR jp2."job_title_short" LIKE '%Data Analyst%')
          AND jp2."salary_year_avg" IS NOT NULL
          AND jp2."job_work_from_home" = 1
        GROUP BY sd2."skills"
        ORDER BY cnt DESC NULLS LAST
        LIMIT 3
      )
    )
) AS filtered_jobs;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Performs the operations within nested subqueries instead of CTEs.
  - Filters jobs and identifies top skills in subqueries.
  - Logic aligns with the task requirements.

---

**Comparison and Reasoning**:

All three queries:

- Correctly filter the job postings based on job title, remote status, and non-null salary.
- Identify the top three most frequently demanded skills among these postings.
- Calculate the overall average salary for jobs requiring at least one of these top skills.
- Produce the same result: **106425.0**.

**Choosing the Correct SQL**:

- **Option 0** (`0result.sql`) is selected because:
  - It clearly and logically structures the query using CTEs (Common Table Expressions), making it easy to read and understand.
  - Each step of the task is broken down:
    - Filtering jobs.
    - Identifying top skills.
    - Selecting jobs with top skills.
    - Calculating the average salary.
  - It directly aligns with the task requirements in a detailed and systematic manner.
