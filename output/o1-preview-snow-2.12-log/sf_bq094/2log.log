**Columns and their potential usage:**

From **COMMITTEE_2016**:
- `"cmte_id"`: Committee ID, used to identify committees and link to other tables.
- `"cmte_nm"`: Committee name, needed for the final output.

From **CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016**:
- `"cmte_id"`: Committee ID, to link committees to candidates they support.
- `"cand_id"`: Candidate ID, to identify candidates supported by committees.

From **CANDIDATE_2016**:
- `"cand_id"`: Candidate ID, to link to candidate details.
- `"cand_name"`: Candidate name, needed for the final output.

From **INDIVIDUALS_2016**:
- `"cmte_id"`: Committee ID, to link contributions to committees.
- `"transaction_amt"`: Amount of individual contribution, to filter contributions between $0 and $200 and calculate total sums.

**Conditions that may be used:**
- Filter individual contributions where `"transaction_amt"` > 0 and `"transaction_amt"` < 200.
- Select committees that have at least one candidate they support (join between `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016` and `COMMITTEE_2016`).
- Sum of small-dollar contributions ("transaction_amt") per committee is more than $0.
- Group data by `"cmte_id"` to calculate the total sum of small-dollar donations and count unique candidates supported.
- Order candidate names alphabetically.

Task: Please provide a list of all 2016 committees that supported at least one candidate and received a total amount of individual contributions between $0 and $200 (inclusive of more than $0 and less than $200) where these small-dollar contributions sum to more than $0 overall. For each qualifying committee, include its name, the number of unique candidates it supported, the candidates’ names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total sum of these small-dollar donations received by the committee.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Committee_Name,Number_of_Candidates_Supported,Candidate_Names_in_Alphabetic_Order,Total_Sum_of_Small_Dollar_Donations
committee_name1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidate_names1:str,total_sum1:float > 0
committee_name2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidate_names2:str,total_sum2:float > 0
...
```

This table lists all 2016 committees that supported at least one candidate and received a total amount of individual contributions between $0 and $200 (more than $0 and less than $200). For each qualifying committee, it includes the committee's name, the number of unique candidates it supported, the candidates' names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total sum of these small-dollar donations received by the committee, which is greater than $0..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 09:03:59 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please provide a list of all 2016 committees that supported at least one candidate and received a total amount of individual contributions between $0 and $200 (inclusive of more than $0 and less than $200) where these small-dollar contributions sum to more than $0 overall. For each qualifying committee, include its name, the number of unique candidates it supported, the candidates’ names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total sum of these small-dollar donations received by the committee., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Committee_Name,Number_of_Candidates_Supported,Candidate_Names_in_Alphabetic_Order,Total_Sum_of_Small_Dollar_Donations
committee_name1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidate_names1:str,total_sum1:float > 0
committee_name2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidate_names2:str,total_sum2:float > 0
...
```

This table lists all 2016 committees that supported at least one candidate and received a total amount of individual contributions between $0 and $200 (more than $0 and less than $200). For each qualifying committee, it includes the committee's name, the number of unique candidates it supported, the candidates' names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total sum of these small-dollar donations received by the committee, which is greater than $0. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
