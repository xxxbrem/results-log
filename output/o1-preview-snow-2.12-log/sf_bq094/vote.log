After reviewing the SQL queries and their outputs, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL that fulfills the task requirements. 

**Reasoning:**

- **Total Small-Dollar Contributions Between $0 and $200:**
  
  The task specifies that we need committees where the sum of small-dollar individual contributions (amounts > $0 and < $200) per committee is **more than $0 and less than $200**. The SQL in `2result.sql` includes the condition:

  ```sql
  HAVING SUM("transaction_amt") > 0 AND SUM("transaction_amt") < 200
  ```

  This ensures that only committees with total small-dollar contributions greater than $0 and less than $200 are selected.

- **Supporting at Least One Candidate:**

  The SQL joins the `small_donations` CTE with `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016` to ensure that each committee has supported at least one candidate:

  ```sql
  JOIN FEC.FEC.CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016 cc ON sd."cmte_id" = cc."cmte_id"
  ```

- **Including Committee Name, Number of Candidates Supported, Candidate Names, and Total Sum:**

  The SELECT statement retrieves all the required information:

  ```sql
  SELECT
      c."cmte_nm" AS "Committee_Name",
      COUNT(DISTINCT cc."cand_id") AS "Number_of_Candidates_Supported",
      LISTAGG(DISTINCT cd."cand_name", ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY cd."cand_name") AS "Candidate_Names_in_Alphabetic_Order",
      CAST(sd."Total_Sum_of_Small_Dollar_Donations" AS FLOAT) AS "Total_Sum_of_Small_Dollar_Donations"
  ```

  This ensures that for each qualifying committee, we get its name, the number of unique candidates it supported, the candidatesâ€™ names in alphabetical order, and the total sum of these small-dollar donations.

- **Filtering Individual Contributions:**

  While the SQL does not explicitly filter by `"entity_tp" = 'IND'`, it relies on the assumption that the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table contains individual contributions. If necessary, adding `"entity_tp" = 'IND'` to the WHERE clause would make the filtering explicit.

**Output:**
