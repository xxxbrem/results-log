I have corrected the column names to match the exact names as defined in the table schema. Column names are case-sensitive and must be enclosed in double quotes when they contain uppercase letters or special characters. Please run this query to retrieve the data with properly populated columns.

```

**Explanation:**

The error occurred because Snowflake treats identifiers enclosed in double quotes (`" "`), as case-sensitive. In the previous query, the column names were not matching the exact case as defined in the table schema. According to the table structure, the column names are all in **lowercase** and enclosed in double quotes. Therefore, we need to ensure that the column names in the SQL query match the exact case.

- **Column names corrections:**
  - `"industry"` instead of `"INDUSTRY"`
  - `"percent_asian"` instead of `"PERCENT_ASIAN"`
  - `"percent_black_or_african_american"` instead of `"PERCENT_BLACK_OR_AFRICAN_AMERICAN"`
  - `"percent_hispanic_or_latino"` instead of `"PERCENT_HISPANIC_OR_LATINO"`
  - `"percent_white"` instead of `"PERCENT_WHITE"`
  - `"percent_women"` instead of `"PERCENT_WOMEN"`
  - `"year"` instead of `"YEAR"`
  - `"subsector"` instead of `"SUBSECTOR"`

- **Adjustments to the query:**
  - Use exact casing for all column names.
  - Ensure that all column names are enclosed in double quotes.
  - Adjust the search patterns in the `ILIKE` condition to match the case-insensitive search.

By making these corrections, the query should execute without errors and return the desired data.

This table compares the racial (Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White) and gender (U.S. Women, U.S. Men) distributions across three areas for the year 2021:

- **Workforce Hiring Percentage**: The percentage representation of each category in Google's overall workforce hiring, derived from the `DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_HIRING` table.
- **Workforce Representation Percentage**: The percentage representation of each category in Google's overall workforce, derived from the `DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_REPRESENTATION` table.
- **BLS Sector Percentage**: The percentage representation of each category in the U.S. labor force for the technology sectors defined as "Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals" and "Computer systems design and related services," obtained from the `CPSAAT18` table in the BLS schema.

*Note: Replace `percentage1` to `percentage18` with the actual numeric values (without the '%' symbol) obtained from the respective tables for the year 2021.*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-12 01:28:39 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a combined 2021 report comparing racial (Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White) and gender (U.S. Women, U.S. Men) distributions across Google’s overall workforce hiring, Google’s overall workforce representation, and the BLS data specifically for the technology sectors defined as Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or Computer systems design and related services?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Category,Workforce_Hiring_Percentage,Workforce_Representation_Percentage,BLS_Sector_Percentage
Asian,percentage1,percentage2,percentage3
Black,percentage4,percentage5,percentage6
Hispanic/Latinx,percentage7,percentage8,percentage9
White,percentage10,percentage11,percentage12
U.S. Women,percentage13,percentage14,percentage15
U.S. Men,percentage16,percentage17,percentage18
```

This table compares the racial (Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White) and gender (U.S. Women, U.S. Men) distributions across three areas for the year 2021:

- **Workforce Hiring Percentage**: The percentage representation of each category in Google's overall workforce hiring, derived from the `DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_HIRING` table.
- **Workforce Representation Percentage**: The percentage representation of each category in Google's overall workforce, derived from the `DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_REPRESENTATION` table.
- **BLS Sector Percentage**: The percentage representation of each category in the U.S. labor force for the technology sectors defined as "Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals" and "Computer systems design and related services," obtained from the `CPSAAT18` table in the BLS schema.

*Note: Replace `percentage1` to `percentage18` with the actual numeric values (without the '%' symbol) obtained from the respective tables for the year 2021.* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-12 01:29:32 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a combined 2021 report comparing racial (Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White) and gender (U.S. Women, U.S. Men) distributions across Google’s overall workforce hiring, Google’s overall workforce representation, and the BLS data specifically for the technology sectors defined as Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or Computer systems design and related services?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Category,Workforce_Hiring_Percentage,Workforce_Representation_Percentage,BLS_Sector_Percentage
Asian,percentage1,percentage2,percentage3
Black,percentage4,percentage5,percentage6
Hispanic/Latinx,percentage7,percentage8,percentage9
White,percentage10,percentage11,percentage12
U.S. Women,percentage13,percentage14,percentage15
U.S. Men,percentage16,percentage17,percentage18
```

This table compares the racial (Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White) and gender (U.S. Women, U.S. Men) distributions across three areas for the year 2021:

- **Workforce Hiring Percentage**: The percentage representation of each category in Google's overall workforce hiring, derived from the `DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_HIRING` table.
- **Workforce Representation Percentage**: The percentage representation of each category in Google's overall workforce, derived from the `DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_REPRESENTATION` table.
- **BLS Sector Percentage**: The percentage representation of each category in the U.S. labor force for the technology sectors defined as "Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals" and "Computer systems design and related services," obtained from the `CPSAAT18` table in the BLS schema.

*Note: Replace `percentage1` to `percentage18` with the actual numeric values (without the '%' symbol) obtained from the respective tables for the year 2021.* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
