After analyzing the provided SQL queries and their corresponding results, **`1result.sql`** correctly implements the required task.

**Reasoning:**

- **Exclusion of Promotions:** `1result.sql` correctly excludes promotional sales by including the condition `s."promo_id" = 999` in all relevant queries. This ensures that only non-promotional sales are considered.

- **Selection of Cities with at Least 20% Sales Increase:**
  - It calculates total sales per city for Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 separately.
  - It then identifies cities where the sales increased by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020.
  - This aligns with the task requirement of focusing on cities with significant sales growth.

- **Ranking Products and Selecting Top 20%:**
  - The query calculates total sales per product across both years within the selected cities.
  - It ranks the products based on total sales and selects the top 20% using `NTILE(5)` and filtering for `ntile = 1`.
  - This method accurately identifies the top 20% of products in terms of sales.

- **Calculating Sales Shares and Share Changes:**
  - The query computes each top productâ€™s share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 within the selected cities.
  - It calculates the difference in share between the two years.
  - The results are ordered in descending order of the share change, as required.

- **Accurate Results:**
  - The results in `1result.csv` show that Product ID 28 (`English Willow Cricket Bat`) had the highest positive share change, aligning with the expectations.
  - The computed share percentages and changes correspond correctly to the sales data, indicating accurate calculations.

- **Consistent with Task Requirements:**
  - The SQL script follows all the specified conditions:
    - Focus on the United States.
    - Consider only Q4 2019 and Q4 2020.
    - Exclude promotional sales.
    - Identify cities with at least 20% sales increase.
    - Analyze the top 20% products based on sales.
    - Calculate and compare sales shares for these products between the two years.

**Conclusion:**

`1result.sql` meets all the criteria outlined in the task and provides accurate and relevant results.
