**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **SALES**
  - `"prod_id"`: To identify products sold.
  - `"cust_id"`: To link sales to customers.
  - `"time_id"`: To determine when the sale occurred.
  - `"promo_id"`: To exclude sales with promotions (sales where `"promo_id"` is 0 or NULL).
  - `"quantity_sold"` and `"amount_sold"`: To calculate total sales amounts.

- **CUSTOMERS**
  - `"cust_id"`: To join with the SALES table.
  - `"cust_city"`: To identify the city of the customer.
  - `"country_id"`: To determine the country (join with the COUNTRIES table).

- **COUNTRIES**
  - `"country_id"`: To join with the CUSTOMERS table.
  - `"country_name"`: To filter for 'United States'.

- **TIMES**
  - `"time_id"`: To join with the SALES table.
  - `"calendar_quarter_number"`: To filter for Q4 (quarter 4).
  - `"calendar_year"`: To filter for years 2019 and 2020.

- **PRODUCTS**
  - `"prod_id"`: To get product information.
  - `"prod_name"`: To display product names.

Task: In the United States, for Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, first select only those cities where total sales (with no promotions) rose by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020. Among these cities, rank products by their overall sales (still excluding promotions) in those quarters and take the top 20%. Then compute each top product’s share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 and calculate the difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020, returning the results in descending order of that share change.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_ID,Product_Name,Share_Q4_2019,Share_Q4_2020,Share_Change
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,share_2019_1:float,share_2020_1:float,share_change_1:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,share_2019_2:float,share_2020_2:float,share_change_2:float
...
```
(Results are ordered in descending order of **Share_Change**)

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the top 20% of products (excluding promotions) sold in cities across the United States where total sales increased by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020. For each product, it shows:

- **Product_ID**: The unique identifier of the product.
- **Product_Name**: The name of the product.
- **Share_Q4_2019**: The product's share of total sales in Q4 2019 (as a percentage).
- **Share_Q4_2020**: The product's share of total sales in Q4 2020 (as a percentage).
- **Share_Change**: The difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020 (Share_Q4_2020 minus Share_Q4_2019).

The results are sorted in descending order based on **Share_Change**, highlighting the products with the most significant increase in market share over the specified period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'COMPLEX_ORACLE': {'COMPLEX_ORACLE': ['COUNTRIES', 'SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'COSTS', 'CURRENCY', 'CUSTOMERS', 'PRODUCTS', 'TIMES', 'CHANNELS', 'PROMOTIONS', 'SALES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

**Explanation:**

This query performs the following steps:

1. **Calculate Total Sales per City for Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 (Excluding Promotions):**
   - It computes the total sales for each city in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 where promotions are not applied (`promo_id = 999`).

2. **Select Cities with at Least 20% Sales Increase:**
   - It calculates the growth rate for each city and selects those with a growth rate of 20% or higher.

3. **Calculate Total Sales per Product per Year in Selected Cities (Excluding Promotions):**
   - For the selected cities, it computes the total sales per product for each year (2019 and 2020).

4. **Rank Products and Select the Top 20%:**
   - It ranks the products based on their total sales across both years and selects the top 20% of products.

5. **Calculate Total Sales per Year in Selected Cities:**
   - It computes the total sales for all products in the selected cities for each year.

6. **Calculate Each Product's Share of Total Sales per Year:**
   - For each of the top products, it calculates their percentage share of the total sales in each year.

7. **Compute the Change in Share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020:**
   - It pivots the data to have shares for both years side by side and calculates the difference in share between the two years.

8. **Finalize and Order the Results:**
   - The final result includes the product ID, product name, share percentages for both years, and the share change, ordered by the share change in descending order.

**Result Format:**

The query returns results in the following format:

```csv
Product_ID,Product_Name,Share_Q4_2019,Share_Q4_2020,Share_Change
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,share_2019_1:float,share_2020_1:float,share_change_1:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,share_2019_2:float,share_2020_2:float,share_change_2:float
...
```

- **Product_ID**: The unique identifier for each product.
- **Product_Name**: The name of the product.
- **Share_Q4_2019**: The product's share of total sales in Q4 2019 (as a percentage).
- **Share_Q4_2020**: The product's share of total sales in Q4 2020 (as a percentage).
- **Share_Change**: The change in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020.

**Notes:**

- The shares are calculated based on total sales amounts and are presented as percentages rounded to four decimal places.
- The `NVL` function handles any `NULL` values by treating them as zero.
- The results are ordered to highlight the products with the most significant increase in market share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020.

2025-02-10 14:59:30 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing In the United States, for Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, first select only those cities where total sales (with no promotions) rose by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020. Among these cities, rank products by their overall sales (still excluding promotions) in those quarters and take the top 20%. Then compute each top product’s share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 and calculate the difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020, returning the results in descending order of that share change., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product_ID,Product_Name,Share_Q4_2019,Share_Q4_2020,Share_Change
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,share_2019_1:float,share_2020_1:float,share_change_1:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,share_2019_2:float,share_2020_2:float,share_change_2:float
...
```
(Results are ordered in descending order of **Share_Change**)

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the top 20% of products (excluding promotions) sold in cities across the United States where total sales increased by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020. For each product, it shows:

- **Product_ID**: The unique identifier of the product.
- **Product_Name**: The name of the product.
- **Share_Q4_2019**: The product's share of total sales in Q4 2019 (as a percentage).
- **Share_Q4_2020**: The product's share of total sales in Q4 2020 (as a percentage).
- **Share_Change**: The difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020 (Share_Q4_2020 minus Share_Q4_2019).

The results are sorted in descending order based on **Share_Change**, highlighting the products with the most significant increase in market share over the specified period. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
