Task: In the United States, for Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, first select only those cities where total sales (with no promotions) rose by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020. Among these cities, rank products by their overall sales (still excluding promotions) in those quarters and take the top 20%. Then compute each top product’s share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 and calculate the difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020, returning the results in descending order of that share change.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_ID,Product_Name,Share_Q4_2019,Share_Q4_2020,Share_Change
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,share_2019_1:float,share_2020_1:float,share_change_1:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,share_2019_2:float,share_2020_2:float,share_change_2:float
...
```
(Results are ordered in descending order of **Share_Change**)

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the top 20% of products (excluding promotions) sold in cities across the United States where total sales increased by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020. For each product, it shows:

- **Product_ID**: The unique identifier of the product.
- **Product_Name**: The name of the product.
- **Share_Q4_2019**: The product's share of total sales in Q4 2019 (as a percentage).
- **Share_Q4_2020**: The product's share of total sales in Q4 2020 (as a percentage).
- **Share_Change**: The difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020 (Share_Q4_2020 minus Share_Q4_2019).

The results are sorted in descending order based on **Share_Change**, highlighting the products with the most significant increase in market share over the specified period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'COMPLEX_ORACLE': {'COMPLEX_ORACLE': ['COUNTRIES', 'SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'COSTS', 'CURRENCY', 'CUSTOMERS', 'PRODUCTS', 'TIMES', 'CHANNELS', 'PROMOTIONS', 'SALES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 14:59:47 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing In the United States, for Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, first select only those cities where total sales (with no promotions) rose by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020. Among these cities, rank products by their overall sales (still excluding promotions) in those quarters and take the top 20%. Then compute each top product’s share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 and calculate the difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020, returning the results in descending order of that share change., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product_ID,Product_Name,Share_Q4_2019,Share_Q4_2020,Share_Change
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,share_2019_1:float,share_2020_1:float,share_change_1:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,share_2019_2:float,share_2020_2:float,share_change_2:float
...
```
(Results are ordered in descending order of **Share_Change**)

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the top 20% of products (excluding promotions) sold in cities across the United States where total sales increased by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020. For each product, it shows:

- **Product_ID**: The unique identifier of the product.
- **Product_Name**: The name of the product.
- **Share_Q4_2019**: The product's share of total sales in Q4 2019 (as a percentage).
- **Share_Q4_2020**: The product's share of total sales in Q4 2020 (as a percentage).
- **Share_Change**: The difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020 (Share_Q4_2020 minus Share_Q4_2019).

The results are sorted in descending order based on **Share_Change**, highlighting the products with the most significant increase in market share over the specified period. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
