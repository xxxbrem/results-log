After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **1result.sql** is the correct choice.

**Reasoning:**

- **Candidate 0 (0result.sql):**
  - Directly uses `"provider_id" = '330101'` without computing which provider actually has the highest total inpatient Medicare cost.
  - Assumes that `'330101'` is the top provider but doesn't verify it within the query.
  - Does not align with the requirement to first determine the top provider based on the data.

- **Candidate 2 (2result.sql):**
  - Correctly computes the top provider by summing the inpatient costs over the years 2011-2015.
  - Uses multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to structure the query.
  - More complex than necessary for the task.

- **Candidate 1 (1result.sql):**
  - Correctly identifies the provider with the highest total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 to 2015.
  - Computes the total inpatient cost per provider, orders them to find the top provider.
  - Calculates the yearly average inpatient and outpatient costs for that provider.
  - Uses a clear and efficient structure with CTEs.
  - Provides results that match the expected output.

**Conclusion:**

Candidate 1 meets all the requirements of the task by:

1. Identifying the provider with the highest total inpatient Medicare cost over the specified period.
2. Calculating the yearly average inpatient and outpatient costs for that provider.
3. Properly structuring the SQL query for clarity and efficiency.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
