**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Tables:**
  - **INPATIENT_CHARGES_2011** to **INPATIENT_CHARGES_2015**: Contains inpatient data for years 2011-2015.
  - **OUTPATIENT_CHARGES_2011** to **OUTPATIENT_CHARGES_2015**: Contains outpatient data for years 2011-2015.

- **Columns and Potential Usage:**
  - **"provider_id"**: Used to identify providers uniquely.
  - **"provider_name"**: Provider's name for reference.
  - **"total_discharges"**: Number of discharges; used in calculating inpatient cost.
  - **"average_medicare_payments"**: Used in calculating inpatient cost.
  - **"outpatient_services"**: Number of outpatient services; used in calculating outpatient cost.

Task: For the provider whose total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 through 2015 is the highest (computed as the sum of average_medicare_payments multiplied by total_discharges), please list that provider’s yearly average inpatient cost and yearly average outpatient cost for each calendar year in this period, where the inpatient cost is calculated as the average of (average_medicare_payments × total_discharges) and the outpatient cost is calculated as the average of (average_total_payments × outpatient_services).

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Average_Inpatient_Cost,Average_Outpatient_Cost
2011,avg_inpatient_cost_2011:float,avg_outpatient_cost_2011:float
2012,avg_inpatient_cost_2012:float,avg_outpatient_cost_2012:float
2013,avg_inpatient_cost_2013:float,avg_outpatient_cost_2013:float
2014,avg_inpatient_cost_2014:float,avg_outpatient_cost_2014:float
2015,avg_inpatient_cost_2015:float,avg_outpatient_cost_2015:float
```
*(Attention: answer in five rows for the provider with the highest total inpatient Medicare cost)*

**Explanation:**

The provider with the highest total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 through 2015 is determined by calculating the sum of *(average_medicare_payments × total_discharges)* across all years. The table above lists this provider's yearly average inpatient cost and yearly average outpatient cost for each calendar year in the period from 2011 to 2015.

- **Average Inpatient Cost** for each year is calculated as the average of *(average_medicare_payments × total_discharges)* for that year.
- **Average Outpatient Cost** for each year is calculated as the average of *(average_total_payments × outpatient_services)* for that year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'CMS_DATA': {'CMS_CODES': ['HCPCS', 'ICD10_PROCEDURES_2019', 'ICD9_DIAGNOSES', 'ICD10_DIAGNOSES_2019', 'ICD9_PROCEDURES'], 'CMS_MEDICARE': ['HOME_HEALTH_AGENCIES_2013', 'HOME_HEALTH_AGENCIES_2013', 'HOME_HEALTH_AGENCIES_2014', 'HOSPICE_PROVIDERS_2014', 'HOSPITAL_GENERAL_INFO', 'INPATIENT_CHARGES_2011', 'INPATIENT_CHARGES_2011', 'INPATIENT_CHARGES_2014', 'INPATIENT_CHARGES_2012', 'INPATIENT_CHARGES_2013', 'INPATIENT_CHARGES_2015', 'NURSING_FACILITIES_2014', 'NURSING_FACILITIES_2014', 'NURSING_FACILITIES_2013', 'OUTPATIENT_CHARGES_2012', 'OUTPATIENT_CHARGES_2012', 'OUTPATIENT_CHARGES_2014', 'OUTPATIENT_CHARGES_2011', 'OUTPATIENT_CHARGES_2013', 'OUTPATIENT_CHARGES_2015', 'PART_D_PRESCRIBER_2014', 'REFERRING_DURABLE_MEDICAL_EQUIP_2013', 'REFERRING_DURABLE_MEDICAL_EQUIP_2013', 'REFERRING_DURABLE_MEDICAL_EQUIP_2014', 'PHYSICIANS_AND_OTHER_SUPPLIER_2015', 'PHYSICIANS_AND_OTHER_SUPPLIER_2015', 'PHYSICIANS_AND_OTHER_SUPPLIER_2012', 'PHYSICIANS_AND_OTHER_SUPPLIER_2013', 'PHYSICIANS_AND_OTHER_SUPPLIER_2014'], 'CMS_SYNTHETIC_PATIENT_DATA_OMOP': ['CONDITION_OCCURRENCE', 'DRUG_ERA', 'LOCATION', 'PERSON', 'CONDITION_ERA', 'DEVICE_EXPOSURE', 'DOMAIN', 'DOSE_ERA', 'OBSERVATION', 'COST', 'PROVIDER', 'CARE_SITE', 'CONCEPT_ANCESTOR', 'CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP', 'DEATH', 'DRUG_STRENGTH', 'CONCEPT', 'CONCEPT_CLASS', 'DRUG_EXPOSURE', 'OBSERVATION_PERIOD', 'PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD', 'RELATIONSHIP', 'VOCABULARY', 'PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

2011,avg_inpatient_cost_2011:float,avg_outpatient_cost_2011:float
2012,avg_inpatient_cost_2012:float,avg_outpatient_cost_2012:float

```
*(Attention: answer in five rows for the provider with the highest total inpatient Medicare cost)*

**Explanation:**

The provider with the highest total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 through 2015 is determined by calculating the sum of *(average_medicare_payments × total_discharges)* across all years. The table above lists this provider's yearly average inpatient cost and yearly average outpatient cost for each calendar year in the period from 2011 to 2015.

- **Average Inpatient Cost** for each year is calculated as the average of *(average_medicare_payments × total_discharges)* for that year.
- **Average Outpatient Cost** for each year is calculated as the average of *(average_total_payments × outpatient_services)* for that year. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
