Among the two SQL queries, the first one (**0result.sql**) is the correct choice.

**Reasoning:**

- **Proper Aggregation:** The first query (`0result.sql`) uses the `AVG` function to calculate the average percentages from the BLS data for each race across all relevant industries and industry groups. This is important because the BLS data may contain multiple entries for each race within the specified industries. Averaging ensures that all relevant data points are considered in the comparison.

- **Data Accuracy:** By aggregating the data, the first query accurately represents the overall BLS percentages, providing a fair comparison against Google's hiring data. The second query (`2result.sql`) uses subqueries without aggregation, potentially retrieving only one record from the BLS data, which may not represent the average across all relevant industries.

- **Error Avoidance:** The second query could encounter an error if the subqueries return more than one row (e.g., "more than one row returned by a subquery used as an expression"). The first query avoids this issue by using `AVG` to aggregate the results.

- **Clear Structure:** The first query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to separate the data retrieval (`google_data`, `bls_data`) and calculation (`differences`) steps, making the query more organized and easier to read.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query as it correctly calculates the average differences and ensures accurate and reliable results.
