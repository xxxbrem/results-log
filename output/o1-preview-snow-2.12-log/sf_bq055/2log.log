Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure! Let's start by identifying the relevant tables, columns, and potential conditions for this task.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `GOOGLE_DEI.GOOGLE_DEI.DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_HIRING`

   - **Columns:**
     - `"report_year"`: Used to filter data for 2021.
     - `"workforce"`: Used to identify the overall hiring data.
     - `"race_asian"`: Percentage of Asian hires.
     - `"race_black"`: Percentage of Black hires.
     - `"race_hispanic_latinx"`: Percentage of Hispanic/Latinx hires.
     - `"race_native_american"`: Percentage of Native American hires.
     - `"race_white"`: Percentage of White hires.

2. **Table:** `GOOGLE_DEI.BLS.CPSAAT18`

   - **Columns:**
     - `"year"`: Used to filter data for 2021.
     - `"industry"`: Used to match specific industries.
     - `"industry_group"`: Used for grouping industries; includes 'Computer systems design and related services'.
     - `"percent_white"`: Percentage of White employees.
     - `"percent_black_or_african_american"`: Percentage of Black or African American employees.
     - `"percent_asian"`: Percentage of Asian employees.
     - `"percent_hispanic_or_latino"`: Percentage of Hispanic or Latino employees.

**Potential Conditions:**

- For Google's hiring data:
  - Filter where `"report_year" = 2021`.
  - Filter where `"workforce"` corresponds to overall hiring (e.g., `"workforce" = 'Overall Hiring'`).

- For BLS data:
  - Filter where `"year" = 2021`.
  - Filter where `"industry"` is one of the specified industries:
    - `"industry" IN ('Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals', 'Software publishers', 'Data processing, hosting, and related services')`
  - Or where `"industry_group" = 'Computer systems design and related services'`

Task: Can you provide the top three races with the largest percentage differences between Google's 2021 overall hiring data from dar non intersectional hiring and the average percentages in the 2021 BLS data for the technology sectors specifically defined as 'Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals,' 'Software publishers,' 'Data processing, hosting, and related services,' or the industry group 'Computer systems design and related services,' along with their respective differences?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Race,Percentage_Difference
race1:str,difference1:float
race2:str,difference2:float
race3:str,difference3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

The top three races with the largest percentage differences between Google's 2021 overall hiring data from `DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_HIRING` and the average percentages in the 2021 BLS data for the specified technology sectors are listed above. The differences are calculated by subtracting the BLS percentages from Google's hiring percentages for each race..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

The top three races with the largest percentage differences between Google's 2021 overall hiring data from `DAR_NON_INTERSECTIONAL_HIRING` and the average percentages in the 2021 BLS data for the specified technology sectors are listed above. The differences are calculated by subtracting the BLS percentages from Google's hiring percentages for each race. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
