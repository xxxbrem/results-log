After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **0result.sql** is the correct SQL. It correctly constructs the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format using `TO_CHAR` and `TO_DATE` functions, ensuring proper date formatting. Additionally, it orders the results by temperature descending while handling NULL values appropriately, providing the top 3 dates with the highest average temperatures for station number 723758.
