2025-02-10 11:02:18 - root - INFO - Thank you for pointing out the error. The issue arises because the dates in the `"mth"` column are in the format `'YYYY-MM-DD'`, but the `TO_DATE` function in the query is using the format `'YYYY-MM'`. This mismatch causes the parsing error.

Here's the corrected query with the appropriate date format:

```sql
-- 9. Assign time steps to each month for products 4160 and 7790
SELECT "product_id", "mth", "qty",
  DATEDIFF(month, TO_DATE('2016-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE("mth", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) + 1 AS "time_step"
FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
WHERE "product_id" IN (4160, 7790)
  AND "mth" BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2018-12-01'
ORDER BY "product_id", "mth"
LIMIT 100;
```

Alternatively, if the `"mth"` column is already of **DATE** data type, you can omit the `TO_DATE` conversion for that column:

```sql
-- 9. Assign time steps to each month for products 4160 and 7790
SELECT "product_id", "mth", "qty",
  DATEDIFF(month, TO_DATE('2016-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), "mth") + 1 AS "time_step"
FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
WHERE "product_id" IN (4160, 7790)
  AND "mth" BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2018-12-01'
ORDER BY "product_id", "mth"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Date Format Correction**: Changed the date format in `TO_DATE` from `'YYYY-MM'` to `'YYYY-MM-DD'` to match the `'YYYY-MM-DD'` format of the `"mth"` column.
- **Date Range Adjusted**: Updated the date range in the `WHERE` clause to include the full date `'YYYY-MM-DD'`.
- **Possible Omission of TO_DATE**: If `"mth"` is already a date type, you don't need to convert it using `TO_DATE`.

By making these adjustments, the query should run successfully and assign the correct time steps to each month for products 4160 and 7790.

2025-02-10 11:03:30 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering:

```
002031 (42601): None: SQL compilation error:
Unsupported subquery type cannot be evaluated
```

occurs because Snowflake does not support correlated scalar subqueries in the `SELECT` list that reference columns from the outer query when they cannot be decorrelated. In your query, the subquery in the `SELECT` clause references `s."mth"` from the outer query, leading to this error.

**Solution:**

To calculate the centered moving average (CMA), you can use window functions instead of scalar subqueries. Window functions are efficient and designed for such calculations. Here's how you can rewrite your query using window functions:

---

### Corrected Query Using Window Functions:

```sql
-- 10. Calculate 12-month centered moving average (CMA) for product 4160
SELECT
  s."product_id",
  s."mth",
  s."qty",
  AVG(s."qty") OVER (
    PARTITION BY s."product_id"
    ORDER BY s."mth"
    ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 6 FOLLOWING
  ) AS "cma"
FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES" s
WHERE s."product_id" = 4160
  AND s."mth" BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2018-12-01'
ORDER BY s."mth"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Window Function:**
  - The `AVG()` function is now used as a window function.
  - The `OVER` clause defines the window for each row over which the average is calculated.
  - `PARTITION BY s."product_id"` ensures the calculation is done separately for each product.
  - `ORDER BY s."mth"` sorts the data by month.
  - `ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 6 FOLLOWING` specifies the window frame to include 5 rows before and 6 rows after the current row, totaling 12 months centered around the current month.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Performance:** Window functions are generally more efficient than correlated subqueries.
  - **Avoids Errors:** Eliminates the issue of unsupported subqueries in the `SELECT` clause.
  - **Readability:** Makes the query easier to read and maintain.

### Applying Similar Corrections to Other Queries:

**11. Compute Sales-to-CMA ratio for products 4160 and 7790 during time steps 7 to 30:**

```sql
-- 11. Compute Sales-to-CMA ratio for products 4160 and 7790 during time steps 7 to 30
SELECT
  s."product_id",
  s."mth",
  s."qty",
  DATEDIFF(month, DATE '2016-01-01', s."mth") + 1 AS "time_step",
  AVG(s."qty") OVER (
    PARTITION BY s."product_id"
    ORDER BY s."mth"
    ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 6 FOLLOWING
  ) AS "cma",
  s."qty" / NULLIF(AVG(s."qty") OVER (
    PARTITION BY s."product_id"
    ORDER BY s."mth"
    ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 6 FOLLOWING
  ), 0) AS "sales_to_cma_ratio"
FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES" s
WHERE s."product_id" IN (4160, 7790)
  AND s."mth" BETWEEN '2016-07-01' AND '2018-06-01'  -- Corresponds to time steps 7 through 30
ORDER BY s."product_id", s."mth"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- Added the `DATEDIFF` function to calculate `time_step`.
- Used window functions to calculate the `cma` and `sales_to_cma_ratio`.
- Ensured that division by zero is handled with `NULLIF`.

---

**12. Prepare data for weighted regression analysis for products 4160 and 7790:**

```sql
-- 12. Prepare data for weighted regression analysis for products 4160 and 7790
SELECT
  s."product_id",
  s."mth",
  s."qty",
  DATEDIFF(month, DATE '2016-01-01', s."mth") + 1 AS "time_step",
  AVG(s."qty") OVER (
    PARTITION BY s."product_id"
    ORDER BY s."mth"
    ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 6 FOLLOWING
  ) AS "cma"
FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES" s
WHERE s."product_id" IN (4160, 7790)
  AND s."mth" BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2018-12-01'
ORDER BY s."product_id", s."mth"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Notes on Corrections:**

- **Window Functions Usage:** Replaced the scalar subqueries in the `SELECT` clause with window functions.
- **Date Handling:**
  - Used `DATE 'YYYY-MM-DD'` literals for clarity.
  - Confirmed that `"mth"` is of DATE data type; no need to use `TO_DATE` if it is.
- **Partitioning and Ordering:**
  - Partitioned by `"product_id"` to calculate statistics per product.
  - Ordered by `"mth"` to ensure calculations proceed in chronological order.
  
**Additional Adjustments:**

- **Handling Gaps in Data:**
  - The `ROWS` specification counts physical rows, so ensure there are no gaps in the `"mth"` data for accurate calculations.
  - If there are gaps, consider creating a calendar table to join and fill missing months.

- **Division by Zero:**
  - Used `NULLIF` to prevent division by zero in `sales_to_cma_ratio`.

# Explanation of Metrics

## 1. Sales-to-CMA Ratio
- **Definition**: This ratio compares actual sales to the centered moving average (CMA) of sales.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Centered Moving Average (CMA)**: The CMA is a smoothed value of sales calculated over a rolling 12-month period. It averages sales from the months before and after a given month, specifically using two overlapping windows (5 months before and 6 months after, and vice versa).
  - **Sales-to-CMA Ratio**: The ratio is computed by dividing the actual sales amount for a month by its corresponding CMA value. A ratio greater than 2 indicates that the actual sales are more than twice the smoothed average for that period, suggesting significantly higher-than-average sales.

## 2. 12-Month Overlapping Windows
- **Definition**: A method to smooth sales data over time by averaging values in a specified window.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Window Size**: The window spans 12 months, with the specific approach involving overlapping periods. 
  - **First Window**: For a given month, this window includes 5 months before and 6 months after.
  - **Second Window**: Another window includes 6 months before and 5 months after the given month.
  - **Averaging**: Sales data is averaged over these two overlapping windows to compute the CMA. This method smooths out fluctuations by considering both the past and future sales in the calculation.

## 3. Restriction to the 7th and 30th Months
- **Definition**: A filter applied to focus calculations within a specific range of months.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Time Range**: Only the months between the 7th and 30th time steps (which correspond to specific periods) are considered for calculating the CMA and ratio.
  - **Purpose**: This restriction is used to avoid edge effects in the data where the moving average might be less reliable (e.g., at the very beginning or end of the available data). By focusing on these months, the calculations are more stable and meaningful.

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"product_id"** (from **MONTHLY_SALES**): Used to identify products 4160 and 7790.
- **"mth"** (from **MONTHLY_SALES**): Represents the month of sales; used to filter data from January 2016 over the first 36 months.
- **"qty"** (from **MONTHLY_SALES**): Quantity sold; used to calculate sales figures for forecasting.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Filter by product IDs**: `"product_id" IN (4160, 7790)`
- **Filter by date range**: `"mth" BETWEEN '2016-01' AND '2018-12'`
- **Convert "mth" to DATE**: To perform date calculations and ordering.
- **Calculate time steps**: Using the difference in months from a start date, e.g., `"time_step" = DATEDIFF(month, '2016-01-01', TO_DATE(CONCAT("mth", '-01'), 'YYYY-MM-DD')) + 1`

Task: What is the average forecasted annual sales for products 4160 and 7790 during 2018, using monthly sales data starting from January 2016 for the first 36 months, applying seasonality adjustments from time steps 7 through 30, and employing a weighted regression method to estimate sales?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
product_id,average_forecasted_annual_sales_2018
4160,sales1:float
7790,sales2:float
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

To determine the average forecasted annual sales for products 4160 and 7790 during 2018, we used monthly sales data from January 2016 through December 2018 (36 months). We applied seasonality adjustments by calculating the Sales-to-Centered Moving Average (CMA) ratio for time steps 7 through 30. A weighted regression method was then employed to estimate the sales for 2018 based on the adjusted data..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PURCHASES', 'LOCATIONS', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_PAGES', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'ORDERS', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'PICKING_LINE', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'INVENTORY', 'PACKAGING', 'PICKING_LIST', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 11:04:52 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the average forecasted annual sales for products 4160 and 7790 during 2018, using monthly sales data starting from January 2016 for the first 36 months, applying seasonality adjustments from time steps 7 through 30, and employing a weighted regression method to estimate sales?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
product_id,average_forecasted_annual_sales_2018
4160,sales1:float
7790,sales2:float
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

To determine the average forecasted annual sales for products 4160 and 7790 during 2018, we used monthly sales data from January 2016 through December 2018 (36 months). We applied seasonality adjustments by calculating the Sales-to-Centered Moving Average (CMA) ratio for time steps 7 through 30. A weighted regression method was then employed to estimate the sales for 2018 based on the adjusted data. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
