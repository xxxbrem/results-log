Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to determine which `L1_model` has the highest occurrence for each status ('strong' and 'soft') based on the defined conditions. Here's how we can proceed:

### **Relevant Tables and Columns:**

**Table:** `STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE`

- `"name"`: Identifier for the model run. **Potential usage**: To join with other tables and group results.
- `"version"`: Version number of the model. **Potential usage**: To join and group results.
- `"step"`: Step number in the modeling process. **Potential usage**: To join and group results.
- `"model"`: Name of the model (e.g., 'Stack', 'Model_A', 'Model_B'). **Potential usage**: To distinguish between 'Stack' and non-'Stack' models.
- `"test_score"`: The test score of the model. **Potential usage**: To compare scores between 'Stack' and non-'Stack' models.

**Table:** `STACKING.STACKING.MODEL`

- `"name"`: Identifier for the model run. **Potential usage**: To join with `MODEL_SCORE`.
- `"version"`: Version number of the model. **Potential usage**: To join with `MODEL_SCORE`.
- `"step"`: Step number in the modeling process. **Potential usage**: To join with `MODEL_SCORE`.
- `"L1_model"`: The L1 model used. **Potential usage**: To identify the `L1_model` associated with each run.

### **Conditions to be Used:**

- **Identify 'Stack' and non-'Stack' models** using the `"model"` column.
- **Calculate maximum `test_score` for non-'Stack' models** for each combination of `"name"`, `"version"`, and `"step"`.
- **Compare `test_score` of 'Stack' model** with the maximum `test_score` of non-'Stack' models to determine the **status** ('strong' or 'soft'):
  - **'strong'**: When the 'Stack' model's `test_score` is greater than the maximum non-'Stack' `test_score`.
  - **'soft'**: When the 'Stack' model's `test_score` equals the maximum non-'Stack' `test_score`.

### **SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **Retrieve distinct model run names from `MODEL_SCORE`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve distinct model names (including 'Stack' and others):**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "model"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Fetch test scores for 'Stack' models:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
   WHERE "model" = 'Stack'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Fetch test scores for non-'Stack' models:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "step", "model", "test_score"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
   WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find the maximum `test_score` for non-'Stack' models for each run:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
   WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
   GROUP BY "name", "version", "step"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve `test_score` of 'Stack' models for each run:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score" AS "stack_test_score"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
   WHERE "model" = 'Stack'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List all `L1_model`s from the `MODEL` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "L1_model"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Join `MODEL_SCORE` and `MODEL` to see which `L1_model` corresponds to each `test_score`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ms."name", ms."version", ms."step", ms."model", ms."test_score", m."L1_model"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE ms
   JOIN STACKING.STACKING.MODEL m
     ON ms."name" = m."name" AND ms."version" = m."version" AND ms."step" = m."step"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Identify runs where 'Stack' model's `test_score` is greater than any non-'Stack' model's `test_score` ('strong' status):**
   ```sql
   SELECT s."name", s."version", s."step", s."test_score" AS "stack_test_score", n."max_non_stack_score"
   FROM (
     SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score"
     FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
     WHERE "model" = 'Stack'
   ) s
   JOIN (
     SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
     FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
     WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
     GROUP BY "name", "version", "step"
   ) n
     ON s."name" = n."name" AND s."version" = n."version" AND s."step" = n."step"
   WHERE s."test_score" > n."max_non_stack_score"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Identify runs where 'Stack' model's `test_score` equals the maximum non-'Stack' model's `test_score` ('soft' status):**
    ```sql
    SELECT s."name", s."version", s."step", s."test_score" AS "stack_test_score", n."max_non_stack_score"
    FROM (
      SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score"
      FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
      WHERE "model" = 'Stack'
    ) s
    JOIN (
      SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
      FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
      WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
      GROUP BY "name", "version", "step"
    ) n
      ON s."name" = n."name" AND s."version" = n."version" AND s."step" = n."step"
    WHERE s."test_score" = n."max_non_stack_score"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Count occurrences of each `L1_model` for all runs:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "occurrences"
    FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    ORDER BY "occurrences" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Find the `L1_model` associated with 'strong' runs:**
    ```sql
    SELECT m."L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "occurrences"
    FROM (
      SELECT s."name", s."version", s."step"
      FROM (
        SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score"
        FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
        WHERE "model" = 'Stack'
      ) s
      JOIN (
        SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
        FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
        WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
        GROUP BY "name", "version", "step"
      ) n
        ON s."name" = n."name" AND s."version" = n."version" AND s."step" = n."step"
      WHERE s."test_score" > n."max_non_stack_score"
    ) sr
    JOIN STACKING.STACKING.MODEL m
      ON sr."name" = m."name" AND sr."version" = m."version" AND sr."step" = m."step"
    GROUP BY m."L1_model"
    ORDER BY "occurrences" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Find the `L1_model` associated with 'soft' runs:**
    ```sql
    SELECT m."L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "occurrences"
    FROM (
      SELECT s."name", s."version", s."step"
      FROM (
        SELECT "name", "version", "step", "test_score"
        FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
        WHERE "model" = 'Stack'
      ) s
      JOIN (
        SELECT "name", "version", "step", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
        FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL_SCORE
        WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
        GROUP BY "name", "version", "step"
      ) n
        ON s."name" = n."name" AND s."version" = n."version" AND s."step" = n."step"
      WHERE s."test_score" = n."max_non_stack_score"
    ) sr
    JOIN STACKING.STACKING.MODEL m
      ON sr."name" = m."name" AND sr."version" = m."version" AND sr."step" = m."step"
    GROUP BY m."L1_model"
    ORDER BY "occurrences" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively delve into the data to understand the relationships between models, their test scores, and the `L1_model`s associated with them. By examining the output of these queries, we can gain insights into which `L1_model`s are most frequently associated with 'strong' and 'soft' statuses based on the defined conditions.Query:

Task: Which L1_model has the highest occurrence for each status ('strong,' where the maximum test score for non-'Stack' models is less than the 'Stack' score, and 'soft,' where it equals the 'Stack' score), and how many times does it occur?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Status,L1_model,Occurrences
strong,L1_model_name:str,num:int>0
soft,L1_model_name:str,num:int>0
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

In this table, for each status ('strong' and 'soft'), we list the **L1_model** with the highest occurrence and the number of times (**Occurrences**) it occurs. Since we do not have the actual data, we've specified the data types for each field..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKING': {'STACKING': ['EDA', 'FEATURE_IMPORTANCE', 'MODEL', 'MODEL_IMPORTANCE', 'MODEL_SCORE', 'PROBLEM', 'SOLUTION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 18:41:57 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which L1_model has the highest occurrence for each status ('strong,' where the maximum test score for non-'Stack' models is less than the 'Stack' score, and 'soft,' where it equals the 'Stack' score), and how many times does it occur?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Status,L1_model,Occurrences
strong,L1_model_name:str,num:int>0
soft,L1_model_name:str,num:int>0
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

In this table, for each status ('strong' and 'soft'), we list the **L1_model** with the highest occurrence and the number of times (**Occurrences**) it occurs. Since we do not have the actual data, we've specified the data types for each field. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
