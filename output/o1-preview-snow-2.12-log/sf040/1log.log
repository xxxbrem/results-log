description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

13. **Retrieve the latitude and longitude of addresses in Florida for mapping purposes:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"
    FROM "US_ADDRESSES__POI"."CYBERSYN"."US_ADDRESSES"
    WHERE "STATE" = 'FL'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Find addresses in Florida with missing ZIP codes:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "NUMBER", "STREET", "CITY"
    FROM "US_ADDRESSES__POI"."CYBERSYN"."US_ADDRESSES"
    WHERE "STATE" = 'FL' AND "ZIP" IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Explore the distribution of addresses across different cities in Florida:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "CITY", COUNT(*) AS "ADDRESS_COUNT"
    FROM "US_ADDRESSES__POI"."CYBERSYN"."US_ADDRESSES"
    WHERE "STATE" = 'FL'
    GROUP BY "CITY"
    ORDER BY "ADDRESS_COUNT" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the structure and content of the address data within Florida, aiding in identifying the largest ZIP code area and the northernmost addresses within that area. By analyzing the results of these queries, we can proceed to extract the required address numbers, street names, and street types for the top 10 northernmost addresses.Query:

Task: Find the top 10 northernmost addresses in Florida's largest zip code area. What are their address numbers, street names, and types?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To find the top 10 northernmost addresses in Florida's largest zip code area, we first identified the zip code in Florida with the most addresses. Then, we selected the addresses within that zip code, sorted them by latitude in descending order, and extracted their address numbers, street names, and street types.

```csv
NUMBER,STREET,STREET_TYPE
number1:str,street1:str,street_type1:str
number2:str,street2:str,street_type2:str

```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'US_ADDRESSES__POI': {'CYBERSYN': ['CYBERSYN_DATA_CATALOG', 'GEOGRAPHY_CHARACTERISTICS', 'GEOGRAPHY_INDEX', 'GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'POINT_OF_INTEREST_ADDRESSES_RELATIONSHIPS', 'POINT_OF_INTEREST_INDEX', 'US_ADDRESSES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
