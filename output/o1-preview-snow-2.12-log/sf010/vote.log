After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that all three queries are functionally similar and produce the same output. Each query calculates the cumulative percentages of mortgages near default in California for each recorded date in 2023 by summing the percentages of:

- Mortgages 90 to 180 days past due.
- Mortgages in forbearance.
- Mortgages in the process of foreclosure, bankruptcy, or deed in lieu.

**Comparison:**

1. **Date Filtering:**
   - **Query 0:** Uses `ts."DATE" >= '2023-01-01' AND ts."DATE" <= '2023-12-31'`.
   - **Query 1:** Uses `"DATE" BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'`.
   - **Query 2:** Uses `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "DATE") = 2023`.

   All three methods effectively filter the dates within the year 2023. However, using `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "DATE") = 2023` (as in Query 2) ensures that all dates within 2023 are included, regardless of any time components that might affect boundary conditions.

2. **Table and Schema Referencing:**
   - **Queries 0 and 2:** Use fully qualified table names with double quotes around schema, table, and column names.
   - **Query 1:** Uses the table name without quotes.

   The use of quotes is important in SQL when dealing with case-sensitive identifiers or identifiers with special characters. Using double quotes ensures that the exact table and column names are referenced, which can prevent errors.

3. **Aggregate Function and Rounding:**
   - All queries calculate `SUM("VALUE") * 100` and round the result to 4 decimal places.

4. **Ordering and Grouping:**
   - All queries group the results by `"DATE"` and order them in ascending order.

**Conclusion:**

While all three queries produce the same results, **Query 2** provides a more robust and SQL-standard approach by:

- Using `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "DATE") = 2023`, which accurately captures all dates within the year 2023 without concerns about date formats or time components.
- Using fully qualified and quoted identifiers to ensure correct table and column referencing.

Therefore, **Query 2** is the most precise and reliable option.
