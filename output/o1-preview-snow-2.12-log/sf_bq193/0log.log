Development Setup
-----------------
These instructions assume you have [git][], [python][], and `pip` installed. If
you don't have `pip` installed, you can install it with `easy_install pip`.


1. Start by getting the source:

   ```sh
   $ git clone git@github.com:mozilla/oneanddone.git
   $ cd oneanddone
   ```
   Note you may want to fork and clone the repo as described in the
   [github docs][git-clone] if you are doing active development.

2. Create a virtualenv for One and Done. Skip the first step if you already have
   `virtualenv` installed.

   ```sh
   $ pip install virtualenv
   $ virtualenv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Set up PostgreSQL locally. The [PostgreSQL Installation Documentation][postgres] explains how to do this.
   

4. Create the initial empty database; make sure it's utf8:
   ``` 
   # Log into the postgres console
   # using your username and password
   $ psql -U your_username
   ```
   In the mysql console:
   ```mysql
   CREATE DATABASE oneanddone;
   \q
   ```
   To run all parts of the application, you will eventually need to populate this empty database with some example data, especially Tasks. There are many ways to populate the database. The method you choose may depend on the kind of data you want to add.
      * Use the create/edit features of your local One and Done instance. For example sign in with an administrator account and go to the `/tasks/create/` URL of the app to create Tasks.
      * Use the Django admin section of your local One and Done instance by going to the `/admin` URL -- this also relies on an admin account. You can define Task Teams here, for example.
      * Use an external tool like PgAdmin.
      * Ask another active developer for a dump of their local database.

5. Install the requirements:
   ```sh
   $ ./bin/peep.py install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   _Note_: On OS X (in particular 10.8.5, Xcode 5.1), you may encounter the following error: `clang: error: unknown argument. '-mno-fused-madd'`. Try running peep with the `ARCHFLAGS` environment variable set, as follows: `ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future ./bin/peep.py install -r requirements/requirements.txt` 

6. Establish your local settings by copying `oneanddone/settings/local.py-dist` to
   `oneanddone/settings/local.py`:

   ```sh
   $ cp oneanddone/settings/local.py-dist oneanddone/settings/local.py
   ```
   
   The default settings in this file should work fine for a local dev environment, but the file
   is commented to describe how it can be customized. For example, if you wish to use `memcached` for caching instead of local memory, 
   you can change the `CACHES` section to read:
   ```python
   CACHES = {
       'default': {
           'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache',
           'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211',
           'TIMEOUT': 600,
       }
   }
   ```
   
7. Establish your local environment by copying `.env-dist` to `.env`:
   ```sh
   $ cp .env-dist .env
   ```

   As above, the default settings in this file should work fine for a local dev environment.

8. Initialize your database structure:
   ```sh
   $ python manage.py migrate
   ```

   Once finished, the `migrate` command should produce a message about which models have been migrated, similar to that shown below.

   ```
   Operations to perform:
     Synchronize unmigrated apps: authtoken, rest_framework, cookies, base, session_csrf
     Apply all migrations: tasks, users, sessions, admin, auth, contenttypes
   Synchronizing apps without migrations:
     Creating tables...
       Creating table authtoken_token
     Installing custom SQL...
     Installing indexes...
   Running migrations:
     Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
     Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
     Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
     Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
     Applying tasks.0001_initial... OK
     Applying users.0001_initial... OK
   ```

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **SAMPLE_CONTENTS:**
  - `"content"`: Contains the content of files, including `README.md` files. Potentially used to extract lines.
  - `"sample_path"`: Indicates the file path; used to filter for `README.md` files.
  - `"sample_repo_name"`: The repository name; used to link to other tables.
- **LANGUAGES:**
  - `"repo_name"`: Repository name; used to join with `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` on repositories.
  - `"language"`: Contains programming languages used in the repository; needs to be flattened as it's a `VARIANT` type.
- **SAMPLE_FILES:**
  - `"repo_name"`: May be used to cross-reference repositories.
  - `"path"`: Could be another way to identify `README.md` files.
- **Conditions That May Be Used:**
  - Filter where `"sample_path"` equals `'README.md'` to select only README files.
  - Exclude lines starting with `'#'` or `'//'` to remove comments.
  - Exclude empty lines (`TRIM(line) <> ''`).
  - Use `LATERAL SPLIT_TO_TABLE` to split the contents of the files into individual lines.
  - Use `TRIM`, `LIKE`, and `NOT LIKE` for string matching and filtering.

Development Setup
-----------------
These instructions assume you have [git][], [python][], and `pip` installed. If
you don't have `pip` installed, you can install it with `easy_install pip`.


1. Start by getting the source:

   ```sh
   $ git clone git@github.com:mozilla/oneanddone.git
   $ cd oneanddone
   ```
   Note you may want to fork and clone the repo as described in the
   [github docs][git-clone] if you are doing active development.

2. Create a virtualenv for One and Done. Skip the first step if you already have
   `virtualenv` installed.

   ```sh
   $ pip install virtualenv
   $ virtualenv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Set up PostgreSQL locally. The [PostgreSQL Installation Documentation][postgres] explains how to do this.
   

4. Create the initial empty database; make sure it's utf8:
   ``` 
   # Log into the postgres console
   # using your username and password
   $ psql -U your_username
   ```
   In the mysql console:
   ```mysql
   CREATE DATABASE oneanddone;
   \q
   ```
   To run all parts of the application, you will eventually need to populate this empty database with some example data, especially Tasks. There are many ways to populate the database. The method you choose may depend on the kind of data you want to add.
      * Use the create/edit features of your local One and Done instance. For example sign in with an administrator account and go to the `/tasks/create/` URL of the app to create Tasks.
      * Use the Django admin section of your local One and Done instance by going to the `/admin` URL -- this also relies on an admin account. You can define Task Teams here, for example.
      * Use an external tool like PgAdmin.
      * Ask another active developer for a dump of their local database.

5. Install the requirements:
   ```sh
   $ ./bin/peep.py install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   _Note_: On OS X (in particular 10.8.5, Xcode 5.1), you may encounter the following error: `clang: error: unknown argument. '-mno-fused-madd'`. Try running peep with the `ARCHFLAGS` environment variable set, as follows: `ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future ./bin/peep.py install -r requirements/requirements.txt` 

6. Establish your local settings by copying `oneanddone/settings/local.py-dist` to
   `oneanddone/settings/local.py`:

   ```sh
   $ cp oneanddone/settings/local.py-dist oneanddone/settings/local.py
   ```
   
   The default settings in this file should work fine for a local dev environment, but the file
   is commented to describe how it can be customized. For example, if you wish to use `memcached` for caching instead of local memory, 
   you can change the `CACHES` section to read:
   ```python
   CACHES = {
       'default': {
           'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache',
           'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211',
           'TIMEOUT': 600,
       }
   }
   ```
   
7. Establish your local environment by copying `.env-dist` to `.env`:
   ```sh
   $ cp .env-dist .env
   ```

   As above, the default settings in this file should work fine for a local dev environment.

8. Initialize your database structure:
   ```sh
   $ python manage.py migrate
   ```

   Once finished, the `migrate` command should produce a message about which models have been migrated, similar to that shown below.

   ```
   Operations to perform:
     Synchronize unmigrated apps: authtoken, rest_framework, cookies, base, session_csrf
     Apply all migrations: tasks, users, sessions, admin, auth, contenttypes
   Synchronizing apps without migrations:
     Creating tables...
       Creating table authtoken_token
     Installing custom SQL...
     Installing indexes...
   Running migrations:
     Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
     Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
     Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
     Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
     Applying tasks.0001_initial... OK
     Applying users.0001_initial... OK
   ```

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...
...
```

*Note*: The results are ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'GITHUB_REPOS': {'GITHUB_REPOS': ['SAMPLE_FILES', 'LANGUAGES', 'LICENSES', 'SAMPLE_COMMITS', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS', 'SAMPLE_REPOS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

"This uses my [Web MIDI Polyfill](https://github.com/cwilso/WebMIDIAPIShim) to add MIDI support via the [Web MIDI API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) - in fact, I partly wrote this as a test case for the polyfill and the MIDI API itself, so if you have a MIDI keyboard attached, check it out.  The polyfill uses Java to access the MIDI device, so if you're wondering why Java is loading, that's why.  It may take a few seconds for MIDI to become active - the library takes a while to load - but when the ring turns gray (instead of blue), it's ready.  If you have a native implementation of the Web MIDI API in your browser, the polyfill shouldn't load - at the time of this writing, Chrome Stable (from version 43) has the only such implementation. Earlier versions of Chrome (from version 33) can enable Web MIDI via chrome://flags/#enable-web-midi",1,

2025-02-12 18:42:06 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...

```

*Note*: The results are ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-12 18:42:47 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...

The polyfill uses Java to access the MIDI device, so if you're wondering why Java is loading, that's why.  It may take a few seconds for MIDI to become active - the library takes a while to load - but when the ring turns gray (instead of blue), it's ready.  If you have a native implementation of the Web MIDI API in your browser, the polyfill shouldn't load - at the time of this writing, Chrome Stable (from version 43) has the only such implementation.

2025-02-12 18:43:39 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...
...
```

*Note*: The results are ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

The polyfill uses Java to access the MIDI device, so if you're wondering why Java is loading, that's why.  It may take a few seconds for MIDI to become active - the library takes a while to load - but when the ring turns gray (instead of blue), it's ready.  If you have a native implementation of the Web MIDI API in your browser, the polyfill shouldn't load - at the time of this writing, Chrome Stable (from version 43) has the only such implementation.

The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...
...
```

*Note*: The results are ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
Current snswer: 
Too long, hard cut:

"This uses my [Web MIDI Polyfill](https://github.com/cwilso/WebMIDIAPIShim) to add MIDI support via the [Web MIDI API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) - in fact, I partly wrote this as a test case for the polyfill and the MIDI API itself, so if you have a MIDI keyboard attached, check it out.  The polyfill uses Java to access the MIDI device, so if you're wondering why Java is loading, that's why.  It may take a few seconds for MIDI to become active - the library takes a while to load - but when the ring turns gray (instead of blue), it's ready.  If you have a native implementation of the Web MIDI API in your browser, the polyfill shouldn't load - at the time of this writing, Chrome Stable (from version 43) has the only such implementation. Earlier versions of Chrome (from version 33) can enable Web MIDI via chrome://flags/#enable-web-midi",1,

2025-02-12 18:45:29 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...
...
```

*Note*: The results are ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

"This uses my [Web MIDI Polyfill](https://github.com/cwilso/WebMIDIAPIShim) to add MIDI support via the [Web MIDI API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) - in fact, I partly wrote this as a test case for the polyfill and the MIDI API itself, so if you have a MIDI keyboard attached, check it out.  The polyfill uses Java to access the MIDI device, so if you're wondering why Java is loading, that's why.  It may take a few seconds for MIDI to become active - the library takes a while to load - but when the ring turns gray (instead of blue), it's ready.  If you have a native implementation of the Web MIDI API in your browser, the polyfill shouldn't load - at the time of this writing, Chrome Stable (from version 43) has the only such implementation. Earlier versions of Chrome (from version 33) can enable Web MIDI via chrome://flags/#enable-web-midi",1,

2025-02-12 18:46:13 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...
...
```

*Note*: The results are ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

The polyfill uses Java to access the MIDI device, so if you're wondering why Java is loading, that's why.  It may take a few seconds for MIDI to become active - the library takes a while to load - but when the ring turns gray (instead of blue), it's ready.  If you have a native implementation of the Web MIDI API in your browser, the polyfill shouldn't load - at the time of this writing, Chrome Stable (from version 43) has the only such implementation.

2025-02-12 18:47:04 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...
...
```

*Note*: The results are ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
