K3 Dockerfiles
==========
Dockerfiles are updated for three images:
1. **k3-app** -- (~250MB) light-weight image to run a K3 program. Based on debian:jessie. It contains only the necessary dependency libraries.
2. **k3-compiler** -- (~2 GB) Image containing the GHC and GCC tool chains to compile a K3 program to binary. Based on debian:jessie
"3. **k3-dev** (~2.5 GB)  -- Larger container with additional library and application support (e.g. clang, ruby, vim, and others). It is based on debian:sid"
To build an image use the following command:
```
docker build -f k3-dev -t damsl/k3-dev:<your_tag> .
```
"(Note: Docker build now has the -f option, so you don't have to call all docker files, ""Dockerfile"")"
"The image ```damsl/k3-dev:vanilla``` which is pushed to the repo contains the K3 source built with no options. Feel free to pull, use, & re-build K3 with whatever options necessary (and re-push with a new tag if needed)."
The other scripts in here are left for legacy purposes.
Build Dependency Versions:
<pre>
- GHC: 7.10.1
- GCC: 4.9.2
- Boost: 1.57
- Mesos: 0.22.1</pre>

==========
"Copyright (c) 2003-2015, CKSource - Frederico Knabben. All rights reserved."
http://ckeditor.com - See LICENSE.md for license information.
CKEditor is a text editor to be used inside web pages. It's not a replacement
"for desktop text editors like Word or OpenOffice, but a component to be used as"
part of web applications and websites.
## Documentation
The full editor documentation is available online at the following address:
http://docs.ckeditor.com
## Installation
Installing CKEditor is an easy task. Just follow these simple steps:
1. **Download** the latest version from the CKEditor website:
"http://ckeditor.com. You should have already completed this step, but be"
sure you have the very latest version.
2. **Extract** (decompress) the downloaded file into the root of your website.
**Note:** CKEditor is by default installed in the `ckeditor` folder. You can
place the files in whichever you want though.
## Checking Your Installation
The editor comes with a few sample pages that can be used to verify that
installation proceeded properly. Take a look at the `samples` directory.
"To test your installation, just call the following page at your website:"
	http://<your site>/<CKEditor installation path>/samples/index.html
For example:

# Template Parameters
"When you launch the installation of the VM, you need to specify the following parameters:"
* `vmDnsPrefix`: this is the public DNS name for the VM that you will use interact with your console. You just need to specify an unique name.
* `adminUsername`: self-explanatory. This is the account you will use for connecting to the node
"* `adminPassword`: self-explanatory. Be aware that Azure requires passwords to have One upper case, one lower case, a special character, and a number"
* `vmSize`: The type of VM that you want to use for the node. The default size is D1_v2 but you can change that if you expect to run workloads that require more RAM or CPU resources.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **SAMPLE_FILES**

   - `"repo_name"`: Identifies the repository name; used for joining with other tables and grouping results.
   - `"path"`: File path within the repository; used to filter for files named `'README.md'`.
   - `"id"`: Unique identifier for each file; used to join with `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` to retrieve file contents.

   **Conditions:**

   - `"path" = 'README.md'`: Selects only the files named `README.md`.

2. **SAMPLE_CONTENTS**

   - `"id"`: Corresponds to the `"id"` in `SAMPLE_FILES`; used to join and retrieve the content of the files.
   - `"content"`: Contains the textual content of the files; needed to extract and analyze lines.
   - `"binary"`: Indicates whether the file is binary; used to exclude binary files (`"binary" = FALSE`).
   - `"sample_repo_name"`: Repository name; confirms the association with the repository.
   - `"sample_path"`: File path; should match `'README.md'` for consistency.

   **Conditions:**

   - `"binary" = FALSE`: Excludes binary files to focus on textual content.

3. **LANGUAGES**

   - `"repo_name"`: Identifies the repository; used to join and associate programming languages with repositories.
   - `"language"`: VARIANT type (possibly JSON) containing programming languages; needs to be flattened to extract individual languages.

   **Conditions:**

   - None specific, but the `"language"` column requires flattening to access individual language entries.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all `README.md` files in `SAMPLE_FILES`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "repo_name", "path", "id"
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."SAMPLE_FILES"
   WHERE "path" = 'README.md'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve contents of `README.md` files by joining `SAMPLE_FILES` and `SAMPLE_CONTENTS`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."content", c."sample_repo_name", c."id"
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."SAMPLE_CONTENTS" c
   JOIN "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."SAMPLE_FILES" f
     ON c."id" = f."id"
   WHERE f."path" = 'README.md'
     AND c."binary" = FALSE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get distinct repository names that have a `README.md` file:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT f."repo_name"
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."SAMPLE_FILES" f
   WHERE f."path" = 'README.md'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List repositories and their associated programming languages:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "repo_name", "language"
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."LANGUAGES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Extract individual programming languages from the `language` VARIANT column:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "repo_name", l.value::STRING AS "language_name"
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."LANGUAGES",
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "language") l
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Split the content of `README.md` files into lines:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."sample_repo_name", REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(c."content", '\n') AS "line"
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."SAMPLE_CONTENTS" c
   JOIN "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."SAMPLE_FILES" f
     ON c."id" = f."id"
   WHERE f."path" = 'README.md'
     AND c."binary" = FALSE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Select non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files:**

   ```sql
   SELECT TRIM(line) AS "line"
   FROM (
     SELECT REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(c."content", '\n') AS line
     FROM "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."SAMPLE_CONTENTS" c
     JOIN "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."SAMPLE_FILES" f
       ON c."id" = f."id"
     WHERE f."path" = 'README.md'
       AND c."binary" = FALSE
   ) sub
   WHERE TRIM(line) != ''
     AND NOT (TRIM(line) LIKE '#%' OR TRIM(line) LIKE '//%')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count the occurrences of each unique non-empty, non-commented line:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "line", COUNT(*) AS "occurrence"
   FROM (
     SELECT TRIM(line) AS "line"
     FROM (
       SELECT REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(c."content", '\n') AS line
       FROM "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."SAMPLE_CONTENTS" c
       JOIN "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."SAMPLE_FILES" f
         ON c."id" = f."id"
       WHERE f."path" = 'README.md'
         AND c."binary" = FALSE
     ) sub
     WHERE TRIM(line) != ''
       AND NOT (TRIM(line) LIKE '#%' OR TRIM(line) LIKE '//%')
   ) lines
   GROUP BY "line"
   ORDER BY "occurrence" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve programming languages for repositories containing a specific line (e.g., "Installation"):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT l."language_name", c."sample_repo_name"

    ```

*Note:* Each query progressively builds upon the previous ones to explore and understand the data relevant to the task. The queries:

- Identify `README.md` files and extract their contents.
- Split the contents into individual lines.
- Filter out empty lines and comment lines.
- Count the occurrences of each unique line.
- Extract programming languages associated with each repository.
- Combine the data to associate lines with occurrences and languages.

All column names are enclosed in double quotations as required, and each query limits the results to 100 rows to ensure manageability during testing and exploration.Query:
SELECT "repo_name", "path", "id"
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."SAMPLE_FILES"
   WHERE "path" = 'README.md'
   LIMIT 100;

K3 Dockerfiles
==========
Dockerfiles are updated for three images:
1. **k3-app** -- (~250MB) light-weight image to run a K3 program. Based on debian:jessie. It contains only the necessary dependency libraries.
2. **k3-compiler** -- (~2 GB) Image containing the GHC and GCC tool chains to compile a K3 program to binary. Based on debian:jessie
"3. **k3-dev** (~2.5 GB)  -- Larger container with additional library and application support (e.g. clang, ruby, vim, and others). It is based on debian:sid"
To build an image use the following command:
```
docker build -f k3-dev -t damsl/k3-dev:<your_tag> .
```
"(Note: Docker build now has the -f option, so you don't have to call all docker files, ""Dockerfile"")"
"The image ```damsl/k3-dev:vanilla``` which is pushed to the repo contains the K3 source built with no options. Feel free to pull, use, & re-build K3 with whatever options necessary (and re-push with a new tag if needed)."
The other scripts in here are left for legacy purposes.
Build Dependency Versions:
<pre>
- GHC: 7.10.1
- GCC: 4.9.2
- Boost: 1.57
- Mesos: 0.22.1</pre>

"Copyright (c) 2003-2015, CKSource - Frederico Knabben. All rights reserved."
http://ckeditor.com - See LICENSE.md for license information.
CKEditor is a text editor to be used inside web pages. It's not a replacement
"for desktop text editors like Word or OpenOffice, but a component to be used as"
part of web applications and websites.
## Documentation
The full editor documentation is available online at the following address:
http://docs.ckeditor.com
## Installation
Installing CKEditor is an easy task. Just follow these simple steps:
1. **Download** the latest version from the CKEditor website:
"http://ckeditor.com. You should have already completed this step, but be"
sure you have the very latest version.
2. **Extract** (decompress) the downloaded file into the root of your website.
**Note:** CKEditor is by default installed in the `ckeditor` folder. You can
place the files in whichever you want though.
## Checking Your Installation
The editor comes with a few sample pages that can be used to verify that
installation proceeded properly. Take a look at the `samples` directory.
"To test your installation, just call the following page at your website:"
	http://<your site>/<CKEditor installation path>/samples/index.html
For example:

# Template Parameters
"When you launch the installation of the VM, you need to specify the following parameters:"
* `vmDnsPrefix`: this is the public DNS name for the VM that you will use interact with your console. You just need to specify an unique name.
* `adminUsername`: self-explanatory. This is the account you will use for connecting to the node
"* `adminPassword`: self-explanatory. Be aware that Azure requires passwords to have One upper case, one lower case, a special character, and a number"
* `vmSize`: The type of VM that you want to use for the node. The default size is D1_v2 but you can change that if you expect to run workloads that require more RAM or CPU resources.

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...
...
```

*Note*: The results are ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'GITHUB_REPOS': {'GITHUB_REPOS': ['SAMPLE_FILES', 'LANGUAGES', 'LICENSES', 'SAMPLE_COMMITS', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS', 'SAMPLE_REPOS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

"This uses my [Web MIDI Polyfill](https://github.com/cwilso/WebMIDIAPIShim) to add MIDI support via the [Web MIDI API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) - in fact, I partly wrote this as a test case for the polyfill and the MIDI API itself, so if you have a MIDI keyboard attached, check it out.  The polyfill uses Java to access the MIDI device, so if you're wondering why Java is loading, that's why.  It may take a few seconds for MIDI to become active - the library takes a while to load - but when the ring turns gray (instead of blue), it's ready.  If you have a native implementation of the Web MIDI API in your browser, the polyfill shouldn't load - at the time of this writing, Chrome Stable (from version 43) has the only such implementation. Earlier versions of Chrome (from version 33) can enable Web MIDI via chrome://flags/#enable-web-midi",3,"CSS,HTML,JavaScript"

Besides it’s out of the box functionality as a model viewer, Spectacles can be seen as a foundation project that is meant to be forked by power users to build other apps; the viewer can be easily customized, extended, hacked. Spectacles should provide the lowest common denominator in terms of it’s UI and code base. It should have all of the features that all good AEC viewers should have, and ideally, nothing more. Which of course begs the question - what features should all AEC model viewers have?

For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

This is because the macro expansion itself generates a hidden loop, so the results of these statements will be confusing and unintended (type errors, infinite loops, etc). For the same reason, you can't `continue 'a` where `'a` is the label given to `block!`. The macro will catch all of these cases during expansion and produce a compile error.",1,Rust

2025-02-12 18:46:01 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...
...
```

*Note*: The results are ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

The polyfill uses Java to access the MIDI device, so if you're wondering why Java is loading, that's why.  It may take a few seconds for MIDI to become active - the library takes a while to load - but when the ring turns gray (instead of blue), it's ready.  If you have a native implementation of the Web MIDI API in your browser, the polyfill shouldn't load - at the time of this writing, Chrome Stable (from version 43) has the only such implementation.

2025-02-12 18:46:35 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...

"This uses my [Web MIDI Polyfill](https://github.com/cwilso/WebMIDIAPIShim) to add MIDI support via the [Web MIDI API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) - in fact, I partly wrote this as a test case for the polyfill and the MIDI API itself, so if you have a MIDI keyboard attached, check it out.  The polyfill uses Java to access the MIDI device, so if you're wondering why Java is loading, that's why.  It may take a few seconds for MIDI to become active - the library takes a while to load - but when the ring turns gray (instead of blue), it's ready.  If you have a native implementation of the Web MIDI API in your browser, the polyfill shouldn't load - at the time of this writing, Chrome Stable (from version 43) has the only such implementation. Earlier versions of Chrome (from version 33) can enable Web MIDI via chrome://flags/#enable-web-midi",1,"CSS, HTML, JavaScript"

2025-02-12 18:47:24 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...
...
```

*Note*: The results are ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

"This uses my [Web MIDI Polyfill](https://github.com/cwilso/WebMIDIAPIShim) to add MIDI support via the [Web MIDI API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) - in fact, I partly wrote this as a test case for the polyfill and the MIDI API itself, so if you have a MIDI keyboard attached, check it out.  The polyfill uses Java to access the MIDI device, so if you're wondering why Java is loading, that's why.  It may take a few seconds for MIDI to become active - the library takes a while to load - but when the ring turns gray (instead of blue), it's ready.  If you have a native implementation of the Web MIDI API in your browser, the polyfill shouldn't load - at the time of this writing, Chrome Stable (from version 43) has the only such implementation. Earlier versions of Chrome (from version 33) can enable Web MIDI via chrome://flags/#enable-web-midi",1,"CSS, HTML, JavaScript"

2025-02-12 18:47:58 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:

```csv
Line,Occurrence,Languages
line1:str,count1:int,language1_1:str,language1_2:str,...
line2:str,count2:int,language2_1:str,language2_2:str,...

```

*Note*: The results are ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

"This uses my [Web MIDI Polyfill](https://github.com/cwilso/WebMIDIAPIShim) to add MIDI support via the [Web MIDI API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) - in fact, I partly wrote this as a test case for the polyfill and the MIDI API itself, so if you have a MIDI keyboard attached, check it out.  The polyfill uses Java to access the MIDI device, so if you're wondering why Java is loading, that's why.  It may take a few seconds for MIDI to become active - the library takes a while to load - but when the ring turns gray (instead of blue), it's ready.  If you have a native implementation of the Web MIDI API in your browser, the polyfill shouldn't load - at the time of this writing, Chrome Stable (from version 43) has the only such implementation. Earlier versions of Chrome (from version 33) can enable Web MIDI via chrome://flags/#enable-web-midi",1,"CSS, HTML, JavaScript"

2025-02-12 18:49:01 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files in GitHub repositories, excluding lines that are comments (either starting with `#` for Markdown or `//` for code comments). For each line, calculate how often each unique line appears across all repositories and return a comma-separated list of the programming languages used in each repository containing that line, sorted alphabetically, with the results ordered by the frequency of occurrence in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The non-empty, non-commented lines from `README.md` files, their occurrence across repositories, and the programming languages used in those repositories are presented below:
