After comparing both SQL statements and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct and more efficient query for the following reasons:

- **Efficiency and Simplicity**: `1result.sql` avoids the extra step of calculating per-user page views in a subquery (`per_user_views`). Instead, it directly calculates the total page views and the average by dividing by the number of unique users. This makes the query simpler and more efficient.

- **Accurate Results**: Both queries produce the same results, but `1result.sql` achieves this with less complexity. It accurately computes the average number of page views per user by using `COUNT(*) / COUNT(DISTINCT "USER_PSEUDO_ID")`, which is mathematically equivalent to averaging the page views per user.

- **Readability**: The query in `1result.sql` is more straightforward and easier to read, which is helpful for maintenance and future modifications.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**
