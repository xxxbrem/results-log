After analyzing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL for solving the task.

**Reasoning:**

- **Understanding the Task:** The goal is to determine which **quickplay event type** had the lowest user retention rate during the second week after users' initial engagement between August 1 and August 15, 2018, measured by the presence of `session_start` events.

- **Definition of Quickplay Event Type:** In this context, the quickplay event type refers to the different types of quickplay games or modes, which are identified by the **`board` parameter** (`'S'`, `'M'`, `'L'`) within the `event_params` of quickplay events.

- **Comparison of SQL Queries:**

  - **`1result.sql`:**
    - This query groups data based on the **`event_name`** (e.g., `'level_start_quickplay'`, `'level_complete_quickplay'`).
    - It calculates the retention rate for different event names, which represent actions within the quickplay mode, not different types of quickplay events.
    - Therefore, it doesn't accurately capture the different quickplay event types as required by the task.

  - **`2result.sql`:**
    - This query correctly extracts the **`board` parameter** from the `event_params` using `LATERAL FLATTEN` to identify the quickplay event types (`'S'`, `'M'`, `'L'`).
    - It calculates the retention rate based on these extracted quickplay event types.
    - It considers the initial engagement timestamp and checks for `session_start` events occurring in the second week after initial engagement.

- **Conclusion:**
  - **`2result.sql`** aligns with the task's requirements by accurately identifying the quickplay event types and calculating the user retention rate based on them.
  - It provides the necessary analysis to determine which quickplay event type had the lowest retention rate during the specified period.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

2result.sql
