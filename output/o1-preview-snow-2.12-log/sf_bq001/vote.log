After reviewing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script that accurately answers the task.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Transactions Identification:**
   - **`1result.sql`** accurately identifies transactions by extracting the `"transactionId"` from the `"hits"` array using `LATERAL FLATTEN`. This ensures that all transaction events are captured, as transactions are recorded at the hit level in Google Analytics data.
   - **`0result.sql`** relies on `"totals":"transactions"` from the session level, which may miss transactions not recorded at the session level or misrepresent the actual number of transactions.
   - **`2result.sql`** also extracts transactions from the `"hits"` array but uses `MIN("date")` to determine first visits and transactions, which may lack precision when multiple sessions occur on the same day.

2. **First Visit Determination:**
   - **`1result.sql`** determines the first visit per visitor by assigning a row number based on `"visitStartTime"` and selecting where `rn = 1`. This approach accurately captures the earliest session for each visitor in February 2017.
   - **`0result.sql`** uses `MIN("visitStartTime")` but may not align the first transaction precisely with the first visit if multiple sessions occur close in time.
   - **`2result.sql`** uses `MIN("date")`, potentially grouping multiple sessions on the same day and not distinguishing the exact sequence of visits and transactions.

3. **Elapsed Days Calculation:**
   - **`1result.sql`** calculates the days elapsed between the first visit and the first transaction using `DATEDIFF('day', TO_DATE(fv."visitDate", 'YYYYMMDD'), TO_DATE(ft."transactionDate", 'YYYYMMDD'))`. This method provides an accurate day count, considering only the dates and not the time components, which satisfies the requirement.
   - **`0result.sql`** uses `DATEDIFF('day', TO_TIMESTAMP(fv."firstVisitTimeInFeb"), TO_TIMESTAMP(ft."firstTransactionTime"))`, which includes time components and could result in partial days being counted or rounded inconsistently.
   - **`2result.sql`** also uses dates but, as mentioned, may lack precision due to the use of `MIN("date")`.

4. **Device Type Identification:**
   - **`1result.sql`** correctly captures the device type used during the first transaction by selecting `"device":"deviceCategory"` from the session where the first transaction occurred.
   - The other scripts also attempt this, but given the issues above, **`1result.sql`** provides the most reliable and accurate results.

**Conclusion:**

By accurately extracting transactions, determining first visits and transactions based on precise timestamps, and correctly calculating the days elapsed, **`1result.sql`** best fulfills the requirements of the task.
