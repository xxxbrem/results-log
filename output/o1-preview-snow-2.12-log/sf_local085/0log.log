```

This query corrects the previous one by converting the `"shippeddate"` and `"requireddate"` columns from `VARCHAR` to `DATE` format using the `TO_DATE` function with the format `'YYYY-MM-DD'`. This allows for accurate date comparisons. The query counts the number of late orders per employee, orders them in descending order of late orders, and limits the results to 100 rows.

2025-02-10 13:09:36 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering the error because there are records in the `"shippeddate"` column that contain empty strings (`''`) instead of `NULL`s. When you attempt to parse these empty strings into dates using the `TO_DATE` function, it results in the error:

```
100097 (22007): Can't parse '' as date with format 'YYYY-MM-DD'
```

**Cause of the Error:**

- **Empty Strings:** The `"shippeddate"` column contains empty strings which cannot be parsed into dates.
- **Date Conversion:** The `TO_DATE` function cannot convert an empty string to a date, leading to the error.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that you only attempt to parse non-empty, non-null date strings. There are a couple of ways to handle this.

---

### **Option 1: Exclude Empty Strings Before Parsing**

Modify your query to exclude records where `"shippeddate"` or `"requireddate"` are empty strings or `NULL` before attempting to parse them.

```sql
SELECT "employeeid", COUNT("orderid") AS "late_orders"
FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
WHERE "shippeddate" IS NOT NULL AND "shippeddate" != ''
  AND "requireddate" IS NOT NULL AND "requireddate" != ''
  AND TO_DATE("shippeddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD') >= TO_DATE("requireddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD')
GROUP BY "employeeid"
ORDER BY "late_orders" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Filter Out Empty Strings:** The conditions `"shippeddate" != ''` and `"requireddate" != ''` ensure that empty strings are excluded.
- **Convert to Date:** Now, `TO_DATE` will only be applied to valid date strings.

---

### **Option 2: Use `TRY_TO_DATE` Function**

The `TRY_TO_DATE` function attempts to convert a string to a date and returns `NULL` if it fails, instead of throwing an error.

```sql
SELECT "employeeid", COUNT("orderid") AS "late_orders"
FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
WHERE TRY_TO_DATE("shippeddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL
  AND TRY_TO_DATE("requireddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL
  AND TRY_TO_DATE("shippeddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD') >= TRY_TO_DATE("requireddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD')
GROUP BY "employeeid"
ORDER BY "late_orders" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Safe Conversion:** `TRY_TO_DATE` returns `NULL` for invalid date strings, preventing errors during conversion.
- **Filter Non-Convertible Dates:** The conditions `TRY_TO_DATE("shippeddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL` ensure that only rows with valid dates are considered.

---

### **Option 3: Combine Filters and Safe Conversion**

For robustness, you can combine both methods.

```sql
SELECT "employeeid", COUNT("orderid") AS "late_orders"
FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
WHERE ("shippeddate" IS NOT NULL AND "shippeddate" != '')
  AND ("requireddate" IS NOT NULL AND "requireddate" != '')
  AND TRY_TO_DATE("shippeddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD') >= TRY_TO_DATE("requireddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD')
GROUP BY "employeeid"
ORDER BY "late_orders" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Calculating Late Order Percentage for Employees with More Than 50 Total Orders**

To answer your original task, we need to:

1. **Calculate Total Orders per Employee.**
2. **Calculate Late Orders per Employee.**
3. **Calculate Late Order Percentage.**
4. **Filter Employees with More Than 50 Total Orders.**
5. **Select Top Three Employees with Highest Late Order Percentage.**

Here's the comprehensive query:

```sql
SELECT
  "employeeid",
  COUNT("orderid") AS "total_orders",
  COUNT(CASE WHEN TRY_TO_DATE("shippeddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD') >= TRY_TO_DATE("requireddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD') THEN 1 END) AS "late_orders",
  (COUNT(CASE WHEN TRY_TO_DATE("shippeddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD') >= TRY_TO_DATE("requireddate", 'YYYY-MM-DD') THEN 1 END) * 100.0) / COUNT("orderid") AS "late_order_percentage"
FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
WHERE ("shippeddate" IS NOT NULL AND "shippeddate" != '')
  AND ("requireddate" IS NOT NULL AND "requireddate" != '')
GROUP BY "employeeid"
HAVING COUNT("orderid") > 50
ORDER BY "late_order_percentage" DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Total Orders:** `COUNT("orderid")` computes the total number of orders per employee.
- **Late Orders:** `COUNT(CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 END)` counts orders where the shipped date is on or after the required date.
- **Late Order Percentage:** `(late_orders * 100.0) / total_orders` calculates the percentage.
- **Filter Employees:** `HAVING COUNT("orderid") > 50` ensures only employees with more than 50 orders are considered.
- **Order and Limit:** `ORDER BY "late_order_percentage" DESC LIMIT 3` selects the top three employees.

---

### **Final Output**

Based on the query, your final result should be formatted as:

```csv
EmployeeID,Number_of_Late_Orders,Late_Order_Percentage
employee_id1:int,num_late_orders1:int,percent_late_orders1:float [0,100]
employee_id2:int,num_late_orders2:int,percent_late_orders2:float [0,100]
employee_id3:int,num_late_orders3:int,percent_late_orders3:float [0,100]
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

---

**Additional Notes:**

- **Date Format:** Ensure the date strings in your data match the `'YYYY-MM-DD'` format used in `TO_DATE` or `TRY_TO_DATE`. Adjust the format string if necessary.
- **Empty Strings vs. NULLs:** Be cautious with empty strings in your data. Always check for both `NULL` and `''` when filtering out invalid data.
- **Data Validation:** It's good practice to validate and clean your data to prevent such errors.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:** Execute the adjusted query in your environment.
- **Verify Results:** Check the output to ensure it meets your expectations.
- **Let Me Know:** If you encounter further issues or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Begin Exploring Related Columns
Relevant tables and columns:

- **ORDERS:**
  - `"employeeid"`: Identifies the employee associated with each order.
  - `"orderid"`: Unique identifier for each order.
  - `"requireddate"`: The date by which the customer requires the order.
  - `"shippeddate"`: The date the order was actually shipped.
- **EMPLOYEES:**
  - `"employeeid"`: Unique identifier for each employee.
  - `"lastname"` and `"firstname"`: Employee names (if needed for reference).

Conditions that may be used:

- **Late Order Condition:** An order is late if `"shippeddate"` is on or after `"requireddate"`.
- **Employee Order Count:** Only consider employees with more than 50 total orders.
- **Data Filtering:** Handling date formats carefully since dates are stored as `VARCHAR`.

---

Below are 10 different SQL queries to explore the data. Each query aims to understand the relevant columns and data distributions.

---

1. **Select all employees from the EMPLOYEES table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."EMPLOYEES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get a list of distinct employee IDs from the ORDERS table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "employeeid" 
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count total orders per employee:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "employeeid", COUNT("orderid") AS "total_orders"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   GROUP BY "employeeid"
   ORDER BY "total_orders" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List orders where the shipped date is on or after the required date (late orders):**

   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   WHERE "shippeddate" >= "requireddate"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count late orders per employee:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "employeeid", COUNT("orderid") AS "late_orders"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   WHERE "shippeddate" >= "requireddate"
   GROUP BY "employeeid"
   ORDER BY "late_orders" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Select orders with missing shipped dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   WHERE "shippeddate" IS NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get the distribution of required dates to understand the date format:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "requireddate" 
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   ORDER BY "requireddate"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Compute the percentage of late orders per employee:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     "employeeid",
     COUNT(CASE WHEN "shippeddate" >= "requireddate" THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT("orderid") AS "late_order_percentage"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   GROUP BY "employeeid"
   ORDER BY "late_order_percentage" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find employees with more than 50 total orders:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "employeeid", COUNT("orderid") AS "total_orders"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   GROUP BY "employeeid"
   HAVING COUNT("orderid") > 50
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List employee IDs along with their total orders and late orders count:**

    ```sql
    SELECT 
      "employeeid",
      COUNT("orderid") AS "total_orders",
      COUNT(CASE WHEN "shippeddate" >= "requireddate" THEN 1 END) AS "late_orders"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
    GROUP BY "employeeid"
    ORDER BY "employeeid"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

These queries help in understanding the data distribution, date formats, and calculations needed to determine the top three employees with the highest percentage of late orders among those who have more than 50 total orders.Query:

Task: Among employees who have more than 50 total orders, which three have the highest percentage of late orders, where an order is considered late if the shipped date is on or after its required date? Please list each employee's ID, the number of late orders, and the corresponding late-order percentage.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
EmployeeID,Number_of_Late_Orders,Late_Order_Percentage
employee_id1:int,num_late_orders1:int,percent_late_orders1:float [0,100]
employee_id2:int,num_late_orders2:int,percent_late_orders2:float [0,100]
employee_id3:int,num_late_orders3:int,percent_late_orders3:float [0,100]
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

This table lists the top three employees who have more than 50 total orders and the highest percentages of late orders. Each row includes the employee's ID, the number of late orders they have, and the percentage of their orders that are late (without the '%' symbol)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'NORTHWIND': {'NORTHWIND': ['EMPLOYEES', 'REGION', 'TERRITORIES', 'CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD', 'EMPLOYEETERRITORIES', 'USSTATES', 'CUSTOMERDEMOGRAPHICS', 'ORDERS', 'ORDER_DETAILS', 'PRODUCTS', 'SHIPPERS', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CATEGORIES', 'CUSTOMERCUSTOMERDEMO', 'SUPPLIERS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
