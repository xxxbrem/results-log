This query retrieves orders where the shipped date is **after** the required date, indicating orders that were shipped later than required. Since the previous query returned no data (perhaps because there are no orders with a missing shipped date), adjusting the condition to `"shippeddate" > "requireddate"` will provide relevant data.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.EMPLOYEES`
  - `"employeeid"`: Used to identify each employee.
  
- **Table:** `NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS`
  - `"employeeid"`: Links each order to the employee who handled it.
  - `"orderid"`: Used to count the total number of orders per employee.
  - `"requireddate"`: The date by which the order was required.
  - `"shippeddate"`: The actual date the order was shipped.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `"shippeddate" >= "requireddate"`: Identifies late orders.
- `GROUP BY "employeeid"`: Aggregates data per employee.
- `HAVING COUNT(*) > 50`: Filters employees with more than 50 total orders.
- `ORDER BY "late_order_percentage" DESC`: Ranks employees by their late order percentage.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all employees with their total number of orders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "employeeid", COUNT(*) AS "total_orders"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   GROUP BY "employeeid"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find employees who have handled more than 50 orders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "employeeid", COUNT(*) AS "total_orders"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   GROUP BY "employeeid"
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 50
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all orders that were shipped on or after their required date (late orders):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "orderid", "employeeid", "requireddate", "shippeddate"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   WHERE "shippeddate" >= "requireddate"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count the number of late orders per employee:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "employeeid", COUNT(*) AS "late_orders"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   WHERE "shippeddate" >= "requireddate"
   GROUP BY "employeeid"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate the total number of orders and late orders for each employee:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "employeeid",
          COUNT(*) AS "total_orders",
          SUM(CASE WHEN "shippeddate" >= "requireddate" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "late_orders"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   GROUP BY "employeeid"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Compute the percentage of late orders for each employee:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "employeeid",
          SUM(CASE WHEN "shippeddate" >= "requireddate" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS "late_order_percentage"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   GROUP BY "employeeid"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Identify employees with more than 50 orders and their late order percentages:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "employeeid",
          COUNT(*) AS "total_orders",
          SUM(CASE WHEN "shippeddate" >= "requireddate" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS "late_order_percentage"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   GROUP BY "employeeid"
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 50
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List the top 10 employees with the highest number of late orders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "employeeid", COUNT(*) AS "late_orders"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   WHERE "shippeddate" >= "requireddate"
   GROUP BY "employeeid"
   ORDER BY "late_orders" DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

9. **Retrieve employee IDs and their corresponding late orders along with order details:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "employeeid", "orderid", "requireddate", "shippeddate"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   WHERE "shippeddate" >= "requireddate"
   ORDER BY "employeeid"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find the earliest and latest shipped dates for each employee:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "employeeid",
           MIN("shippeddate") AS "earliest_shipped_date",
           MAX("shippeddate") AS "latest_shipped_date"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
    GROUP BY "employeeid"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **List all distinct employees who have late orders:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "employeeid"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
    WHERE "shippeddate" >= "requireddate"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Calculate the average number of orders per employee:**
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(order_count) AS "average_orders_per_employee"
    FROM (
      SELECT "employeeid", COUNT(*) AS order_count
      FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
      GROUP BY "employeeid"
    ) AS subquery;
    ```

13. **Find employees with the highest late order percentages (without filtering by total orders):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "employeeid",
           SUM(CASE WHEN "shippeddate" >= "requireddate" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS "late_order_percentage"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
    GROUP BY "employeeid"
    ORDER BY "late_order_percentage" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List employees along with the total number of customers they have served:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "employeeid", COUNT(DISTINCT "customerid") AS "num_customers"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
    GROUP BY "employeeid"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Retrieve orders where the shipped date is missing (orders not yet shipped):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "orderid", "employeeid", "requireddate", "shippeddate"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
    WHERE "shippeddate" IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Among employees who have more than 50 total orders, which three have the highest percentage of late orders, where an order is considered late if the shipped date is on or after its required date? Please list each employee's ID, the number of late orders, and the corresponding late-order percentage.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
EmployeeID,Number_of_Late_Orders,Late_Order_Percentage
employee_id1:int,num_late_orders1:int,percent_late_orders1:float [0,100]
employee_id2:int,num_late_orders2:int,percent_late_orders2:float [0,100]
employee_id3:int,num_late_orders3:int,percent_late_orders3:float [0,100]
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

This table lists the top three employees who have more than 50 total orders and the highest percentages of late orders. Each row includes the employee's ID, the number of late orders they have, and the percentage of their orders that are late (without the '%' symbol)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'NORTHWIND': {'NORTHWIND': ['EMPLOYEES', 'REGION', 'TERRITORIES', 'CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD', 'EMPLOYEETERRITORIES', 'USSTATES', 'CUSTOMERDEMOGRAPHICS', 'ORDERS', 'ORDER_DETAILS', 'PRODUCTS', 'SHIPPERS', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CATEGORIES', 'CUSTOMERCUSTOMERDEMO', 'SUPPLIERS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
