After reviewing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Proportional Allocation:** `1result.sql` accurately allocates each tract's population and income to the zip codes based on the overlapping area between their geographic boundaries. It calculates the weighted population by multiplying the tract's population with the ratio of the overlapping area to the tract's total area.

- **5-Mile Radius Filter:** The query correctly filters the zip codes to include only those within a 5-mile radius of the specified point at latitude **47.685833°N** and longitude **-122.191667°W**.

- **Correct Calculations:** It computes the total population and the average individual income for each zip code, rounding the average income to one decimal place as required.

- **Accurate Results:** The results from `1result.sql` align with the expected values, showing the zip codes sorted by average individual income in descending order.

**Output:**
