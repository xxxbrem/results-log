1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

After carefully comparing the three SQL scripts (`0result.sql`, `1result.sql`, and `2result.sql`) and their corresponding results, `1result.sql` emerges as the most accurate and correct answer to the task for the following reasons:

1. **Complete Data Coverage:**
   - Both `0result.sql` and `1result.sql` include all tables representing the sessions from January 1, 2017 (`GA_SESSIONS_20170101`) through June 30, 2017 (`GA_SESSIONS_20170630`), ensuring comprehensive data coverage for the first half of 2017.
   - In contrast, `2result.sql` appears to omit certain dates and sessions, as it skips some tables (e.g., it's missing `GA_SESSIONS_20170102`, `GA_SESSIONS_20170103`, etc.), leading to incomplete data and potentially inaccurate results.

2. **Consistent and Accurate Results:**
   - The total product revenue calculated in `1result.sql` is slightly higher (`581,583.0783` million) compared to `0result.sql` (`581,455.1983` million). This suggests that `1result.sql` may have captured all relevant data more accurately.
   - The maximum daily, weekly, and monthly product revenues are consistent between `0result.sql` and `1result.sql`, but the higher total revenue in `1result.sql` indicates a more precise aggregation.

3. **Clearer and More Structured SQL Code:**
   - `1result.sql` uses well-named Common Table Expressions (CTEs) like `flattened`, `total_revenue`, `top_source`, `daily_revenues`, `weekly_revenues`, etc., making the SQL script more readable and maintainable.
   - This clear structure facilitates better understanding and verification of the query logic, ensuring that each step accurately contributes to the final result.

4. **Accurate Identification of the Top Traffic Source:**
   - Both `0result.sql` and `1result.sql` identify `(direct)` as the top-performing traffic source in terms of total product revenue during the first half of 2017.
   - However, due to the reasons above, `1result.sql` provides a more reliable calculation of the total revenue associated with `(direct)`.

5. **Alignment with the Task Requirements:**
   - The task requires determining the traffic source that generated the highest total product revenue during the specified period and finding the maximum daily, weekly, and monthly product revenues for that source.
   - `1result.sql` fulfills these requirements thoroughly by aggregating and calculating the necessary metrics accurately over the entire dataset.

**Conclusion:**

Given the comprehensive data inclusion, accurate calculations, clearer code structure, and precise fulfillment of the task requirements, `1result.sql` is the correct SQL script to answer the task effectively.
