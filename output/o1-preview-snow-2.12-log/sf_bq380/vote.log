Upon comparing both SQL queries and their results, we can see that both queries are functionally similar and produce the same output. However, let's analyze them for any differences that might affect their correctness.

**First SQL (0result.sql):**

- Uses the `WITH` clause to create two subqueries: `Received` and `Given`.
- Calculates the total number of distinct upvotes **received** by each user using the `ToUserId`.
- Calculates the total number of distinct upvotes **given** by each user using the `FromUserId`.
- Joins the `Received` subquery with the `USERS` table to get usernames.
- Performs a `LEFT JOIN` with the `Given` subquery to include users who may not have given any upvotes.
- Orders the results by the total upvotes received in descending order.
- Limits the results to the top 3 users.

**Second SQL (1result.sql):**

- Structurally very similar to the first SQL.
- Uses slightly different formatting and quotation styles for the schema and table names.
- The logic and calculations are identical to the first SQL.

**Reason for Choosing 0result.sql:**

- The first SQL (`0result.sql`) adheres closely to standard SQL formatting and conventions.
- It uses clear aliases and ensures that all necessary columns are appropriately selected and joined.
- The result aligns exactly with the task requirements, providing the usernames and the total distinct upvotes received and given, sorted as specified.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

0result.sql
