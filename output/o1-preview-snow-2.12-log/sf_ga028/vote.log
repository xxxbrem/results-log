After analyzing both SQL queries and their corresponding results, we can determine which one correctly performs the 7-day retention analysis as per the task requirements.

**Key Requirements of the Task:**

1. **Identify Users:**
   - Users who had their **first session start** during the week starting on **July 2, 2018** (Week 0).
   - Use the **'session_start'** events to determine the first session.

2. **Calculate Retention:**
   - For each week from Week 1 to Week 4, count the number of these users who were active.
   - Only include events up to **October 2, 2018**.
   - Group dates by **Monday-based weeks**.

### **Analysis of 0result.sql**

**Overview:**

- **Cohort Definition:**
  - Uses `user_first_touch_timestamp` to identify users.
  - Filters users whose `user_first_touch_timestamp` is between July 2 and July 8, 2018.

- **Event Selection:**
  - Events are selected from specific date tables corresponding to Weeks 1 to 4.
  - Uses `event_timestamp` to determine event weeks.

- **Calculation:**
  - Counts the total number of users in the cohort.
  - Counts the number of users active in each week by checking `event_week`.

**Issues:**

1. **Cohort Definition Misalignment:**
   - The task specifies using the **first 'session_start' event** for cohort identification.
   - `user_first_touch_timestamp` may not accurately reflect the first 'session_start' event within this data.
   - It might include users who installed the app earlier but didn't start a session until after July 2, or those who reinstalled the app.

2. **Potential Data Gaps:**
   - Only includes specific date tables for events.
   - May miss events or users if they are not present in those tables.

3. **Lower User Counts:**
   - The total number of users in Week 0 is **222**, which seems low given the dataset size.
   - Might indicate incomplete data retrieval or incorrect filtering.

### **Analysis of 2result.sql**

**Overview:**

- **Cohort Definition:**
  - Identifies users whose **first 'session_start' event** occurred between July 2 and July 8, 2018.
  - Accurately captures users who first engaged with the app in Week 0.

- **Event Selection:**
  - Collects all events up to October 2, 2018, ensuring comprehensive data.
  - Calculates `week_start_date` based on Monday-based weeks.
  - Determines `week_number` relative to Week 0.

- **Calculation:**
  - Counts the total number of users in the cohort.
  - For Weeks 1 to 4, counts users who had any event activity.
  - Groups events by week numbers.

**Advantages:**

1. **Correct Cohort Identification:**
   - Aligns with the task by using the first 'session_start' event.
   - Ensures that only users who started using the app in Week 0 are included.

2. **Comprehensive Event Data:**
   - Includes all events up to October 2, 2018.
   - Reduces the risk of missing user activity due to excluded dates.

3. **Accurate Weekly Grouping:**
   - Uses `DATEADD` and `DAYOFWEEK` functions to align weeks to Mondays.
   - Calculates week numbers relative to Week 0, which simplifies retention calculation.

4. **Plausible User Counts:**
   - Week 0 has **1,374** users, which is more reasonable for an app's user base.
   - Retention numbers for subsequent weeks are consistent and logical.

### **Conclusion**

- **2result.sql** more accurately fulfills the task requirements by:

  - Correctly identifying the cohort based on the first 'session_start' event in Week 0.
  - Including all necessary event data up to October 2, 2018.
  - Appropriately grouping dates by Monday-based weeks.
  - Providing plausible and consistent user counts for retention analysis.

- **0result.sql** fails to meet the task specifications due to:

  - Incorrect cohort definition using `user_first_touch_timestamp`.
  - Potentially missing data due to limited event selection.
  - Unrealistically low user counts, indicating possible data issues.
