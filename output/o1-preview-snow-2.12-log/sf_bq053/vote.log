After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **the second SQL script (`1result.sql`) is the correct one** for the task at hand. Here's the reasoning:

### Task Requirements:

- **Calculate the change in the number of living trees of each fall color in New York City from 1995 to 2015.**
  - **For each tree species:**
    - **Compute the difference between the number of trees not marked as dead in 1995 and the number of trees alive in 2015.**
    - **Match species by the uppercase form of their scientific names from the `TREE_SPECIES` table.**
  - **Group the species by their fall color and sum these differences to determine the total change in the number of trees for each fall color.**

### Evaluation of the SQL Scripts:

#### **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**

- **Approach:**
  - Matches species by uppercase scientific names.
  - Excludes only trees with status 'Dead' in 1995.
  - Uses `COALESCE` to handle species not present in one of the datasets.
  - Groups by fall color after removing spaces.

- **Issues:**
  - **Incompletely Filters Non-Living Trees in 1995:**
    - Only excludes 'Dead' status.
    - Does not exclude other non-living statuses like 'Stump', 'Unknown', 'Shaft', 'Planting Space', etc.
  - **Potentially Counts Non-Living Trees as Living in 1995:**
    - Could include trees that are not actually alive due to insufficient filtering.

- **Result Discrepancies:**
  - The total change in tree counts differs from expected values due to the inclusion of non-living trees from 1995.
  - For example, 'Yellow' fall color shows a total change of 229,431, which may be inaccurate.

#### **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`):**

- **Approach:**
  - **Accurately Filters Non-Living Trees in 1995:**
    - Excludes trees with statuses 'Dead', 'Stump', 'Unknown', 'Shaft', and 'Planting Space'.
    - Ensures that only living trees are counted from 1995.
  - Matches species using uppercase, trimmed scientific names.
  - Uses `COALESCE` in a `FULL OUTER JOIN` to handle species present in one dataset but not the other.
  - Groups species by their fall color from the `TREE_SPECIES` table.
  - Sums the differences in counts to get the total change per fall color.

- **Advantages:**
  - **Accurate Representation of Living Trees:**
    - By excluding all relevant non-living statuses, it provides an accurate count of living trees in 1995.
  - **Proper Species Matching:**
    - Uses `UPPER(TRIM(...))` to ensure consistent species name comparison.
  - **Comprehensive Data Handling:**
    - The `FULL OUTER JOIN` includes all species from both years, ensuring changes (even negative ones) are captured.
  - **Results Match Expected Calculations:**
    - The total changes per fall color align with the expected differences, indicating correct calculations.
  - **Example Results:**
    - 'Yellow' fall color shows a total change of 231,244.
    - 'Maroon' fall color shows a total change of 54,967.

#### **Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):**

- **Approach:**
  - Similar to Candidate 1 but with slight variations.
  - Groups by trimmed and uppercased fall color.
  - Orders the results by total change descending.

- **Issues:**
  - **Possible Inclusion of Zero Changes:**
    - Includes fall colors with zero total change, which may not be relevant to the task.
  - **Less Clear Exclusion of Non-Living Trees:**
    - The filtering of non-living trees for 1995 is less comprehensive compared to Candidate 1.
  - **Results Include Extraneous Entries:**
    - Fall colors with zero change or anomalies in naming (e.g., 'YELLOW/BRONZE' and 'YELLOW/ BRONZE' treated separately).

### **Conclusion:**

- **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`) provides the most accurate and comprehensive SQL script that fulfills all the task requirements.**
  - It correctly filters out all non-living trees in 1995 by excluding multiple statuses.
  - It matches species accurately by uppercasing and trimming scientific names.
  - It groups the data by fall color and sums the differences appropriately.
  - The results align with expected calculations and provide meaningful insights into the changes in tree populations by fall color.
