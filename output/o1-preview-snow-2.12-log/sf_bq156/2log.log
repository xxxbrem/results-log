**Correction:**

I have simplified the previous query by removing the condition `m."Study" = 'LGG'`. It seems that the `Study` column in the `MC3_MAF_V5_ONE_PER_TUMOR_SAMPLE` table may not match or may not contain the study code 'LGG'. By removing this condition, we can retrieve participants with TP53 mutations regardless of their study, and then join with the expression data filtered by `e."Study" = 'LGG'`. This should return the expression levels of gene **DRG2** for participants in the **LGG** study who have TP53 mutations.

# Welch's t-test

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In statistics, Welch's t-test, or unequal variances t-test, is a two-sample location test which is used to test the (null) hypothesis that two populations have equal means. It is named for its creator, Bernard Lewis Welch, and is an adaptation of Student's t-test, and is more reliable when the two samples have unequal variances and possibly unequal sample sizes. These tests are often referred to as "unpaired" or "independent samples" t-tests, as they are typically applied when the statistical units underlying the two samples being compared are non-overlapping. Given that Welch's t-test has been less popular than Student's t-test and may be less familiar to readers, a more informative name is "Welch's unequal variances t-test" — or "unequal variances t-test" for brevity.

## Assumptions

Student's t-test assumes that the sample means being compared for two populations are normally distributed, and that the populations have equal variances. Welch's t-test is designed for unequal population variances, but the assumption of normality is maintained. Welch's t-test is an approximate solution to the Behrens–Fisher problem.

## Calculations

Welch's t-test defines the statistic t by the following formula:

$$t=\frac{\triangle\overline{X}}{s_{\triangle\overline{X}}}=\frac{\overline{X}_1-\overline{X}_2}{\sqrt{s^2_{\overline{X}_1}+s^2_{\overline{X}_2}}}$$
$$s_{\overline{X}_i}=\frac{s_i}{\sqrt{N_i}}$$

where $\overline{X}_i$ and $s_{\overline{X}_i}$ are the $i$-th sample mean and its standard error, with $s_i$ denoting the corrected sample standard deviation, and sample size $N_i$. Unlike in Student's t-test, the denominator is not based on a pooled variance estimate.

The degrees of freedom $\nu$ associated with this variance estimate is approximated using the Welch–Satterthwaite equation:

$$\nu\approx\frac{(\frac{s^2_1}{N_1}+\frac{s^2_2}{N_2})^2}{\frac{s^4_1}{N^2_1\nu_1}+\frac{s^4_2}{N^2_2\nu_2}}$$

This expression can be simplified when $N_1=N_2$:
$$\nu\approx\frac{s^4_{\triangle\overline{X}}}{\nu^{-1}_1s^4_{\overline{X}_1}+\nu^{-1}_2s^4_{\overline{X}_2}}$$

Here, $\nu _{i}=N_{i}-1$ is the degrees of freedom associated with the $i$-th variance estimate.

The statistic is approximately from the t-distribution since we have an approximation of the chi-square distribution. This approximation is better done when both $N_{1}$ and $N_2$ are larger than 5.


## Example

The t-score, assuming the distributions of gene expression with and without mutation have unequal variances, is computed by using the following equation:

$$t=\frac{g_y-g_n}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_y}{N_y}+\frac{s^2_n}{N_n}}}$$

where
- $g_y$ and $g_n$ are mean gene expression of participants with and without mutation;
- $N_y$ and $N_n$ are the number of participants in the group with and without mutation;
- $s^2_y$ and $s^2_n$ are the variance of gene expression for the participants with and without mutation, respectively.
Since the Somatic mutation table contains information of positive somatic mutation only, the averages and variances needed to compute the t-score are computed as a function $S_y=\sum_{i=1}^{N_y}g_i$ and $Q_y=\sum_{i=1}^{N_y}g^2_i$, the sums over the gene expression and squared gene expression for articipants with somatic mutation.

After computing $S_y$ and $Q_y$, we can compute the mean and the variance as:

$$g_y=\frac{S_y}{N_y}$$
$$s^2_y=\frac{1}{N_y-1}[Q_y-\frac{S^2_y}{N_y}]$$

To compute $S_n$ and $Q_n$, we first compute the sums of the gene expression and squeared gene expression using all the samples and then substract $S_y$ and $Q_y$. The following query uses this approach to compute the necessary variances and means, and then computes t-score. The t-score is only computed if the variances are greater than zero and if the number of participants in each group is greater than a user defined threshold (e.g., 10).


## Statistical test

Once $t$ and $\nu$ have been computed, these statistics can be used with the t-distribution to test one of two possible null hypotheses:

- that the two population means are equal, in which a two-tailed test is applied; or
- that one of the population means is greater than or equal to the other, in which a one-tailed test is applied.

The approximate degrees of freedom are real numbers $\nu \in \mathbb {R} ^{+}$ and used as such in statistics-oriented software, whereas they are rounded down to the nearest integer in spreadsheets.

## Advantages and limitations

Welch's t-test is more robust than Student's t-test and maintains type I error rates close to nominal for unequal variances and for unequal sample sizes under normality. Furthermore, the power of Welch's t-test comes close to that of Student's t-test, even when the population variances are equal and sample sizes are balanced. Welch's t-test can be generalized to more than 2-samples, which is more robust than one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

It is not recommended to pre-test for equal variances and then choose between Student's t-test or Welch's t-test. Rather, Welch's t-test can be applied directly and without any substantial disadvantages to Student's t-test as noted above. Welch's t-test remains robust for skewed distributions and large sample sizes. Reliability decreases for skewed distributions and smaller samples, where one could possibly perform Welch's t-test

Task: Compute the t-score (rounded to 2 decimals) to compare the difference in mean expression levels of gene DRG2 between two groups (TP53 mutated vs. non-mutated) in the Lower Grade Glioma study. Note that, categorical groups with number of samples smaller than 10 or zero variance should be ignored. Refer to `t_score.md` about how to compute t-score.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
t-score
value:float
```

To compare the difference in mean expression levels of the gene **DRG2** between **TP53** mutated and non-mutated groups in the **Lower Grade Glioma** study, we compute the t-score using Welch's t-test formula. This test accounts for unequal variances and sample sizes in the two groups. Groups with fewer than 10 samples or zero variance are ignored in this calculation..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PANCANCER_ATLAS_1': {'PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED': ['ALL_CNVR_DATA_BY_GENE_FILTERED', 'CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED', 'EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED', 'JHU_USC_EDU_PANCAN_HUMANMETHYLATION27_BETAVALUE_WHITELISTED_FILTERED', 'JHU_USC_EDU_PANCAN_HUMANMETHYLATION450_BETAVALUE_WHITELISTED_FILTERED', 'JHU_USC_EDU_PANCAN_MERGED_HUMANMETHYLATION27_HUMANMETHYLATION450_BETAVALUE_WHITELISTED_FILTERED', 'MC3_MAF_V5_ONE_PER_TUMOR_SAMPLE', 'PANCANMIRS_EBADJONPROTOCOLPLATFORMWITHOUTREPSWITHUNCORRECTMIRS_08_04_16_FILTERED', 'PURITY_PLOIDY_ALL_SAMPLES_FILTERED', 'TCGA_RPPA_PANCAN_CLEAN_FILTERED']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 06:39:20 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Compute the t-score (rounded to 2 decimals) to compare the difference in mean expression levels of gene DRG2 between two groups (TP53 mutated vs. non-mutated) in the Lower Grade Glioma study. Note that, categorical groups with number of samples smaller than 10 or zero variance should be ignored. Refer to `t_score.md` about how to compute t-score., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
t-score
value:float
```

To compare the difference in mean expression levels of the gene **DRG2** between **TP53** mutated and non-mutated groups in the **Lower Grade Glioma** study, we compute the t-score using Welch's t-test formula. This test accounts for unequal variances and sample sizes in the two groups. Groups with fewer than 10 samples or zero variance are ignored in this calculation. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
