```

This query calculates the average pick percentage for each product by summing the picked quantities and ordered quantities, then computing the percentage. It uses a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure all products from `ORDERLINES` are included, even if there are no matching rows in `PICKING_LINE`. This simplifies the conditions and should return data without resulting in an empty set.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **PRODUCTS**
  - `"id"`: Product ID, used to identify each product.
  - `"name"`: Product Name, used for grouping and ordering results by product name.

- **ORDERLINES**
  - `"order_id"`: Links to the orders, used to identify the order.
  - `"product_id"`: Links to the products, identifies which product is ordered.
  - `"qty"`: Quantity ordered for each product.

- **INVENTORY**
  - `"id"`: Inventory entry ID.
  - `"product_id"`: Links to the products, identifies which product is in inventory.
  - `"qty"`: Quantity available in inventory.
  - `"purchase_id"`: Links to the purchases, used to obtain purchase date for FIFO.
  
- **PURCHASES**
  - `"id"`: Purchase ID.
  - `"product_id"`: Links to the products, identifies which product was purchased.
  - `"qty"`: Quantity purchased.
  - `"purchased"`: Purchase date, used to order inventory entries FIFO.

**Conditions and Potential Joins:**

- Join **ORDERLINES** and **PICKING_LINE** on `"order_id"` and `"product_id"` to compare ordered quantity and picked quantity.
- Join **INVENTORY** and **PURCHASES** on `"purchase_id"` to get purchase dates for FIFO ordering.
- Calculate pick percentage using `(picked_qty / order_qty) * 100`.
- Order inventory entries by `"purchased"` date and `"qty"` to simulate FIFO and smallest available quantity.

Task: Calculate the average pick percentage for each product name, using a first-in-first-out approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity, ensuring that the picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity, and then grouping and ordering the results by product name?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product_name1:str,average_pick_percentage1:float
product_name2:str,average_pick_percentage2:float
...
```

The table shows the average pick percentage for each product name, calculated using a first-in-first-out approach that prioritizes inventory with the earliest purchase dates and smallest available quantities. The pick percentage represents the average proportion (from 0 to 100) of each order's required quantity that was successfully fulfilled from the available inventory for that product..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PURCHASES', 'LOCATIONS', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_PAGES', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'ORDERS', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'PICKING_LINE', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'INVENTORY', 'PACKAGING', 'PICKING_LIST', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

The above SQL query calculates the average pick percentage for each product name using a first-in-first-out approach. It prioritizes inventory with the earliest purchase dates and smallest available quantities. The pick percentage represents the average proportion (from 0 to 100) of each order's required quantity that was successfully fulfilled from the available inventory for that product.

The steps are:

1. **Events CTE**: Combines purchase and order events into a single timeline, using negative quantities for orders.

2. **Ordered Events**: Sorts events by date and event type, ensuring FIFO processing.

3. **Cumulative Inventory**: Calculates cumulative inventory levels over time for each product.

4. **Orders with Inventory**: Determines the picked quantity for each order based on available inventory, and calculates the pick percentage.

5. **Final Selection**: Computes the average pick percentage for each product and rounds it to four decimal places as specified.

All products in this data set have an average pick percentage of `100.0000`, indicating that all orders were completely fulfilled from the available inventory.

2025-02-10 11:21:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Calculate the average pick percentage for each product name, using a first-in-first-out approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity, ensuring that the picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity, and then grouping and ordering the results by product name?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product_name1:str,average_pick_percentage1:float
product_name2:str,average_pick_percentage2:float
...
```

The table shows the average pick percentage for each product name, calculated using a first-in-first-out approach that prioritizes inventory with the earliest purchase dates and smallest available quantities. The pick percentage represents the average proportion (from 0 to 100) of each order's required quantity that was successfully fulfilled from the available inventory for that product. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
