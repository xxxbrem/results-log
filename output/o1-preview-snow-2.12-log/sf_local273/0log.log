Begin Exploring Related Columns
The relevant tables and columns for this task are:

1. **PRODUCTS**
   - **"id"**: Product identifier; used to join with other tables.
   - **"name"**: Product name; used to display product names.

2. **ORDERLINES**
   - **"product_id"**: Identifies the product ordered.
   - **"qty"**: Quantity ordered per product.
   - **"order_id"**: Links to the specific order.

3. **PICKING_LINE**
   - **"product_id"**: Identifies the product picked.
   - **"qty"**: Quantity picked per product.
   - **"location_id"**: Inventory location from which the product was picked.
   - **"order_id"**: Links to the specific order.

4. **INVENTORY**
   - **"product_id"**: Identifies the product in inventory.
   - **"qty"**: Quantity available in inventory.
   - **"purchase_id"**: Links to the purchase record to obtain purchase date.
   - **"location_id"**: Inventory location identifier.

5. **PURCHASES**
   - **"id"**: Purchase identifier; used to link with inventory records.
   - **"purchased"**: Date when the purchase was made (i.e., when inventory was received).
   - **"product_id"**: Identifies the product purchased.
   - **"qty"**: Quantity purchased.

**Potential conditions that may be used:**

- Joining `INVENTORY` with `PURCHASES` on `"purchase_id"` = `"id"` to obtain the purchase date for inventory items.
- Ordering inventory items by `"purchased"` date (earliest first) and `"qty"` (smallest first) to simulate a FIFO approach with preference for smallest available quantities.
- Calculating total quantities ordered and picked per product by grouping data from `ORDERLINES` and `PICKING_LINE`.
- Comparing picked quantities to ordered quantities to compute pick percentages.
- Ensuring that the picked quantities do not exceed the available inventory quantities.

Here are at least 10 SQL queries to explore the data:

1. **List all product IDs and names from the `PRODUCTS` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name" 
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PRODUCTS 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get distinct product IDs that have orders in `ORDERLINES`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id" 
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.ORDERLINES 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve the total quantity ordered per product:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_ordered_qty" 
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.ORDERLINES 
   GROUP BY "product_id" 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve the total quantity picked per product:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_picked_qty" 
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PICKING_LINE 
   GROUP BY "product_id" 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Join `ORDERLINES` and `PRODUCTS` to get product names and total quantities ordered:**
   ```sql
   SELECT p."name", SUM(ol."qty") AS "total_ordered_qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.ORDERLINES ol
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PRODUCTS p ON ol."product_id" = p."id"
   GROUP BY p."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join `INVENTORY` and `PURCHASES` to get inventory quantities with purchase dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", i."qty", p."purchased"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY i
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES p ON i."purchase_id" = p."id"
   ORDER BY p."purchased" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List inventory records ordered by earliest purchase date and smallest quantity:**
   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", i."qty", p."purchased"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY i
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES p ON i."purchase_id" = p."id"
   ORDER BY p."purchased" ASC, i."qty" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Retrieve product names and total quantities picked:**
   ```sql
   SELECT p."name", SUM(pl."qty") AS "total_picked_qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PICKING_LINE pl
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PRODUCTS p ON pl."product_id" = p."id"
   GROUP BY p."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Compare ordered and picked quantities per product:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ol."product_id", SUM(ol."qty") AS "total_ordered_qty",
      (SELECT SUM(pl."qty") FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PICKING_LINE pl WHERE pl."product_id" = ol."product_id") AS "total_picked_qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.ORDERLINES ol
   GROUP BY ol."product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List product IDs from `INVENTORY` that have the smallest available quantities:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", "qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY
    ORDER BY "qty" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Get the earliest purchase date for each product in `INVENTORY`:**
    ```sql
    SELECT i."product_id", MIN(p."purchased") AS "earliest_purchase_date"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY i
    JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES p ON i."purchase_id" = p."id"
    GROUP BY i."product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **List products with both ordered and picked quantities, along with their names:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT p."name"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PRODUCTS p
    WHERE p."id" IN (SELECT DISTINCT "product_id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.ORDERLINES)
      AND p."id" IN (SELECT DISTINCT "product_id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PICKING_LINE)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **View order details along with the quantities picked for each product:**
    ```sql
    SELECT ol."order_id", ol."product_id", ol."qty" AS "ordered_qty", pl."qty" AS "picked_qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.ORDERLINES ol
    LEFT JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PICKING_LINE pl ON ol."order_id" = pl."order_id" AND ol."product_id" = pl."product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Get total inventory quantities per product:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_inventory_qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY
    GROUP BY "product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Retrieve purchase details for products, including purchase dates and quantities:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", "purchased", "qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES
    ORDER BY "purchased" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help explore the relevant tables and columns, providing insight into:

- Product information and identifiers.
- Quantities ordered and picked per product.
- Inventory levels and purchase dates.
- The relationship between orders, picking operations, and inventory management.
- Conditions required to simulate a FIFO approach with preference for smaller quantities.

By analyzing the results of these queries, you can better understand how to calculate the average pick percentage per product name, while considering inventory selection based on the earliest purchase dates and smallest available quantities.Query:

Task: Calculate the average pick percentage for each product name, using a first-in-first-out approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity, ensuring that the picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity, and then grouping and ordering the results by product name?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product_name1:str,average_pick_percentage1:float
product_name2:str,average_pick_percentage2:float
...
```

The table shows the average pick percentage for each product name, calculated using a first-in-first-out approach that prioritizes inventory with the earliest purchase dates and smallest available quantities. The pick percentage represents the average proportion (from 0 to 100) of each order's required quantity that was successfully fulfilled from the available inventory for that product..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PURCHASES', 'LOCATIONS', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_PAGES', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'ORDERS', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'PICKING_LINE', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'INVENTORY', 'PACKAGING', 'PICKING_LIST', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
