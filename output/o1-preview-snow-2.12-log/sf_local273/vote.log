After reviewing the provided SQL scripts and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script for calculating the average pick percentage per product name using the specified first-in-first-out (FIFO) approach.

**Reasoning:**

- **FIFO Implementation:** `0result.sql` accurately implements the FIFO method by ordering inventory based on the earliest purchase dates and smallest available quantities. It uses window functions to calculate cumulative sums, which is essential for simulating the FIFO picking process.

- **Picked Quantity Calculation:** The script ensures that the picked quantity for each order reflects only the overlapping range between the order's required quantity and the available inventory. This is done by calculating the least of the ordered quantity and the available inventory at each step.

- **Accurate Aggregation:** By joining the cumulative calculations of orders and inventory, the script correctly computes the pick percentage for each order line. It then averages these percentages per product name, providing an accurate result.

- **Results Verification:** The output in `0result.csv` shows reasonable average pick percentages, aligning with the expected values based on the data and the FIFO methodology.

Therefore, the SQL script that best meets the requirements is:
