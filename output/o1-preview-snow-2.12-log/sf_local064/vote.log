After comparing both SQL scripts, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct one.

**Reason:**

The task specifies the following steps:

1. **Calculate the month-end balance** for each customer and each month in 2020 by adding all deposits and subtracting all withdrawals for that month.
2. **Determine the months with the highest and lowest counts of customers with positive month-end balances.**
3. **Compute the average month-end balance across all customers** for each of these two months.
4. **Provide the difference between these two averages.**

The key differences between the two SQL scripts are:

- **Handling of Zero Balances in Averages:**
  - `1result.sql` excludes customers with a net transaction amount of zero when calculating the average balance:
    ```sql
    WHERE
        "year_month" IN (SELECT "year_month" FROM target_months)
        AND "net_transaction_amount" <> 0
    ```
  - `2result.sql` includes all customers by not filtering out zero balances:
    ```sql
    WHERE mb."txn_month" IN (SELECT "txn_month" FROM selected_months)
    ```
  - **Why This Matters:** The task asks to compute the average month-end balance **across all customers**, which implies including customers with zero balances. Excluding zero balances would not align with the task's requirement.

- **Data Filtering and Consistency:**
  - Both scripts correctly filter transactions for the year 2020 and calculate month-end balances per customer.
  - `2result.sql` uses `LOWER("txn_type")` to ensure case-insensitive matching of transaction types, adding robustness in case the data contains variations in case.

- **Final Calculation:**
  - Both scripts compute the difference between the average balances of the months with the highest and lowest counts of customers with positive balances.
  - They both arrive at the same numerical result, but `2result.sql` does so while adhering strictly to the task's instructions.

**Conclusion:**

`2result.sql` accurately follows the task by including all customers in the average calculation, thereby providing the correct answer as per the requirements.
