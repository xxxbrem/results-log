Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns that can help us analyze user page visit sequences.

---

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `"LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"`
   - **Column:** `"session"`: Potential usage - Identifies user sessions; useful for tracking sequences of page visits within the same session.
   - **Column:** `"stamp"`: Potential usage - Timestamp of the action; allows ordering actions chronologically.
   - **Column:** `"path"`: Potential usage - Contains the URL paths of the pages visited by users.
   - **Column:** `"action"`: Potential usage - Describes the type of action performed; might indicate page visits.

2. **Table:** `"LOG"."LOG"."READ_LOG"`
   - **Column:** `"session"`: Potential usage - Session identification.
   - **Column:** `"stamp"`: Potential usage - Timestamp for chronological ordering.
   - **Column:** `"url"`: Potential usage - URL of the page accessed; could be useful if page visits are logged here.

3. **Table:** `"LOG"."LOG"."ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE"`
   - **Column:** `"session"`: Potential usage - Session tracking.
   - **Column:** `"stamp"`: Potential usage - Timestamp of the action.
   - **Column:** `"url"`: Potential usage - URL of the page; useful for page visit analysis.

---

**Potential Conditions:**

- Filter records where the `"path"` or `"url"` is equal to `'/detail'`.
- Order records by `"session"` and `"stamp"` to track the sequence of pages visited.
- Use window functions or self-joins to find sequences of page visits.
- Count occurrences of third-page visits following two consecutive `'/detail'` page visits.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct pages visited by users:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "path"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count total visits for each page:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "path", COUNT(*) AS "visit_count"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
   GROUP BY "path"
   ORDER BY "visit_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve all actions in a specific session ordered by time:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
   WHERE "session" = 'specific_session_id'
   ORDER BY "stamp" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find sessions where the '/detail' page was visited:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "session"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
   WHERE "path" = '/detail'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get page visit sequences for all sessions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "stamp", "path"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
   ORDER BY "session", "stamp" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Identify sessions with consecutive '/detail' page visits:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "stamp", "path",
       LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_path"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
   WHERE "path" = '/detail'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find sequences where '/detail' was visited twice in a row:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM (
       SELECT "session", "stamp", "path",
           LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_path"
       FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
   ) sub
   WHERE "path" = '/detail' AND "prev_path" = '/detail'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Retrieve third-page visits after two consecutive '/detail' visits:**

   ```sql
   SELECT sub."session", sub."stamp", sub."path"
   FROM (
       SELECT "session", "stamp", "path",
           LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_path",
           LAG("path", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_prev_path"
       FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
   ) sub
   WHERE sub."prev_prev_path" = '/detail' AND sub."prev_path" = '/detail' AND sub."path" != '/detail'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count occurrences of third-page visits after two '/detail' pages:**

   ```sql
   SELECT sub."path" AS "third_page", COUNT(*) AS "count"
   FROM (
       SELECT "session", "stamp", "path",
           LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_path",
           LAG("path", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_prev_path"
       FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
   ) sub
   WHERE sub."prev_prev_path" = '/detail' AND sub."prev_path" = '/detail' AND sub."path" != '/detail'
   GROUP BY sub."path"
   ORDER BY "count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List the top 3 most frequent third-page visits:**

    ```sql
    SELECT sub."path" AS "third_page", COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM (
        SELECT "session", "stamp", "path",
            LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_path",
            LAG("path", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_prev_path"
        FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
    ) sub
    WHERE sub."prev_prev_path" = '/detail' AND sub."prev_path" = '/detail' AND sub."path" != '/detail'
    GROUP BY sub."path"
    ORDER BY "count" DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

11. **Examine the distribution of page sequences after '/detail' visits:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "path", COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM (
        SELECT "session", "stamp", "path",
            LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_path"
        FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
    ) sub
    WHERE sub."prev_path" = '/detail'
    GROUP BY "path"
    ORDER BY "count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Get all page sequences for sessions with multiple '/detail' visits:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", ARRAY_AGG("path" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "page_sequence"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
    GROUP BY "session"
    HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN "path" = '/detail' THEN 1 END) >= 2
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Identify unique session paths after two '/detail' visits:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT sub."session", sub."path" AS "third_page"
    FROM (
        SELECT "session", "stamp", "path",
            LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_path",
            LAG("path", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_prev_path"
        FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
    ) sub
    WHERE sub."prev_prev_path" = '/detail' AND sub."prev_path" = '/detail' AND sub."path" != '/detail'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Explore actions associated with the third-page visits:**

    ```sql
    SELECT sub."path" AS "third_page", sub."action", COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM (
        SELECT "session", "stamp", "path", "action",
            LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_path",
            LAG("path", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_prev_path"
        FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
    ) sub
    WHERE sub."prev_prev_path" = '/detail' AND sub."prev_path" = '/detail' AND sub."path" != '/detail'
    GROUP BY sub."path", sub."action"
    ORDER BY "count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find timestamps of third-page visits after two '/detail' pages:**

    ```sql
    SELECT sub."session", sub."stamp" AS "third_page_time", sub."path" AS "third_page"
    FROM (
        SELECT "session", "stamp", "path",
            LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_path",
            LAG("path", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "prev_prev_path",
            LAG("stamp", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS "first_detail_time"
        FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
    ) sub
    WHERE sub."prev_prev_path" = '/detail' AND sub."prev_path" = '/detail' AND sub."path" != '/detail'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

- Understand the pages visited by users and their frequencies.
- Identify sessions where the '/detail' page is visited, especially when visited consecutively.
- Explore the sequences of page visits to find patterns.
- Count and rank third-page visits following two consecutive '/detail' visits.

By running these queries, we can gain insights into user navigation patterns and prepare to answer the original task.Query:

Task: Which three distinct third-page visits are most frequently observed immediately after two consecutive visits to the '/detail' page, and how many times does each third-page visit occur?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Third_Page,Count
page1:str,count1:int
page2:str,count2:int
page3:str,count3:int
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

Explanation: The table lists the three most frequently visited third pages that occur immediately after two consecutive visits to the '/detail' page, along with the number of times (`Count`) each third-page visit occurs..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'LOG': {'LOG': ['ACCESS_LOG', 'MST_USERS_WITH_CARD_NUMBER', 'INVALID_ACTION_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG', 'ACTIVITY_LOG', 'APP1_MST_USERS', 'APP1_MST_USERS', 'APP2_MST_USERS', 'DUP_ACTION_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_IP', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE', 'FORM_LOG', 'MST_CATEGORIES', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20170101', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20170101', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20161201', 'PURCHASE_LOG', 'MST_USERS', 'FORM_ERROR_LOG', 'READ_LOG', 'PRODUCT_SALES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
