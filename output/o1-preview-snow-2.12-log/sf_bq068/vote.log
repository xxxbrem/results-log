After comparing the two SQL scripts and their results, I conclude that **2result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Simplicity and Efficiency:** The `2result.sql` script combines debits and credits into a single `transactions` CTE using `UNION ALL`. This approach simplifies the data by having all transactions in one place with appropriate positive (credits) and negative (debits) signs. It makes the subsequent aggregation and calculation of balances more straightforward and efficient.

- **Adherence to Double-Entry Bookkeeping Principles:** By directly applying the negative sign to the debit amounts (`-t."value" AS "amount"` for inputs) and keeping credits positive, the script closely follows the double-entry bookkeeping principles.

- **Conciseness:** The script avoids the need for separate `debits` and `credits` CTEs and a `FULL OUTER JOIN`, which reduces complexity and potential for errors.

- **Correctness of Results:** The results from `2result.sql` accurately reflect the maximum and minimum final balances grouped by address type within the specified date range.

**Therefore, the correct SQL script is:**
