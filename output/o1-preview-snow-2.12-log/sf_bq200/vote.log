After analyzing the SQL queries and their results, the SQL script that correctly fulfills the task is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

The SQL query in `1result.sql` correctly:

- **Combines Data from Both Seasons**: It unifies data from both the regular season (`GAMES_WIDE`) and post-season (`GAMES_POST_WIDE`) tables using a `UNION ALL`, ensuring all relevant games are included.

- **Confirms Team Association**: It verifies whether a pitcher played for a specific team by checking if the `pitcherId` appears among the fielders for that team (`homeFielder1` to `homeFielder12` or `awayFielder1` to `awayFielder12`). This confirms that the pitcher's performance is attributed to the correct team.

- **Identifies Maximum Pitch Speed per Pitcher**: It calculates the maximum non-zero pitch speed for each pitcher while playing for each team, grouping by `teamId`, `teamName`, `pitcherId`, and `pitcherName`.

- **Handles Ties Appropriately**: In cases where multiple pitchers have the same maximum pitch speed for a team, the query uses `ROW_NUMBER()` with an `ORDER BY` clause that includes both `maxPitchSpeed` (descending) and `pitcherName` (alphabetical order). This ensures that only one pitcher (the one with the alphabetically first name) is selected per team when there is a tie, meeting the requirement of identifying a single pitcher per team.

- **Retrieves Required Information**: It selects the team's ID and name, the pitcher's full name (concatenated from `pitcherFirstName` and `pitcherLastName`), and the maximum valid pitch speed achieved by the pitcher for that team.

- **Organized Output**: The final results are ordered by the team's name, providing a clear and organized presentation of the pitchers and their teams.

**Conclusion:**

The `1result.sql` script meets all the criteria specified in the task, accurately identifying the pitcher with the highest non-zero pitch speed for each team, confirming their association with the team, and handling potential ties effectively.
