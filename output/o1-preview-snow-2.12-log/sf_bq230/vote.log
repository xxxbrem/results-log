After reviewing the provided SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct and most robust query to use.

**Reasoning:**

- **Data Type Handling:** The `"value"` column in the `CROPS` table may contain non-numeric entries or empty strings. Using `TRY_TO_DOUBLE("value")` in `2result.sql` safely attempts to convert the values to numeric, treating any non-convertible entries as `NULL`. This ensures that the aggregation functions correctly without errors.

- **Robust Aggregation:**
  - **`0result.sql`:** Uses `SUM("value")` directly without handling potential non-numeric values. If non-numeric data exists, this query may fail or produce inaccurate results.
  - **`1result.sql`:** Casts `"value"` to `FLOAT` using `"value"::FLOAT`. If `"value"` contains non-numeric strings, this casting will result in an error and halt the query execution.
  - **`2result.sql`:** By using `TRY_TO_DOUBLE("value")`, it ensures that only valid numeric values are summed, and any non-numeric entries do not disrupt the computation.

- **Accurate Results:** The results from `2result.sql` are more reliable because the query accounts for data inconsistencies, leading to accurate total production figures for both corn and mushrooms.

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** is the appropriate SQL query that correctly calculates the total 2022 production figures for corn and mushrooms for each U.S. state, handling data conversion issues effectively.
