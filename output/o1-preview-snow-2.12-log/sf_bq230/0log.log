**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `CROPS` (from database `USDA_NASS_AGRICULTURE`, schema `USDA_NASS_AGRICULTURE`)

**Columns:**

- `"state_name"`: Identifies each U.S. state.
- `"commodity_desc"`: Used to filter for 'CORN' and 'MUSHROOMS'.
- `"group_desc"`: Used to filter 'FIELD CROPS' for corn and 'HORTICULTURE' for mushrooms.
- `"statisticcat_desc"`: To select records where the statistic category is 'PRODUCTION'.
- `"agg_level_desc"`: Ensures the data is aggregated at the 'STATE' level.
- `"year"`: Used to filter data for the year '2022'.
- `"unit_desc"`: Ensures the units are 'BU' (bushels) for corn.
- `"value"`: Contains the production figures.
- `"value_suppression_code"`: Helps identify if 'value' is suppressed (we need records where 'value' is not suppressed).
- `"class_desc"`: May provide additional classification details about the commodity.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `"commodity_desc"` = 'CORN' or 'MUSHROOMS'.
- `"group_desc"` = 'FIELD CROPS' (for corn) or 'HORTICULTURE' (for mushrooms).
- `"statisticcat_desc"` = 'PRODUCTION'.
- `"agg_level_desc"` = 'STATE'.
- `"year"` = 2022.
- `"value"` is not null and not suppressed.
- For corn, `"unit_desc"` = 'BU' (bushels).

Task: Using the crops dataset, find the total 2022 production figures, measured in bushels, for corn from the 'FIELD CROPS' category and mushrooms from the 'HORTICULTURE' group for each U.S. state. Only include data rows where 'statisticcat_desc' is 'PRODUCTION', 'agg_level_desc' is 'STATE', 'value' is not null, and ensure that for corn the 'unit_desc' is 'BU'. Combine both results so that each state’s 2022 corn and mushroom totals are presented.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
state_name,corn_production_bu,mushroom_production_unit
state1:str,production_corn1:float,production_mushroom1:float
state2:str,production_corn2:float,production_mushroom2:float
...
```

This table presents the total 2022 production figures for corn (measured in bushels) and mushrooms for each U.S. state. The data includes only entries where `statisticcat_desc` is `PRODUCTION`, `agg_level_desc` is `STATE`, `value` is not null, and for corn, `unit_desc` is `BU` (bushels)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'USDA_NASS_AGRICULTURE': {'USDA_NASS_AGRICULTURE': ['ANIMALS_PRODUCTS', 'CENSUS2002', 'CENSUS2002', 'CENSUS2007', 'CENSUS2012', 'DEMOGRAPHICS', 'CENSUS_2002', 'CENSUS_2002', 'CENSUS_2012', 'CENSUS_2007', 'CROPS', 'ENVIRONMENTAL', 'ECONOMICS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 02:04:34 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Using the crops dataset, find the total 2022 production figures, measured in bushels, for corn from the 'FIELD CROPS' category and mushrooms from the 'HORTICULTURE' group for each U.S. state. Only include data rows where 'statisticcat_desc' is 'PRODUCTION', 'agg_level_desc' is 'STATE', 'value' is not null, and ensure that for corn the 'unit_desc' is 'BU'. Combine both results so that each state’s 2022 corn and mushroom totals are presented., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
state_name,corn_production_bu,mushroom_production_unit
state1:str,production_corn1:float,production_mushroom1:float
state2:str,production_corn2:float,production_mushroom2:float
...
```

This table presents the total 2022 production figures for corn (measured in bushels) and mushrooms for each U.S. state. The data includes only entries where `statisticcat_desc` is `PRODUCTION`, `agg_level_desc` is `STATE`, `value` is not null, and for corn, `unit_desc` is `BU` (bushels). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
