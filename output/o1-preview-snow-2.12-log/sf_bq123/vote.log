After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct query for the given task. Here is the reasoning:

**1. Correct Extraction of Day Names:**

- **`0result.sql`:** This query attempts to extract the day name using the following line:
  ```sql
  UPPER(TRIM(TO_VARCHAR(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("question_creation_date" / 1000000), 'DAY'))) AS "day_name"
  ```
  However, this may not correctly extract the day name. The result shows `DAY` as the day name, which suggests that the literal string `'DAY'` is being used instead of the actual day name extracted from the date.

- **`1result.sql`:** This query correctly extracts the day name using:
  ```sql
  TRIM(UPPER(DAYNAME(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(q."creation_date" / 1e6)))) AS "Day_of_week"
  ```
  This method uses the `DAYNAME` function to obtain the actual day name from the timestamp.

**2. Accurate Calculation of Percentage:**

- **`0result.sql`:** The percentage calculated is `58.2016%` for a day named `DAY`, which is not meaningful due to the incorrect day extraction.

- **`1result.sql`:** The query calculates the percentage of questions answered within an hour for each actual day of the week and ranks them to find the third highest percentage. The result is:
  ```
  Day_of_week,Percentage
  FRI,49.7839
  ```
  This indicates that Friday (`FRI`) has the third highest percentage of questions answered within an hour, which satisfies the task's requirement.

**Conclusion:**

`1result.sql` correctly extracts the day names, accurately calculates the percentages, and provides a plausible result that aligns with the task's objective.
