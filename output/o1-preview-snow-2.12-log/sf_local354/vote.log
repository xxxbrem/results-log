The correct SQL query that answers the task is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **0result.sql** correctly identifies drivers who raced during the 1950s and participated in at least two distinct race rounds in a season.
- It accurately determines the first and last races each driver participated in within a season by ordering the races based on the **race date** and **race ID**. This ensures that the actual races the driver took part in are considered, rather than just the first and last rounds of the season, which the driver may not have attended.
- It compares the constructors of the first and last races the driver participated in, without imposing additional restrictions. This aligns precisely with the task's requirement to find drivers whose first and last constructors in a season were the same.
- **1result.sql** adds an extra condition by requiring that the driver used only one constructor throughout the entire season (**constructor_count = 1**). This is more restrictive than the task demands, as the task only specifies that the constructors in the first and last races must be the same, not that the driver couldn't have used different constructors in other races during the season.
- **2result.sql** determines the first and last races based on the **round numbers**, which might not accurately represent the first and last races a driver participated in. Drivers might skip certain rounds or not start from the first round, so using dates and race participation (as in **0result.sql**) is a more precise method.

Therefore, **0result.sql** is the most appropriate query that fulfills the task's requirements.
