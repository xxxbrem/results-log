  AND ("cumulative_confirmed" IS NULL OR "cumulative_confirmed" = 0)
  AND "country_name" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

The error occurs because the `"cumulative_confirmed"` column is of numeric type `NUMBER(38,0)`, and comparing it to an empty string (`''`) or attempting to cast it to a different numeric type can cause SQL compilation errors.

To correct the query:

- **Avoid using `TRY_TO_DOUBLE` or `TRY_CAST`** on a numeric column that is already of type `NUMBER(38,0)`.
- **Check for zero values** in addition to `NULL` values, since countries with zero confirmed cases might be relevant.
- **Ensure that `country_name` is not `NULL`** to include only valid country names in the results.

By adjusting the `WHERE` clause to:

```sql
WHERE "date" = '2020-06-30'
  AND ("cumulative_confirmed" IS NULL OR "cumulative_confirmed" = 0)
  AND "country_name" IS NOT NULL
```

we filter the dataset to include countries where the cumulative confirmed cases are either `NULL` or zero on June 30, 2020.

**Explanation:**

Since the previous query returned no data, it's possible that on June 30, 2020, there were no countries with missing (`NULL`) or zero cumulative confirmed cases in the dataset. To get meaningful results, we can **simplify the condition** by fetching countries with a **low number of cumulative confirmed cases**.

In this corrected query:

- We **removed the condition** that checks for `NULL` or zero values in `"cumulative_confirmed"`, as it was too restrictive.
- We **added a condition** to select countries where `"cumulative_confirmed"` is less than or equal to **100**. This provides a list of countries with relatively few confirmed cases by that date.
- We ensured that `"country_name"` is not `NULL` or empty to avoid incomplete records.

This simplified query should return a list of countries with **low cumulative confirmed cases** on June 30, 2020, providing the desired output without encountering empty results.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **Table: POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY**
  - `"country"`: Used to identify the country by name; potential usage in joining with `"country_name"` from the COVID-19 data.
  - `"country_code"`: ISO country code; potential usage in joining with `"iso_3166_1_alpha_3"` from the COVID-19 data.
  - `"year_2018"`: Population data for the year 2018; potential usage as the denominator in percentage calculations.

- **Table: COVID19_OPEN_DATA**
  - `"country_name"`: Name of the country; potential usage in joining with `"country"` from the population data.
  - `"iso_3166_1_alpha_3"`: ISO country code; potential usage in joining with `"country_code"` from the population data.
  - `"date"`: Date of the record; potential usage in filtering data up to June 30, 2020.
  - `"cumulative_confirmed"`: Cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; potential usage as the numerator in percentage calculations.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter records where `"date"` equals '2020-06-30' in the COVID-19 data.
- Join the two tables on matching `"country_code"` and `"iso_3166_1_alpha_3"`, or `"country"` and `"country_name"`.
- Use `DISTINCT` to get unique values.

Task: You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Country_Name,Percentage_Infected
country1:str,percentage1:float between 0 and 100
country2:str,percentage2:float between 0 and 100
...
```

To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table and the population data for 2018 from the `POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY` table. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed / population_2018) * 100`..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK': {'COVID19_OPEN_DATA': ['COMPATIBILITY_VIEW', 'COVID19_OPEN_DATA'], 'WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION': ['POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY'], 'WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT': ['SERIES_SUMMARY', 'COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'INTERNATIONAL_DEBT', 'SERIES_TIMES', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_EDUCATION': ['COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_EDUCATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS'], 'WORLD_BANK_WDI': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'FOOTNOTES', 'INDICATORS_DATA', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIME']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-12 03:40:22 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Country_Name,Percentage_Infected
country1:str,percentage1:float between 0 and 100
country2:str,percentage2:float between 0 and 100
...
```

To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table and the population data for 2018 from the `POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY` table. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed / population_2018) * 100`. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-12 03:40:45 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Country_Name,Percentage_Infected
country1:str,percentage1:float between 0 and 100
country2:str,percentage2:float between 0 and 100
...
```

To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table and the population data for 2018 from the `POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY` table. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed / population_2018) * 100`. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-12 03:41:33 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Country_Name,Percentage_Infected
country1:str,percentage1:float between 0 and 100
country2:str,percentage2:float between 0 and 100
...
```

To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table and the population data for 2018 from the `POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY` table. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed / population_2018) * 100`. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
