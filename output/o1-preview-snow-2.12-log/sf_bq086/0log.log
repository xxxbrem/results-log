   SELECT "country", "year_2018"
   FROM COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get cumulative confirmed cases for all countries on June 30, 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", "cumulative_confirmed"
   FROM COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK.COVID19_OPEN_DATA.COVID19_OPEN_DATA
   WHERE "date" = '2020-06-30'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List the top 100 countries by cumulative confirmed cases on June 30, 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", "cumulative_confirmed"
   FROM COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK.COVID19_OPEN_DATA.COVID19_OPEN_DATA
   WHERE "date" = '2020-06-30'
   ORDER BY "cumulative_confirmed" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Join COVID-19 data with population data to view cumulative confirmed cases and population for each country:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."country_name", p."year_2018", c."cumulative_confirmed"
   FROM COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK.COVID19_OPEN_DATA.COVID19_OPEN_DATA c
   JOIN COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY p
     ON c."country_name" = p."country"
   WHERE c."date" = '2020-06-30'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve cumulative confirmed cases over time for a specific country (e.g., "United States"):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "date", "cumulative_confirmed"
   FROM COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK.COVID19_OPEN_DATA.COVID19_OPEN_DATA
   WHERE "country_name" = 'United States'
   ORDER BY "date" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count the number of distinct countries in the COVID-19 data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "country_name") AS "number_of_countries"
   FROM COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK.COVID19_OPEN_DATA.COVID19_OPEN_DATA
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find countries present in COVID-19 data but not in the population data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT c."country_name"
   FROM COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK.COVID19_OPEN_DATA.COVID19_OPEN_DATA c
   LEFT JOIN COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY p
     ON c."country_name" = p."country"
   WHERE p."country" IS NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Get the latest date available in the COVID-19 data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MAX("date") AS "latest_date"
   FROM COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK.COVID19_OPEN_DATA.COVID19_OPEN_DATA
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve population data for countries starting with the letter 'A':**

    ```sql
    SELECT "country", "year_2018"
    FROM COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY
    WHERE "country" LIKE 'A%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Explanation:**

- The above queries help in exploring the relevant data needed to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020.
- By examining the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table, we can obtain the cumulative confirmed cases for each country up to the specified date.
- The `POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY` table provides the population data for the year 2018, which we can use as the denominator in our percentage calculation.
- Joining these two datasets on the country name (or country code) allows us to align the COVID-19 cases with the corresponding population figures.
- These queries range from simple data retrieval to joining tables and applying conditions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the data involved.Query:

Task: You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Country_Name,Percentage_Infected
country1:str,percentage1:float between 0 and 100
country2:str,percentage2:float between 0 and 100
...
```

To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table and the population data for 2018 from the `POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY` table. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed / population_2018) * 100`..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK': {'COVID19_OPEN_DATA': ['COMPATIBILITY_VIEW', 'COVID19_OPEN_DATA'], 'WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION': ['POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY'], 'WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT': ['SERIES_SUMMARY', 'COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'INTERNATIONAL_DEBT', 'SERIES_TIMES', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_EDUCATION': ['COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_EDUCATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS'], 'WORLD_BANK_WDI': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'FOOTNOTES', 'INDICATORS_DATA', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIME']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-12 03:36:02 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Country_Name,Percentage_Infected
country1:str,percentage1:float between 0 and 100
country2:str,percentage2:float between 0 and 100
...
```

To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table and the population data for 2018 from the `POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY` table. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed / population_2018) * 100`. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-12 03:37:58 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Country_Name,Percentage_Infected
country1:str,percentage1:float between 0 and 100
country2:str,percentage2:float between 0 and 100
...
```

To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table and the population data for 2018 from the `POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY` table. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed / population_2018) * 100`. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
