2025-02-12 06:04:45 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering indicates that some values in the `"created_at"` column are causing issues when being converted to timestamps using the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function. Specifically, the error message:

```
252005: Failed to convert current row, cause: year 49020491 is out of range
```

suggests that some `"created_at"` values are either too large or invalid, resulting in dates that exceed the acceptable range for timestamps.

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

In the `ORDER_ITEMS` table, the `"created_at"` column likely contains numeric values representing timestamps. If these values are in microseconds or contain erroneous data, they can represent dates far in the future or past when converted, causing the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function to fail.

---

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

#### **1. Check the Range of "created_at" Values**

First, let's identify the minimum and maximum values of `"created_at"` without converting them to timestamps:

```sql
SELECT 
  MIN("created_at") AS "Min_Created_At",
  MAX("created_at") AS "Max_Created_At"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS";
```

This will help us understand if there are outliers or invalid values in the data.

#### **2. Inspect Records with Extreme "created_at" Values**

Next, examine records with unusually large or small `"created_at"` values:

```sql
-- Records with very large "created_at" values
SELECT
  "id",
  "created_at"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS"
WHERE "created_at" > 1704067200000000 -- Corresponds to Jan 1, 2024
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- Records with negative or zero "created_at" values
SELECT
  "id",
  "created_at"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS"
WHERE "created_at" <= 0
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **3. Use TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP Instead of TO_TIMESTAMP**

The `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP` function attempts to convert the value and returns `NULL` if it fails, preventing the query from throwing an error:

```sql
SELECT 
  MIN(TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) AS "Earliest_Order_Date",
  MAX(TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) AS "Latest_Order_Date"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS";
```

This will provide the earliest and latest valid order dates, ignoring invalid timestamps.

#### **4. Filter Out Invalid "created_at" Values**

Alternatively, you can exclude records with out-of-range `"created_at"` values:

```sql
SELECT 
  MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) AS "Earliest_Order_Date",
  MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) AS "Latest_Order_Date"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS"
WHERE "created_at" BETWEEN 0 AND 1704067200000000; -- Valid range up to Jan 1, 2024
```

#### **5. Identify Records with Invalid "created_at" Values**

If you wish to clean or correct these records, identify them using:

```sql
SELECT
  "id",
  "created_at"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS"
WHERE TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at") IS NULL;
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Data Representation**: Typically, timestamps are stored as the number of seconds (or milliseconds/microseconds) since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).
  
- **Valid Range**: The acceptable range for `TO_TIMESTAMP` depends on the precision (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds) and the system's date range limits.
  
- **Invalid Values**: If `"created_at"` contains values that, when converted, result in years like 49,020,491, it's clear that these values are not intended and are causing the error.

---

### **Proceeding with Your Analysis**

Now that we've addressed the issue, you can proceed with your task using valid `"created_at"` values.

#### **Calculating the Required Metrics**

Here's how you can calculate the top product by total profit for each month prior to January 2024:

```sql
SELECT
  TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at")), 'YYYY-MM') AS "Month",
  p."name" AS "Product_Name",
  SUM(p."cost") AS "Total_Cost",
  SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "Total_Profit"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
JOIN "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."PRODUCTS" p
  ON oi."product_id" = p."id"
WHERE 
  TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at") < '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY 
  "Month", 
  p."name"
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "Month" ORDER BY SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") DESC) = 1
ORDER BY 
  "Month";
```

**Explanation:**

- **TO_CHAR and DATE_TRUNC**: Formats the timestamp to get the month in `'YYYY-MM'` format.
- **TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP**: Safely converts `"created_at"` to timestamp, filtering out invalid dates.
- **SUM of Costs and Profits**: Calculates total cost and total profit per product per month.
- **QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER()**: Retrieves the product with the highest total profit for each month.
- **ORDER BY "Month"**: Presents the results chronologically.

---

### **Final Output Format**

The result will have the following format:

```csv
Month,Product_Name,Total_Cost,Total_Profit
2023-01,Product A,1000.00,500.00
2023-02,Product B,1500.00,700.00
...
```

---

### **Note**

- Ensure that all date and time functions appropriately match the data format in your database.
- If `"created_at"` values are in microseconds, ensure that `TO_TIMESTAMP` interprets them correctly.
  - In Snowflake, you might need to specify the scale: `TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)`
- Always test queries with a limited dataset before running them on the entire database.

---

### **Next Steps**

- Verify the modified query works without errors.
- Review the data for any anomalies or further data quality issues.
- Use the output to create the final report as per the task requirements.

2025-02-12 06:06:47 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the way the `"created_at"` timestamps are being converted. Specifically, the large numeric values in the `"created_at"` column are causing `TO_TIMESTAMP` to interpret them as seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970), resulting in dates that are far beyond the acceptable range—hence the "year out of range" error.

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

From your earlier query:

```sql
SELECT 
  MIN("created_at") AS "Min_Created_At",
  MAX("created_at") AS "Max_Created_At"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS";
```

**Results:**

```
Min_Created_At,Max_Created_At
1546875140000000,1729707817544847
```

These values are extremely large—on the order of **trillions**—which suggests that the `"created_at"` timestamps are stored in **microseconds** since the Unix epoch.

---

### **Solution**

To correctly convert these microsecond timestamps to standard timestamps, you need to **divide them by 1,000,000** to convert microseconds to seconds before using `TO_TIMESTAMP`.

---

### **Corrected SQL Query**

Here's the corrected version of your query:

```sql
SELECT 
     "id", 
     "created_at", 
     TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000) AS "Created_At_Timestamp" 
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" 
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Division by 1,000,000**: Converts microseconds to seconds, which is the expected input for `TO_TIMESTAMP`.
- **`TO_TIMESTAMP` Function**: Converts seconds since the Unix epoch to a timestamp.

---

### **Applying the Correction to Other Queries**

You'll need to adjust your other queries similarly wherever `TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")` is used. Replace it with `TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000)`.

Here are the corrected versions of your queries:

---

1. **List Distinct Order Months:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     DISTINCT DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Order_Month" 
   FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" 
   ORDER BY "Order_Month" 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count Orders per Month:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Order_Month", 
     COUNT(*) AS "Order_Count" 
   FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" 
   GROUP BY "Order_Month" 
   ORDER BY "Order_Month" 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Join `ORDER_ITEMS` and `PRODUCTS` to Get Product Details:**

   *(No change needed if not using `created_at`)*

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     oi."id" AS "Order_Item_ID", 
     oi."product_id", 
     p."name" AS "Product_Name", 
     p."cost" AS "Product_Cost", 
     oi."sale_price" AS "Sale_Price" 
   FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
   JOIN "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."PRODUCTS" p
     ON oi."product_id" = p."id" 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Calculate Profit per Order Item:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     oi."id" AS "Order_Item_ID", 
     oi."product_id", 
     p."name" AS "Product_Name", 
     oi."sale_price", 
     p."cost", 
     (oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "Profit" 
   FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
   JOIN "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."PRODUCTS" p
     ON oi."product_id" = p."id" 
   WHERE oi."sale_price" IS NOT NULL AND p."cost" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Aggregate Total Profit per Product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     oi."product_id", 
     p."name" AS "Product_Name", 
     SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "Total_Profit" 
   FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
   JOIN "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."PRODUCTS" p
     ON oi."product_id" = p."id" 
   WHERE oi."sale_price" IS NOT NULL AND p."cost" IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY oi."product_id", p."name" 
   ORDER BY "Total_Profit" DESC 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Aggregate Total Profit per Product per Month:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Order_Month", 
     oi."product_id", 
     p."name" AS "Product_Name", 
     SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "Total_Profit" 
   FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
   JOIN "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."PRODUCTS" p
     ON oi."product_id" = p."id" 
   WHERE oi."sale_price" IS NOT NULL AND p."cost" IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY "Order_Month", oi."product_id", p."name" 
   ORDER BY "Order_Month", "Total_Profit" DESC 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Filter Orders Prior to January 2024:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     * 
   FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" 
   WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000) < '2024-01-01' 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Aggregate Total Cost and Profit per Product per Month:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Order_Month", 
     oi."product_id", 
     p."name" AS "Product_Name", 
     SUM(p."cost") AS "Total_Cost", 
     SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "Total_Profit" 
   FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
   JOIN "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."PRODUCTS" p
     ON oi."product_id" = p."id" 
   WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000) < '2024-01-01' 
     AND oi."sale_price" IS NOT NULL AND p."cost" IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY "Order_Month", oi."product_id", p."name" 
   ORDER BY "Order_Month", "Total_Profit" DESC 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

### **Additional Notes**

- **Null Checks:** Include `IS NOT NULL` checks for `"sale_price"` and `"cost"` to prevent calculation errors.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that all uses of `TO_TIMESTAMP` with `"created_at"` include the division by 1,000,000.
- **Date Filtering:** When filtering dates, always apply the division before the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function.

---

### **Final Query for Your Task**

To accomplish your task of identifying the top product by total profit for each month prior to January 2024, use the following query:

```sql
SELECT
  TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)), 'YYYY-MM') AS "Month",
  p."name" AS "Product_Name",
  SUM(p."cost") AS "Total_Cost",
  SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "Total_Profit"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
JOIN "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."PRODUCTS" p
  ON oi."product_id" = p."id"
WHERE 
  TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000) < '2024-01-01'
  AND oi."sale_price" IS NOT NULL
  AND p."cost" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
  "Month", 
  p."name"
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "Month" ORDER BY SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") DESC) = 1
ORDER BY 
  "Month";
```

---

### **Explanation of the Final Query**

- **`TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)`**: Correctly converts the microsecond timestamp to a standard timestamp.
- **`TO_CHAR(..., 'YYYY-MM') AS "Month"`**: Formats the date to display only the year and month.
- **`SUM(p."cost")`**: Calculates the total cost for the product in that month.
- **`SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost")`**: Calculates the total profit for the product in that month.
- **`QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "Month" ORDER BY SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") DESC) = 1`**: Selects the product with the highest total profit for each month.
- **`ORDER BY "Month"`**: Orders the results chronologically by month.

---

### **Conclusion**

By adjusting the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function to account for microseconds, you should now be able to execute your queries without encountering the "year out of range" error. This correction ensures that date conversions are accurate, allowing you to proceed with your analysis.

---

### **Corrected SQL Query**

To resolve the error, you need to **divide the `"created_at"` values by 1,000,000** to convert microseconds to seconds before passing them to `TO_TIMESTAMP`.

Here is the corrected query:

```sql

     DISTINCT DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Order_Month" 
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS"

  - `"created_at" / 1000000`: Divides the microsecond timestamp by 1,000,000 to convert it to seconds.
- **TO_TIMESTAMP Function**:
  - `TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000)`: Converts the adjusted timestamp (in seconds) to a proper timestamp format.
- **DATE_TRUNC Function**:
  - `DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', ...)`: Truncates the timestamp to the beginning of the month, allowing you to group or sort by month.
- **DISTINCT**:
  - Retrieves unique months from the order dates.
- **ORDER BY "Order_Month"**:
  - Orders the results chronologically by month.
- **LIMIT 100**:
  - Limits the result to 100 rows.

---

### **Why This Correction Works**

By converting the `"created_at"` values from microseconds to seconds, the timestamps are now within the valid range expected by `TO_TIMESTAMP`. This prevents the function from generating dates that are out of range (such as years in the far future), thus eliminating the error.

---

### **Applying This Correction to Similar Queries**

For any other queries where you use `TO_TIMESTAMP` on the `"created_at"` column, you should apply the same correction:

- **Divide `"created_at"` by 1,000,000 before using `TO_TIMESTAMP`.**

---

### **Example of Applying the Correction**

If you had this query:

```sql
SELECT 
     DATE_TRUNC('DAY', TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) AS "Order_Day", 
     COUNT(*) AS "Orders_Count"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS"
GROUP BY "Order_Day"
ORDER BY "Order_Day";
```

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT 
     DATE_TRUNC('DAY', TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Order_Day", 
     COUNT(*) AS "Orders_Count"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS"
GROUP BY "Order_Day"
ORDER BY "Order_Day";
```

---

### **Additional Note**

- **Consistency**: Always ensure that whenever you're converting the `"created_at"` field to a timestamp, you include the division by 1,000,000.
- **Data Validation**: It's a good practice to check if there are any null or invalid values in the `"created_at"` column and handle them appropriately to prevent errors in your queries.

---

### **Conclusion**

By adjusting the way you handle the `"created_at"` column and converting it properly from microseconds to seconds, you should be able to execute your queries without encountering the "year out of range" error.

2025-02-12 06:10:44 - root - INFO - Certainly! The error you're encountering is due to the way the `"created_at"` timestamps are being converted. Specifically, the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function expects the input to be in **seconds** since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). However, in your dataset, the `"created_at"` values are stored in **microseconds**. Directly applying `TO_TIMESTAMP` to microsecond values results in an attempt to convert an extremely large number, causing the "year out of range" error.

---

### **Understanding the Error**

- **Error Message**:

  ```
  252005: 252005: Failed to convert current row, cause: year 49020491 is out of range
  ```

- **Cause**: The `"created_at"` values are in microseconds. When using `TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")`, the function interprets the input as seconds, leading to dates millions of times larger than expected (since 1 second = 1,000,000 microseconds).

---

### **Solution**

To fix the error, you need to **convert the microseconds to seconds** by dividing the `"created_at"` values by **1,000,000** before applying `TO_TIMESTAMP`.

---

### **Corrected SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT 
     DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Order_Month", 
     COUNT(*) AS "Order_Count" 
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" 
WHERE "created_at" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "Order_Month" 
ORDER BY "Order_Month" 
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Conversion of Microseconds to Seconds**:

  - **`"created_at" / 1000000`**: Divides the microsecond timestamp by 1,000,000 to convert it to seconds.

- **Timestamp Conversion**:

  - **`TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000)`**: Converts the adjusted timestamp (in seconds) to a proper timestamp format.

- **Month Truncation**:

  - **`DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP(...))`**: Truncates the timestamp to the beginning of the month, allowing aggregation by month.

- **Filtering Null Values**:

  - **`WHERE "created_at" IS NOT NULL`**: Ensures that null values in `"created_at"` do not cause errors during conversion.

- **Aggregation and Ordering**:

  - **`GROUP BY "Order_Month"`**: Groups the results by each month.
  - **`ORDER BY "Order_Month"`**: Orders the results chronologically by month.
  - **`LIMIT 100`**: Limits the output to 100 rows.

---

### **Why This Correction Works**

By converting `"created_at"` from microseconds to seconds, the time values are now in the correct scale for `TO_TIMESTAMP` to interpret them accurately. This prevents the function from generating dates that are out of range, thus eliminating the error.

---

### **Result**

Running the corrected query will give you the count of orders per month without any conversion errors. Based on your earlier results, you should see "Order_Month" values like:

```
Order_Month    | Order_Count
---------------|-------------
2019-01-01     |    ...
2019-02-01     |    ...
...
```

---

### **Additional Notes**

- **Consistency**: Whenever you use `TO_TIMESTAMP` with the `"created_at"` field, remember to divide by 1,000,000 to convert microseconds to seconds.

- **Data Validation**:

  - Ensure that `"created_at"` does not contain null or invalid values before conversion.
  - Use the `WHERE "created_at" IS NOT NULL` clause to filter out nulls.

- **Application to Other Queries**:

  - Any other query that involves converting `"created_at"` to a timestamp should apply the same adjustment.

---

### **Example of Applying the Correction to Similar Queries**

If you have other queries with similar errors, adjust them by dividing `"created_at"` by 1,000,000 before using `TO_TIMESTAMP`. For instance:

**Original Query with Error**:

```sql
SELECT 
     DATE_TRUNC('DAY', TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) AS "Order_Day", 
     COUNT(*) AS "Total_Orders"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS"
GROUP BY "Order_Day"
ORDER BY "Order_Day";
```

**Corrected Query**:

```sql
SELECT 
     DATE_TRUNC('DAY', TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Order_Day", 
     COUNT(*) AS "Total_Orders"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS"
WHERE "created_at" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "Order_Day"
ORDER BY "Order_Day";
```

---

### **Conclusion**

By adjusting the conversion of the `"created_at"` field, you can resolve the "year out of range" error and correctly aggregate your data by month. This approach ensures that the timestamps are accurately represented in your queries.

2025-02-12 06:12:59 - root - INFO - Certainly! The error you're encountering is due to the way the `"created_at"` timestamps are being converted. Specifically, the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function expects the input to be in **seconds** since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). However, in your dataset, the `"created_at"` values are stored in **microseconds**. 

Directly applying `TO_TIMESTAMP` to microsecond values results in dates that are far in the future, causing the "year out of range" error:

```
252005: Failed to convert current row, cause: year 49020491 is out of range
```

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

- **Microseconds vs. Seconds**: Your `"created_at"` timestamps are in microseconds. When you pass these large numbers directly to `TO_TIMESTAMP`, it's as if you're telling SQL that these numbers represent seconds, which leads to dates millions of years in the future.
  
- **Expected Input for `TO_TIMESTAMP`**: The `TO_TIMESTAMP` function expects the number of **seconds** since the Unix epoch.

---

### **Solution**

To fix this error, you need to convert the microseconds to seconds by dividing the `"created_at"` values by **1,000,000** before passing them to `TO_TIMESTAMP`.

---

### **Corrected SQL Query**

Here is the corrected version of your query:

```sql
SELECT 
      DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Order_Month", 
      oi."product_id", 
      p."name" AS "Product_Name", 
      SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "Total_Profit" 
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
JOIN "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."PRODUCTS" p
  ON oi."product_id" = p."id" 
WHERE 
  oi."created_at" IS NOT NULL 
  AND oi."sale_price" IS NOT NULL 
  AND p."cost" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
  "Order_Month", 
  oi."product_id", 
  p."name" 
ORDER BY 
  "Order_Month", 
  "Total_Profit" DESC 
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation**

1. **Converting Microseconds to Seconds**:
   - **Division by 1,000,000**: `"created_at" / 1000000`
     - This converts your microsecond timestamps to seconds, which is what `TO_TIMESTAMP` expects.
   
2. **Using `TO_TIMESTAMP`**:
   - **Correct Usage**: `TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)`
     - Now, `TO_TIMESTAMP` can correctly interpret the timestamp.

3. **Truncating to Month**:
   - `DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP(...))`:
     - This truncates the timestamp to the beginning of the month for grouping purposes.

4. **Adding Necessary WHERE Conditions**:
   - `WHERE oi."created_at" IS NOT NULL`:
     - Ensures that there are no null values in `"created_at"` which could cause errors.
   - `AND oi."sale_price" IS NOT NULL` and `AND p."cost" IS NOT NULL`:
     - Prevents errors due to null values in calculations.

5. **Grouping and Ordering**:
   - **GROUP BY**: Grouped by `"Order_Month"`, `oi."product_id"`, and `p."name"` to calculate the total profit per product per month.
   - **ORDER BY**: Ordered first by `"Order_Month"` to present results chronologically, then by `"Total_Profit"` in descending order to list top products per month.

---

### **Additional Notes**

- **Data Types**:
  - Ensure that the data types for `"sale_price"` and `"cost"` are numeric and compatible for subtraction.
  
- **Null Checks**:
  - Including `IS NOT NULL` conditions helps avoid runtime errors during calculations.

- **Testing**:
  - It's a good practice to test the corrected query on a smaller dataset or with `LIMIT` to ensure it works as expected.

---

### **Final Query for Your Task**

To accomplish your original task—identifying the product that achieved the highest total profit for each month prior to January 2024 and reporting the total cost and total profit—you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT
  TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)), 'YYYY-MM') AS "Month",
  p."name" AS "Product_Name",
  SUM(p."cost") AS "Total_Cost",
  SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "Total_Profit"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
JOIN "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."PRODUCTS" p
  ON oi."product_id" = p."id"
WHERE 
  TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000) < '2024-01-01' 
  AND oi."created_at" IS NOT NULL 
  AND oi."sale_price" IS NOT NULL 
  AND p."cost" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
  "Month", 
  p."name"
QUALIFY 
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "Month" ORDER BY SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") DESC) = 1
ORDER BY 
  "Month";
```

---

### **Explanation of the Final Query**

- **Formatting Month**:
  - `TO_CHAR(..., 'YYYY-MM') AS "Month"`:
    - Formats the date to a 'YYYY-MM' string for clarity.

- **Filtering Dates Before January 2024**:
  - `TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000) < '2024-01-01'`:
    - Ensures only data prior to January 2024 is included.

- **Calculating Total Cost and Total Profit**:
  - `SUM(p."cost") AS "Total_Cost"`:
    - Total cost of the product within the month.
  - `SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "Total_Profit"`:
    - Total profit from the product within the month.

- **Selecting the Top Product per Month**:
  - **QUALIFY Clause**:
    - `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "Month" ORDER BY SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") DESC) = 1`:
      - Assigns a row number starting at 1 for each month, ordered by total profit descending.
      - Keeps only the top product (row number = 1) for each month.

- **Ordering Results**:
  - `ORDER BY "Month"`:
    - Presents the results in chronological order by month.

---

### **Sample Output Format**

```csv
Month,Product_Name,Total_Cost,Total_Profit
2019-01,Product A,1000.00,500.00
2019-02,Product B,1500.00,700.00
...
```

---

### **Next Steps**

- **Execute the Corrected Query**:
  - Run the corrected query in your database environment to retrieve the desired results.

- **Validate the Results**:
  - Check the results to ensure they make sense and align with your expectations.

- **Handle Any Further Errors**:
  - If you encounter additional errors, verify that all data types are correct and that there are no null values causing issues.

2025-02-12 06:14:34 - root - INFO - Certainly! The error you're encountering is due to the way the `"created_at"` timestamps are being converted. Specifically, the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function expects the input to be in **seconds** since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). However, in your dataset, the `"created_at"` values are stored in **microseconds**. 

Directly applying `TO_TIMESTAMP` to microsecond values results in dates that are far in the future, causing the "year out of range" error:

```
252005: Failed to convert current row, cause: year 49020491 is out of range
```

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

- **Microseconds vs. Seconds**: Your `"created_at"` timestamps are in microseconds. When you pass these large numbers directly to `TO_TIMESTAMP`, it's as if you're telling SQL that these numbers represent seconds, which leads to dates millions of years in the future.
  
- **Expected Input for `TO_TIMESTAMP`**: The `TO_TIMESTAMP` function expects the number of **seconds** since the Unix epoch.

---

### **Solution**

To fix this error, you need to convert the microseconds to seconds by dividing the `"created_at"` values by **1,000,000** before passing them to `TO_TIMESTAMP`.

---

### **Corrected SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT 
      DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Order_Month", 
      oi."product_id", 
      p."name" AS "Product_Name", 
      COUNT(*) AS "Items_Sold" 
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
JOIN "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."PRODUCTS" p
  ON oi."product_id" = p."id" 
WHERE oi."created_at" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "Order_Month", oi."product_id", p."name" 
ORDER BY "Order_Month", "Items_Sold" DESC 
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation**

1. **Converting Microseconds to Seconds**:
   - **Division by 1,000,000**: `"created_at" / 1000000`
     - This converts your microsecond timestamps to seconds, which is what `TO_TIMESTAMP` expects.
   
2. **Using `TO_TIMESTAMP`**:
   - **Correct Usage**: `TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)`
     - Now, `TO_TIMESTAMP` can correctly interpret the timestamp.

3. **Truncating to Month**:
   - `DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TO_TIMESTAMP(...))`:
     - This truncates the timestamp to the beginning of the month, allowing aggregation by month.

4. **Adding Necessary WHERE Conditions**:
   - `WHERE oi."created_at" IS NOT NULL`:
     - Ensures that there are no null values in `"created_at"` which could cause errors during conversion.

5. **Grouping and Ordering**:
   - **GROUP BY**: Grouped by `"Order_Month"`, `oi."product_id"`, and `p."name"` to calculate the items sold per product per month.
   - **ORDER BY**: Ordered first by `"Order_Month"` to present results chronologically, then by `"Items_Sold"` in descending order to list top-selling products per month.

---

### **Why This Correction Works**

By converting `"created_at"` from microseconds to seconds, the time values are now in the correct scale for `TO_TIMESTAMP` to interpret them accurately. This prevents the function from generating dates that are out of range, thus eliminating the error.

---

### **Applying This Correction to Similar Queries**

For any other queries where you use `TO_TIMESTAMP` on the `"created_at"` column, you should apply the same correction:

- **Divide `"created_at"` by 1,000,000 before using `TO_TIMESTAMP`.**

---

### **Additional Notes**

- **Consistency**: Always ensure that whenever you're converting the `"created_at"` field to a timestamp, you include the division by 1,000,000.

- **Data Validation**: It's a good practice to check if there are any null or invalid values in the `"created_at"` column and handle them appropriately to prevent errors in your queries.

---

### **Conclusion**

By adjusting the conversion of the `"created_at"` field, you can resolve the "year out of range" error and correctly aggregate your data by month. This approach ensures that the timestamps are accurately represented in your queries.

2025-02-12 06:15:57 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering stems from how the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function is being used with the `"created_at"` column in your query. Specifically, the error message:

```
252005: Failed to convert current row, cause: year 49020491 is out of range
```

indicates that the values in `"created_at"` are causing `TO_TIMESTAMP` to attempt to create timestamps with years far beyond the acceptable range.

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

- **Microseconds vs. Seconds**: The `"created_at"` field in the `ORDER_ITEMS` table contains timestamps in **microseconds** since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). However, the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function expects input in **seconds**.

- **Resulting Error**: Applying `TO_TIMESTAMP` directly to microsecond values causes it to interpret the timestamps as if they were in seconds, producing dates that are millions of years in the future, hence the "year out of range" error.

---

### **Solution**

**Convert Microseconds to Seconds**: To correctly convert the microsecond timestamps to proper datetime values, you need to divide the `"created_at"` values by **1,000,000** before passing them to `TO_TIMESTAMP`.

---

### **Corrected SQL Query**

Here is the corrected query that should resolve the error:

```sql
SELECT 
      MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Earliest_Order_Date", 
      MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Latest_Order_Date" 
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
WHERE oi."created_at" IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Division by 1,000,000**: 
  - By dividing `"created_at"` by 1,000,000, you convert the timestamp from microseconds to seconds.
  - Example: If `"created_at"` is `1546875140000000` microseconds, dividing by `1,000,000` gives `1546875140` seconds.

- **`TO_TIMESTAMP` Function**:
  - `TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)` now receives the timestamp in seconds and converts it correctly to a datetime value.

- **Filtering Out NULL Values**:
  - Adding `WHERE oi."created_at" IS NOT NULL` ensures that you exclude any records where `"created_at"` is NULL, which could cause the function to fail.

---

### **Additional Recommendations**

- **Using `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP` Function**:
  - If there is a possibility of invalid or out-of-range values even after conversion, you can use `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP`, which returns `NULL` instead of throwing an error when conversion fails.

  ```sql
  SELECT 
        MIN(TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Earliest_Order_Date", 
        MAX(TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1000000)) AS "Latest_Order_Date" 
  FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
  WHERE oi."created_at" IS NOT NULL;
  ```

- **Verifying the Date Range**:
  - After running the corrected query, verify the earliest and latest order dates to ensure they make sense (e.g., dates fall within expected operational periods).

---

### **Example Results**

Assuming the corrected query runs successfully, you might get results like:

```
Earliest_Order_Date    | Latest_Order_Date
-----------------------|-------------------------
2019-01-07 12:45:40    | 2024-10-24 18:43:37
```

---

### **Summary**

- **Issue**: `TO_TIMESTAMP` expects seconds, but `"created_at"` is in microseconds.
- **Fix**: Divide `"created_at"` by 1,000,000 before converting.
- **Updated Query**: Modify your SQL to include the division.
- **Benefit**: This adjustment correctly converts timestamps, eliminating the "year out of range" error.

---

**Let me know if you need further assistance or have any questions about this correction!**

Task: For each month prior to January 2024, identify the product that achieved the highest total profit (calculated as the sum of sale_price minus the product’s cost) across all order items, then report the total cost and total profit for that top product per month, including all order items regardless of their status, and present the results chronologically by month.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the product with the highest total profit for each month prior to January 2024, we calculate the total profit for each product in each month as the sum of (sale_price minus the product's cost) across all order items, regardless of their status. Here is the requested data presented chronologically by month:

```csv
Month,Product_Name,Total_Cost,Total_Profit
month1:str,product_name1:str,total_cost1:float,total_profit1:float
month2:str,product_name2:str,total_cost2:float,total_profit2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': {'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': ['DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS', 'ORDERS', 'USERS', 'EVENTS', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS', 'PRODUCTS', 'ORDER_ITEMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
