2025-02-12 06:04:47 - root - INFO - I see that you encountered an error when trying to convert the `"created_at"` column to a timestamp. The error message indicates that the year is out of range:

```
Failed to convert current row, cause: year 54522248 is out of range
```

### Explanation of the Issue:

The error occurs because the values in the `"created_at"` column are large numbers that cannot be directly converted to timestamps using `TO_TIMESTAMP()`. This suggests that the `"created_at"` column stores time values in a high-precision format such as **microseconds** or **nanoseconds** since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

Looking at the sample data you provided:

```
id,product_id,sale_price,created_at,status
21512,14235,0.0199999995529651,1720493802000000,Cancelled
102872,14235,0.0199999995529651,1729178375000000,Complete
117211,14235,0.0199999995529651,1661055328000000,Complete
```

The `"created_at"` values are numbers like `1720493802000000`.

### Determining the Correct Time Unit:

Let's attempt to determine the correct unit by examining one of these values.

**Option 1: Microseconds**

If we assume the values are in **microseconds**, we divide by **1,000,000** to convert to seconds:

```
1720493802000000 / 1,000,000 = 1,720,493,802 seconds
```

Converting seconds since epoch to a date:

```sql
SELECT TO_TIMESTAMP(1720493802000000 / 1e6);
```

This gives:

```
'2024-06-09 17:30:02'  -- June 9, 2024
```

**Option 2: Nanoseconds**

If we assume the values are in **nanoseconds**, we divide by **1,000,000,000**:

```
1720493802000000 / 1,000,000,000 = 1,720,493,802 seconds
```

This results in the same date as above, indicating that the values are likely in **microseconds**.

### Adjusting the Query:

To fix the error, we need to adjust the query to divide the `"created_at"` values by **1,000,000** before converting them to timestamps.

Here is the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT 
    oi."id", 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1e6)) AS "order_month"
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
LIMIT 100;
```

### Checking for Future Dates:

However, notice that the converted date is in June 2024, which is beyond the scope of "prior to January 2024" specified in the task. This suggests that some `"created_at"` values represent dates in the future.

To ensure we only include dates prior to January 2024, we can add a `WHERE` clause to filter out future dates:

```sql
SELECT 
    oi."id", 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1e6)) AS "order_month"
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1e6) < '2024-01-01'
LIMIT 100;
```

### Handling Invalid Dates:

If there are still invalid dates causing errors, we can use the `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP` function, which returns `NULL` for invalid conversions instead of raising an error:

```sql
SELECT 
    oi."id", 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1e6)) AS "order_month"
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
WHERE TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1e6) < '2024-01-01'
LIMIT 100;
```

### Verifying the Data:

To further verify, you can check the minimum and maximum dates in your data:

```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1e6)) AS "Earliest Date",
    MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1e6)) AS "Latest Date"
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi;
```

### Completing the Task:

Now, to address your original task, you can write a query that:

1. Joins `"ORDER_ITEMS"` with `"PRODUCTS"` to get product cost and name.
2. Calculates profit per order item.
3. Calculates total profit and total cost per product per month.
4. Identifies the top product by profit for each month.
5. Includes all order items regardless of status.
6. Filters out dates beyond January 2024.
7. Orders the results chronologically by month.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    "order_month", 
    "product_name", 
    "total_cost", 
    "total_profit"
FROM (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1e6)) AS "order_month",
        p."name" AS "product_name",
        SUM(p."cost") AS "total_cost",
        SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "total_profit",
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('month', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1e6)) 
                           ORDER BY SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") DESC) AS "rank"
    FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
    JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."PRODUCTS" p
        ON oi."product_id" = p."id"
    WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1e6) < '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY "order_month", p."name"
) sub
WHERE "rank" = 1
ORDER BY "order_month" ASC;
```

### Explanation:

- **DATE_TRUNC** and **TO_TIMESTAMP**: Converts `"created_at"` to a timestamp and truncates it to the month.
- **SUM(p."cost")**: Calculates the total cost of the product for that month.
- **SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "total_profit"**: Calculates the total profit for the product for that month.
- **ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...)**: Assigns a rank to each product within each month based on total profit, ordering from highest to lowest.
- **WHERE "rank" = 1**: Filters to keep only the product with the highest total profit per month.
- **WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at" / 1e6) < '2024-01-01'**: Ensures that only order items prior to January 2024 are included.
- **ORDER BY "order_month" ASC**: Orders the results chronologically by month.

### Expected Output Format:

```csv
Month,Product_Name,Total_Cost,Total_Profit
month1:str,product_name1:str,total_cost1:float,total_profit1:float
month2:str,product_name2:str,total_cost2:float,total_profit2:float
...
```

### Note:

- Replace `month1:str` with the actual month (e.g., `2023-01-01`).
- Ensure that the dates in the `"created_at"` column are correctly converted and that future dates are excluded as per the task requirement.

### Additional Suggestions:

- If you continue to face errors, consider checking for any anomalous or corrupt data in the `"created_at"` column.
- Ensure that your data does not contain timestamps that are incorrectly formatted or that represent dates far in the future or past.

I hope this helps you resolve the error and complete the task successfully. Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!

2025-02-12 06:08:10 - root - INFO - I understand you're encountering the following error when executing your SQL query:

```
001065 (22023): 01ba564f-0004-9c12-0001-11c3010ef14e: SQL compilation error:
Function TRY_CAST cannot be used with arguments of types NUMBER(38,6) and TIMESTAMP_NTZ(6)
```

### Explanation of the Error:

The error occurs because when you divide `"created_at"` by `1e6`, it results in a number with decimal places (`NUMBER(38,6)` data type). The `TO_TIMESTAMP` function expects its input to be either an `INTEGER` or a `FLOAT`, representing the number of **seconds** since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). However, it's having trouble accepting a `NUMBER(38,6)` due to the scale (number of decimal places).

### Solution:

To resolve this error, we need to cast the result of the division to a `FLOAT` or an `INTEGER` before passing it to `TO_TIMESTAMP`. Here's how you can modify your query:

**Option 1: Cast to FLOAT**

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', TO_TIMESTAMP(CAST(oi."created_at" / 1e6 AS FLOAT))) AS "order_month",
    p."name" AS "product_name",
    SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "total_profit"
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."PRODUCTS" p
  ON oi."product_id" = p."id"
WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP(CAST(oi."created_at" / 1e6 AS FLOAT)) < '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY "order_month", p."name"
ORDER BY "order_month" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Option 2: Cast to INTEGER (if acceptable)**

If you don't need the fractional seconds, you can cast the result to a `BIGINT` or `INTEGER`, which will truncate the decimal part:

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', TO_TIMESTAMP(CAST(oi."created_at" / 1e6 AS BIGINT))) AS "order_month",
    p."name" AS "product_name",
    SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "total_profit"
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."PRODUCTS" p
  ON oi."product_id" = p."id"
WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP(CAST(oi."created_at" / 1e6 AS BIGINT)) < '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY "order_month", p."name"
ORDER BY "order_month" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

### Why This Works:

- **Casting to FLOAT:** By casting the result to `FLOAT`, we ensure that `TO_TIMESTAMP` receives a numeric input it can process, avoiding the issue with `NUMBER(38,6)`.
  
- **Casting to INTEGER/BIGINT:** If we cast to `BIGINT`, we remove the decimal places, and `TO_TIMESTAMP` can accept an integer value representing whole seconds since the epoch.

### Additional Notes:

- **Ensure Consistent Casting:** Make sure to apply the same casting method wherever you convert `"created_at"` to a timestamp in your query.

- **Verify Time Units:** As previously discussed, it's crucial to confirm that the `"created_at"` column is in **microseconds**. If it's in a different unit (e.g., milliseconds or nanoseconds), adjust the division accordingly (`1e3` for milliseconds, `1e9` for nanoseconds).

- **Check for Null Values:** If there are null or invalid values in `"created_at"`, you might want to use `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP` to handle them gracefully.

### Revised Query Using `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP`:

If you still encounter issues, consider using `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP`:

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP(CAST(oi."created_at" / 1e6 AS FLOAT))) AS "order_month",
    p."name" AS "product_name",
    SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "total_profit"
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."PRODUCTS" p
  ON oi."product_id" = p."id"
WHERE TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP(CAST(oi."created_at" / 1e6 AS FLOAT)) < '2024-01-01'
  AND TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP(CAST(oi."created_at" / 1e6 AS FLOAT)) IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "order_month", p."name"
ORDER BY "order_month" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

- **Why Use `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP`:** This function attempts to convert the input to a timestamp. If it fails, it returns `NULL` instead of throwing an error. This can prevent your query from failing due to bad data.

### Conclusion:

By casting the result of your division to an appropriate data type (`FLOAT` or `BIGINT`), you should be able to resolve the error and successfully run your query.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure! Let's start by identifying the relevant tables, columns, and potential usage for the task:

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

**Tables:**
- `"ORDER_ITEMS"`: Contains information about each item in an order, including sale price and product ID.
- `"PRODUCTS"`: Contains product details, including cost and name.

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

From `"ORDER_ITEMS"` table:
- `"product_id"`: Used to link each order item to a specific product.
- `"sale_price"`: Used to determine the revenue from the sale of each item.
- `"created_at"`: Used to determine the date when the order item was created, necessary for grouping by month.
- `"status"`: Although all statuses are included, this column may be useful for exploratory purposes.

From `"PRODUCTS"` table:
- `"id"`: Used to join with `"ORDER_ITEMS"."product_id"` to get product details.
- `"cost"`: Used to determine the cost of the product, necessary for calculating profit.
- `"name"`: Used to identify the product by name in the results.

**Conditions that may be used:**
- Joining `"ORDER_ITEMS"` and `"PRODUCTS"` on `"ORDER_ITEMS"."product_id" = "PRODUCTS"."id"`.
- Filtering `"ORDER_ITEMS"."created_at"` to include dates prior to January 2024.
- Calculating profit as `("sale_price" - "cost")`.
- Grouping data by month extracted from `"created_at"`.

### SQL Queries to Explore the Data:

Here are 10 different SQL queries to understand the data in relevant columns:

1. **Select basic product information from the PRODUCTS table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name", "cost", "retail_price"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."PRODUCTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select basic order item information from the ORDER_ITEMS table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "product_id", "sale_price", "created_at", "status"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve distinct product IDs from ORDER_ITEMS:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Join ORDER_ITEMS and PRODUCTS to get product names for each order item:**
   ```sql
   SELECT oi."id" AS "order_item_id", oi."product_id", p."name" AS "product_name", oi."sale_price"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
   JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."PRODUCTS" p
     ON oi."product_id" = p."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate profit for each order item (sale_price minus cost):**
   ```sql
   SELECT oi."id" AS "order_item_id", oi."sale_price", p."cost", (oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "profit"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
   JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."PRODUCTS" p
     ON oi."product_id" = p."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Extract the month and year from "created_at" in ORDER_ITEMS:**
   ```sql
   SELECT oi."id", DATE_TRUNC('month', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at")) AS "order_month"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List total sale_price and total cost per product:**
   ```sql
   SELECT p."name" AS "product_name", SUM(oi."sale_price") AS "total_sales", SUM(p."cost") AS "total_cost"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
   JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."PRODUCTS" p
     ON oi."product_id" = p."id"
   GROUP BY p."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find the number of order items per product:**
   ```sql
   SELECT p."name" AS "product_name", COUNT(oi."id") AS "order_item_count"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
   JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."PRODUCTS" p
     ON oi."product_id" = p."id"
   GROUP BY p."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List order items created before January 2024:**
   ```sql
   SELECT oi."id", oi."product_id", oi."sale_price", oi."created_at"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
   WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at") < TO_TIMESTAMP('2024-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate total profit per month per product:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', TO_TIMESTAMP(oi."created_at")) AS "order_month",
           p."name" AS "product_name",
           SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost") AS "total_profit"
    FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."ORDER_ITEMS" oi
    JOIN THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE."PRODUCTS" p
      ON oi."product_id" = p."id"
    GROUP BY "order_month", p."name"
    ORDER BY "order_month" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

### Notes:

- **Date Conversion:** In queries involving dates, `TO_TIMESTAMP` is used to convert numeric timestamps to timestamp format. Adjust the format if the "created_at" column stores dates differently.
- **Profit Calculation:** Profit is calculated as `("sale_price" - "cost")`.
- **Grouping and Aggregation:** Used `GROUP BY` to aggregate data per product or per month as needed.
- **Limiting Results:** Each query includes `LIMIT 100` to restrict the number of rows returned.
- **Distinct Values:** Used `DISTINCT` to get unique values where appropriate.
- **Aliases:** Used aliases (e.g., `oi` for `"ORDER_ITEMS"` and `p` for `"PRODUCTS"`) for brevity in queries.
- **Ordering Results:** Included `ORDER BY` in query 10 to present data chronologically by month.

These queries help in understanding the data distribution and relationships between the tables and columns relevant to the task, providing insight into how to calculate total profit per product per month.Query:

Answer:
001007 (22023): 01ba5650-0004-9c12-0001-11c3010ef162: SQL compilation error:
invalid type [TO_TIMESTAMP(TO_DOUBLE(SCALED_ROUND_INT_DIVIDE(OI."created_at", 1000000)))] for parameter 'TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ'End Exploring Related Columns
Task: For each month prior to January 2024, identify the product that achieved the highest total profit (calculated as the sum of sale_price minus the product’s cost) across all order items, then report the total cost and total profit for that top product per month, including all order items regardless of their status, and present the results chronologically by month.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the product with the highest total profit for each month prior to January 2024, we calculate the total profit for each product in each month as the sum of (sale_price minus the product's cost) across all order items, regardless of their status. Here is the requested data presented chronologically by month:

```csv
Month,Product_Name,Total_Cost,Total_Profit
month1:str,product_name1:str,total_cost1:float,total_profit1:float
month2:str,product_name2:str,total_cost2:float,total_profit2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': {'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': ['DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS', 'ORDERS', 'USERS', 'EVENTS', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS', 'PRODUCTS', 'ORDER_ITEMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
