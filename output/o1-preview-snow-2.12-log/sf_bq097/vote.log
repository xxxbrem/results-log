After comparing both SQL queries, **1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **1result.sql** joins the tables on the `"GeoFIPS"` column, which is the unique identifier for geographic regions. This method ensures that data from 2012 and 2017 are accurately matched for the same geographic region, even if there are slight differences or inconsistencies in the `"GeoName"` field.

- **0result.sql** joins on the `"GeoName"` column. While `"GeoName"` may uniquely identify regions in this dataset, relying on names can be less reliable due to potential variations or typos. Using the unique identifier `"GeoFIPS"` is a better practice for precise data matching.

Therefore, **1result.sql** provides a more accurate and reliable result for calculating the increase in average earnings per job between 2012 and 2017 for each geographic region in Massachusetts.
