2025-01-19 11:15:10 - root - INFO - Understood. Here's an adjusted SQL query that identifies the university faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks:

```sql
SELECT uf."FacRank", uf."FacFirstName", uf."FacLastName", uf."FacSalary"
FROM "university_faculty" uf
JOIN (
    SELECT "FacRank", AVG("FacSalary") AS avg_salary
    FROM "university_faculty"
    GROUP BY "FacRank"
) AS avg_salaries ON uf."FacRank" = avg_salaries."FacRank"
WHERE ABS(uf."FacSalary" - avg_salaries.avg_salary) = (
    SELECT MIN(ABS(uf2."FacSalary" - avg_salaries2.avg_salary))
    FROM "university_faculty" uf2
    JOIN (
        SELECT "FacRank", AVG("FacSalary") AS avg_salary
        FROM "university_faculty"
        GROUP BY "FacRank"
    ) AS avg_salaries2 ON uf2."FacRank" = avg_salaries2."FacRank"
    WHERE uf2."FacRank" = uf."FacRank"
)
LIMIT 1000;
```

This query works as follows:

- It joins each faculty member with the average salary of their rank.
- Calculates the absolute difference between their salary and the average salary.
- Finds the minimum absolute difference for each rank.
- Selects faculty members whose salary difference equals this minimum value.

This should return the faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `university_faculty`

  - **"FacRank"**: Used to group faculty members by rank to calculate the average salary for each rank.
  - **"FacFirstName"**: To retrieve faculty members' first names.
  - **"FacLastName"**: To retrieve faculty members' last names.
  - **"FacSalary"**: Used to compare individual salaries with the average salary of their respective ranks.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filtering by specific ranks using `WHERE "FacRank" = 'RankName'`.
- Ordering salaries to find those closest to the average.
- Limiting the number of results with `LIMIT`.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct faculty ranks:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "FacRank"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Retrieve distinct departments:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "FacDept"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **List all faculty members with their ranks and salaries:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Calculate the average salary for each rank:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   GROUP BY "FacRank"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Find faculty members with salaries above $100,000:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   WHERE "FacSalary" > 100000
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List faculty members ordered by salary ascending:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   ORDER BY "FacSalary" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List faculty members ordered by salary descending:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   ORDER BY "FacSalary" DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Count the number of faculty members in each rank:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", COUNT(*) AS "FacultyCount"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   GROUP BY "FacRank"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Find minimum and maximum salaries for each rank:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", MIN("FacSalary") AS "MinSalary", MAX("FacSalary") AS "MaxSalary"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   GROUP BY "FacRank"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **List faculty members hired after a certain date:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacHireDate", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
    FROM "university_faculty"
    WHERE "FacHireDate" > '2010-01-01'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Retrieve faculty members in a specific department:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacDept", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
    FROM "university_faculty"
    WHERE "FacDept" = 'Computer Science'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Calculate average salary by department:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "FacDept", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
    FROM "university_faculty"
    GROUP BY "FacDept"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Find faculty members with salaries close to the average salary of their rank:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
    FROM "university_faculty"
    WHERE ABS("FacSalary" - (SELECT AVG("FacSalary") FROM "university_faculty" WHERE "FacRank" = uf."FacRank")) < 5000
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```
    *(Note: `uf` is an alias for "university_faculty")*

14. **List the top 10 highest-paid faculty members:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
    FROM "university_faculty"
    ORDER BY "FacSalary" DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

15. **List faculty members along with their supervisors:**
    ```sql
    SELECT uf."FacFirstName", uf."FacLastName", uf."FacRank", uf."FacSalary", supervisor."FacFirstName" AS "SupervisorFirstName", supervisor."FacLastName" AS "SupervisorLastName"
    FROM "university_faculty" uf
    LEFT JOIN "university_faculty" supervisor ON uf."FacSupervisor" = supervisor."FacNo"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help to understand the data in the `university_faculty` table, especially concerning faculty ranks and salaries, which are crucial for solving the task of finding faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks.Query:

Task: Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the university faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks, we would calculate the average salary for each rank and then find the faculty member(s) with salaries nearest to these averages. The output includes their ranks, first names, last names, and salaries in the following format:

```csv
FacRank,FacFirstName,FacLastName,FacSalary
rank1:str,firstname1:str,lastname1:str,salary1:int
rank2:str,firstname2:str,lastname2:str,salary2:int
...
(Attention: answer in this order)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
