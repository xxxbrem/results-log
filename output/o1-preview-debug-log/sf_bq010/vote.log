To determine the correct SQL query that accurately answers the task, let's compare the three provided SQL scripts and their results:

### **Task:**
Find the top-selling product among customers who bought **'YouTube Men’s Vintage Henley'** in **July 2017**, excluding the product itself.

---

### **Comparison of SQL Scripts and Results:**

#### **Option 0: `0result.sql`**

- **Summary:**
  - **Does not filter** for purchase actions (`action_type = 6`).
  - Uses **exact match** (`=`) for product name.
- **Result:**
  - **Product:** Google 22 oz Water Bottle
  - **Total Quantity Sold:** 6,013

#### **Option 1: `1result.sql`**

- **Summary:**
  - **Filters** for purchase actions by setting `action_type = 6` in both the main query and subquery.
  - Uses **exact match** (`=`) for product name.
- **Result:**
  - **Product:** Google Sunglasses
  - **Total Quantity Sold:** 24

#### **Option 2: `2result.sql`**

- **Summary:**
  - **Does not filter** for purchase actions (`action_type = 6` is not specified).
  - Uses **fuzzy matching** with `ILIKE` and wildcards for product name.
- **Result:**
  - **Product:** YouTube Men's Vintage Tank
  - **Total Quantity Sold:** 33,336

### **Analysis and Selection:**

1. **Filtering for Purchase Actions (`action_type = 6`):**

   - **Importance:** To accurately identify actual purchases, it's crucial to filter hits by `action_type = 6`, which represents completed transactions.
   - **Option 1** is the **only script** that correctly filters both the customers and the products for purchase actions.
   - **Options 0 and 2** do **not** filter for `action_type = 6`, potentially including non-purchase actions like views or additions to the cart.

2. **Product Name Matching:**

   - **Exact Match vs. Fuzzy Matching:**
     - An **exact match** ensures that we're identifying the specific product without including similar but different items.
     - **Option 1** uses an exact match, which aligns with the task's focus on **'YouTube Men’s Vintage Henley'**.
     - **Option 2** uses **fuzzy matching** (`ILIKE '%YouTube Men%s Vintage Henley%'`), which may include unintended products due to variations in the name.

3. **Result Plausibility:**

   - The **extremely high quantity** in **Option 2** (33,336 units) for the **YouTube Men's Vintage Tank** seems unrealistic, especially compared to the quantities in **Options 0 and 1**.
   - This discrepancy suggests that **Option 2** may be counting non-purchase interactions (e.g., views or clicks), inflating the total quantity sold.

4. **Conclusion:**

   - **Option 1** provides the most accurate and reliable result because it:
     - Correctly filters for **actual purchases**.
     - Uses an **exact match** for the product name.
     - Excludes the target product from the results.
   - The resulting top-selling product, **Google Sunglasses**, with a total of **24 units sold**, is plausible and consistent with the filtered purchase data.
