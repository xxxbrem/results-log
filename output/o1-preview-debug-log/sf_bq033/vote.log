After comparing both SQL scripts and their results, I recommend using **1result.sql** as the correct script.

**Reason:**

1. **Accurate Date Handling:**
   - **1result.sql** uses `DATE_TRUNC('month', TRY_TO_DATE(...))` to truncate the filing dates to the first day of each month, ensuring accurate grouping by month.
   - This approach avoids potential issues with dates not matching exactly due to time components or other variations.

2. **Consistent Month Generation:**
   - The generation of months in **1result.sql** is based on `DATE_TRUNC('month', ...)`, which aligns perfectly with the truncation used in the filing counts.
   - This ensures that the months from the `months` CTE and the months in the `filing_counts` CTE match precisely when joined.

3. **Case-Insensitive Search with ILIKE:**
   - **1result.sql** uses the `ILIKE` operator for case-insensitive pattern matching, which is appropriate for searching the abstract text for the phrase `'internet of things'` regardless of capitalization.
   - While **0result.sql** uses `LIKE` after applying `LOWER()`, using `ILIKE` is more straightforward and readable.

4. **Cleaner and More Readable Code:**
   - The structure of **1result.sql** is cleaner, with clear separation of CTEs (`months` and `filing_counts`) and a straightforward final `SELECT` statement.
   - The use of `LPAD` and `TO_CHAR` functions improves the formatting of the month numbers and names.

5. **Consistent Results:**
   - Both scripts produce the same results in the output CSV files, indicating that they are functionally equivalent.
   - However, due to the factors above, **1result.sql** is preferred for its clarity and robustness.
