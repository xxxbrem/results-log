Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS`

  - **"country_code"**: To filter for U.S. publications (`'US'`).
  - **"filing_date"**: To filter filings between 2008 and 2022 and group by month and year.
  - **"abstract_localized"**: Contains the abstract text in VARIANT (JSON) format; used to search for the phrase `'internet of things'`.
  - **"publication_number"**: Unique identifier for publications; useful for retrieving specific records.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Country Filter**: `"country_code" = 'US'`
- **Filing Date Range**: `"filing_date"` between 20080101 and 20221231
- **Abstract Text Search**: `"abstract_localized":"text"::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'`

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **List Distinct Country Codes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **View Examples of Filing Dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "filing_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   ORDER BY "filing_date"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Check the Range of Filing Dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("filing_date") AS "min_filing_date", MAX("filing_date") AS "max_filing_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS;
   ```

4. **Explore Structure of "abstract_localized":**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT_KEYS("abstract_localized") AS "abstract_keys"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "abstract_localized" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Extract Abstract Text from "abstract_localized":**
   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "abstract_localized":"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "abstract_localized" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

6. **Find Publications with 'internet of things' in Abstract:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "abstract_localized":"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "abstract_localized":"text"::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

7. **List Distinct Years from Filing Dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT FLOOR("filing_date" / 10000) AS "year"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **View Filing Dates and Publication Dates Together:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "filing_date", "publication_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   ORDER BY "filing_date" ASC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

9. **List Distinct Application Kinds:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "application_kind"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Count Publications per Country Code:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "country_code", COUNT(*) AS "publication_count"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    GROUP BY "country_code"
    ORDER BY "publication_count" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the values and formats of the relevant columns needed to answer the task, such as verifying the country code for U.S. publications, examining the format of the filing dates, and exploring how to extract and search the abstract text for the phrase `'internet of things'`.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT "country_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 1000;

Task: How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase "internet of things") filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings, can be presented in the following format:

```csv
Year,Month_num,Month,Number_of_filings
2008,01,Jan,count:int
2008,02,Feb,count:int
...
2022,12,Dec,count:int
```

This table lists each month and the corresponding number of filings, ensuring that months with zero filings are included..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

FROM months m
LEFT JOIN filing_counts c ON m.month_start = c.month_start

```

This query calculates the number of U.S. patent publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase **"internet of things"**) filed each month from **2008** to **2022**, including months with no filings.

**Explanation:**

- **CTE `months`:** Generates all months from January 2008 to December 2022.
- **CTE `filing_counts`:** Counts the number of filings per month that meet the criteria.
  - Filters for U.S. publications (`"country_code" = 'US'`).
  - Considers filings between **2008-01-01** and **2022-12-31**.
  - Extracts the abstract text and searches for the phrase **"internet of things"**.
- **Main Query:**
  - Left joins the `months` CTE with `filing_counts` to include months with zero filings.
  - Extracts the **Year**, **Month_num**, and **Month** from the date.
  - Orders the results chronologically.

**Output Format:**

```csv
Year,Month_num,Month,Number_of_filings

This ensures every month in the date range is included, even if the count is zero.

2025-01-18 20:14:34 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase "internet of things") filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings, can be presented in the following format:

```csv
Year,Month_num,Month,Number_of_filings
2008,01,Jan,count:int
2008,02,Feb,count:int
...
2022,12,Dec,count:int
```

This table lists each month and the corresponding number of filings, ensuring that months with zero filings are included. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
