   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2010`
   WHERE `year` = 2010 AND `air_temperature` IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY `month`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Retrieve sea surface temperatures less than 5°C in 2011:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `sea_surface_temp`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2011`
   WHERE `year` = 2011 AND `sea_surface_temp` < 5
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Find distinct platforms used in 2012 data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `platform_type`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2012`
   WHERE `year` = 2012
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Select timestamps and air temperatures for July 2013:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `timestamp`, `air_temperature`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2013`
    WHERE `year` = 2013 AND `month` = 7
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the data distribution and availability of temperature readings in the relevant tables and columns for the years 2010 to 2014. They provide insights into the temperature values that will be used to compute the sum of absolute differences as per the task requirements.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT `year`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2010`
   WHERE `year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014
   LIMIT 1000;
Answer:
year

Task: What are the top 3 months between 2010 and 2014 with the smallest sum of absolute differences between the average air temperature, wet bulb temperature, dew point temperature, and sea surface temperature, including respective years and sum of differences? Please present the year and month in numerical format.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Month,SumAbsDiff
year1:int,month1:int,value1:float
year2:int,month2:int,value2:float
year3:int,month3:int,value3:float
```

We computed the average air temperature, wet bulb temperature, dew point temperature, and sea surface temperature for each month between 2010 and 2014. Then, for each month, we calculated the sum of the absolute differences between these averages. The top 3 months with the smallest sum of absolute differences are listed above, including the respective year, month in numerical format, and the sum of differences..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 08:48:33 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the top 3 months between 2010 and 2014 with the smallest sum of absolute differences between the average air temperature, wet bulb temperature, dew point temperature, and sea surface temperature, including respective years and sum of differences? Please present the year and month in numerical format., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Month,SumAbsDiff
year1:int,month1:int,value1:float
year2:int,month2:int,value2:float
year3:int,month3:int,value3:float
```

We computed the average air temperature, wet bulb temperature, dew point temperature, and sea surface temperature for each month between 2010 and 2014. Then, for each month, we calculated the sum of the absolute differences between these averages. The top 3 months with the smallest sum of absolute differences are listed above, including the respective year, month in numerical format, and the sum of differences. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
