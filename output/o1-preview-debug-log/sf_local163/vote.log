After comparing the two SQL scripts and their results, **I have determined that `1result.sql` is the correct answer**.

**Reason:**

- **Precision in Calculation**: In `1result.sql`, the absolute difference between each faculty member's salary and the average salary for their rank is calculated without rounding:

  ```sql
  ABS(f."FacSalary" - a."AvgSalary") AS "SalaryDiff"
  ```

  This ensures maximum precision in identifying the faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average.

- **Avoiding Rounding Errors**: In `2result.sql`, the `ROUND` function is applied to the salary difference:

  ```sql
  ROUND(ABS(uf."FacSalary" - avg_salary."AvgSalary"), 4) AS "SalaryDiff"
  ```

  Rounding the salary differences could lead to multiple faculty members having the same rounded difference when, in reality, their actual differences are slightly different. This might affect the accuracy of the result by potentially including or excluding faculty members who are not the closest.

- **Consistency with Data**: The results from `1result.sql` are derived using the most precise calculations based on the available data, ensuring that the faculty members selected truly have salaries closest to the average for their ranks.

**Therefore, the correct SQL script is:**

```plain
1result.sql
```
