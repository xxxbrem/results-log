**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `UNIVERSITY_FACULTY`
  - `"FacRank"`: Represents the rank of each faculty member; used to group salaries by rank.
  - `"FacFirstName"`: Faculty member's first name; used for identification.
  - `"FacLastName"`: Faculty member's last name; used for identification.
  - `"FacSalary"`: Faculty member's salary; used to calculate averages and compare with individual salaries.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Grouping faculty members by `"FacRank"` to calculate average salaries per rank.
- Comparing each faculty member's `"FacSalary"` to the average salary of their `"FacRank"`.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct faculty ranks to identify available ranks:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "FacRank"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **List all faculty members with their first name, last name, rank, and salary:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Calculate the average salary for each faculty rank:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   GROUP BY "FacRank"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Get the minimum and maximum salaries for each faculty rank:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", MIN("FacSalary") AS "MinSalary", MAX("FacSalary") AS "MaxSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   GROUP BY "FacRank"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Retrieve faculty members' salaries sorted by rank and salary:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   ORDER BY "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Count the number of faculty members in each rank:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", COUNT(*) AS "FacultyCount"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   GROUP BY "FacRank"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Identify faculty members with missing salary information:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   WHERE "FacSalary" IS NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Calculate the overall average salary of all faculty members:**

   ```sql
   SELECT AVG("FacSalary") AS "OverallAverageSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Retrieve the distribution of faculty salaries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "FacSalary"
   FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
   ORDER BY "FacSalary"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Get the maximum salary for each faculty rank:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "FacRank", MAX("FacSalary") AS "MaxSalary"
    FROM EDUCATION_BUSINESS.EDUCATION_BUSINESS.UNIVERSITY_FACULTY
    GROUP BY "FacRank"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution of faculty salaries across different ranks and identifying individual faculty members' salaries in relation to their rank averages.Query:

Task: Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To find the university faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks, we process the data in the `UNIVERSITY_FACULTY` table. For each `FacRank`, we calculate the average `FacSalary` and then identify the faculty member(s) with the salary nearest to this average. Below is the structured representation of the required information.

```csv
FacRank,FacFirstName,FacLastName,FacSalary
Rank1:str,FirstName1:str,LastName1:str,Salary:number closest to average of Rank1
Rank2:str,FirstName2:str,LastName2:str,Salary:number closest to average of Rank2
Rank3:str,FirstName3:str,LastName3:str,Salary:number closest to average of Rank3
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': {'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': ['HARDWARE_DIM_CUSTOMER', 'HARDWARE_DIM_PRODUCT', 'HARDWARE_FACT_GROSS_PRICE', 'HARDWARE_FACT_MANUFACTURING_COST', 'HARDWARE_FACT_PRE_INVOICE_DEDUCTIONS', 'HARDWARE_FACT_SALES_MONTHLY', 'SALARYDATASET', 'STAFFHOURS', 'UNIVERSITY_COURSE', 'UNIVERSITY_ENROLLMENT', 'UNIVERSITY_FACULTY', 'UNIVERSITY_OFFERING', 'UNIVERSITY_STUDENT', 'WEB_ACCOUNTS', 'WEB_EVENTS', 'WEB_ORDERS', 'WEB_REGION', 'WEB_SALES_REPS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 01:27:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find the university faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks, we process the data in the `UNIVERSITY_FACULTY` table. For each `FacRank`, we calculate the average `FacSalary` and then identify the faculty member(s) with the salary nearest to this average. Below is the structured representation of the required information.

```csv
FacRank,FacFirstName,FacLastName,FacSalary
Rank1:str,FirstName1:str,LastName1:str,Salary:number closest to average of Rank1
Rank2:str,FirstName2:str,LastName2:str,Salary:number closest to average of Rank2
Rank3:str,FirstName3:str,LastName3:str,Salary:number closest to average of Rank3
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
