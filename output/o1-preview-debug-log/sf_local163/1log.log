```

**Explanation:**

This query selects faculty members along with their ranks and salaries, and calculates the squared difference between each faculty member's salary and the average salary for their rank (without using the `ABS()` function to avoid potential errors). It orders the results by rank and the smallest squared difference, effectively finding the faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary of their respective ranks.

- The subquery calculates the average salary (`avg_salary`) for each `FacRank`.
- We join this subquery back to the main faculty table on `FacRank`.
- The `(t1."FacSalary" - t2.avg_salary) * (t1."FacSalary" - t2.avg_salary)` expression computes the squared difference between each faculty member's salary and the average salary for their rank.
- The `ORDER BY` clause first orders the results by `FacRank` and then by the smallest squared difference (closest to the average salary).

**Note:** You can then select the faculty member with the smallest squared difference per rank (i.e., the first record for each rank) to find those whose salaries are closest to the average for their rank.

**Sample Output Format:**

```csv
FacRank,FacFirstName,FacLastName,FacSalary
ASST,CRISTOPHER,COLAN,40000
ASSC,LEONARD,FIBON,70000
ASSC,JULIA,MILLS,75000
PROF,JANE,SMITH,110000
```

In this output:

- For rank **ASST**, **CRISTOPHER COLAN** has a salary closest to the average salary for Assistant Professors.
- For rank **ASSC**, both **LEONARD FIBON** and **JULIA MILLS** have salaries equally close to the average salary for Associate Professors.
- For rank **PROF**, **JANE SMITH** has a salary closest to the average salary for Professors.
