## ST_WITHIN

Returns true if the first geospatial object is fully contained by the second geospatial object. In other words:

The first GEOGRAPHY object g1 is fully contained by the second GEOGRAPHY object g2.
The first GEOMETRY object g1 is fully contained by the second GEOMETRY object g2.

Calling ST_WITHIN(g1, g2) is equivalent to calling ST_CONTAINS(g2, g1).
Although ST_COVEREDBY and ST_WITHIN might seem similar, the two functions have subtle differences. For details on the differences between “covered by” and “within”, see the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM).

Note This function does not support using a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection as input values.

Tip You can use the search optimization service to improve the performance of queries that call this function.
For details, see Search Optimization Service.

See also:ST_CONTAINS , ST_COVEREDBY


## Syntax

ST_WITHIN( <geography_expression_1> , <geography_expression_2> )

ST_WITHIN( <geometry_expression_1> , <geometry_expression_2> )


## Arguments


geography_expression_1A GEOGRAPHY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geography_expression_2A GEOGRAPHY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geometry_expression_1A GEOMETRY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geometry_expression_2A GEOMETRY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.


## Returns

BOOLEAN.

## Examples


## GEOGRAPHY examples

This shows a simple use of the ST_WITHIN function:

create table geospatial_table_01 (g1 GEOGRAPHY, g2 GEOGRAPHY);
insert into geospatial_table_01 (g1, g2) values 
    ('POLYGON((0 0, 3 0, 3 3, 0 3, 0 0))', 'POLYGON((1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2, 1 1))');

Copy SELECT ST_WITHIN(g1, g2) 
    FROM geospatial_table_01;
+-------------------+
| ST_WITHIN(G1, G2) |

Task: Can you tell me which bike trip in New York City on July 15, 2015, started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature for that day, as recorded by the Central Park weather station '94728'? If there's more than one trip that meets these criteria, I'd like to know about the one that starts in the smallest ZIP Code and ends in the largest ZIP Code.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: I'm sorry, but based on the data provided, there is no information about bike trips in New York City on July 15, 2015. The available data includes weather records from NOAA weather stations, such as the Central Park station '94728', but does not include bike trip data or ZIP Code information related to bike trips.

Without access to the bike trip data and the corresponding ZIP Code areas for that date, it's not possible to determine which bike trip started and ended in the ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature recorded by station '94728'..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

The available data includes weather records from NOAA weather stations, such as the Central Park station `'94728'`, but does not include bike trip data or ZIP Code information related to bike trips.

Without access to the bike trip data and the corresponding ZIP Code areas for that date, it's not possible to determine which bike trip started and ended in the ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature recorded by station `'94728'`.
