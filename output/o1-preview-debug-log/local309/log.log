Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant tables and columns:**

- **`results` table:**
  - `"race_id"`: To link each result to a race and obtain the year.
  - `"driver_id"`: To identify the driver in each race.
  - `"constructor_id"`: To identify the constructor in each race.
  - `"points"`: Points scored by the driver in a race.
  
- **`races` table:**
  - `"race_id"`: To link with the `results` table.
  - `"year"`: To determine the year of each race.
  
- **`drivers` table:**
  - `"driver_id"`: To link with the `results` table.
  - `"forename"`: Driver's first name.
  - `"surname"`: Driver's last name.
  - `"full_name"`: Driver's full name (if available).

- **`constructors` table:**
  - `"constructor_id"`: To link with the `results` table.
  - `"name"`: Name of the constructor.

**Possible conditions:**

- Join the `results` and `races` tables on `"race_id"` to get the year for each result.
- Aggregate points per `"driver_id"` and `"year"` to find the top driver each year.
- Aggregate points per `"constructor_id"` and `"year"` to find the top constructor each year.

**SQL queries to understand the data:**

1. **List all years available in the dataset:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year" FROM "races" ORDER BY "year" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Get a sample of races with their years:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "year", "name" FROM "races" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Find all drivers who have participated in races:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "driver_id" FROM "results" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Retrieve driver details:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "forename", "surname", "full_name" FROM "drivers" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **List all constructors in the results:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "constructor_id" FROM "results" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Get constructor names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", "name" FROM "constructors" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **View points scored by drivers in races:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "race_id", "points" FROM "results" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Check points scored by constructors in races:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", "race_id", "points" FROM "results" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Find races for a specific year (e.g., 2020):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "name" FROM "races" WHERE "year" = 2020 LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Get the total points per driver (unaggregated):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "driver_id", "points" FROM "results" ORDER BY "points" DESC LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Task: For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the driver and constructor who scored the most points each year, we sum the points for each driver and constructor across all races in a year using the `results` table, which contains the points awarded per race. We then identify the driver and constructor with the highest total points for each year.

```csv
Year,Driver Full Name,Constructor Name
year:int,driver_full_name:str,constructor_name:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 12:08:44 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the driver and constructor who scored the most points each year, we sum the points for each driver and constructor across all races in a year using the `results` table, which contains the points awarded per race. We then identify the driver and constructor with the highest total points for each year.

```csv
Year,Driver Full Name,Constructor Name

``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
