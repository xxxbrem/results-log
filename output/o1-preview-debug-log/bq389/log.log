2025-01-19 08:26:21 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to a mismatched quotation mark in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, you have a backtick (\`) instead of a closing single quote (') at the end of the date `'2020-12-31\``. This causes an unclosed string literal error because SQL expects string literals to be enclosed in single quotes.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT `date_local`, `arithmetic_mean`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
WHERE `state_name` = 'California' AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- Ensure that string literals are enclosed with single quotes `'...'`.
- Use backticks \`...\` for identifiers like table names and column names.
- In the `WHERE` clause, the dates `'2020-01-01'` and `'2020-12-31'` should both be enclosed with single quotes.

**Original Line with Error:**

```sql
AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31`
                                             ^---------^
```

- The backtick at the end should be a single quote.

**Corrected Line:**

```sql
AND `date_local` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
```

After making this correction, your query should execute without any syntax errors.

Task: Please calculate the monthly average levels of PM10, PM2.5 FRM, PM2.5 non-FRM, volatile organic emissions, SO2 (scaled by a factor of 10), and Lead (scaled by a factor of 100) air pollutants in California for the year 2020.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Month_num,Month,PM10,PM2.5_FRM,PM2.5_non_FRM,VOC,SO2_scaled,Lead_scaled
01,Jan,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float
02,Feb,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float
03,Mar,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float
04,Apr,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float

11,Nov,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float
12,Dec,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float,value:float

The table above shows the monthly average levels of PM10, PM2.5 FRM, PM2.5 non-FRM, volatile organic compounds (VOC), SO2 (scaled by a factor of 10), and Lead (scaled by a factor of 100) air pollutants in California for each month in the year 2020..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 08:30:32 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please calculate the monthly average levels of PM10, PM2.5 FRM, PM2.5 non-FRM, volatile organic emissions, SO2 (scaled by a factor of 10), and Lead (scaled by a factor of 100) air pollutants in California for the year 2020., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

The table above shows the monthly average levels of PM10, PM2.5 FRM, PM2.5 non-FRM, volatile organic compounds (VOC), SO2 (scaled by a factor of 10), and Lead (scaled by a factor of 100) air pollutants in California for each month in the year 2020. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
