After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Calculation of Percentages:** The query in `2result.sql` calculates the total number of patients per histological type and the number of patients with CDH1 mutations separately. This ensures that the percentage is accurately computed by dividing the number of mutated patients by the total number of patients for each histological type.
  
- **Exclusion of Null or Empty Histological Types:** The query includes conditions to exclude patients with null or empty `"histological_type"` values (`"histological_type" IS NOT NULL AND "histological_type" != ''`). This improves the accuracy by considering only valid histological types.
  
- **Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** By utilizing CTEs (`WITH` clauses), the query organizes the steps clearly:
  - `total_patients`: calculates the total number of patients per histological type.
  - `cdh1_patients`: identifies patients with CDH1 mutations.
  - `cdh1_hist_types`: counts the number of mutated patients per histological type.
  - The final `SELECT` computes the percentage for each histological type.
  
- **Alignment with the Task Objective:** The query directly addresses the task by computing the percentages of CDH1 mutations among different histological types of breast cancer in the PanCancer Atlas and selects the top five histological types with the highest percentages.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plain
2result.sql
