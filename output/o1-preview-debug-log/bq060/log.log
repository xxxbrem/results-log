Task: Which top 3 countries had the highest net migration in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers? And what are their migration rates?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the top 3 countries with the highest net migration rates in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers, we identify countries meeting the area criterion and list their net migration rates in descending order.

```csv
Country_name,Net_migration_rate
country1:str,rate1:float
country2:str,rate2:float
country3:str,rate3:float
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 05:02:05 - root - INFO - To determine the top 3 countries with the highest net migration rates in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers, we join the `birth_death_growth_rates` and `country_names_area` tables on `country_code`, filter for the year 2017 and areas greater than 500, and order by `net_migration` in descending order.

```sql
SELECT a.`country_name`, a.`net_migration`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_international.birth_death_growth_rates` AS a
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_international.country_names_area` AS b
ON a.`country_code` = b.`country_code`
WHERE a.`year` = 2017 AND b.`country_area` > 500
ORDER BY a.`net_migration` DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

The top 3 countries are:

```csv
Country_name,Net_migration_rate
Syria,61.46
Luxembourg,15.52
Qatar,14.61

2025-01-19 05:02:07 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which top 3 countries had the highest net migration in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers? And what are their migration rates?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the top 3 countries with the highest net migration rates in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers, we identify countries meeting the area criterion and list their net migration rates in descending order.

```csv
Country_name,Net_migration_rate
country1:str,rate1:float
country2:str,rate2:float
country3:str,rate3:float
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
