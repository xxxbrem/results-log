After reviewing both SQL queries, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Calculation of Daily New Cases:** The second query (`1result.sql`) calculates daily new cases by subtracting the previous day's confirmed cases only when previous day's data is available (`prev_day_cases IS NOT NULL`). This approach avoids inaccuracies that can occur when there's no prior data (which would otherwise result in misleading large daily increases on the first reporting day).

- **Exclusion of Initial Data Points Without Previous Day Cases:** By filtering out days where `prev_day_cases` is `NULL`, the query ensures that only legitimate daily increases are considered. This is crucial for accurate ranking and frequency counts, particularly when assessing how often each state appears in the daily top five.

- **Consistent Methodology in Both State and County Analysis:** The second query applies the same logical approach to both state and county-level data, ensuring consistency in how daily new cases are calculated and ranked.
