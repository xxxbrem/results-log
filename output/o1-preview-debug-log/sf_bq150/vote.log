After carefully comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct query for assessing whether different genetic variants affect the log₁₀-transformed TP53 expression levels in TCGA-BRCA samples.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Total Number of Samples:**
   - **`1result.sql`** reports a total of **114 samples**.
   - **`2result.sql`** reports a total of **115 samples**.
   - The correct number of unique samples, based on the provided data, should be **114**. The extra sample in `2result.sql` suggests a duplication or miscount.

2. **Group By Clause in the Data CTE:**
   - In **`2result.sql`**, the `Data` Common Table Expression (CTE) includes a `GROUP BY` clause on `expr."case_barcode"`, `expr."normalized_count"`, and `mut."Variant_Classification"`.
   - This grouping is unnecessary and may lead to duplicate records or incorrect counts. Specifically, grouping by `expr."normalized_count"` can cause multiple entries for the same `case_barcode` if there are technical replicates or slight variations in expression measurements.
   - In **`1result.sql`**, there is no such `GROUP BY` clause in the initial CTE, which ensures that each `case_barcode` is counted only once, preserving the accurate total sample count.

3. **Calculations of Mean Squares and F-Statistic:**
   - The calculations in **`1result.sql`** are consistent with standard ANOVA computations.
   - The Sum of Squares Between (SSB) and Sum of Squares Within (SSW) are correctly calculated based on the group means and the overall grand mean.
   - **`1result.sql`** correctly computes the degrees of freedom:
     - Degrees of freedom between groups: \( \text{{Number of groups}} - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 \).
     - Degrees of freedom within groups: \( \text{{Total samples}} - \text{{Number of groups}} = 114 - 3 = 111 \).
   - The Mean Square Between (MSB) and Mean Square Within (MSW) are then accurately calculated:
     - MSB = SSB / df_between.
     - MSW = SSW / df_within.
   - The F-statistic is correctly computed as MSB / MSW.

4. **Consistency with Provided Data:**
   - The number of mutation types is correctly identified as **3** in both queries, which aligns with the provided data.
   - The mean squares and F-statistic in **`1result.sql`** are consistent with the expected values given the data distribution.

5. **Potential Error in `2result.sql`:**
   - The extra sample in `2result.sql` likely affects the SSW and MSW calculations, leading to slightly different values for the mean squares and F-statistic.
   - The inclusion of the `GROUP BY` clause may have caused the query to count a sample more than once or to include an additional sample erroneously.

**Conclusion:**

Based on these observations, **`1result.sql`** is the correct query as it accurately computes the required statistics without unnecessary grouping or sample duplication. It provides the correct total number of samples, the number of mutation types, and precise calculations for the mean squares and F-statistic.
