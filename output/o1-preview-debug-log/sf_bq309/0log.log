- **Question_Length**: The length of the question body.
- **User_Reputation**: The reputation of the user who asked the question.
- **Net_Votes**: The net votes (score) of the question.
- **Badge_Count**: The number of badges the user has earned.

**Notes:**

- **COALESCE** is used to handle any `NULL` values in `reputation`, `score`, and `Badge_Count`, replacing them with `0` if they are `NULL`.
- The query ensures that `pq."body"` and `pq."view_count"` are not `NULL` and that `view_count` is greater than `0` to avoid division by zero and null value issues.
- The `EXISTS` clause in the `WHERE` condition checks for the existence of at least one answer with a score-to-view ratio above `0.01` for each question.
- The questions are ordered by the length of their body in descending order to get the longest ones.

This query selects the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions where each question either has an accepted answer or has an answer with a score-to-view ratio above `0.01`. It includes the following columns:

- `Question_ID`: The ID of the question.
- `Title`: The title of the question.
- `Question_Length`: The length of the question body.
- `User_Reputation`: The reputation of the user who posted the question.
- `Net_Votes`: The net votes (score) of the question.
- `Badge_Count`: The number of badges the user has earned.

**Note:** This version of the query avoids using an unsupported subquery type by replacing the `EXISTS` clause with a `LEFT JOIN` on a subquery that calculates the maximum score-to-view ratio for each question.

Task: Show the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions where the question has an accepted answer or an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01, including the user's reputation, net votes, and badge count.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Question_id,Title,Question_length,User_reputation,Net_votes,Badge_count
id1:int,title1:str,length1:int,reputation1:int,net_votes1:int,badge_count1:int

(Attention: Answer includes top 10 longest questions)
```

We have listed the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions (by length of the question body) where each question either has an accepted answer or has an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01. For each question, we include the question ID, title, question length, the user's reputation, net votes (score of the question), and the user's badge count..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKOVERFLOW': {'STACKOVERFLOW': ['BADGES', 'COMMENTS', 'POSTS_ANSWERS', 'POSTS_MODERATOR_NOMINATION', 'POSTS_ORPHANED_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_PRIVILEGE_WIKI', 'POSTS_QUESTIONS', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI_EXCERPT', 'POSTS_WIKI_PLACEHOLDER', 'POST_HISTORY', 'POST_LINKS', 'STACKOVERFLOW_POSTS', 'TAGS', 'USERS', 'VOTES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
