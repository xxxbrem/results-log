**Columns and Potential Usage:**

**Table: PICKING_LINE**
- `"order_id"`: Used to filter for order 421.
- `"product_id"`: Identifies products picked in the order.
- `"qty"`: Quantity of each product picked.

**Table: PRODUCTS**
- `"id"`: Product ID, used to join with `PICKING_LINE."product_id"`.
- `"name"`: Product name, used for display.

**Table: INVENTORY**
- `"product_id"`: Used to find inventory batches for each product.
- `"purchase_id"`: Links to `PURCHASES."id"`, used to get purchase dates.
- `"qty"`: Quantity available in each inventory batch.

**Table: PURCHASES**
- `"id"`: Purchase ID, links to `INVENTORY."purchase_id"`.
- `"purchased"`: Date of purchase, used to order inventory batches (FIFO).

**Conditions That May Be Used:**
- Filter `PICKING_LINE` where `"order_id" = 421`.
- Join `PICKING_LINE."product_id"` with `PRODUCTS."id"` to get product names.
- Join `INVENTORY` with `PURCHASES` to get purchase dates.
- Order by `"purchased"` date to implement FIFO logic.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Get all picking lines for order 421:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get distinct products picked for order 421:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get total quantities picked per product for order 421:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty_picked"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get product names for products picked in order 421:**
   ```sql
   SELECT pl."product_id", pr."name"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" pr
     ON pl."product_id" = pr."id"
   WHERE pl."order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get total quantities picked with product names for order 421:**
   ```sql
   SELECT pl."product_id", pr."name", SUM(pl."qty") AS "total_qty_picked"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" pr
     ON pl."product_id" = pr."id"
   WHERE pl."order_id" = 421
   GROUP BY pl."product_id", pr."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List inventory batches for products picked in order 421:**
   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", i."purchase_id", i."qty" AS "inventory_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   WHERE i."product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get purchase dates for inventory batches (FIFO order):**
   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", pu."purchased", i."qty" AS "inventory_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pu
     ON i."purchase_id" = pu."id"
   WHERE i."product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   ORDER BY pu."purchased" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get total inventory per product for products in order 421:**
   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", SUM(i."qty") AS "total_inventory_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   WHERE i."product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   GROUP BY i."product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate cumulative inventory quantities per product (FIFO):**
   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", pu."purchased", i."qty",
     SUM(i."qty") OVER (
       PARTITION BY i."product_id"
       ORDER BY pu."purchased" ASC
       ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
     ) AS "cumulative_inventory_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pu
     ON i."purchase_id" = pu."id"
   WHERE i."product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   ORDER BY i."product_id", pu."purchased" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Estimate average units picked per batch for each product:**
    ```sql
    SELECT pl."product_id", pr."name",
      COUNT(DISTINCT i."purchase_id") AS "batches_used",
      SUM(pl."qty") / COUNT(DISTINCT i."purchase_id") AS "avg_units_per_batch"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" pr
      ON pl."product_id" = pr."id"
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
      ON pl."product_id" = i."product_id"
    WHERE pl."order_id" = 421
    GROUP BY pl."product_id", pr."name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```
    *Note:* This query approximates the average units picked per batch by dividing the total units picked by the number of inventory batches available for each product. To accurately calculate this using the FIFO method, more complex logic would be required to simulate the picking process based on purchase dates and inventory quantities.

Task: Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
product_id,product_name,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,average_units2:float
...
```

The table above lists the products picked for order 421, including their product IDs, names, and the average number of units picked per inventory batch using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-21 02:37:01 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
product_id,product_name,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,average_units2:float
...
```

The table above lists the products picked for order 421, including their product IDs, names, and the average number of units picked per inventory batch using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
