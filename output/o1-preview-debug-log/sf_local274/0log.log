Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine which products were picked for order 421 and calculate the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns that contain this information.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **PICKING_LINE**
   - `"order_id"`: Used to filter records for order 421.
   - `"product_id"`: Identifies the products picked.
   - `"qty"`: Quantity of each product picked.
   - `"location_id"`: Helps link to the inventory batches.
   - Potential usage: Retrieve the products and quantities picked for order 421.

2. **INVENTORY**
   - `"product_id"`: Links to the products in inventory.
   - `"location_id"`: Used to match with picking lines.
   - `"purchase_id"`: Identifies the purchase batch (needed for FIFO).
   - `"qty"`: Quantity available in each inventory batch.
   - Potential usage: Determine which inventory batches were used for picking.

3. **PURCHASES**
   - `"id"`: Purchase batch identifier.
   - `"product_id"`: Identifies the product purchased.
   - `"purchased"`: Date of purchase (used for FIFO ordering).
   - Potential usage: Get purchase dates to apply FIFO method.

4. **PRODUCTS**
   - `"id"`: Product identifier.
   - `"name"`: Name of the product.
   - Potential usage: Retrieve product names for clarity.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filter records where `"order_id"` equals 421 in the `PICKING_LINE` table.
- Join `PICKING_LINE`, `INVENTORY`, and `PURCHASES` tables to link picks to inventory batches and purchase dates.
- Order by `"purchased"` date to apply FIFO (earliest purchases used first).
- Group by `"product_id"` to calculate average units picked per product.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve products and quantities picked for order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", "qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get distinct products picked for order 421:**

   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve inventory batches associated with the picked products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pl."product_id", pl."qty", pl."location_id", inv."purchase_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" inv
     ON pl."location_id" = inv."location_id" AND pl."product_id" = inv."product_id"
   WHERE pl."order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get purchase dates for the inventory batches to apply FIFO:**

   ```sql
   SELECT inv."product_id", inv."purchase_id", pur."purchased" AS "purchase_date"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" inv
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pur
     ON inv."purchase_id" = pur."id"
   WHERE inv."product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   ORDER BY pur."purchased" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate total quantity picked per product for order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_picked_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate average quantity picked per product for order 421:**

   SELECT "product_id", AVG("qty") AS "average_units_picked"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Retrieve purchase details of the products to implement FIFO:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pur."product_id", pur."purchased" AS "purchase_date", pur."qty" AS "purchased_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pur
   WHERE pur."product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   ORDER BY pur."purchased" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get product names for the products picked in order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p."name", pl."product_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" p
     ON pl."product_id" = p."id"
   WHERE pl."order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve inventory quantities for the products in order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT inv."product_id", inv."qty" AS "inventory_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" inv
   WHERE inv."product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Detailed view combining picks, inventory, and purchases to trace FIFO usage:**

    ```sql
    SELECT pl."product_id", pl."qty" AS "picked_qty", inv."purchase_id", pur."purchased" AS "purchase_date"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" inv
      ON pl."location_id" = inv."location_id" AND pl."product_id" = inv."product_id"
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pur
      ON inv."purchase_id" = pur."id"
    WHERE pl."order_id" = 421
    ORDER BY pur."purchased" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **List all picking lines for order 421 with location details:**

    ```sql
    SELECT pl."product_id", pl."qty", pl."location_id", loc."warehouse", loc."aisle", loc."position"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."LOCATIONS" loc
      ON pl."location_id" = loc."id"
    WHERE pl."order_id" = 421
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Identify the number of inventory batches used per product:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "location_id") AS "batches_used"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
    WHERE "order_id" = 421
    GROUP BY "product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Get the earliest purchase date for each product (FIFO starting point):**

    ```sql
    SELECT pur."product_id", MIN(pur."purchased") AS "earliest_purchase_date"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pur
    WHERE pur."product_id" IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
      FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
      WHERE "order_id" = 421
    )
    GROUP BY pur."product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Compute total available inventory for the products in order 421:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_inventory_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY"
    WHERE "product_id" IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
      FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
      WHERE "order_id" = 421
    )
    GROUP BY "product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Retrieve order details along with customer information:**

    ```sql
    SELECT o."id" AS "order_id", o."customer_id", c."name" AS "customer_name", ol."product_id", ol."qty" AS "ordered_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERS" o
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" ol ON o."id" = ol."order_id"
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."CUSTOMERS" c ON o."customer_id" = c."id"
    WHERE o."id" = 421
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries are designed to explore the relevant data and understand how to calculate the average number of units picked per product for order 421 using the FIFO method. They progressively build upon each other, starting from simple data retrieval to more complex joins that link the picking lines with inventory and purchase details.

By examining the purchase dates and quantities, we can apply the FIFO principle to determine which inventory batches were used first and calculate the average units picked accordingly.Query:

Task: Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine which products were picked for order 421 and calculate the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method, we analyze the picking records associated with that order. The FIFO method ensures that the oldest inventory is used first when fulfilling orders.

```csv
product_id,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,average_units2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
