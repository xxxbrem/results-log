After analyzing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for calculating the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method for order 421.

**Reasoning:**

1. **FIFO Logic Application:**
   - **`2result.sql`** explicitly applies the FIFO method by considering the cumulative inventory quantities based on purchase dates. It uses window functions to calculate the cumulative inventory and determines how much quantity is used from each batch in the correct FIFO sequence.
   - **`1result.sql`**, on the other hand, calculates the average directly from the picking line quantities without ensuring that the FIFO sequence of inventory batches is considered.

2. **Accurate Batch Usage Calculation:**
   - **`2result.sql`** accurately calculates the number of batches used per product by identifying which inventory batches contributed to fulfilling the order. It computes the average units picked per batch based on the actual batches used.
   - **`1result.sql`** may include batches that were not actually used in fulfilling order 421, as it joins on inventory batches based on location and product but doesn't account for the cumulative quantities picked versus available in each batch.

3. **Detailed Subqueries and Joins:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into understandable parts:
     - **PickedProducts**: Summarizes the total quantity picked per product.
     - **InventoryBatches**: Orders inventory batches by purchase date and calculates cumulative inventory quantities.
     - **UsedBatches**: Determines the quantity used from each batch based on the cumulative picked quantity.
     - **BatchesUsedPerProduct**: Calculates the number of batches used and the total quantity used per product.
   - This structured approach ensures that the FIFO method is properly implemented.

4. **Accuracy in Results:**
   - Both queries produce the same numerical results for average units picked per batch:
     - Product 4280 (Hoppy Crude Oil): 36.6667 units per batch
     - Product 6520 (Der Helle Kumpel): 23.3333 units per batch
   - However, the method used in **`2result.sql`** provides confidence that these averages are calculated using the FIFO method, as required by the task.

**Conclusion:**

Given that **`2result.sql`** correctly implements the FIFO logic and ensures accurate calculation of average units picked per batch, it is the appropriate choice for the given task.
