Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task of determining which products were picked for order 421 and calculating the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method, we need to consider the relevant tables and columns that can provide this information.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **PICKING_LINE** (`ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PICKING_LINE`)
   - **"order_id"**: Identifies the order number; used to filter picking records for order 421.
   - **"product_id"**: Identifies the products picked; used to determine which products were picked.
   - **"qty"**: Quantity of the product picked; used to calculate the total and average quantities picked.
   - **"location_id"**: Warehouse location where the product was picked; may help link to inventory.

   **Condition:** `"order_id" = 421`

2. **INVENTORY** (`ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY`)
   - **"product_id"**: Identifies the product in inventory; used to link with picking lines.
   - **"purchase_id"**: Links to the purchase order; helps determine when the inventory was added.
   - **"qty"**: Quantity available in inventory; used to apply the FIFO method.
   - **"location_id"**: Location of the inventory; may help link to picking lines.

3. **PURCHASES** (`ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES`)
   - **"id"**: Purchase ID; links to the inventory records.
   - **"product_id"**: Identifies the product purchased; used to match with inventory and picking lines.
   - **"purchased"**: Date when the product was purchased; critical for applying the FIFO method.
   - **"qty"**: Quantity purchased; helps in calculating inventory levels.

4. **PRODUCTS** (`ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PRODUCTS`)
   - **"id"**: Product ID; used to get product details.
   - **"name"**: Name of the product; for better readability in results.

**Potential Conditions to be Used:**

- Filter picking lines by `"order_id" = 421`.
- Order inventory or purchase records by `"purchased"` date ascending to apply FIFO.
- Join tables on `"product_id"` to link products, picking lines, inventory, and purchases.
- Use aggregate functions like `SUM("qty")` to compute total quantities.

---

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **Retrieve Distinct Products Picked for Order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE"
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get Quantities Picked for Each Product in Order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty_picked"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE"
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve All Picking Lines for Order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE"
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get Product Names for Products Picked in Order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "pr"."name"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PRODUCTS" AS "pr"
   INNER JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE" AS "pl"
     ON "pr"."id" = "pl"."product_id"
   WHERE "pl"."order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get Total Quantity Picked for Each Product Name in Order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pr"."name", SUM("pl"."qty") AS "total_qty_picked"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PRODUCTS" AS "pr"
   INNER JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE" AS "pl"
     ON "pr"."id" = "pl"."product_id"
   WHERE "pl"."order_id" = 421
   GROUP BY "pr"."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve Inventory Entries for Products Picked in Order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "i"."product_id", "i"."purchase_id", "i"."qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."INVENTORY" AS "i"
   INNER JOIN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   ) AS "p"
     ON "i"."product_id" = "p"."product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get Purchase Dates for Inventory Entries (Applying FIFO):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "i"."product_id", "i"."purchase_id", "pur"."purchased", "i"."qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."INVENTORY" AS "i"
   INNER JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PURCHASES" AS "pur"
     ON "i"."purchase_id" = "pur"."id"
   WHERE "i"."product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   ORDER BY "pur"."purchased" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate Total Inventory Available per Product (For FIFO Calculation):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_inventory_qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."INVENTORY"
   WHERE "product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421

9. **Retrieve Purchase Details for Products Picked in Order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pur"."product_id", "pur"."id" AS "purchase_id", "pur"."purchased", "pur"."qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PURCHASES" AS "pur"
   WHERE "pur"."product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   ORDER BY "pur"."purchased" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Get Average Number of Units Picked for Each Product in Order 421:**

    ```sql

    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE"
    WHERE "order_id" = 421
    GROUP BY "product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **List All Purchase Batches for Products in Order 421 (For FIFO Analysis):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "pur"."product_id", "pur"."id" AS "purchase_id", "pur"."purchased", "pur"."qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PURCHASES" AS "pur"
    WHERE "pur"."product_id" IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
      FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE"
      WHERE "order_id" = 421
    )
    ORDER BY "pur"."purchased" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Determine Remaining Inventory After Order 421 Picks (Hypothetical):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "i"."product_id", ("i"."qty" - COALESCE("pl_total"."total_qty_picked", 0)) AS "remaining_qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."INVENTORY" AS "i"
    LEFT JOIN (
      SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty_picked"
      FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE"
      WHERE "order_id" = 421
      GROUP BY "product_id"
    ) AS "pl_total"
      ON "i"."product_id" = "pl_total"."product_id"
    WHERE "i"."product_id" IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
      FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE"
      WHERE "order_id" = 421
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Get Detailed Picking Information Including Product Names for Order 421:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "pl"."product_id", "pr"."name", "pl"."qty", "pl"."location_id", "pl"."line_no"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE" AS "pl"
    INNER JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PRODUCTS" AS "pr"
      ON "pl"."product_id" = "pr"."id"
    WHERE "pl"."order_id" = 421
    ORDER BY "pl"."line_no"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List Inventory Locations Used for Picking Order 421:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "pl"."location_id", "loc"."warehouse", "loc"."aisle", "loc"."position"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE" AS "pl"
    INNER JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."LOCATIONS" AS "loc"
      ON "pl"."location_id" = "loc"."id"
    WHERE "pl"."order_id" = 421
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Identify the Earliest Purchase Dates for Products Picked (Validating FIFO):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "i"."product_id", MIN("pur"."purchased") AS "earliest_purchase_date"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."INVENTORY" AS "i"
    INNER JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PURCHASES" AS "pur"
      ON "i"."purchase_id" = "pur"."id"
    WHERE "i"."product_id" IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
      FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PICKING_LINE"
      WHERE "order_id" = 421
    )
    GROUP BY "i"."product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the necessary data to understand which products were picked for order 421 and how inventory levels and purchase dates affect the FIFO calculation. The queries also help in determining if additional data (like linking specific inventory batches to picking records) is required to accurately apply the FIFO method.

---

**Note:** The actual computation of the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO method would require detailed transaction-level data linking each pick to specific inventory batches (i.e., knowing exactly which inventory items were used for each pick). If such linkage does not exist in the data (e.g., if `PICKING_LINE` does not reference `INVENTORY` records directly), assumptions may need to be made, or additional data may be necessary.

For the purposes of this task, the provided queries help in understanding the data and setting up the groundwork for further analysis.Query:

Task: Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine which products were picked for order 421 and calculate the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method, we analyze the picking records associated with that order. The FIFO method ensures that the oldest inventory is used first when fulfilling orders.

```csv
product_id,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,average_units2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-21 01:26:27 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine which products were picked for order 421 and calculate the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method, we analyze the picking records associated with that order. The FIFO method ensures that the oldest inventory is used first when fulfilling orders.

```csv
product_id,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,average_units2:float
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
