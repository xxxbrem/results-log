To solve the task, we need to identify relevant tables, columns, and conditions.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`
  - `country_code`: To identify countries.
  - `country_name`: To get the country names.
  - `indicator_code`: To filter for crude birth rate indicator.
  - `indicator_name`: To verify the indicator is crude birth rate.
  - `value`: To get the crude birth rate values.
  - `year`: To filter data for the 1980s (1980-1989).
- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.country_summary`
  - `country_code`: To join with `indicators_data` on country code.
  - `short_name`: To get country names.
  - `region`: To identify the region of each country.
  - `income_group`: To filter for high-income countries.

**Conditions:**

- Filter `indicator_code` for crude birth rate (need to find the exact code).
- Filter `year` between 1980 and 1989.
- Filter `income_group` to 'High income'.

   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`
   WHERE LOWER(`indicator_name`) LIKE '%crude birth rate%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **List all high-income countries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `country_code`, `short_name`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.country_summary`
   WHERE `income_group` = 'High income'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Get regions of high-income countries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `region`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.country_summary`
   WHERE `income_group` = 'High income'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Retrieve crude birth rate data for the 1980s:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `country_code`, `year`, `value`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`
   WHERE `indicator_code` = 'SP.DYN.CBRT.IN' AND `year` BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **List high-income countries with their regions and income groups:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `country_code`, `short_name`, `region`, `income_group`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.country_summary`
   WHERE `income_group` = 'High income'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Calculate average crude birth rate per country during the 1980s:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `country_code`, AVG(`value`) AS avg_birth_rate
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data`
   WHERE `indicator_code` = 'SP.DYN.CBRT.IN' AND `year` BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989
   GROUP BY `country_code`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Join country data with birth rate data for high-income countries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT cs.`country_code`, cs.`short_name`, cs.`region`, id.`year`, id.`value`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.country_summary` AS cs
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data` AS id
   ON cs.`country_code` = id.`country_code`
   WHERE cs.`income_group` = 'High income' AND id.`indicator_code` = 'SP.DYN.CBRT.IN' AND id.`year` BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Get average birth rate per region for high-income countries in the 1980s:**

   ```sql
   SELECT cs.`region`, AVG(id.`value`) AS avg_birth_rate
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.country_summary` AS cs
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data` AS id
   ON cs.`country_code` = id.`country_code`
   WHERE cs.`income_group` = 'High income' AND id.`indicator_code` = 'SP.DYN.CBRT.IN' AND id.`year` BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989
   GROUP BY cs.`region`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Identify the highest average crude birth rate among high-income countries per region:**

   ```sql
   SELECT cs.`region`, cs.`short_name`, AVG(id.`value`) AS avg_birth_rate
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.country_summary` AS cs
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data` AS id
   ON cs.`country_code` = id.`country_code`
   WHERE cs.`income_group` = 'High income' AND id.`indicator_code` = 'SP.DYN.CBRT.IN' AND id.`year` BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989
   GROUP BY cs.`region`, cs.`short_name`
   ORDER BY cs.`region`, avg_birth_rate DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **List high-income countries with the highest average crude birth rate in each region during the 1980s:**

    ```sql
    SELECT t.`region`, t.`short_name` AS country, t.`avg_birth_rate`
    FROM (
      SELECT cs.`region`, cs.`short_name`, AVG(id.`value`) AS avg_birth_rate,
             ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY cs.`region` ORDER BY AVG(id.`value`) DESC) AS rn
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.country_summary` AS cs
      JOIN `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data` AS id
      ON cs.`country_code` = id.`country_code`
      WHERE cs.`income_group` = 'High income' AND id.`indicator_code` = 'SP.DYN.CBRT.IN' AND id.`year` BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989
      GROUP BY cs.`region`, cs.`short_name`
    ) AS t
    WHERE t.rn = 1
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

**Note:** The `indicator_code` for crude birth rate is assumed to be `'SP.DYN.CBRT.IN'`. You should verify this by running the first query to ensure you're using the correct code.

The above queries help in understanding the data and getting insights into the values in the related columns necessary to answer the task.Query:
SELECT t.region, t.short_name AS country, t.avg_birth_rate
FROM (
  SELECT cs.region, cs.short_name, AVG(id.value) AS avg_birth_rate,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY cs.region ORDER BY AVG(id.value) DESC) AS rn
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.country_summary` AS cs
  JOIN `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data` AS id
  ON cs.country_code = id.country_code
  WHERE cs.income_group LIKE 'High income%' AND id.indicator_code = 'SP.DYN.CBRT.IN' AND id.year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989
  GROUP BY cs.region, cs.short_name
) AS t
WHERE t.rn = 1;

Task: Which high-income country had the highest average crude birth rate respectively in each region, and what are their corresponding average birth rate, during the 1980s?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The high-income country with the highest average crude birth rate during the 1980s in each region is as follows:

```csv
Region,Country,AverageBirthRate
region1:str,country1:str,rate1:float
region2:str,country2:str,rate2:float
...
```

This table lists, for each region, the high-income country that had the highest average crude birth rate during the 1980s, along with their corresponding average birth rate..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 09:03:25 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which high-income country had the highest average crude birth rate respectively in each region, and what are their corresponding average birth rate, during the 1980s?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The high-income country with the highest average crude birth rate during the 1980s in each region is as follows:

```csv
Region,Country,AverageBirthRate
region1:str,country1:str,rate1:float
region2:str,country2:str,rate2:float
...
```

This table lists, for each region, the high-income country that had the highest average crude birth rate during the 1980s, along with their corresponding average birth rate. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
