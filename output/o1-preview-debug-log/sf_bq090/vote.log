After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Strategy Identification:** The query in `1result.sql` correctly identifies the strategies based on the `PartyID` prefixes:
  - **Feeling-lucky strategy:** PartyIDs starting with `'LUCKY'` (`'LUCKYBTC'`, `'LUCKYES'`, `'LUCKYNQ'`).
  - **Momentum strategy:** PartyIDs starting with `'MOMO'` (`'MOMOES'`, `'MOMONQ'`, `'MOMOBTC'`).

- **Filtering Long-side Trades:** It filters trades where the side is `'LONG'`, as required.

- **Intrinsic Value Calculation:** It calculates the intrinsic value using `GREATEST(t."LastPx" - t."StrikePrice", 0)` to ensure only positive intrinsic values are considered, which is appropriate for options.

- **Average Calculation:** The query computes the average intrinsic value for each strategy and calculates the difference between them.

- **Float Precision:** The final result is rounded to 4 decimal places using the `ROUND` function, complying with the instruction.

- **Correct Logic Application:** The negative difference (`-0.2764`) indicates that the average intrinsic value for the feeling-lucky strategy is lower than that of the momentum strategy under long-side trades by approximately `0.2764`.

This aligns with the task's requirement to determine how much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy compared to those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades.
