After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL to use for the following reasons:

1. **Correct Strategy Identification:**
   - **`1result.sql`** correctly identifies trades using the **feeling-lucky strategy** by selecting `PartyID`s that start with `'LUCKY%'` and the **momentum strategy** by selecting `PartyID`s that start with `'MOMO%'`.
   - In contrast, **`0result.sql`** incorrectly uses `'PREDICTNQ'` to represent the feeling-lucky strategy, but `PartyID`s starting with `'PREDICT%'` actually represent the **predictive** strategy, not feeling-lucky.

2. **Appropriate Intrinsic Value Calculation:**
   - **`1result.sql`** calculates the average intrinsic value as the difference `t."LastPx" - t."StrikePrice"` for each strategy without taking the absolute value. This approach considers the direction of the trade's profitability, which is appropriate if negative values are meaningful in the context.
   - **`2result.sql`** calculates the average of the absolute intrinsic values `ABS(t."LastPx" - t."StrikePrice")`, which may not align with the intended calculation if negative intrinsic values are significant.

3. **Consistent Filtering for Long-Side Trades:**
   - **`1result.sql`** correctly filters trades where the `"Side"` is `'LONG'`, ensuring that only long-side trades are considered in the comparison.
   - Both **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** also filter for `'LONG'` sides but have other issues as mentioned above.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query to determine how much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy compared to those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades.
