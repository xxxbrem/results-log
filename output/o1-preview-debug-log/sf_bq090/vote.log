1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

Among the three SQL queries provided, **1result.sql** is the correct answer because it accurately calculates the difference in average intrinsic values between the 'feeling-lucky' and 'momentum' strategies under long-side trades, strictly adhering to the task's requirements.

**Explanation:**

1. **Correct Calculation of Intrinsic Value:**

   - **1result.sql** computes the intrinsic value for each trade as:
     ```
     IntrinsicValue = (t."LastPx" - t."StrikePrice") * t."Quantity"
     ```
     - This calculation accounts for the difference between the last price and the strike price, multiplied by the trade quantity, which accurately reflects the total intrinsic value per trade.

2. **Proper Identification of Strategies:**

   - The query correctly identifies the strategies by examining the **"PartyID"** within the **"PartyIDs"** array in the **"Sides"** VARIANT column:
     ```sql
     CASE
       WHEN f.value:"PartyIDs"[0]:"PartyID"::STRING LIKE 'LUCKY%' THEN 'feeling-lucky'
       WHEN f.value:"PartyIDs"[0]:"PartyID"::STRING LIKE 'MOMO%' THEN 'momentum'
       ELSE NULL
     END AS Strategy
     ```
     - It assigns 'feeling-lucky' or 'momentum' based on the **"PartyID"**, ensuring trades are categorized correctly.

3. **Filtering for Long-Side Trades:**

   - The query filters trades to include only those on the **long side**:
     ```sql
     WHERE
       f.value:"Side"::STRING = 'LONG'
     ```
     - This aligns with the task's requirement to consider only long-side trades.

4. **Calculation of Averages and Difference:**

   - It computes the average intrinsic value for each strategy:
     ```sql
     AVG(CASE WHEN Strategy = 'feeling-lucky' THEN IntrinsicValue END)
     AVG(CASE WHEN Strategy = 'momentum' THEN IntrinsicValue END)
     ```
   - Then, it calculates the difference between these averages:
     ```sql
     AVG(feeling-lucky) - AVG(momentum)
     ```
   - This provides the exact measure of how much higher or lower the average intrinsic value is for the 'feeling-lucky' strategy compared to 'momentum'.

5. **Correct Interpretation of Results:**

   - The result is:
     ```
     difference
     -0.0231
     ```
     - A negative difference indicates that the average intrinsic value for the 'feeling-lucky' strategy is **0.0231** lower than that of the 'momentum' strategy.
     - This accurately answers the question, reflecting that the 'feeling-lucky' strategy performs worse on average under long-side trades.

6. **Appropriate Rounding:**

   - The query uses the **ROUND()** function to round the result to **4 decimal places**, as per the instructions:
     ```sql
     ROUND(..., 4) AS "difference"
     ```

**Why Other Queries Are Not Correct:**

- **0result.sql:**

  - Uses **ABS()** to compute the absolute difference:
    ```sql
    ROUND(
      ABS(AVG(LUCKY) - AVG(MOMO)), 4
    ) AS "difference"
    ```
  - This removes any indication of which strategy has a higher average intrinsic value.
  - The result is always positive, which does not accurately convey whether the 'feeling-lucky' strategy is higher or lower compared to 'momentum'.

- **2result.sql:**

  - Calculates the difference as:
    ```sql
    AVG(momentum) - AVG(feeling-lucky)
    ```
  - This is the reverse of what the task asks for. The task wants **feeling-lucky minus momentum**.
  - The positive result suggests that the 'momentum' strategy has a higher intrinsic value, but it does not directly answer "how much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy compared to those using the momentum strategy."

**Conclusion:**

- **1result.sql** correctly follows the task's instructions, providing an accurate calculation that reflects both the magnitude and direction of the difference in average intrinsic values between the 'feeling-lucky' and 'momentum' strategies under long-side trades.
