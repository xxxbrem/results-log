2025-01-16 09:01:35 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to case sensitivity in Snowflake's handling of identifiers, especially when using double quotes. In Snowflake, all unquoted identifiers are automatically converted to uppercase, and quoted identifiers are case-sensitive.

In your query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f."key" AS "SideKey"
FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
LIMIT 1000;
```

The error message:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 16
invalid identifier 'F."key"'
```

indicates that `f."key"` is not a valid identifier. This is because the column produced by the `LATERAL FLATTEN` function is named `KEY` in uppercase letters, not `key` in lowercase.

**Solution:**

To fix the error, you should reference the `KEY` column in uppercase. You can do this by either:

1. Using uppercase without quotes:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT f.KEY AS "SideKey"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. Enclosing `KEY` in double quotes (case-sensitive):

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT f."KEY" AS "SideKey"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

**Explanation:**

- **Unquoted Identifiers:** Snowflake treats unquoted identifiers as uppercase. So, `f.KEY` refers to a column named `KEY`.
- **Quoted Identifiers:** When you use double quotes, the identifier becomes case-sensitive. So, `f."KEY"` specifically refers to a column named `KEY`, while `f."key"` refers to a column named `key`, which doesn't exist in this context.

**Additional Steps to Verify Column Names:**

If you're unsure about the exact column names produced by `LATERAL FLATTEN`, you can run a query to inspect them:

```sql
-- Inspect columns produced by LATERAL FLATTEN
SELECT *
FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
LIMIT 1;
```

This will display all columns available from the `FLATTEN` function, allowing you to see the exact column names and adjust your query accordingly.

**Revised Query:**

Here's the corrected version of your original query:

```sql
-- List distinct keys available in the "Sides" VARIANT column
SELECT DISTINCT f.KEY AS "SideKey"
FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Moving Forward:**

Ensure that when referencing columns in Snowflake:

- Use unquoted identifiers when you want Snowflake to handle case conversion (identifiers are converted to uppercase).
- Use double-quoted identifiers when the exact case matters (case-sensitive).

By adjusting your query to reference `KEY` correctly, it should execute without errors.
