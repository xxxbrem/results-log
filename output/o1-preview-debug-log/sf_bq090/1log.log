Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Columns and their potential usage:**

- **"Sides"**: This VARIANT column likely contains nested JSON data about each side of the trade, including details such as **"Side"** (e.g., 'Long', 'Short'), **"Strategy"** (e.g., 'feeling-lucky', 'momentum'), and **"IntrinsicValue"**. These details are essential for filtering trades based on strategy and side, and for accessing intrinsic values.

- **"Quantity"**: Represents the number of units traded. While not directly related to the intrinsic value per unit, it could be useful for calculating total intrinsic values or weighted averages.

- **"StrikePrice"** and **"LastPx"**: These may be used in calculating the intrinsic value if not already provided in the **"Sides"** data.

- **"TradeDate"**: The date of the trade, which could be helpful if time-based filtering is needed.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Filter by "Side"**: Select trades where **"Side"** is 'Long' to focus on long-side trades.

- **Filter by "Strategy"**: Select trades using 'feeling-lucky' or 'momentum' strategies.

- **Extract "IntrinsicValue"**: Retrieve the intrinsic value from the nested **"Sides"** data.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve the "Sides" column to examine its structure:**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."Sides"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Flatten the "Sides" column to explore nested data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Extract distinct "Side" values from "Sides":**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT f.value:"Side"::STRING AS "Side"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Extract distinct "Strategy" values from "Sides":**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT f.value:"Strategy"::STRING AS "Strategy"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Extract "IntrinsicValue" from "Sides":**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:"IntrinsicValue"::FLOAT AS "IntrinsicValue"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Retrieve trades using the 'feeling-lucky' strategy:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:"Strategy"::STRING AS "Strategy",
          f.value:"IntrinsicValue"::FLOAT AS "IntrinsicValue"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   WHERE f.value:"Strategy"::STRING ILIKE '%feeling%lucky%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Retrieve trades using the 'momentum' strategy:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:"Strategy"::STRING AS "Strategy",
          f.value:"IntrinsicValue"::FLOAT AS "IntrinsicValue"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   WHERE f.value:"Strategy"::STRING ILIKE '%momentum%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Retrieve trades with "Side" as 'Long':**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:"Side"::STRING AS "Side",
          f.value:"IntrinsicValue"::FLOAT AS "IntrinsicValue"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   WHERE f.value:"Side"::STRING ILIKE '%long%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Retrieve 'feeling-lucky' strategy trades on the 'Long' side:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:"Strategy"::STRING AS "Strategy",
          f.value:"Side"::STRING AS "Side",
          f.value:"IntrinsicValue"::FLOAT AS "IntrinsicValue"
   FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
   WHERE f.value:"Strategy"::STRING ILIKE '%feeling%lucky%'
     AND f.value:"Side"::STRING ILIKE '%long%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Retrieve 'momentum' strategy trades on the 'Long' side:**

    ```sql
    SELECT f.value:"Strategy"::STRING AS "Strategy",
           f.value:"Side"::STRING AS "Side",
           f.value:"IntrinsicValue"::FLOAT AS "IntrinsicValue"
    FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
    WHERE f.value:"Strategy"::STRING ILIKE '%momentum%'
      AND f.value:"Side"::STRING ILIKE '%long%'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Calculate the average intrinsic value for 'feeling-lucky' strategy under 'Long' side trades:**

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(f.value:"IntrinsicValue"::FLOAT) AS "AverageIntrinsicValue"
    FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
    WHERE f.value:"Strategy"::STRING ILIKE '%feeling%lucky%'
      AND f.value:"Side"::STRING ILIKE '%long%';
    ```

12. **Calculate the average intrinsic value for 'momentum' strategy under 'Long' side trades:**

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(f.value:"IntrinsicValue"::FLOAT) AS "AverageIntrinsicValue"
    FROM CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS.CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT" t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."Sides") f
    WHERE f.value:"Strategy"::STRING ILIKE '%momentum%'
      AND f.value:"Side"::STRING ILIKE '%long%';
    ```

These queries are designed to explore the necessary data within the **"TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT"** table to understand the structure and contents of the **"Sides"** column. By extracting and filtering on **"Strategy"**, **"Side"**, and **"IntrinsicValue"**, we can prepare to compute the difference in average intrinsic value between trades using the 'feeling-lucky' and 'momentum' strategies under long-side trades.Query:

Task: How much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy compared to those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
difference
value:float > 0
```
The difference represents how much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy compared to those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS': {'CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS': ['TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
Be careful of information in nested JSON columns. e.g.1. When it comes to active users, it refers to has engagement_time_msec parameter rather than directly counting users. So the right query is: SELECT DISTINCT USER_PSEUDO_ID FROM all_user_activity, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => event_params) AS flattened_params WHERE flattened_params.value:key = 'engagement_time_msec'
e.g. When it comes to top-selling product, you should pay attention to hits2.value:"eCommerceAction":"action_type"::INTEGER = 6 where 6 means sold product.
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive and negative signs.
