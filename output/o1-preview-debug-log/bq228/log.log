Task: Please provide a list of the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Major_Category,Number_of_Incidents
category1:str,count1:int
category2:str,count2:int
category3:str,count3:int
```

**Explanation:**

To identify the top three major crime categories in the borough of **Barking and Dagenham**, we would:

1. **Filter** the `crime_by_lsoa` table where the `borough` column equals "Barking and Dagenham".
2. **Group** the filtered data by the `major_category` column.
3. **Sum** the `value` column for each `major_category` to get the total number of incidents.
4. **Order** the results in descending order based on the total incidents.
5. **Select** the top three categories with the highest number of incidents.

Since the specific data is not provided, the placeholders `category1:str` and `count1:int` represent the major crime categories and their corresponding incident counts..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 06:34:07 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please provide a list of the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Major_Category,Number_of_Incidents
category1:str,count1:int
category2:str,count2:int
category3:str,count3:int
```

**Explanation:**

To identify the top three major crime categories in the borough of **Barking and Dagenham**, we would:

1. **Filter** the `crime_by_lsoa` table where the `borough` column equals "Barking and Dagenham".
2. **Group** the filtered data by the `major_category` column.

5. **Select** the top three categories with the highest number of incidents.

Since the specific data is not provided, the placeholders `category1:str` and `count1:int` represent the major crime categories and their corresponding incident counts. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
