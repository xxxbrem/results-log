After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Comprehensive Inclusion of Segments:** The first query (`1result.sql`) ensures that all hardware product segments are included in the final output, even if a segment has zero unique products sold in either 2020 or 2021. This is achieved by:
  - Using the `all_segments` CTE to retrieve all distinct segments from the product dimension table.
  - Performing a `LEFT JOIN` with the counts for 2020 and 2021, which incorporates segments with zero counts.
  - Utilizing `COALESCE` to handle `NULL` values and display zero where appropriate.
  
- **Accurate Percentage Calculation:** By accounting for all segments and properly handling zero values, `1result.sql` accurately calculates the percentage increase. Segments that had no sales in 2020 but had sales in 2021 are displayed with a `NULL` percentage increase, avoiding division by zero errors.

- **Robustness:** The structure of `1result.sql` makes it more robust and less prone to errors in cases where data might be missing for certain years or segments.

In contrast, while `2result.sql` produces the same results with the provided data, it may omit segments that have zero sales in either 2020 or 2021 because it relies on counts derived directly from the joined tables without explicitly including all segments. This could lead to incomplete results in scenarios where certain segments lack data for one of the years.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the preferred query as it aligns with best practices for data completeness and accuracy.
