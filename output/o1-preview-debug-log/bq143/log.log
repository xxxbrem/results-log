2025-01-19 05:56:02 - root - INFO - The error occurs because your SQL query starts directly with a `WHERE` clause, but in SQL, you cannot start a query with `WHERE`. The `WHERE` clause must follow a `SELECT` statement and a `FROM` clause specifying the table you are querying.

Here's how you can modify your query:

Include a `SELECT` statement and specify the table you are querying from.

**Corrected Example:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.CPTAC.RNAseq_hg38_gdc_current`
WHERE sample_type_name IN ('Primary Tumor', 'Solid Tissue Normal')
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **SELECT \***: Selects all columns from the table. You can replace `*` with specific column names if you only need certain columns.
- **FROM `isb-cgc-bq.CPTAC.RNAseq_hg38_gdc_current`**: Specifies the table to query from.
- **WHERE sample_type_name IN ('Primary Tumor', 'Solid Tissue Normal')**: Filters the results to only include rows where `sample_type_name` is either 'Primary Tumor' or 'Solid Tissue Normal'.
- **LIMIT 1000**: Limits the result to 1,000 rows to avoid retrieving unnecessary data.

**Example Selecting Specific Columns:**

If you only need certain columns, such as `sample_barcode`, `gene_name`, and `fpkm_unstranded`, you can write:

```sql
SELECT sample_barcode, gene_name, fpkm_unstranded
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.CPTAC.RNAseq_hg38_gdc_current`
WHERE sample_type_name IN ('Primary Tumor', 'Solid Tissue Normal')
LIMIT 1000;
```

**General SQL Query Structure:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Make sure to always start your query with a `SELECT` statement, specify the columns you want to retrieve, and the table you are querying from using the `FROM` clause. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records.

**Additional Tips:**

- Ensure that the table name is correct and accessible.
- Use backticks `` ` `` around the table name to handle any special characters or case sensitivity.
- If you're unsure about the columns in the table, you can retrieve all columns using `SELECT *`, or explore the table schema.

**Using the Corrected Query:**

Try running the corrected query to retrieve the data:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.CPTAC.RNAseq_hg38_gdc_current`
WHERE sample_type_name IN ('Primary Tumor', 'Solid Tissue Normal')
LIMIT 1000;
```

This should resolve the syntax error and return the desired results.

Task: Use CPTAC proteomics and RNAseq data for Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma to select 'Primary Tumor' and 'Solid Tissue Normal' samples. Join the datasets on sample submitter IDs and gene symbols. Calculate the correlation between protein abundance (log2 ratio) and gene expression levels (log-transformed+1 FPKM) for each gene and sample type. Filter out correlations with an absolute value greater than 0.5, and compute the average correlation for each sample type.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Sample_Type,Average_Correlation
Primary Tumor,average_correlation_value:float
Solid Tissue Normal,average_correlation_value:float
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

After joining the CPTAC proteomics and RNAseq datasets for Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (CCRCC) on sample submitter IDs and gene symbols, we calculated the Pearson correlation between protein abundance (log2 ratio) and gene expression levels (log-transformed FPKM+1) for each gene and sample type ('Primary Tumor' and 'Solid Tissue Normal'). We filtered out correlations with an absolute value greater than 0.5 and computed the average correlation for each sample type..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
