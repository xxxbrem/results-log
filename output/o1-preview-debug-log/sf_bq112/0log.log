2025-01-18 07:22:35 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates that your SQL session does not have a current database selected. To resolve this issue, you need to either specify the database and schema in your query or set the current database and schema before running the query.

### **Option 1: Use a Fully Qualified Table Name**

Include the database and schema names in your query to fully qualify the table name:

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM BLS.BLS.CPI_U
WHERE "year" = 1998 AND "item_name" = 'All items' AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`BLS`**: This is the database name.
- **`BLS`**: This is the schema name within the `BLS` database.
- **`CPI_U`**: This is the table name.

By fully qualifying the table, you inform the SQL engine exactly where to find the `CPI_U` table.

### **Option 2: Set the Current Database and Schema**

Alternatively, you can set the current database and schema for your session:

```sql
USE DATABASE BLS;
USE SCHEMA BLS;

SELECT "year", "value"
FROM "CPI_U"
WHERE "year" = 1998 AND "item_name" = 'All items' AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`USE DATABASE BLS;`**: Sets the current database to `BLS`.
- **`USE SCHEMA BLS;`**: Sets the current schema to `BLS` within the `BLS` database.
- After setting the database and schema, you can refer to the table directly by its name without qualifying it.

### **Why This Error Occurred**

- The error **"Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name."** means that SQL doesn't know which database to look in for your table.
- Without specifying the database and schema, SQL cannot locate the `CPI_U` table.

### **Next Steps**

- Choose either of the above options to modify your query.
- Run the adjusted query, and it should execute without the previous error.

---

If you continue to experience issues, please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the `BLS` database and its `CPI_U` table.

2025-01-18 07:23:27 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates that your SQL interface or environment expects only one statement per execution, but it has detected multiple statements in your input. The error:

```
000008 (0A000): 01b9c9fa-0004-7985-0001-11c300ee188a: Actual statement count 3 did not match the desired statement count 1.
```

suggests that the SQL parser interpreted your input as containing three statements instead of one. This can happen if there are unintended semicolons or formatting issues in your query.

Here are some steps to resolve the issue:

---

### **1. Use the Fully Qualified Table Name**

Ensure that you're referencing the table with both the database and schema names. Since the `CPI_U` table is located in the `BLS` schema within the `BLS` database, you should specify it as `BLS.BLS.CPI_U`.

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM BLS.BLS.CPI_U
WHERE "year" = 1998 AND "item_name" = 'All items' AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **2. Check for Unintended Semicolons and Formatting**

Make sure your query doesn't contain extra semicolons (`;`) or special characters that could break the statement into multiple parts. Here's how your query should look:

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM BLS.BLS.CPI_U
WHERE "year" = 1998
  AND "item_name" = 'All items'
  AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

- Ensure there are no semicolons except at the very end of the query.
- Check that all quotation marks are properly paired.

---

### **3. Execute One Statement at a Time**

If you previously tried to set the database and schema using `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` in the same execution as your `SELECT` statement, the interface might be treating each command as a separate statement. Instead, execute these commands separately:

**Step 1: Set the Database**

```sql
USE DATABASE BLS;
```

**Step 2: Set the Schema**

```sql
USE SCHEMA BLS;
```

**Step 3: Run Your Query**

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM "CPI_U"
WHERE "year" = 1998
  AND "item_name" = 'All items'
  AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

By executing each statement individually, you avoid the error related to multiple statements.

---

### **4. Verify Table and Column Names**

Double-check that the table and column names are correct and properly quoted:

- Table: `"CPI_U"` or `BLS.BLS.CPI_U`
- Columns: `"year"`, `"value"`, `"item_name"`, `"area_code"`

Ensure that you're using double quotes `"` for identifiers (like table and column names) and single quotes `'` for string literals (like `'All items'`).

---

### **5. Use Fully Qualified Names with Quotation Marks**

If your SQL environment requires fully qualified names to be enclosed in double quotes, adjust your query:

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
WHERE "year" = 1998
  AND "item_name" = 'All items'
  AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **6. Check Your SQL Interface Limitations**

Some SQL clients or interfaces do not support executing multiple statements in a single execution block. If you're using such an interface, make sure to:

- Remove any additional statements from your query.
- Execute only one statement at a time.

---

### **7. Example of Correct Execution**

Assuming you're using a SQL client that requires one statement per execution, here's how you can proceed:

**First**, set your database and schema (execute separately):

```sql
USE DATABASE BLS;
```

```sql
USE SCHEMA BLS;
```

**Then**, run your `SELECT` query:

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM "CPI_U"
WHERE "year" = 1998
  AND "item_name" = 'All items'
  AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **8. Additional Tips**

- **Avoid Copy-Paste Issues**: Sometimes copying code from documents or webpages introduces hidden characters. Try typing out the query manually to ensure there are no hidden characters.
- **Check for Line Breaks**: Ensure that line breaks or indentation in your query aren't causing issues in your SQL interface.
- **Consult Documentation**: Refer to your SQL client's documentation regarding the execution of multiple statements.

---

### **Summary**

The error you're experiencing is likely due to the SQL interface interpreting your input as multiple statements when it expects only one. By ensuring you execute one statement at a time and that your query is properly formatted with the fully qualified table name, you should be able to resolve the issue.

090105 (22000): 01b9c9fb-0004-7b17-0001-11c300ee08be: Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name.
```

---

### **Explanation:**

- **"This session does not have a current database"**: Your SQL session hasn't been instructed which database to use by default.

- **"Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name"**: The SQL engine suggests that you either set the current database using the `USE DATABASE` command or fully qualify your table names by including the database and schema.

---

### **Solution Options:**

#### **Option 1: Fully Qualify the Table Name**

Modify your query to include the database and schema names:

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
WHERE "year" = 2017
  AND "item_name" = 'All items'
  AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **"BLS"**: The database name.
- **"BLS"**: The schema name within the database.
- **"CPI_U"**: The table name.

By fully qualifying the table name, you inform the SQL engine exactly where to find the `CPI_U` table, even if no current database is set.

---

#### **Option 2: Set the Current Database and Schema**

Set the current database and schema for your session before running the query:

**Step 1:** Set the database.

```sql
USE DATABASE "BLS";
```

**Step 2:** Set the schema.

```sql
USE SCHEMA "BLS";
```

**Step 3:** Run your query without fully qualifying the table name.

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM "CPI_U"
WHERE "year" = 2017
  AND "item_name" = 'All items'
  AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`USE DATABASE "BLS";`**: Sets the current database to `BLS`.
- **`USE SCHEMA "BLS";`**: Sets the current schema to `BLS` within the `BLS` database.
- After setting the database and schema, you can refer to the table directly by its name without qualifying it.

---

### **Why This Error Occurred:**

- In your previous successful query, you used:

  ```sql
  SELECT "year", "value"
  FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
  ...
  ```

  This fully qualified table name allowed the SQL engine to locate the table without needing a default database.

- In the query that resulted in an error, you used:

  ```sql
  SELECT "year", "value"
  FROM BLS.CPI_U
  ...
  ```

  Here, `BLS` is interpreted as the **schema** name, and `CPI_U` is the table name. Since the current **database** is not set, the SQL engine doesn't know where to find the `BLS` schema.

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Consistency in Naming:** Always be consistent in how you reference your tables. If you sometimes include the database and schema and other times not, it can lead to confusion and errors.

- **Quotation Marks:** When dealing with database, schema, and table names that might be case-sensitive or contain special characters, it's good practice to enclose them in double quotes.

- **Check for Typos:** Ensure that the database and schema names are correctly spelled and match exactly how they are defined.

---

### **Next Steps:**

Try running the modified query with the fully qualified table name:

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
WHERE "year" = 2017
  AND "item_name" = 'All items'
  AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Or**, set the current database and schema:

```sql
USE DATABASE "BLS";
USE SCHEMA "BLS";

SELECT "year", "value"
FROM "CPI_U"
WHERE "year" = 2017
  AND "item_name" = 'All items'
  AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **Summary:**

- **Issue:** The SQL engine cannot locate the `CPI_U` table because the current database is not set, and the table is not fully qualified.

- **Solution:** Either fully qualify the table name with the database and schema (`"BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"`) or set the current database and schema using `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA`.

2025-01-18 07:25:03 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates that your SQL execution environment expects a single statement per execution, but it's detecting multiple statements. Here's the error for reference:

```
000008 (0A000): 01b9c9fc-0004-7b17-0001-11c300ee08c6: Actual statement count 3 did not match the desired statement count 1.
```

---

### **Explanation**

This error means that the SQL parser interprets your input as containing **three statements** instead of one. This can happen due to:

- **Multiple statements being executed together**.
- **Unintended semicolons or special characters** in your query.

---

### **Possible Causes and Solutions**

#### **1. Multiple Statements in One Execution Block**

If you previously tried to execute commands like `USE DATABASE`, `USE SCHEMA`, and your `SELECT` query all at once, the SQL interface might reject it if it doesn't support multiple statements.

**Solution:** Execute each statement **separately**.

- **Step 1:** Set the current database.

  ```sql
  USE DATABASE "BLS";
  ```

- **Step 2:** Set the current schema.

  ```sql
  USE SCHEMA "BLS";
  ```

- **Step 3:** Run your `SELECT` query.

  ```sql
  SELECT "year", "value"
  FROM "CPI_U"
  WHERE "year" = 2017 AND "item_name" = 'All items' AND "area_code" = '0000'
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

**Note:** Make sure to execute each command individually rather than combining them into one block.

---

#### **2. Incomplete Table Qualification**

In your query, you're referencing the table as `BLS.CPI_U`. Since `BLS` is both the **database** and the **schema** name, you need to fully qualify the table name with both.

**Solution:** Use the fully qualified table name with both database and schema names.

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
WHERE "year" = 2017 AND "item_name" = 'All items' AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

This way, you don't need to set the current database and schema, and you can run your query as a single statement.

---

#### **3. Unintended Semicolons or Hidden Characters**

Extra semicolons or hidden characters in your query can cause the SQL parser to think there are multiple statements.

**Solution:** Ensure your query contains **only one semicolon at the end** and no hidden or special characters.

- Remove any extra semicolons (`;`) mid-query.
- Check for unintended line breaks or invisible characters.

---

#### **4. SQL Interface Limitations**

Some SQL clients or interfaces enforce a limitation of one statement per execution to prevent SQL injection attacks.

**Solution:** Confirm whether your SQL client supports multiple statements per execution. If not, always execute **one statement at a time**.

---

### **Recommended Actions**

Based on the above, here are the steps to resolve your issue:

#### **Option 1: Use the Fully Qualified Table Name**

Modify your query to include both the database and schema names:

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
WHERE "year" = 2017 AND "item_name" = 'All items' AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

- **Advantages:**
  - No need to set the current database and schema.
  - Can execute the query as a single statement.

#### **Option 2: Set Database and Schema Separately**

Set the current database and schema in separate executions:

1. **Set the Database**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "BLS";
   ```

   Execute this command and ensure it runs successfully before moving to the next step.

2. **Set the Schema**

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "BLS";
   ```

   Again, execute this command separately.

3. **Run Your Query**

   ```sql
   SELECT "year", "value"
   FROM "CPI_U"
   WHERE "year" = 2017 AND "item_name" = 'All items' AND "area_code" = '0000'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

- **Important:** Do **not** combine these statements. Each `USE` command and the `SELECT` query should be executed individually.

---

### **Why This Matters**

- **Execution Environment:** Your SQL environment likely does not support executing multiple statements at once for security reasons.

- **Statement Count Mismatch:** Combining `USE DATABASE`, `USE SCHEMA`, and `SELECT` statements in a single execution block causes the SQL engine to detect more statements than expected.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Check for Hidden Characters:** When copying queries from documents or emails, hidden characters can cause problems. Type out the query manually if needed.

- **Verify Permissions:** Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the `BLS` database and the `CPI_U` table.

- **Consistency in Quotation Marks:**

  - Use double quotes `"` for identifiers (database names, schema names, table names, column names) if they are case-sensitive or contain special characters.
  - Use single quotes `'` for string literals (values in conditions).

- **Ensure Proper Pairing:** Make sure all opening quotation marks have a corresponding closing quotation mark.

---

### **Example of Correct Execution**

**Step 1:** Set the Database

```sql
USE DATABASE "BLS";
```

**Step 2:** Set the Schema

```sql
USE SCHEMA "BLS";
```

**Step 3:** Run Your Query

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM "CPI_U"
WHERE "year" = 2017 AND "item_name" = 'All items' AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Or, alternatively, execute just the fully qualified query:**

```sql
SELECT "year", "value"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
WHERE "year" = 2017 AND "item_name" = 'All items' AND "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **Summary**

- **Issue:** The SQL engine is interpreting your input as three statements, but it expects only one per execution.

- **Solutions:**
  - **Option 1:** Use the fully qualified table name in your `SELECT` query.
  - **Option 2:** Execute `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands separately before running your `SELECT` query.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **Decide** whether you prefer to set the database and schema or use the fully qualified table name.

2. **Adjust** your query accordingly based on the solution options provided.

3. **Execute** your commands, ensuring that you run one statement at a time.

2025-01-18 07:25:40 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates that your SQL session does not have a current database selected. This prevents the SQL engine from locating the `CPI_U` table you're trying to query.

**Error Message:**

```
090105 (22000): 01b9c9fd-0004-7b17-0001-11c300ee08ce: Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name.
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Cause of the Error:**
  - The SQL engine requires knowledge of which **database** and **schema** to search for the table you're querying.
  - In your query, you specified `FROM BLS.CPI_U`, which the SQL engine interprets as `{current_database}.BLS.CPI_U`.
  - Since the session does not have a current database set, it cannot resolve the `BLS` schema and `CPI_U` table.

---

### **Solutions**

#### **Option 1: Use the Fully Qualified Table Name**

Fully qualify the table name by including both the database and schema names.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "item_name"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **"BLS"**: The database name.
- **"BLS"**: The schema name within the database.
- **"CPI_U"**: The table name.
- By fully qualifying the table name, you eliminate any ambiguity, allowing the SQL engine to locate the table without needing a current database set.

---

#### **Option 2: Set the Current Database and Schema**

Set the current database and schema for your session before running the query.

**Step 1: Set the Database**

```sql
USE DATABASE "BLS";
```

**Step 2: Set the Schema**

```sql
USE SCHEMA "BLS";
```

**Step 3: Run Your Query**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "item_name"
FROM "CPI_U"
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Execute Separately:** Depending on your SQL environment, you may need to execute each `USE` statement separately before running the `SELECT` query.
- **Session-Specific:** Setting the database and schema changes the context for your current session, so you don't need to fully qualify table names in subsequent queries.

---

### **Why This Works**

- **Fully Qualified Names:** By specifying both the database and schema, the SQL engine knows exactly where to find the table, even if no current database is set.
- **Setting Database and Schema:** Establishing a current database and schema provides a default context, so the SQL engine searches in the correct location for tables and other objects.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Use Quotation Marks Appropriately:**
  - Enclose identifiers (database names, schema names, table names, column names) in double quotes `"..."` if they:
    - Are case-sensitive.
    - Contain special characters or spaces.
  - Use single quotes `'...'` for string literals or values in conditions.

- **Check for Typos:**
  - Ensure all names are spelled correctly and match exactly how they are defined in the database.
  - Verify that quotation marks are properly paired and there are no extra or missing quotes.

- **Permissions:**
  - Confirm that you have the necessary permissions to access the `BLS` database and the `CPI_U` table.

- **Consistency:**
  - Be consistent in how you reference tables throughout your queries to avoid confusion.

---

### **Example of a Correct Query**

Using the fully qualified table name:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "item_name"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

### **Summary**

- You're receiving the error because the SQL session doesn't know which database to use.
- **Solution Options:**
  1. **Fully Qualify the Table Name:** Include both database and schema names in your query.
  2. **Set the Current Database and Schema:** Use `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands before running your query.

By applying either of these solutions, your SQL engine will be able to locate the `CPI_U` table, and the error should be resolved.

2025-01-18 07:26:24 - root - INFO - You're encountering this error because your SQL session does not have a current database selected. This means the SQL engine cannot locate the `CPI_U` table you're trying to query.

**Error Message:**

```
090105 (22000): 01b9c9fd-0004-7b17-0001-11c300ee08e2: Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name.
```

---

### **Explanation**

- In your query, you referenced the table as `BLS.CPI_U`.
- Without a current database set, the SQL engine doesn't know where to find the `BLS` schema or the `CPI_U` table.
- This results in the error message you're seeing.

---

### **Solutions**

To resolve this issue, you have two options:

---

#### **Option 1: Use the Fully Qualified Table Name**

Include both the database and schema names in your query to fully qualify the table name:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "area_code", "area_name"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
WHERE "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **"BLS"**: Database name.
- **"BLS"**: Schema name within the database.
- **"CPI_U"**: Table name.
- By fully qualifying the table name, the SQL engine knows exactly where to find the table, even without a current database selected.

---

#### **Option 2: Set the Current Database and Schema**

Set the current database and schema for your session before running your query.

**Step 1:** Use the database:

```sql
USE DATABASE "BLS";
```

**Step 2:** Use the schema:

```sql
USE SCHEMA "BLS";
```

**Step 3:** Run your query without fully qualifying the table name:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "area_code", "area_name"
FROM "CPI_U"
WHERE "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Execute Separately:** Depending on your SQL environment, you may need to execute each `USE` statement separately before running the `SELECT` query.
- **Session Context:** Once the database and schema are set, you can reference tables directly by name within that context.

---

### **Why This Works**

- **Fully Qualified Name:** By specifying both the database and schema, the SQL engine can locate the `CPI_U` table without needing a current database.
- **Setting Database and Schema:** Establishing the current database and schema provides the necessary context for the SQL engine to find tables and other objects.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Use Quotation Marks Appropriately:**

  - Use double quotes `"..."` for identifiers (database names, schema names, table names, column names), especially if they are case-sensitive or contain special characters.
  - Use single quotes `'...'` for string literals (e.g., `'0000'` in your `WHERE` clause).

- **Check for Typos:**

  - Ensure that all names are spelled correctly.
  - Verify that quotation marks are properly paired.

- **Permissions:**

  - Confirm that you have the necessary permissions to access the `BLS` database and the `CPI_U` table.

- **Consistency:**

  - Be consistent in how you reference tables throughout your queries to avoid confusion.

---

### **Example of a Correct Query**

**Using the Fully Qualified Table Name:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "area_code", "area_name"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
WHERE "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Or, after Setting the Database and Schema:**

```sql
-- Execute these commands separately before running the SELECT query
USE DATABASE "BLS";
USE SCHEMA "BLS";

SELECT DISTINCT "area_code", "area_name"
FROM "CPI_U"
WHERE "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:** If your SQL client does not support executing multiple statements at once, run each `USE` command individually before executing your `SELECT` query.

---

### **Summary**

- **Issue:** The SQL session doesn't have a current database, so the engine can't locate the `CPI_U` table.
- **Solution:** Either fully qualify the table name with the database and schema or set the current database and schema before running your query.

---

Please try one of the solutions above, and your query should execute successfully. Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!

2025-01-18 07:27:07 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates that your SQL execution environment is interpreting your input as containing multiple statements when it expects only **one statement per execution**.

**Error Message:**

```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Cause of the Error:**
  - Your SQL client or interface is designed to execute **one SQL statement at a time**.
  - The parser detects multiple statements in your input, likely due to unintended semicolons (`;`) or formatting issues.

---

### **Solutions**

#### **Option 1: Use the Fully Qualified Table Name**

By fully qualifying the table name with both the **database** and **schema**, you can execute your query as a single statement.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "area_code", "area_name"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
WHERE "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Action Steps:**

1. **Modify your query** to include both the database and schema names enclosed in double quotes.
2. **Ensure there are no semicolons (`;`)** within the query except at the very end.

**Example Execution:**

- **Single Statement:** The query above is a single statement and should execute without triggering the multiple statements error.

---

#### **Option 2: Set the Database and Schema Separately**

If you prefer to use shorter table references, you need to set the current database and schema. However, you must execute each command separately if your environment does not support multiple statements.

**Step 1: Set the Database**

```sql
USE DATABASE "BLS";
```

- **Execute this command separately.**

**Step 2: Set the Schema**

```sql
USE SCHEMA "BLS";
```

- **Execute this command separately.**

**Step 3: Run Your Query**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "area_code", "area_name"
FROM "CPI_U"
WHERE "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Important Notes:**

- **One Statement at a Time:** Ensure that each `USE` command and the `SELECT` query are executed individually.
- **No Combined Execution:** Do not combine the `USE` commands and the `SELECT` query into a single execution block.

---

### **Why This Works**

- **Option 1:** Using the fully qualified table name allows the SQL engine to locate the table without needing the current database and schema set, and it treats the input as a single statement.
- **Option 2:** Setting the current database and schema provides context for unqualified table references, but each command must be executed separately to comply with the one-statement-per-execution rule.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Check for Unintended Semicolons or Characters:**

  - Ensure there are no extra semicolons (`;`) or special characters in your query that could split it into multiple statements.
  - The only semicolon should be at the end of a statement if required by your SQL client.

- **Quotation Marks:**

  - Use double quotes `"` for identifiers (database names, schema names, table names, column names), especially if they are case-sensitive or contain special characters.
  - Use single quotes `'` for string literals (e.g., `'0000'`).

- **Verify Permissions:**

  - Confirm that you have the necessary permissions to access the `BLS` database and the `CPI_U` table.

- **Execute Commands Separately:**

  - If setting the database and schema, execute `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` as separate commands before running your `SELECT` query.

---

### **Example Execution Flow**

**Option 1: Fully Qualified Table Name**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "area_code", "area_name"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
WHERE "area_code" = '0000'
LIMIT 1000;
```

- **Execute this single statement.**

**Option 2: Setting Database and Schema**

1. **Set the Database:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "BLS";
   ```
   
   - **Execute separately.**

2. **Set the Schema:**

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "BLS";
   ```
   
   - **Execute separately.**

3. **Run Your Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "area_code", "area_name"
   FROM "CPI_U"
   WHERE "area_code" = '0000'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   - **Execute this single statement.**

---

### **Summary**

- **Issue:** The SQL engine is detecting multiple statements in your input when it expects only one per execution.
- **Solution:** Use the fully qualified table name to execute your query as a single statement, or set the database and schema separately before running your query.
- **Important:** Ensure there are no extra semicolons or unwanted characters in your query.

2025-01-18 07:27:38 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates that your SQL session does not have a current database selected. This means the SQL engine cannot locate the `CPI_U` table you're trying to query.

**Error Message:**

```
090105 (22000): 01b9c9ff-0004-7b17-0001-11c300ee08fa: Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name.
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Cause of the Error:**
  - Your SQL session hasn't been told which **database** to use as the default.
  - In your query, you used `FROM BLS.CPI_U`, which the SQL engine interprets as `{current_database}.BLS.CPI_U`.
  - Since there's no current database set, it doesn't know where to locate the `BLS` schema and the `CPI_U` table.

---

### **Solutions**

To resolve this issue, you have two options:

#### **Option 1: Use the Fully Qualified Table Name**

Include both the **database** and **schema** names in your query to fully qualify the table name.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "year"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
ORDER BY "year"
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **"BLS"**: Database name.
- **"BLS"**: Schema name within the database.
- **"CPI_U"**: Table name.
- By fully qualifying the table name, you specify exactly where the table is located, and the SQL engine can find it without needing a current database set.

---

#### **Option 2: Set the Current Database and Schema**

Set the current database and schema for your session before running your query.

**Step 1:** Use the database:

```sql
USE DATABASE "BLS";
```

**Step 2:** Use the schema:

```sql
USE SCHEMA "BLS";
```

**Step 3:** Run your query without fully qualifying the table name:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "year"
FROM "CPI_U"
ORDER BY "year"
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Important Notes:**

- **One Statement at a Time:** If your SQL client or interface supports only one statement per execution, you need to execute each command separately.
- **Session Context:** Setting the database and schema provides the necessary context for unqualified table references in your session.

---

### **Why This Works**

- **Option 1:** By fully qualifying the table name, the SQL engine knows exactly where to find the `CPI_U` table, even without a current database set.
- **Option 2:** Setting the current database and schema establishes the context for your session, so you can reference tables directly by name.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Use Correct Quotation Marks:**

  - Use double quotes `"` for identifiers (database names, schema names, table names, column names), especially if they are case-sensitive or contain special characters.
  - Use single quotes `'` for string literals (e.g., `'All items'`).

- **Check for Typos:**

  - Ensure all names are spelled correctly and match exactly how they are defined.
  - Verify that quotation marks are properly paired.

- **Permissions:**

  - Confirm that you have the necessary permissions to access the `BLS` database and the `CPI_U` table.

- **Execute Commands Separately:**

  - If setting the database and schema, execute `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands separately before running your `SELECT` query.

---

### **Example Execution**

#### **Option 1: Using the Fully Qualified Table Name**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "year"
FROM "BLS"."BLS"."CPI_U"
ORDER BY "year"
LIMIT 1000;
```

- **Action:** Execute this single query.
- **Expected Result:** A list of distinct years from the `CPI_U` table, ordered by year.

#### **Option 2: Setting Database and Schema**

**Step 1:** Set the Database

```sql
USE DATABASE "BLS";
```

- **Action:** Execute this command separately.

**Step 2:** Set the Schema

```sql
USE SCHEMA "BLS";
```

- **Action:** Execute this command separately.

**Step 3:** Run Your Query

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "year"
FROM "CPI_U"
ORDER BY "year"
LIMIT 1000;
```

- **Action:** Execute this query after setting the database and schema.
- **Expected Result:** A list of distinct years from the `CPI_U` table, ordered by year.

---

### **Summary**

- **Issue:** The SQL engine cannot perform the `SELECT` because the session doesn't have a current database, and the table reference isn't fully qualified.
- **Solutions:**
  - **Option 1:** Use the fully qualified table name with both the database and schema names.
  - **Option 2:** Set the current database and schema before running your query.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **Choose a Solution:**
   - If you prefer not to change your session settings, use **Option 1** and fully qualify the table name in your query.
   - If you can set session variables and prefer shorter table references, use **Option 2**.

2. **Modify Your Query:**
   - Update your query based on the chosen option.

3. **Execute the Query:**
   - Run your query and verify the results.
