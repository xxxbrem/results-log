Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table**: `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS`
  - **"station_id"**: Unique identifier for each bike share station; used to count distinct stations.
  - **"status"**: Indicates whether a station is active or closed; used to filter stations by status.
  - **"modified_date"**: Timestamp of the last modification to the station's data; can be used to determine the year when the status was updated.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Filter by status**: Using `"status"` to select 'active' or 'closed' stations.
- **Extract year from date**: Using `EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date"))` to get the year from the `"modified_date"` column.
- **Filter by year**: Selecting records where the extracted year is 2013 or 2014.
- **Use DISTINCT**: To count unique stations without duplicates.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all station IDs and their statuses:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve distinct statuses of stations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "status"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS;
   ```

3. **Extract the year from "modified_date" for each station:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status", EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date")) AS "year"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find stations modified in 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status", "modified_date"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date")) = 2013
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find stations modified in 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status", "modified_date"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date")) = 2014
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List distinct active stations in 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "station_id"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE "status" = 'active' AND EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date")) = 2013;
   ```

7. **List distinct closed stations in 2013:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "station_id"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE "status" = 'closed' AND EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date")) = 2013;
   ```

8. **Count the number of active stations for each year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date")) AS "year", COUNT(DISTINCT "station_id") AS "active_stations_count"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE "status" = 'active'
   GROUP BY "year"
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count the number of closed stations for each year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date")) AS "year", COUNT(DISTINCT "station_id") AS "closed_stations_count"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE "status" = 'closed'
   GROUP BY "year"
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve all data from the bike share stations table:**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Note:** These queries are designed to explore the relevant data in the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table. They help in understanding the distribution of active and closed bike share stations for the years 2013 and 2014 by utilizing columns like `"station_id"`, `"status"`, and `"modified_date"`.Query:

Task: Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_closed
2013,num_active:int,num_closed:int
2014,num_active:int,num_closed:int
```

**Explanation:**

The table provides the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year, 2013 and 2014. The values `num_active:int` and `num_closed:int` represent the integer counts of active and closed stations in the respective years..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'AUSTIN': {'AUSTIN_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'AUSTIN_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATIONS', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'AUSTIN_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'AUSTIN_INCIDENTS': ['INCIDENTS_2008', 'INCIDENTS_2009', 'INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2011', 'INCIDENTS_2016'], 'AUSTIN_WASTE': ['WASTE_AND_DIVERSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to active users, it refers to `event_params` has `engagement_time_msec` rather than directly counting users. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android.

2025-01-20 20:55:02 - root - INFO - Upon reviewing the data, it appears that the `"modified_date"` field in the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table does not contain records for the years 2013 or 2014. The dates available correspond to years like 2021 and 2022. Therefore, we cannot retrieve the number of active and closed bike share stations for 2013 and 2014 based on this field.

However, if you would like to get the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for the years available in the data, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("modified_date"/1000000)) AS "Year",
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN "status" = 'active' THEN "station_id" END) AS "Number_of_Stations_active",
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN "status" = 'closed' THEN "station_id" END) AS "Number_of_Stations_closed"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
GROUP BY "Year"
ORDER BY "Year";
```

This query will provide the counts for the years present in the `"modified_date"` data.

If you need to get the total number of active and closed stations regardless of the year, you can use:

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN "status" = 'active' THEN "station_id" END) AS "Number_of_Stations_active",
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN "status" = 'closed' THEN "station_id" END) AS "Number_of_Stations_closed"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS;
```

Unfortunately, without data corresponding to the years 2013 and 2014, we cannot provide the counts specifically for those years.

Year,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_closed

```

**Explanation:**

The table provides the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year, 2013 and 2014. The values `num_active:int` and `num_closed:int` represent the integer counts of active and closed stations in the respective years. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN "status" = 'active' THEN "station_id" END) AS "Number_of_Stations_active",

2025-01-20 20:56:23 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 20:56:23 - root - INFO - After carefully reviewing the data and your request, I found that the `"modified_date"` column in the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table does not contain records for the years 2013 and 2014. The dates available in the data correspond to years like 2020, 2021, and 2022.

Given this limitation, we cannot provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for the years 2013 and 2014 based on the `"modified_date"` field.

However, we can estimate the number of stations that were active in 2013 and 2014 by analyzing the trip data in the `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` table. This table contains a `"start_time"` column that records when each trip began. By extracting the year from this timestamp and counting the distinct `"start_station_id"`, we can approximate the number of stations that were operational in those years.

Here is the SQL query to retrieve the number of distinct active stations for each year 2013 and 2014:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000)) AS "Year",
       COUNT(DISTINCT "start_station_id") AS "Number_of_Stations_active"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000)) IN (2013, 2014)
GROUP BY "Year"
ORDER BY "Year";
```

**Explanation:**

- **EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000))**: Converts the `"start_time"` (assumed to be in milliseconds) to a timestamp and extracts the year.
- **COUNT(DISTINCT "start_station_id")**: Counts the distinct stations where trips started, indicating active stations.
- **WHERE ... IN (2013, 2014)**: Filters the data for the years 2013 and 2014.
- **GROUP BY "Year"**: Groups the counts by year.

**Note:** This query only provides the number of stations that were used in trips during 2013 and 2014. It does not account for stations that were inactive or closed, nor does it capture stations that were active but had no recorded trips in the data.

Since the data does not provide information on closed stations for those years, we cannot provide the counts for `"Number_of_Stations_closed"`.

**Based on the data, the results might look like:**

```csv
Year,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_closed
2013,10,0
2014,25,0
```

*(Please note that the numbers above are illustrative. You'll need to run the SQL query to get the actual counts.)*

**Final SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000)) AS "Year",
       COUNT(DISTINCT "start_station_id") AS "Number_of_Stations_active",
       0 AS "Number_of_Stations_closed"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000)) IN (2013, 2014)
GROUP BY "Year"
ORDER BY "Year";
```

**Explanation:**

- **0 AS "Number_of_Stations_closed"**: Since we do not have data for closed stations in 2013 and 2014, we set this count to zero.

**Please note:**

- The counts are based on the trip data and represent stations where trips started, which implies they were active.
- Without historical status data for stations in the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table for 2013 and 2014, we cannot determine the number of closed stations.
- Ensure that "start_time" in the `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` table is indeed in milliseconds since epoch. If it's in a different unit, adjust the division accordingly.

**Sample Query Execution:**

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000)) AS "Year",
       COUNT(DISTINCT "start_station_id") AS "Number_of_Stations_active",
       0 AS "Number_of_Stations_closed"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("start_time" / 1000)) IN (2013, 2014)
GROUP BY "Year"
ORDER BY "Year";
```

This query will provide you with the number of active stations based on trip data for the years 2013 and 2014 in the desired format.

2025-01-20 20:58:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

```

**Explanation:**

The table provides the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year, 2013 and 2014. The values `num_active:int` and `num_closed:int` represent the integer counts of active and closed stations in the respective years. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-20 21:03:12 - root - INFO - After thoroughly reviewing the available data in the `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table, I have determined that the dataset does not contain records for the years **2013** and **2014**. The `"modified_date"` column reflects dates starting from **2020** onward, and there are no other date fields in this table that provide information for earlier years.

Similarly, the `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS` table does not have trip records for the years **2013** and **2014** in the `"start_time"` column.

As a result, it's not possible to provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year **2013** and **2014** based on the available data.

**Final SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT NULL AS "Year", NULL AS "Number_of_Stations_active", NULL AS "Number_of_Stations_closed"
WHERE FALSE;
```

**Explanation:**

- Since there is no data for the years **2013** and **2014**, the query returns an empty result set with the specified column names but no rows.
- The `WHERE FALSE` clause ensures that no data is returned, reflecting the absence of records for those years.
- This adheres to your requested format while accurately representing the data available.

If you have access to data that includes records for 2013 and 2014 or need assistance with data from other years, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help.
