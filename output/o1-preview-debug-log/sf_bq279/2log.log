2025-01-20 20:51:48 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error occurred because the `"modified_date"` column in the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table contains timestamps in nanoseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). When we attempt to convert these large numbers directly using `TO_TIMESTAMP`, it results in dates with years that are out of range, causing the error:

```
Failed to convert current row, cause: year 52173925 is out of range
```

To resolve this, we need to convert the nanoseconds to seconds before applying the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function. This can be done by dividing the `"modified_date"` value by **1,000,000,000** (since there are 1,000,000,000 nanoseconds in a second).

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

1. **Convert "modified_date" to a proper timestamp:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status", TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date" / 1000000000) AS "mod_date"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   *This query divides the `"modified_date"` by 1,000,000,000 to convert nanoseconds to seconds, and then applies `TO_TIMESTAMP` to get a proper timestamp.*

2. **Extract the year from "mod_date" and get station statuses:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status", DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date" / 1000000000)) AS "year"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   *This query extracts the year from the corrected `"mod_date"` for each station.*

3. **Retrieve the distinct years available:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date" / 1000000000)) AS "year"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count distinct active stations for 2013 and 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date" / 1000000000)) AS "year",
          COUNT(DISTINCT "station_id") AS "Number_of_Stations_active"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE "status" = 'active' AND DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date" / 1000000000)) IN (2013, 2014)
   GROUP BY "year"
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count distinct closed stations for 2013 and 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date" / 1000000000)) AS "year",
          COUNT(DISTINCT "station_id") AS "Number_of_Stations_closed"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE "status" = 'closed' AND DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date" / 1000000000)) IN (2013, 2014)
   GROUP BY "year"
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Combine active and closed station counts for 2013 and 2014:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "year",
     SUM(CASE WHEN "status" = 'active' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "Number_of_Stations_active",
     SUM(CASE WHEN "status" = 'closed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "Number_of_Stations_closed"
   FROM (
     SELECT "station_id", "status", DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date" / 1000000000)) AS "year"
     FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   ) sub
   WHERE "year" IN (2013, 2014)
   GROUP BY "year"
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Note:** Ensure that all calculations and functions handle the data correctly by converting the nanoseconds in `"modified_date"` to seconds before applying any date or time functions.

**Proceeding with the Task:**

Using the corrected queries, we can now determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year, 2013 and 2014.

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
Year,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_closed
2013,num_active:int,num_closed:int
2014,num_active:int,num_closed:int
```

Replace `num_active:int` and `num_closed:int` with the actual integer counts obtained from the queries.

**Summary:**

- The error was due to attempting to convert nanosecond timestamps directly without adjusting for their unit.
- By dividing the `"modified_date"` by 1,000,000,000, we obtain the correct timestamps.
- With the corrected timestamps, we can extract the year and compute the required counts.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to identify the relevant tables, columns, and conditions.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS`
  - **Column:** `"station_id"` - Used to identify distinct bike share stations.
  - **Column:** `"status"` - Indicates whether a station is active or closed.
  - **Column:** `"modified_date"` - Represents the date when the station's status was last updated; can be used to extract the year.

**Potential Conditions:**

- Filter stations based on their `"status"` (e.g., 'active', 'closed').
- Extract the year from `"modified_date"` to focus on the years 2013 and 2014.
- Use `DISTINCT` to count unique stations.
- Limit results to 100 rows per query.

**SQL Queries:**

1. ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "status"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Retrieve the distinct statuses of bike share stations.*

2. ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status", "modified_date"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *View station IDs with their statuses and modification dates.*

3. ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status", TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date") AS "mod_date"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Convert "modified_date" to a timestamp for readability.*

4. ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status", DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) AS "year"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Extract the year from "modified_date" for each station.*

5. ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) AS "year"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *List the years present in the "modified_date" field.*

6. ```sql
   SELECT "station_id"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE "status" = 'active'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Retrieve IDs of stations that are active.*

7. ```sql
   SELECT "station_id"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE "status" = 'closed'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Retrieve IDs of stations that are closed.*

8. ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) = 2013
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Get stations modified in the year 2013.*

9. ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "status"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) = 2014
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Get stations modified in the year 2014.*

10. ```sql
    SELECT DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) AS "year", COUNT(DISTINCT "station_id") AS "num_stations"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
    WHERE "status" = 'active'
    GROUP BY "year"
    ORDER BY "year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```
    *Count distinct active stations per year.*

11. ```sql
    SELECT DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) AS "year", COUNT(DISTINCT "station_id") AS "num_stations"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
    WHERE "status" = 'closed'
    GROUP BY "year"
    ORDER BY "year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```
    *Count distinct closed stations per year.*

12. ```sql
    SELECT "status", COUNT(DISTINCT "station_id") AS "num_stations"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
    GROUP BY "status"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```
    *Count total stations by their status.*

13. ```sql
    SELECT "station_id", "status", TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date") AS "mod_date"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
    WHERE "status" = 'active' AND DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) BETWEEN 2013 AND 2014
    LIMIT 100;
    ```
    *Retrieve active stations modified between 2013 and 2014.*

14. ```sql
    SELECT "station_id", "status", TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date") AS "mod_date"
    FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
    WHERE "status" = 'closed' AND DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date")) BETWEEN 2013 AND 2014

Task: Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_closed
2013,num_active:int,num_closed:int
2014,num_active:int,num_closed:int

**Explanation:**

The table provides the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year, 2013 and 2014. The values `num_active:int` and `num_closed:int` represent the integer counts of active and closed stations in the respective years..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'AUSTIN': {'AUSTIN_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'AUSTIN_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATIONS', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'AUSTIN_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'AUSTIN_INCIDENTS': ['INCIDENTS_2008', 'INCIDENTS_2009', 'INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2011', 'INCIDENTS_2016'], 'AUSTIN_WASTE': ['WASTE_AND_DIVERSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to active users, it refers to `event_params` has `engagement_time_msec` rather than directly counting users. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android.

2025-01-20 20:56:44 - root - INFO - I'm sorry for any confusion earlier.

Upon reviewing the data, it appears that the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table does not contain records for the years 2013 and 2014. The `modified_date` column only includes data for the years **2021** and **2022**. Here's the query that demonstrates this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("modified_date" / 1000000)) AS "year"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
ORDER BY "year";
```

**Result:**

| year |
|------|
| 2021 |
| 2022 |

Since there are no records for 2013 and 2014 in the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table, the SQL query I provided earlier returns "No data found" for those years.

To attempt to find data for 2013 and 2014, we can check the `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` table to see if it contains trips from those years. Let's examine the `start_time` column:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT DATE_PART('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("start_time" / 1000000)) AS "year"
FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
ORDER BY "year";
```

If this query shows that trips occurred in 2013 and 2014, we might infer active stations based on usage. However, since the `status` of stations is only available in the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table with modification dates from 2021 and 2022, we cannot accurately determine the number of active and closed stations for 2013 and 2014.

**Conclusion:**

Due to the lack of data for 2013 and 2014 in the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table, it is not possible to provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for those years from the available data.

I apologize that I cannot provide the requested information with the current dataset. If you have access to additional data sources that include station statuses for 2013 and 2014, I would be happy to help formulate a query using that information.
