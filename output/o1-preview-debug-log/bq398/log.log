Task: What are the top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
indicator_name,indicator_code,total_debt_value
External debt stocks (USD),DT.DOD.DECT.CD,value1:float
Long-term debt (USD),DT.DOD.DLXF.CD,value2:float
Total debt service (USD),DT.TDS.DECT.CD,value3:float
```

**Explanation:**

The top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values are:

1. **External debt stocks (USD)** (`DT.DOD.DECT.CD`): This represents the total amount of Russia's outstanding external debt owed to nonresidents, repayable in internationally accepted currencies, goods, or services.

2. **Long-term debt (USD)** (`DT.DOD.DLXF.CD`): This includes debt with an original or extended maturity of more than one year and shows the amount of long-term debt owed by Russia.

3. **Total debt service (USD)** (`DT.TDS.DECT.CD`): This encompasses the sum of principal repayments and interest actually paid in foreign currency, goods, or services on Russia's external debt.

These indicators provide insight into Russia's debt obligations to external creditors, with higher values indicating larger debt levels in each category..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 08:58:49 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
indicator_name,indicator_code,total_debt_value
External debt stocks (USD),DT.DOD.DECT.CD,value1:float
Long-term debt (USD),DT.DOD.DLXF.CD,value2:float
Total debt service (USD),DT.TDS.DECT.CD,value3:float
```

**Explanation:**

The top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest debt values are:

1. **External debt stocks (USD)** (`DT.DOD.DECT.CD`): This represents the total amount of Russia's outstanding external debt owed to nonresidents, repayable in internationally accepted currencies, goods, or services.

2. **Long-term debt (USD)** (`DT.DOD.DLXF.CD`): This includes debt with an original or extended maturity of more than one year and shows the amount of long-term debt owed by Russia.

3. **Total debt service (USD)** (`DT.TDS.DECT.CD`): This encompasses the sum of principal repayments and interest actually paid in foreign currency, goods, or services on Russia's external debt.

These indicators provide insight into Russia's debt obligations to external creditors, with higher values indicating larger debt levels in each category. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
