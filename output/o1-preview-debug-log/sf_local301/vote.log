After analyzing the three SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the most appropriate choice. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Date Parsing and Consistency**:
   - **`1result.sql`** uses `TO_DATE("week_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')` to parse the `"week_date"` column, which is more reliable and consistently formatted compared to `"week_date_formatted"`. This ensures accurate date calculations.
   - **`0result.sql`** relies on `TRY_TO_DATE("week_date_formatted")`, which may have inconsistent formats and could lead to parsing errors.
   - **`2result.sql`** also uses `TO_DATE("week_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')` but employs `CASE` statements in the `WHERE` clause, making the query more complex and less scalable.

2. **Clarity and Maintainability**:
   - **`1result.sql`** defines date ranges explicitly in a `date_ranges` Common Table Expression (CTE), making it clear and easy to adjust the date ranges if needed. This structure enhances readability and maintainability.
   - The use of `LEFT JOIN` with the `sales_data` CTE simplifies the aggregation process, ensuring that all sales data is accurately accounted for each year.
   - **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** have more complex `CASE` statements and calculations embedded within the main query, which can make the code harder to read and maintain.

3. **Accuracy of Results**:
   - All three queries produce the same percentage change results. However, the method used in **`1result.sql`** minimizes the risk of errors due to its clear date range definitions and the use of consistent date parsing.

4. **Scalability**:
   - With the date ranges defined separately, **`1result.sql`** can easily accommodate additional years or different date ranges without significant modifications to the core query logic.

Based on these reasons, **`1result.sql`** is the correct and most efficient SQL query for calculating the percentage change in sales around mid-June for the specified years.
