Task: Can you determine which of our top 10 paying customers had the highest payment difference in any given month? I’d like to know the highest payment difference for this customer, with the result rounded to two decimal places.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
customer_id,highest_payment_difference
customer_id:int,payment_difference:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

To determine which of the top 10 paying customers had the highest payment difference in any given month, we would:

1. **Identify the Top 10 Paying Customers:**
   - Calculate the total payments made by each customer using the `PAYMENT` table.
   - Sort the customers in descending order of their total payments.
   - Select the top 10 customers from this list.

2. **Calculate Monthly Payment Differences for Each Customer:**
   - For each of these top 10 customers, group their payments by month.
   - Within each month, find the difference between the highest and lowest payment amounts.

3. **Find the Highest Payment Difference:**
   - Identify the maximum payment difference among all months for each customer.
   - Compare these differences across the top 10 customers to find the highest one.

The final result shows the `customer_id` of the customer with the highest payment difference in any given month, along with the `highest_payment_difference` rounded to two decimal places..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'SQLITE_SAKILA': {'SQLITE_SAKILA': ['ACTOR', 'ADDRESS', 'CATEGORY', 'CITY', 'COUNTRY', 'CUSTOMER', 'FILM', 'FILM_ACTOR', 'FILM_CATEGORY', 'FILM_TEXT', 'INVENTORY', 'LANGUAGE', 'PAYMENT', 'RENTAL', 'STAFF', 'STORE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

I’d like to know the highest payment difference for this customer, with the result rounded to two decimal places., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
customer_id,highest_payment_difference
customer_id:int,payment_difference:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The final result shows the `customer_id` of the customer with the highest payment difference in any given month, along with the `highest_payment_difference` rounded to two decimal places. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
