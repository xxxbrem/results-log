- **`minor_category`**: Used to identify and group crimes by minor crime categories.
- **`value`**: Represents the number of crimes for a given record; used to calculate total crimes.
- **`year`**: Used to filter data for specific years.
- **`month`**: May be used to aggregate data monthly or annually.
- **`major_category`**: Could provide additional grouping, if needed.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **`year = 2008`**: To filter records from the year 2008.
- **Grouping by `minor_category`**: To aggregate crime counts for each minor category.
- **Ordering by crime counts**: To identify top categories.

Below are 10 simple, short, non-nested BigQuery SQL queries to explore the dataset:

1. **List distinct minor crime categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `minor_category`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Get total crimes per minor category in 2008:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `minor_category`, SUM(`value`) AS total_crimes
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   WHERE `year` = 2008
   GROUP BY `minor_category`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **List available years in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `year`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   ORDER BY `year`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Get total crimes per year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `year`, SUM(`value`) AS total_crimes
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   GROUP BY `year`
   ORDER BY `year`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Get total crimes per minor category across all years:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `minor_category`, SUM(`value`) AS total_crimes
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   GROUP BY `minor_category`
   ORDER BY total_crimes DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List major crime categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `major_category`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Get total crimes per major category in 2008:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `major_category`, SUM(`value`) AS total_crimes
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   WHERE `year` = 2008
   GROUP BY `major_category`
   ORDER BY total_crimes DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Get monthly crime totals for 2008:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `month`, SUM(`value`) AS total_crimes
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   WHERE `year` = 2008
   GROUP BY `month`
   ORDER BY `month`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **List distinct boroughs in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `borough`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Check the range of crime counts (`value`):**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `value`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
    ORDER BY `value`
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Task: Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Sure, here is the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row:

```csv
Year,Minor_Category1,Minor_Category2,Minor_Category3,Minor_Category4,Minor_Category5
year:int,percentage:0<=float<=100,percentage:0<=float<=100,percentage:0<=float<=100,percentage:0<=float<=100,percentage:0<=float<=100
...
```

**Explanation:**
- **Year**: The calendar year (e.g., 2008, 2009, 2010).
- **Minor_Category1 to Minor_Category5**: The names of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008.
- **Percentage Values**: For each year, the percentage share of each minor crime category in London's total crimes for that year, rounded to two decimal places..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 06:31:11 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Sure, here is the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row:

```csv
Year,Minor_Category1,Minor_Category2,Minor_Category3,Minor_Category4,Minor_Category5

...
```

**Explanation:**
- **Year**: The calendar year (e.g., 2008, 2009, 2010).
- **Minor_Category1 to Minor_Category5**: The names of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008.
- **Percentage Values**: For each year, the percentage share of each minor crime category in London's total crimes for that year, rounded to two decimal places. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
