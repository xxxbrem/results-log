Task: What is the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Highest_number_of_rides
number:int

(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This represents the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 06:55:03 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Highest_number_of_rides
number:int

(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This represents the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
