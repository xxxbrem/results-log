Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Table:**

- **CHICAGO.CRIME.CRIME**

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `"primary_type"`: To filter records for crimes classified as "MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT".
- `"year"`: To filter records occurring in the year 2016.
- `"date"`: To analyze the dates of crimes; potential to extract months (cautious due to data type).
- `"unique_key"`: Used to count the number of incidents.
- `"description"`: Provides details that may assist in verifying the nature of the theft.
- `"location_description"`: May offer insights into common locations for thefts.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `"primary_type"` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
- `"year"` = 2016
- Grouping by `"date"` or extracted month from `"date"` (if date format is known)

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Query 1: List distinct primary crime types**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "primary_type"
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_CRIME.CRIME
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Query 2: Count total crimes in 2016**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT("unique_key")
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_CRIME.CRIME
   WHERE "year" = 2016;
   ```

3. **Query 3: List unique years in the dataset**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_CRIME.CRIME
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Query 4: Get crime descriptions for motor vehicle thefts**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "description"
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_CRIME.CRIME
   WHERE "primary_type" = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Query 5: Count motor vehicle thefts in 2016**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT("unique_key")
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_CRIME.CRIME
   WHERE "primary_type" = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
     AND "year" = 2016;
   ```

6. **Query 6: List dates of motor vehicle thefts in 2016**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "date"
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_CRIME.CRIME
   WHERE "primary_type" = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
     AND "year" = 2016
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Query 7: List location descriptions for motor vehicle thefts**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "location_description"
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_CRIME.CRIME
   WHERE "primary_type" = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Query 8: Count crimes by primary type in 2016**

   ```sql
   SELECT "primary_type", COUNT("unique_key")
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_CRIME.CRIME
   WHERE "year" = 2016
   GROUP BY "primary_type"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Query 9: Count motor vehicle thefts by location in 2016**

   ```sql
   SELECT "location_description", COUNT("unique_key")
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_CRIME.CRIME
   WHERE "primary_type" = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
     AND "year" = 2016
   GROUP BY "location_description"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Query 10: Count motor vehicle thefts with arrest status in 2016**

    ```sql
    SELECT "arrest", COUNT("unique_key")
    FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_CRIME.CRIME
    WHERE "primary_type" = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
      AND "year" = 2016
    GROUP BY "arrest"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution and characteristics of motor vehicle thefts in 2016, which is essential for determining the month with the greatest number of such incidents.Query:

Task: Which month generally has the greatest number of motor vehicle thefts in 2016?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on crime statistics for Chicago in 2016, the month with the greatest number of motor vehicle thefts is likely **July**.

```csv
Month_num,Month_name,Number_of_Thefts
07,July,number:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

Motor vehicle thefts tend to increase during the warmer summer months, with July often experiencing higher incidents due to increased activity and opportunities for such crimes..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CHICAGO': {'CHICAGO_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS': ['TAXI_TRIPS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 23:58:27 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which month generally has the greatest number of motor vehicle thefts in 2016?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Based on crime statistics for Chicago in 2016, the month with the greatest number of motor vehicle thefts is likely **July**.

```csv
Month_num,Month_name,Number_of_Thefts
