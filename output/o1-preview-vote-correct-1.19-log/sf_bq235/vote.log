After comparing all three SQL queries and their results, it's clear that all of them correctly compute the combined average cost per service for both inpatient and outpatient services in 2014. Each query returns the same provider with the highest combined average cost:

- **Provider ID**: 260230
- **Provider Name**: KINDRED HOSPITAL-ST LOUIS AT MERCY
- **Combined Average Cost per Service**: 50033.0

The first SQL query (`0result.sql`) efficiently calculates the total inpatient and outpatient payments and services by grouping solely on `provider_id` and using `MAX(provider_name)` to retrieve the provider's name. This approach assumes that each `provider_id` uniquely identifies a provider, which is standard in such datasets.

The second and third SQL queries (`1result.sql` and `2result.sql`) include grouping by both `provider_id` and `provider_name`. While this is acceptable, it can be redundant if `provider_id` uniquely identifies each provider, making additional grouping by `provider_name` unnecessary.

Therefore, choosing the first SQL query is appropriate due to its concise and efficient approach.

**The correct SQL file is:**

```plain
0result.sql
```
