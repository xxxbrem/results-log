  - **"case_id"**: Unique identifier for each collision; used to join with the **CASE_IDS** table.

- **CASE_IDS**

  - **"case_id"**: Used to join with the **COLLISIONS** table.
  
  - **"db_year"**: The year the collision occurred; essential for grouping causes by year.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Joining **COLLISIONS** and **CASE_IDS** on **"case_id"** to link collisions with their respective years.
  
- Grouping data by **"db_year"** to compare the most common causes across different years.

These queries are designed to explore the relevant columns and understand the distribution of collision causes and how they relate to different years. By analyzing this data, we can identify any years where the two most common causes of traffic accidents differ from those in other years.Query:

Task: In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year
year:int
```

To determine the year in which the two most common causes of traffic accidents were different from those in other years, we would analyze the `primary_collision_factor` or `pcf_violation_code` columns in the `COLLISIONS` table, grouped by year. The year where the top two causes differ from those in all other years would be identified based on this analysis..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Usage of ST_INTERSECTS: ST_INTERSECTS(geometry1, ST_GEOGFROMWKB(geometry2)) This function checks if the two geometries intersect. The first argument, geometry1, is compared with the second argument, geometry2, which is converted from its WKB (Well-Known Binary) representation to a geography type using ST_GEOGFROMWKB. If the two geometries share any portion of space, the function returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE. Usage of ST_CONTAINS: ST_CONTAINS(r1.geometry, r2.geometry) This function checks if the geometry r1.geometry completely contains the geometry r2.geometry. It returns TRUE if all points of r2.geometry are within r1.geometry and FALSE otherwise. This is useful for spatial containment queries, such as verifying whether one region is entirely within another. ARRAY_INTERSECTION(nodes1, nodes2): This function computes the intersection of the two arrays, returning a new array containing only the elements that are present in both nodes1 and nodes2. ARRAY_SIZE(...): This function then determines the size (or number of elements) in the resulting array from the intersection.

2025-01-20 16:40:48 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year
year:int
```

To determine the year in which the two most common causes of traffic accidents were different from those in other years, we would analyze the `primary_collision_factor` or `pcf_violation_code` columns in the `COLLISIONS` table, grouped by year. The year where the top two causes differ from those in all other years would be identified based on this analysis. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
