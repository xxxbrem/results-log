Begin Exploring Related Columns
Consider the tables and columns relevant to the task:

- **Table:** `COLLISIONS`

  - **"collision_date"**: Used to extract the year of the collision.
  
  - **"primary_collision_factor"**: Represents the primary cause of each collision.
  
  - **"pcf_violation_code"**: Specific violation code associated with the collision.
  
  - **"pcf_violation_category"**: Category of the violation, helpful for grouping causes.

Possible conditions that may be used:

- Extracting the year from `"collision_date"` to group collisions by year.
- Counting the frequency of each `"primary_collision_factor"` or `"pcf_violation_category"` per year.

Here are 10 simple, short, non-nested SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

```sql
-- Query 1: Get distinct primary collision factors
SELECT DISTINCT "primary_collision_factor"
FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- Query 2: Retrieve collision dates and primary collision factors
SELECT "collision_date", "primary_collision_factor"
FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- Query 3: Get distinct pcf violation codes
SELECT DISTINCT "pcf_violation_code"
FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- Query 4: Retrieve collision dates and pcf violation codes
SELECT "collision_date", "pcf_violation_code"
FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- Query 5: Get distinct pcf violation categories
SELECT DISTINCT "pcf_violation_category"
FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- Query 6: Retrieve collision dates and pcf violation categories
SELECT "collision_date", "pcf_violation_category"
FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- Query 7: Retrieve collision dates, primary collision factors, and pcf violation categories
SELECT "collision_date", "primary_collision_factor", "pcf_violation_category"
FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- Query 8: Get counts of primary collision factors
SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "count"
FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
ORDER BY "count" DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- Query 9: Get counts of pcf violation categories
SELECT "pcf_violation_category", COUNT(*) AS "count"
FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
GROUP BY "pcf_violation_category"
ORDER BY "count" DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- Query 10: Retrieve collision dates, primary collision factors, pcf violation codes, and categories
SELECT "collision_date", "primary_collision_factor", "pcf_violation_code", "pcf_violation_category"
FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
LIMIT 1000;
```

These queries will help in understanding the values in the relevant columns and how they can be used to determine the year in which the two most common causes of traffic accidents were different from those in other years.Query:

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year
year:int
```

To determine the year in which the two most common causes of traffic accidents were different from those in other years, we would analyze the `primary_collision_factor` or `pcf_violation_code` columns in the `COLLISIONS` table, grouped by year. The year where the top two causes differ from those in all other years would be identified based on this analysis..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
