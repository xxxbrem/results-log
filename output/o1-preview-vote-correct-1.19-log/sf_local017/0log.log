2025-01-21 00:43:11 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to a mismatch between the date format specified in the `TO_DATE` function and the actual format of the dates in the `"collision_date"` column.

**Explanation:**

- **Actual date format in the data:** The dates in `"collision_date"` are in the format `'YYYY-MM-DD'` (e.g., `'2011-11-22'`).
- **Format provided in the query:** You're using `'MM/DD/YYYY'` in the `TO_DATE` function, which doesn't match the actual format.

**Solution:**

Update the date format in the `TO_DATE` function to match the actual format `'YYYY-MM-DD'`.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("collision_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS "year"
FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
LIMIT 100;
```

**Alternatively**, since the dates are in the ISO format `'YYYY-MM-DD'`, you might not need to parse them at all. You can directly cast the string to a `DATE` type:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "collision_date"::DATE) AS "year"
FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
LIMIT 100;
```

**Next Steps:**

Now that we've fixed the date parsing issue, you can proceed to extract the year and analyze the data to find in which year the two most common causes of traffic accidents were different from those in other years.

**Example Query to Identify the Two Most Common Causes per Year:**

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("collision_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS "year",
    "primary_collision_factor",
    COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
WHERE "primary_collision_factor" IS NOT NULL AND "primary_collision_factor" != ''
GROUP BY "year", "primary_collision_factor"
ORDER BY "year", "collision_count" DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

- We're extracting the year from `"collision_date"`.
- Filtering out null or empty `"primary_collision_factor"` values.
- Grouping by year and primary collision factor to count collisions.
- Ordering the results to identify the most common causes each year.

**To Find the Year Where Top Two Causes Differ:**

You'll need to compare the top two collision factors for each year and identify the year(s) where they differ from other years.

**Example Steps:**

1. Create a temporary table or a common table expression (CTE) that lists the top two collision factors for each year.
2. Compare these factors across all years.
3. Identify the year(s) where the top two factors are different.

**Sample Query Using CTEs (For Illustration):**

```sql
WITH yearly_top_causes AS (
    SELECT
        "year",
        "primary_collision_factor",
        "collision_count",
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "year" ORDER BY "collision_count" DESC) AS cause_rank
    FROM (
        SELECT
            EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("collision_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS "year",
            "primary_collision_factor",
            COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
        FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
        WHERE "primary_collision_factor" IS NOT NULL AND "primary_collision_factor" != ''
        GROUP BY "year", "primary_collision_factor"
    ) t
)
SELECT *
FROM yearly_top_causes
WHERE cause_rank <= 2
ORDER BY "year", cause_rank;
```

**Note:** Since you were asked to avoid using CTEs, you can modify the query accordingly or run multiple queries to achieve the same result.

**Final Output Format:**

- After processing the data, present the year(s) where the top two causes differ.

```csv
Year
year:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

For example, if the year is **2015**, the output would be:

```csv
Year
2015
```

**Remember:** Since the task requests only the year(s) where the two most common causes of accidents differ from those in other years, your final answer should be concise and presented in the specified format.

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
Considered tables and columns:

- `"collision_date"` (from `COLLISIONS`): Potential usage - Extracting the year of the collision.
- `"primary_collision_factor"` (from `COLLISIONS`): Potential usage - Identifying the primary causes of traffic accidents.
- `"pcf_violation_code"` (from `COLLISIONS`): Potential usage - Specific violation codes associated with accidents.
- `"case_id"` (from `COLLISIONS`): Potential usage - Unique identifier for collisions; can be used for linking with other tables if needed.

Conditions that may be used:

- Extracting the year from `"collision_date"` for grouping or filtering.
- Filtering where `"primary_collision_factor"` is not null.
- Grouping by `"primary_collision_factor"` and year to count occurrences.
- Ordering results to find the most common causes.

SQL queries:

1. Select collision dates:

   ```sql
   SELECT "collision_date"
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. Select distinct primary collision factors:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. Count collisions per primary collision factor:

   ```sql
   SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
   GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "collision_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. Extract year from collision date:

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("collision_date", 'MM/DD/YYYY')) AS "year"
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. Count collisions per year:

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("collision_date", 'MM/DD/YYYY')) AS "year", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
   GROUP BY "year"
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. Count collisions per primary factor per year:

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("collision_date", 'MM/DD/YYYY')) AS "year", "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
   GROUP BY "year", "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "year", "collision_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. Select collisions with non-null primary factors:

   ```sql
   SELECT "collision_date", "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
   WHERE "primary_collision_factor" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. Count collisions per violation code:

   ```sql
   SELECT "pcf_violation_code", COUNT(*) AS "violation_count"
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
   GROUP BY "pcf_violation_code"
   ORDER BY "violation_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. Count collisions per violation code per year:

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("collision_date", 'MM/DD/YYYY')) AS "year", "pcf_violation_code", COUNT(*) AS "violation_count"
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
   GROUP BY "year", "pcf_violation_code"
   ORDER BY "year", "violation_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. Find top primary factors with counts greater than 100 in a year:

    ```sql
    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("collision_date", 'MM/DD/YYYY')) AS "year", "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
    FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.COLLISIONS
    WHERE "primary_collision_factor" IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY "year", "primary_collision_factor"

Task: In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year
year:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

The year provided indicates when the two most common causes of traffic accidents differed from those in other years..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-21 00:44:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year
year:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

The year provided indicates when the two most common causes of traffic accidents differed from those in other years. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
