After comparing the three provided SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the most correct answer. Here's the reasoning:

- **Efficiency in Data Handling**: `1result.sql` selects only the necessary columns (`"USER_PSEUDO_ID"` and `"EVENT_NAME"`) from the events tables. This reduces the amount of data processed compared to `0result.sql`, which uses `SELECT *` and includes unnecessary columns for this calculation.

- **Accurate Inclusion of All Users**: `1result.sql` ensures that all users, including those with zero pageviews, are considered. It does this by:

  - Creating a list of all unique users from the combined events.
  - Left joining with the `purchasers` and `pageviews_per_user` tables to include users who may not have pageviews or purchase events.
  - Using `COALESCE` to assign a zero pageview count to users without any pageviews.

- **Correct Logic Implementation**: The query correctly calculates the average number of pageviews for purchasers and non-purchasers by:

  - Identifying purchasers based on the presence of a 'purchase' event.
  - Counting pageviews per user.
  - Computing the average pageviews for purchasers and non-purchasers separately.
  - Calculating the difference between these averages.

- **Consistent Results**: The result from `1result.sql` matches the results from the other queries, indicating that the calculation is performed correctly.

Given these points, **`1result.sql`** is the most appropriate and correct SQL query to answer the question.
