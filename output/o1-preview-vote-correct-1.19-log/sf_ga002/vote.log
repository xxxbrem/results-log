2result.sql

I have chosen `2result.sql` as the correct SQL query that answers the question. Here's why:

**Understanding the Question:**

- **Objective:** For each month from November 2020 to January 2021, identify the most purchased other products (excluding the "Google Red Speckled Tee") and their quantities **by customers who bought the "Google Red Speckled Tee"**.
- **Key Requirements:**
  - **Per Month:** The results should be grouped by each month.
  - **Customers:** Only consider purchases made by customers who bought the "Google Red Speckled Tee".
  - **Other Products:** Exclude the "Google Red Speckled Tee" from the products being counted.

**Comparing the SQL Queries:**

1. **`0result.sql`:**

   - **Observations:**
     - The quantities in the results are significantly smaller (e.g., quantities like 17, 14).
     - This suggests that the query might not be summing quantities across all relevant customers correctly.
   - **Issues:**
     - Possibly aggregating purchases per customer rather than summing across all customers for each product.
     - Might not be handling NULL quantities, leading to undercounting.

2. **`1result.sql`:**

   - **Observations:**
     - The quantities are extremely high (e.g., quantities in the thousands).
     - This might indicate that the query is including purchases beyond the specified customer group.
   - **Issues:**
     - May not be correctly filtering purchases to only those made by customers who bought the "Google Red Speckled Tee".
     - The query doesn't handle NULL quantities, which could lead to incomplete or inaccurate sums.

3. **`2result.sql` (Chosen Query):**

   - **Observations:**
     - The quantities are substantial but seem reasonable given the scope of the data.
     - It uses `COALESCE` to handle NULL quantities, defaulting them to 1, ensuring accurate summation.
   - **Strengths:**
     - Accurately identifies purchases made by customers who bought the "Google Red Speckled Tee" within the same month.
     - Excludes the "Google Red Speckled Tee" from the results as required.
     - Correctly aggregates quantities across all relevant customers and products.
     - Properly formats the month for grouping and display.

**Conclusion:**

- **`2result.sql`** best fulfills the requirements of the question by:
  - Correctly filtering the data to include only the specified customers.
  - Accurately aggregating quantities of other products purchased by these customers per month.
  - Handling potential NULL values in quantities to avoid undercounting.
  - Providing results that are consistent with expected data patterns for the given context.
