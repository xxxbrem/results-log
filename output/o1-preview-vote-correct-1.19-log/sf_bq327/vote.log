To determine the correct SQL query that answers the question **"How many debt indicators for Russia have a value of 0, excluding NULL values?"**, let's compare the two candidate queries and their results.

### Candidate 0: `0result.sql`

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "indicator_name") AS "Number_of_Debt_Indicators"
FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT.INTERNATIONAL_DEBT
WHERE "country_name" = 'Russian Federation'
  AND "value" = 0
  AND "value" IS NOT NULL;
```

**Result:**

```
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
12
```

**Analysis:**

- **Filters:**
  - `"country_name" = 'Russian Federation'`: Selects records for Russia based on the country name.
  - `"value" = 0 AND "value" IS NOT NULL`: Ensures that only records with a value of 0 are considered, excluding NULL values.
- **Indicator Selection:**
  - Counts distinct `"indicator_name"` without specifically filtering for debt indicators.
- **Potential Issue:**
  - This query may include indicators that are not related to debt, as it doesn't filter specifically for debt indicators.

### Candidate 2: `2result.sql`

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "indicator_code") AS "Number_of_Debt_Indicators"
FROM "WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT"."INTERNATIONAL_DEBT"
WHERE "country_code" = 'RUS'
  AND "indicator_code" LIKE 'DT.%'
  AND "value" = 0;
```

**Result:**

```
Number_of_Debt_Indicators
12
```

**Analysis:**

- **Filters:**
  - `"country_code" = 'RUS'`: Selects records for Russia using the country code, which is a unique and standardized identifier.
  - `"indicator_code" LIKE 'DT.%'`: Filters for indicators whose codes start with `'DT.'`, which, based on the dataset's naming conventions, represent debt indicators.
  - `"value" = 0`: Ensures that only records with a value of 0 are considered.
- **Indicator Selection:**
  - Counts distinct `"indicator_code"` specific to debt indicators.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Specificity to Debt Indicators:** By filtering `"indicator_code" LIKE 'DT.%'`, the query specifically targets debt indicators.
  - **Standardized Country Identification:** Using `"country_code" = 'RUS'` reduces the risk of mismatches due to variations in country names.

### Conclusion:

**Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`)** is the correct SQL query because:

- It **specifically filters for debt indicators** by using the condition `"indicator_code" LIKE 'DT.%'`.
- It uses the **standardized country code `'RUS'`**, ensuring accurate data retrieval for Russia.
- It counts the **distinct debt indicators** with a **value of 0**, excluding any unrelated indicators.

Candidate 0 lacks the specificity to debt indicators and may include non-debt indicators in the count, which would not accurately answer the question.

### Correct SQL:

```plain
2result.sql
```
