After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct choice.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate URL Parsing:** The `2result.sql` query uses `REGEXP_SUBSTR(page_url, '[^/]+$')` to accurately extract the last segment of the URL, which is crucial for identifying PDP pages. This method ensures that the last segment is correctly captured, even if the URL varies in length.

- **PDP Identification Logic:** The query checks if the last segment contains a `'+'` sign and confirms if the preceding URL segments match the specified category names. This aligns precisely with the refined page classification criteria for PDP pages.

- **Comprehensive Conditions:** By utilizing `COALESCE(segments[3], '')` and `COALESCE(segments[4], '')`, the query accounts for possible `NULL` values and ensures that the category comparison is robust.

- **Higher Accuracy:** The result of `13.5858%` for PDP page views suggests that `2result.sql` captures more PDP pages than `0result.sql`, likely due to the more precise URL parsing and condition checks.

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** provides a more accurate calculation of the percentage of page views that were for PDP-type pages.
