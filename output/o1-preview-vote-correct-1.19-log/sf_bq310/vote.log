We choose `0result.sql` as the correct SQL query because it best matches the task requirements.

```plain
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Task Requirement:** Find the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow, specifically across specified tags such as 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', etc.

- **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**
  - **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "title"
    FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.POSTS_QUESTIONS
    WHERE LOWER("title") LIKE '%how%'
      AND ("tags" LIKE '%android-layout%'
           OR "tags" LIKE '%android-activity%'
           OR "tags" LIKE '%android-intent%'
           OR "tags" LIKE '%android-fragment%'
           OR "tags" LIKE '%android-studio%')
    ORDER BY "view_count" DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 1;
    ```
  - **Explanation:**
    - The query selects questions where the title contains 'how' (case-insensitive).
    - It filters questions tagged with any of the specified Android-related tags:
      - 'android-layout'
      - 'android-activity'
      - 'android-intent'
      - 'android-fragment'
      - 'android-studio'
    - It orders the results by `view_count` in descending order to get the most viewed question.
    - Limits the result to 1.
  - **Result:**
    - Title: *"How do I pass data between Activities in Android application?"*
    - This question is highly relevant as it deals with passing data between activities, a common task in Android development, and matches the specified tags.

- **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`):**
  - Uses `REGEXP_LIKE` to match tags but may not be as efficient or compatible across all SQL databases.
  - The result is *"How to prevent Soft Keyboard from resizing background image"*, which, while related to Android, may not be as representative as Candidate 0's result.

- **Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):**
  - Broadly matches any question tagged with '%android%', which may include undesired tags.
  - The result is *"How to close/hide the Android soft keyboard programmatically?"*, which, although popular, does not limit the tags to the specified ones.

**Conclusion:**

- **`0result.sql`** directly addresses the requirements by:
  - Filtering for "how" questions.
  - Limiting to specified Android-related tags.
  - Selecting the most viewed question (`ORDER BY "view_count" DESC LIMIT 1`).

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that fulfills the task.
