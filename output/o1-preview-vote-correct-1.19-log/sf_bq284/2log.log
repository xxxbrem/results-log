End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News, the format is:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_Mentioning_Education
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
```

This table lists each category, the total number of articles in that category, and the percentage of those articles that mention "education"..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'BBC': {'BBC_NEWS': ['FULLTEXT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 08:24:29 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News, the format is:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_Mentioning_Education
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:0<=float<=100
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
```

This table lists each category, the total number of articles in that category, and the percentage of those articles that mention "education". The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
