After analyzing both SQL scripts and their results, **2result.sql** is the correct query. Here's why:

**Reasoning:**

- **Partitioning Correctly for County Data:**
  - In **`2result.sql`**, when calculating daily new cases for counties, the query partitions the data by both **`"state_name"`** and **`"county"`**:
    ```sql
    LAG(c."confirmed_cases") OVER (
        PARTITION BY c."state_name", c."county" ORDER BY c."date"
    )
    ```
  - This is crucial because counties with the same name can exist in different states (e.g., "Washington" County exists in multiple states). By partitioning by both **`"state_name"`** and **`"county"`**, the query ensures that it calculates the daily new cases accurately for each county within its specific state.
- **Potential Issue in 1result.sql:**
  - In **`1result.sql`**, the partitioning for counties is done only by **`"county"`**:
    ```sql
    LAG(c."confirmed_cases") OVER (
        PARTITION BY c."county" ORDER BY c."date"
    )
    ```
  - This could lead to incorrect calculations if a county name appears in multiple states, as the cumulative cases from different states with the same county name could be mixed together.
- **Consistency in Results:**
  - While the output results are similar, the count for "Kane" County differs slightly between the two results (70 in **`1result.csv`** vs. 69 in **`2result.csv`**). This discrepancy likely results from the partitioning issue in **`1result.sql`**.
- **Accuracy of 2result.sql:**
  - By correctly partitioning the data, **`2result.sql`** provides more accurate and reliable results, ensuring that each county's data is analyzed within the context of its state.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plain
2result.sql
