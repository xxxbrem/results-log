After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that the second query (`2result.sql`) is the better choice.

**Reason:**

- **Simplicity and Efficiency:** The query in `2result.sql` calculates the year-over-year growth percentage in a single query without the need for temporary tables or `WITH` clauses. It uses `CASE` statements within the `SUM` function to compute the sales for 2022 and 2023 directly. This makes the query more concise, easier to understand, and potentially more efficient in terms of execution.

- **Accurate Results:** Both queries produce the same results for the top 5 items with the highest year-over-year growth percentage. This indicates that `2result.sql` is accurate while being more streamlined.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
