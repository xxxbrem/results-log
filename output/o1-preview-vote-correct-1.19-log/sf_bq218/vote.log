After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that both `0result.sql` and `2result.sql` produce the same top 5 items with the highest year-over-year growth percentage in total sales revenue for 2023. However, there are some differences between the two queries:

- **`0result.sql`** uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to separately compute total sales for 2022 and 2023, then calculates the growth percentage by joining these results.
- **`2result.sql`** performs the calculations in a single query using `CASE WHEN` statements to compute the total sales for each year and then calculates the growth percentage.

While both queries are correct, `2result.sql` is more concise and efficient because it reduces the need for multiple CTEs and simplifies the calculation into one query. Therefore, the correct and preferred SQL query is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
