0result.sql
```

After analyzing the three SQL queries, we have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the most accurate and appropriate for the given task. Here's why:

1. **Data Sources:**
   - **Confirmed Cases Data:**
     - **`0result.sql`** and **`1result.sql`** both use the **`"COVID19_JHU_WORLD_BANK"."COVID19_JHU_CSSE"."SUMMARY"`** table, which provides daily summaries of COVID-19 data per country, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
     - **`2result.sql`** uses the **`"COVID19_JHU_WORLD_BANK"."COVID19_JHU_CSSE"."CONFIRMED_CASES"`** table, which has discrepancies in total confirmed cases compared to the SUMMARY table, leading to inconsistencies.
   - **Population Data:**
     - **`0result.sql`** retrieves population data from the **`"COVID19_JHU_WORLD_BANK"."WORLD_BANK_WDI"."INDICATORS_DATA"`** table, specifically using the **`"SP.POP.TOTL"`** indicator for total population, which is accurate and up-to-date for 2019.
     - **`1result.sql`** uses the **`"WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION"."POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY"`** table but relies on 2018 population data, which may be less accurate.
     - **`2result.sql`** also uses the **`"POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY"`** table but relies on COALESCE over multiple years, potentially introducing outdated data.

2. **Calculations and Accuracy:**
   - **`0result.sql`** provides accurate calculations for **cases per 100,000 people**, using precise population figures and matching the total confirmed cases from the reliable SUMMARY table.
   - The **cases per 100,000** values in **`0result.sql`** align closely with actual statistics when calculated using 2019 population data.
   - **`1result.sql`** uses 2018 population data, which might not reflect the most recent demographic changes.
   - **`2result.sql`** presents discrepancies in total confirmed cases, which may affect the accuracy of the cases per 100,000 calculations.

3. **Consistency with Provided Data:**
   - The total confirmed cases in **`0result.sql`** match the numbers provided in the prior queries and answers from the SUMMARY table within the conversation.
   - **`1result.sql`** shows similar results but uses an older population dataset.
   - **`2result.sql`** has inconsistent confirmed cases data compared to the provided answers, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions.

4. **SQL Structure and Clarity:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses a clear and concise SQL query with a common table expression (CTE) to handle country name adjustments and population retrieval, making the query easy to understand and maintain.
   - **`1result.sql`** handles country name adjustments within a subquery but relies on an older dataset.
   - **`2result.sql`** involves conversions and COALESCE over multiple years, which can introduce complexity and potential errors.

**Conclusion:**

Given the importance of accuracy and the use of the most reliable and up-to-date data sources, **`0result.sql`** is the correct choice. It fulfills the task requirements by providing:

- The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases on April 20, 2020, for the specified countries.
- The number of cases per 100,000 people, based on recent population data (2019).
- Accurate and consistent data aligned with the provided information.
