After comparing the two SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that `1result.sql` is the correct script for the following reasons:

1. **Severity Ranking of Mutations**:
   - In `1result.sql`, a `severity_rank_table` is created to assign numerical ranks to different types of mutations based on their severity. This ranking is crucial because it allows us to consider the most impactful mutation (i.e., the one with the highest severity) for each sample.
   - By selecting the mutation with the minimum severity rank (i.e., the most severe mutation) per sample, we ensure that the analysis accurately reflects the worst genetic variant affecting TP53 expression levels.

2. **Accurate Grouping of Samples**:
   - The first script groups samples based on the worst mutation type, which aligns with the goal of assessing whether different genetic variants affect TP53 expression levels.
   - In contrast, `2result.sql` does not account for mutation severity and may include multiple mutation types per sample without prioritizing the most severe one.

3. **Comprehensive Data Integration**:
   - `1result.sql` carefully joins the mutation data with the expression data using `sample_barcode`, ensuring that each sample is correctly matched and categorized.
   - It also handles samples without mutations by assigning them the `Wild_Type` classification, allowing for a meaningful comparison between mutated and non-mutated samples.

4. **Methodological Alignment with the Research Question**:
   - The approach in `1result.sql` is methodologically rigorous and aligns with the research question, which seeks to assess the impact of different genetic variants (considering their severity) on TP53 expression levels.
   - By calculating the F-statistic using the mean squares between and within groups based on the worst mutation per sample, the script provides a valid statistical assessment.

Therefore, the correct SQL script to use is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
