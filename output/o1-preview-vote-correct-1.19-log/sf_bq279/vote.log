After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, `1result.sql` is the correct choice for the following reasons:

- **Comprehensive Data Retrieval**: The query in `1result.sql` considers both `"start_station_id"` and `"end_station_id"` from trips in 2013 and 2014, ensuring that all stations involved in trips during those years are included.
  
- **Data Cleaning and Consistency**:
  - It uses `TRY_TO_NUMBER()` to safely convert station IDs to numeric values and handles any potential non-numeric IDs without causing errors.
  - By using `UPPER("status")`, it standardizes the station status values, which helps in accurate grouping and counting.

- **Accurate Grouping and Counting**: The query correctly groups the data by year and station status, and counts the distinct station IDs, providing precise counts of active and closed stations for each year.

- **Output Consistency**: The results from `1result.sql` match the expected station counts based on the data:
  - **2013**: 10 active stations, 1 closed station.
  - **2014**: 38 active stations, 9 closed stations.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
