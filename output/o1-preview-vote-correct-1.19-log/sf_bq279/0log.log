```

In this query, I've adjusted the date conversion by dividing `"start_time"` by 1000, assuming that the timestamp is recorded in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. This modification simplifies the condition and should return data for trips that started in the year 2013.

Since the previous query returned no data due to the date condition, I've simplified the query by removing the date filter to ensure it returns data. This query selects all records from the `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` table, allowing us to examine the available data and adjust our conditions accordingly based on the actual contents of the `start_time` column.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS`
  - `"station_id"`: Unique identifier for each bike share station.
  - `"status"`: Indicates whether a station is active or closed.
  - `"modified_date"`: Date when the station's details were last updated; may help determine status changes over time.

- **Table:** `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS`
  - `"start_station_id"`: ID of the station where a trip started.
  - `"end_station_id"`: ID of the station where a trip ended.
  - `"start_time"`: Timestamp of when the trip started; used to extract the year (2013 or 2014).
  - `"end_station_id"`: May provide additional station IDs that were used.

**Potential Conditions:**

- Filter trips by `"start_time"` to include only records from the years 2013 and 2014.
- Use `DISTINCT` to get unique station IDs involved in trips for each year.
- Join trip data with station data to get the current status of each station.
- Since the `"status"` field may not reflect historical statuses, infer activity based on the presence of trips in a given year.
- Use the `"modified_date"` to check if the station status changed during 2013 or 2014.

Task: Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Status,Number_of_Stations
2013,Active,num_active_2013:int
2013,Closed,num_closed_2013:int
2014,Active,num_active_2014:int
2014,Closed,num_closed_2014:int
```
To determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we analyze the `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` and `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` tables. The `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` table provides trip data, which helps identify stations used in each year, while the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table contains the status of each station. However, since the `status` field in `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` may represent the current status without historical changes, precise counts for each year are not available from the provided data. The table above outlines the expected format, with `num_active_YYYY:int` and `num_closed_YYYY:int` representing the integer counts of stations for each year and status..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 07:53:54 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Status,Number_of_Stations
2013,Active,num_active_2013:int
2013,Closed,num_closed_2013:int
2014,Active,num_active_2014:int
2014,Closed,num_closed_2014:int
```
To determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we analyze the `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` and `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` tables. The `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` table provides trip data, which helps identify stations used in each year, while the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table contains the status of each station. However, since the `status` field in `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` may represent the current status without historical changes, precise counts for each year are not available from the provided data. The table above outlines the expected format, with `num_active_YYYY:int` and `num_closed_YYYY:int` representing the integer counts of stations for each year and status. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
