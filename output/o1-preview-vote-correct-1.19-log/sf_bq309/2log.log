```

This SQL query retrieves the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions (by the length of the question body) where each question either has an accepted answer or has an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01. It includes the following columns:

- **Question_id**: The ID of the question.
- **Title**: The title of the question.
- **Question_length**: The length of the question body.
- **User_reputation**: The reputation of the user who asked the question.
- **Net_votes**: The net votes (score) of the question.
- **Badge_count**: The number of badges the user has earned.

The query performs the following steps:

1. **Joins the `POSTS_QUESTIONS` and `USERS` tables** to get details about each question and the corresponding user's reputation.
2. **Left joins a subquery on the `BADGES` table** to get the badge count for each user. If a user has no badges, the `COALESCE` function ensures that the badge count is set to 0 instead of `NULL`.
3. **Filters questions based on the specified conditions**:
   - **Has an accepted answer**: `q."accepted_answer_id" IS NOT NULL`
   - **OR has an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01**: Uses an `EXISTS` clause to check if there is at least one answer meeting the criteria.
4. **Orders the results by the length of the question body in descending order** to get the longest questions.
5. **Limits the results to the top 10 questions**.

This query ensures that all necessary columns are included, empty values are handled properly (e.g., badge count), and the conditions specified in the task are correctly applied.

```

This SQL query retrieves the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions based on the length of the question body. It includes questions that either have an accepted answer or have at least one answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01. The query avoids the error caused by unsupported subqueries by using `LEFT JOIN` instead of an `EXISTS` clause.

**Explanation:**

- **Select Columns:**
  - `q."id"` as `"Question_id"`
  - `q."title"` as `"Title"`
  - `LENGTH(q."body")` as `"Question_length"`
  - `u."reputation"` as `"User_reputation"`
  - `q."score"` as `"Net_votes"`
  - `COALESCE(b."badge_count", 0)` as `"Badge_count"` (uses `COALESCE` to replace `NULL` with `0` if the user has no badges)

- **Joins:**
  - **Join with `USERS` table (`u`)** to get user reputations.
  - **Left Join with a subquery (`b`)** that calculates the badge count per user.
  - **Left Join with a subquery (`ar`)** that calculates the maximum answer score per question.

- **Subquery `ar` (Answer Ratios):**
  - Selects the maximum answer score (`MAX("score")`) for each question (`"parent_id"`) from the `POSTS_ANSWERS` table.
  - Groups by `"parent_id"` to get one record per question.

- **Filter Conditions (`WHERE` clause):**
  - Includes questions that **have an accepted answer**: `q."accepted_answer_id" IS NOT NULL`.
  - **OR** includes questions where **the maximum answer score divided by view count is greater than 0.01**:
    - Checks that `q."view_count" > 0` to avoid division by zero.
    - Calculates `(ar."max_answer_score" / q."view_count") > 0.01`.

- **Ordering and Limiting:**
  - Orders the results by `LENGTH(q."body")` in descending order to get the longest questions first.
  - Limits the output to the top 10 records.

This revised query eliminates the use of an `EXISTS` subquery, which was causing the error, and replaces it with a `LEFT JOIN` to a subquery that pre-calculates the necessary values. It adheres to the requirement of not using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and ensures all joins and calculations are properly handled within the query.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure! Let's consider the relevant tables and columns for the task:

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`POSTS_QUESTIONS` table**:
   - `"id"`: Question ID; used to identify each question.
   - `"body"`: Content of the question; used to calculate the length of the question.
   - `"accepted_answer_id"`: Indicates if the question has an accepted answer.
   - `"view_count"`: Number of times the question has been viewed; used to calculate score-to-view ratio.
   - `"owner_user_id"`: ID of the user who posted the question; used to link to user details.
   - `"score"`: Net votes (upvotes - downvotes) of the question; included in the output.

2. **`POSTS_ANSWERS` table**:
   - `"id"`: Answer ID.
   - `"parent_id"`: ID of the question that the answer belongs to; used to link answers to questions.
   - `"score"`: Score of the answer; used to calculate score-to-view ratio.

3. **`USERS` table**:
   - `"id"`: User ID; matches with `"owner_user_id"` from the questions table.
   - `"reputation"`: Reputation of the user; included in the output.

4. **`BADGES` table**:
   - `"user_id"`: User ID; used to count the number of badges per user.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Checking if a question has an accepted answer by verifying if `"accepted_answer_id"` is not null.
- Calculating the length of the question's `"body"` to find the longest questions.
- Calculating the score-to-view ratio of answers to questions.
- Filtering questions based on the above conditions.
- Joining tables to get user reputation and badge count.

---

Here are 15 different SQL queries to explore the data:

1. **Retrieve question IDs and their lengths:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", LENGTH("body") AS "question_length"
   FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get questions with an accepted answer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "title", "accepted_answer_id"
   FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   WHERE "accepted_answer_id" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all answers with their parent question IDs and scores:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id" AS "answer_id", "parent_id" AS "question_id", "score" AS "answer_score"
   FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_ANSWERS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve questions with their view counts:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "title", "view_count"
   FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   ORDER BY "view_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Join questions with users to get their reputation:**

   ```sql
   SELECT q."id" AS "question_id", q."title", u."reputation"
   FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS" q
   JOIN STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."USERS" u
   ON q."owner_user_id" = u."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count badges per user:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "user_id", COUNT(*) AS "badge_count"
   FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."BADGES"
   GROUP BY "user_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Select questions with their net votes (scores):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "title", "score" AS "net_votes"
   FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   ORDER BY "net_votes" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate score-to-view ratio for answers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT a."id" AS "answer_id", a."parent_id" AS "question_id",
          a."score" / q."view_count" AS "score_to_view_ratio"
   FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_ANSWERS" a
   JOIN STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS" q
   ON a."parent_id" = q."id"
   WHERE q."view_count" > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find the top 100 longest questions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "title", LENGTH("body") AS "question_length"
   FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   ORDER BY "question_length" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Get questions with accepted answers and user reputations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT q."id" AS "question_id", q."title", u."reputation"
    FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS" q
    JOIN STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."USERS" u
    ON q."owner_user_id" = u."id"
    WHERE q."accepted_answer_id" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Show the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions where the question has an accepted answer or an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01, including the user's reputation, net votes, and badge count.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Question_id,Title,Question_length,User_reputation,Net_votes,Badge_count
id1:int,title1:str,length1:int,reputation1:int,net_votes1:int,badge_count1:int

(Attention: Answer includes top 10 longest questions)
```

We have listed the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions (by length of the question body) where each question either has an accepted answer or has an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01. For each question, we include the question ID, title, question length, the user's reputation, net votes (score of the question), and the user's badge count..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKOVERFLOW': {'STACKOVERFLOW': ['BADGES', 'COMMENTS', 'POSTS_ANSWERS', 'POSTS_MODERATOR_NOMINATION', 'POSTS_ORPHANED_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_PRIVILEGE_WIKI', 'POSTS_QUESTIONS', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI_EXCERPT', 'POSTS_WIKI_PLACEHOLDER', 'POST_HISTORY', 'POST_LINKS', 'STACKOVERFLOW_POSTS', 'TAGS', 'USERS', 'VOTES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
