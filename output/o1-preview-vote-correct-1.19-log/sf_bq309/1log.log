```

This SQL query retrieves the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions (by the length of the question body) where each question either:

- Has an accepted answer (`q."accepted_answer_id" IS NOT NULL`), **or**
- Has an answer with a score-to-view ratio above `0.01` (`(a."max_answer_score" / NULLIF(q."view_count", 0) > 0.01)`).

The query includes the following columns:

- **Question_id**: The ID of the question.
- **Title**: The title of the question.
- **Question_length**: The length of the question body.
- **User_reputation**: The reputation of the user who asked the question.
- **Net_votes**: The score (net votes) of the question.
- **Badge_count**: The number of badges the user has earned.

**Notes:**

- **Avoiding Subquery Errors**: To prevent the "Unsupported subquery type cannot be evaluated" error, the query avoids subqueries in the `WHERE` clause by using `LEFT JOIN`s instead.
- **Handling Empty Values**: The `COALESCE` function ensures that if a user has no badges (`NULL`), the `Badge_count` is displayed as `0`.
- **Calculating Maximum Answer Score**: The subquery aliased as `a` computes the maximum score of answers for each question.
- **Null Division Prevention**: The `NULLIF` function is used to prevent division by zero when computing the score-to-view ratio.

- `"accepted_answer_id" IS NOT NULL`: To find questions with an accepted answer.
- Calculating the score-to-view ratio for answers greater than 0.01.
- Calculating the length of the question using `LENGTH("body")`.
- Joining tables to gather all required information.

---

Here are at least 10 different SQL queries to help understand the data:

1. **Select the first 100 questions with their IDs and titles:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "title"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Fetch questions with their view counts and scores:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "title", "view_count", "score"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   WHERE "view_count" IS NOT NULL AND "score" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve answers with their associated question IDs and scores:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "parent_id", "score"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_ANSWERS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get users along with their reputation:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "display_name", "reputation"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."USERS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List badges and their corresponding user IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name", "user_id"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."BADGES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate the length of question bodies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "title", LENGTH("body") AS "question_length"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find questions that have an accepted answer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "title", "accepted_answer_id"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   WHERE "accepted_answer_id" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Select questions ordered by the number of answers they have:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "title", "answer_count"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
   ORDER BY "answer_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Get answers along with their scores and the view counts of their questions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT a."id" AS "answer_id", a."score" AS "answer_score", q."view_count" AS "question_view_count"
   FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_ANSWERS" a
   JOIN "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS" q ON a."parent_id" = q."id"
   WHERE q."view_count" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate the score-to-view ratio for answers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT a."id" AS "answer_id", a."score" / q."view_count" AS "score_to_view_ratio"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_ANSWERS" a
    JOIN "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS" q ON a."parent_id" = q."id"
    WHERE q."view_count" > 0
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Retrieve questions along with their owners' reputations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT q."id" AS "question_id", q."title", u."reputation"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS" q
    JOIN "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."USERS" u ON q."owner_user_id" = u."id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Count the number of badges each user has earned:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "user_id", COUNT(*) AS "badge_count"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."BADGES"
    GROUP BY "user_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Select the top 100 longest questions by body length:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "title", LENGTH("body") AS "question_length"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
    ORDER BY LENGTH("body") DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Fetch questions with their net votes and view counts:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "title", "score" AS "net_votes", "view_count"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
    WHERE "score" IS NOT NULL AND "view_count" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Get questions with accepted answers and the score of those answers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT q."id" AS "question_id", q."title", a."score" AS "accepted_answer_score"
    FROM "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_QUESTIONS" q
    JOIN "STACKOVERFLOW"."STACKOVERFLOW"."POSTS_ANSWERS" a ON q."accepted_answer_id" = a."id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries use different combinations of tables and columns to explore the data:

- **Queries 1-2:** Basic selection of questions and their attributes.
- **Query 3:** Accessing answer data and linking to questions.
- **Query 4:** Retrieving user information.
- **Query 5:** Looking at badge data associated with users.
- **Query 6:** Calculating the length of the question body.
- **Query 7:** Identifying questions with accepted answers.
- **Query 8:** Ordering questions by the number of answers they have received.
- **Queries 9-10:** Analyzing the relationship between answer scores and question view counts.
- **Query 11:** Combining question data with user reputation.
- **Query 12:** Counting badges per user to determine badge counts.
- **Query 13:** Finding the longest questions by body length.
- **Query 14:** Fetching net votes and view counts for questions.
- **Query 15:** Getting accepted answer scores for questions with accepted answers.

These queries will help in understanding the structure and content of the data, which is essential for constructing the final query to fulfill the task requirements.Query:

Task: Show the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions where the question has an accepted answer or an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01, including the user's reputation, net votes, and badge count.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.

We have listed the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions (by length of the question body) where each question either has an accepted answer or has an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01. For each question, we include the question ID, title, question length, the user's reputation, net votes (score of the question), and the user's badge count..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKOVERFLOW': {'STACKOVERFLOW': ['BADGES', 'COMMENTS', 'POSTS_ANSWERS', 'POSTS_MODERATOR_NOMINATION', 'POSTS_ORPHANED_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_PRIVILEGE_WIKI', 'POSTS_QUESTIONS', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI_EXCERPT', 'POSTS_WIKI_PLACEHOLDER', 'POST_HISTORY', 'POST_LINKS', 'STACKOVERFLOW_POSTS', 'TAGS', 'USERS', 'VOTES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

We have listed the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions (by length of the question body) where each question either has an accepted answer or has an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01. For each question, we include the question ID, title, question length, the user's reputation, net votes (score of the question), and the user's badge count. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
