```plain
2result.sql
```

The SQL script in `2result.sql` is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Accurate Calculation of Score-to-View Ratio:**

   - **`2result.sql`** computes the **maximum** score-to-view ratio **per question** by aggregating using the `MAX()` function in the `answer_stats` CTE:
     ```sql
     MAX(
         CASE
             WHEN q."view_count" > 0 THEN CAST(a."score" AS FLOAT) / q."view_count"
             ELSE NULL
         END
     ) AS "max_score_view_ratio"
     ```
     This ensures that for each question, we're considering the answer with the **highest** score-to-view ratio, which aligns with the requirement to include questions where **any associated answer** has a score-to-view ratio above `0.01`.
   
   - **`0result.sql`** selects questions where **any answer** meets the condition without aggregating:
     ```sql
     WHERE
         q."view_count" > 0
         AND (a."score" / NULLIF(q."view_count", 0)) > 0.01
     ```
     While this works, it doesn't explicitly compute or consider the **maximum** score-to-view ratio per question, which could be less precise.

2. **Comprehensive Inclusion of Questions:**

   - **`2result.sql`** ensures that all questions with an accepted answer or with any answer having a score-to-view ratio above `0.01` are included by properly joining and filtering in the `WHERE` clause:
     ```sql
     WHERE
         q."accepted_answer_id" IS NOT NULL
         OR (ans."max_score_view_ratio" > 0.01)
     ```
     This accounts for cases where a question may have multiple answers, and only the best-performing one should influence the inclusion.
   
   - **`0result.sql`** may include questions multiple times if they have multiple answers meeting the condition before the `DISTINCT` operation, which can be less efficient.

3. **Efficiency and Clarity:**

   - **`2result.sql`** uses aggregation and joins more efficiently, reducing potential duplicates and making the intention of the query clearer.
   - It also orders the results consistently:
     ```sql
     ORDER BY
         LENGTH(q."body") DESC NULLS LAST,
         q."id" ASC
     ```
     This provides a deterministic order when multiple questions have the same body length.

4. **Consistent Results:**

   - Both scripts produce the same final result set, but **`2result.sql`** does so with a query that's more precise in fulfilling the task requirements by accurately computing and considering the maximum score-to-view ratio per question.

**Conclusion:**

Given the above reasons, **`2result.sql`** is more accurate and efficient in implementing the task requirements, making it the correct choice.
