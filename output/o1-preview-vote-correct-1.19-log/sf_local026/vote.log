Between the two SQL queries, both correctly calculate the total runs conceded by each bowler in each over by summing the runs scored off the bat and any extras. However, **`0result.sql`** is preferred because it groups the data by bowler ID (`player_id`), `match_id`, and `over_id` before joining with the `PLAYER` table to retrieve the bowler's name. This ensures accurate aggregation even if multiple players share the same name. In contrast, grouping directly by `player_name` in `2result.sql` could potentially lead to incorrect results if there are duplicate names.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query.
