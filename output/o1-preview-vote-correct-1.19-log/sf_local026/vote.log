After comparing the SQL queries and analyzing the results, **`2result.sql`** emerges as the correct answer. Here's why:

**Explanation:**

1. **Difference in Results:**
   - **Candidates 0 and 1** report unrealistically high runs conceded in a single over (47 runs), which is practically impossible in cricket.
   - **Candidate 2** reports more realistic values (37 and 33 runs), aligning with the highest possible runs in an over considering six legal deliveries and possible extras.

2. **Inclusion of `innings_no`:**
   - **Candidate 2** includes `"innings_no"` in the JOIN conditions:
     ```sql
     AND b."innings_no" = s."innings_no"
     ```
     This ensures that runs are correctly matched to the corresponding innings, avoiding data duplication and mismatches.
   - **Candidates 0 and 1** omit `"innings_no"` in the JOINs, potentially leading to inflated sums due to overlapping deliveries from different innings.

3. **Accurate Grouping and Summation:**
   - **Candidate 2** accurately groups data by bowler, match, and over, ensuring that the `SUM` function calculates the total runs conceded in a single over without duplication.
   - The correct use of `COALESCE` handles `NULL` values appropriately, contributing to accurate summations.

4. **Practicality of Results:**
   - A maximum of 36 runs can be scored off six legal deliveries (assuming six sixes). With additional extras (no-balls, wides), the total can exceed 36 but not by much.
   - The reported values in **Candidate 2** (37 and 33 runs) are within a plausible range, whereas 47 runs are not realistic.

5. **Consistency with Cricket Rules and Data Integrity:**
   - By including `"innings_no"` and ensuring accurate JOINs, **Candidate 2** maintains data integrity and aligns with cricket rules regarding overs and innings.

**Chosen SQL:**

```plain
2result.sql
```

*This SQL query correctly identifies the top 3 bowlers who conceded the maximum runs in a single over, along with the corresponding matches, by accurately joining the tables with consideration for innings and avoiding data duplication.*
