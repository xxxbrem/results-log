After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **I conclude that `1result.sql` is the correct SQL**.

**Reason:**

- **Explicit Proportion Calculation:** `1result.sql` explicitly calculates the proportion of each name's occurrence in Wyoming relative to its total occurrence across all states. It does this by computing `ROUND(wy_names."number"::FLOAT / total_names.total_number, 4) AS proportion`. This makes the calculation clear and precise.
- **Ordering and Tie-breaking:** The query orders the results by `proportion` in descending order and then by `"name"` in ascending order. This ensures that if multiple names have the same highest proportion, they are sorted alphabetically.
- **Clarity and Readability:** The query is structured in a way that is easy to read and understand, with clear aliases and organized subqueries.

Therefore, the correct SQL that answers the question is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
