After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script for the following reasons:

1. **Use of Sample Standard Deviation (`STDDEV_SAMP`)**:
   - The `0result.sql` script uses the `STDDEV_SAMP` function to calculate the sample standard deviation of the daily incident counts.
   - This is appropriate because we are working with a sample of data (daily counts within a specific year) rather than the entire population.
   - Using `STDDEV_SAMP` provides an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation based on the sample.

2. **Accurate Calculation of Z-Scores**:
   - The script correctly computes the Z-scores by subtracting the mean from each daily count and dividing by the sample standard deviation.
   - This standardizes the daily incident counts, allowing for meaningful comparisons across dates.

3. **Proper Selection of the Second Highest Z-Score**:
   - By ordering the results in descending order of Z-scores and offsetting by 1, the script accurately retrieves the date with the second highest Z-score.
   - This aligns with the task requirement to find the date with the second highest Z-score for daily 'PUBLIC INTOXICATION' incidents.

4. **Consistency with Statistical Practices**:
   - Using sample statistics (mean and standard deviation) when dealing with sample data is a standard statistical practice.
   - This ensures that the Z-scores are correctly scaled and representative of the data distribution.

Therefore, the **`0result.sql`** script is the most appropriate and accurate among the provided options.
