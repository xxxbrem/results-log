2025-01-21 00:53:50 - root - INFO - It appears that the error you're encountering is due to a mismatch between the format of the `payment_date` string and the format string provided in the `TO_DATE` function.

The `payment_date` values include milliseconds, as seen in '2005-05-25 11:30:37.000', which corresponds to the format `'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3'` where `'FF3'` represents milliseconds (up to 3 digits).

Additionally, in Snowflake, it's more appropriate to use `TO_TIMESTAMP` when you're dealing with datetime strings that include both date and time components.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "payment_id", "customer_id", "amount",
       TO_TIMESTAMP("payment_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3') AS "payment_date_parsed",
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_TIMESTAMP("payment_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3')) AS "year",
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_TIMESTAMP("payment_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3')) AS "month"
FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **TO_TIMESTAMP Function:**
  - Converts a string to a timestamp.
  - Syntax: `TO_TIMESTAMP(string, format)`
  - The format `'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3'` matches the `payment_date` format, including milliseconds.
  
- **Format Specifiers:**
  - `'YYYY'`: Four-digit year.
  - `'MM'`: Two-digit month.
  - `'DD'`: Two-digit day.
  - `'HH24'`: Hour in 24-hour format.
  - `'MI'`: Minute.
  - `'SS'`: Second.
  - `'FF3'`: Fractional seconds up to 3 digits (milliseconds).

**Alternative Using TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP:**

If there's a possibility that some `payment_date` values might not match the format (though unlikely in this dataset), you can use `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP`, which returns `NULL` instead of an error for non-matching formats.

```sql
SELECT "payment_id", "customer_id", "amount",
       TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP("payment_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3') AS "payment_date_parsed",
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP("payment_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3')) AS "year",
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP("payment_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3')) AS "month"
FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Using CAST:**

Alternatively, since Snowflake can often auto-recognize standard timestamp formats, you can cast the `payment_date` directly:

```sql
SELECT "payment_id", "customer_id", "amount",
       CAST("payment_date" AS TIMESTAMP) AS "payment_date_parsed",
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CAST("payment_date" AS TIMESTAMP)) AS "year",
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CAST("payment_date" AS TIMESTAMP)) AS "month"
FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Proceeding with the Task:**

With the corrected query, you should now be able to extract the year and month from the `payment_date`. This will allow you to group payments by customer and month to calculate the payment differences.

**Next Steps:**

- **Calculate Monthly Payment Differences:**
  - For each of the top 10 paying customers, group their payments by year and month.
  - Within each group, find the maximum and minimum payment amounts.
  - Calculate the difference between these amounts.

- **Identify the Highest Payment Difference:**
  - For each customer, determine their highest monthly payment difference.
  - Compare these differences among the top 10 customers to find the highest one.

**Example Query to Calculate Payment Differences:**

```sql
-- Identify the top 10 paying customers
WITH top_customers AS (
    SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_payment"
    FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
    GROUP BY "customer_id"
    ORDER BY "total_payment" DESC
    LIMIT 10
),

-- Extract year and month from payment dates
payments_with_date AS (
    SELECT "customer_id",
           TO_TIMESTAMP("payment_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3') AS "payment_date_parsed",
           EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_TIMESTAMP("payment_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3')) AS "year",
           EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_TIMESTAMP("payment_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3')) AS "month",
           "amount"
    FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
    WHERE "customer_id" IN (SELECT "customer_id" FROM top_customers)
),

-- Calculate payment differences per customer per month
monthly_differences AS (
    SELECT "customer_id", "year", "month",
           MAX("amount") - MIN("amount") AS "payment_difference"
    FROM payments_with_date
    GROUP BY "customer_id", "year", "month"
),

-- Find the highest payment difference per customer
customer_max_differences AS (
    SELECT "customer_id", MAX("payment_difference") AS "max_payment_difference"
    FROM monthly_differences
    GROUP BY "customer_id"
)

-- Retrieve the customer with the highest payment difference
SELECT "customer_id", ROUND("max_payment_difference", 2) AS "highest_payment_difference"
FROM customer_max_differences
ORDER BY "highest_payment_difference" DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Final Answer:**

Based on the above, the final result will be:

```csv
customer_id,highest_payment_difference
customer_id:int,payment_difference:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This CSV format shows the `customer_id` of the top paying customer who had the highest payment difference in any given month, along with the `highest_payment_difference` rounded to two decimal places.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- **PAYMENT."customer_id"**: To identify payments made by each customer.
- **PAYMENT."amount"**: The amount paid in each transaction.
- **PAYMENT."payment_date"**: To determine when the payment was made, allowing us to group payments by month.
- **CUSTOMER."customer_id"**: To join with the PAYMENT table and retrieve customer information.
- **CUSTOMER."first_name"**, **CUSTOMER."last_name"**: For identifying customers by name.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Aggregate functions like `SUM`, `MAX`, and `MIN` to calculate total payments and payment differences.
- `GROUP BY` clauses to group payments by customer and by month.
- `ORDER BY` clauses to sort customers based on total payments.
- Date extraction functions to derive month and year from the payment dates.

Task: Can you determine which of our top 10 paying customers had the highest payment difference in any given month? I’d like to know the highest payment difference for this customer, with the result rounded to two decimal places.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
customer_id,highest_payment_difference
customer_id:int,payment_difference:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

To determine which of the top 10 paying customers had the highest payment difference in any given month, we would:

1. **Identify the Top 10 Paying Customers:**
   - Calculate the total payments made by each customer using the `PAYMENT` table.
   - Sort the customers in descending order of their total payments.
   - Select the top 10 customers from this list.

2. **Calculate Monthly Payment Differences for Each Customer:**
   - For each of these top 10 customers, group their payments by month.
   - Within each month, find the difference between the highest and lowest payment amounts.

3. **Find the Highest Payment Difference:**
   - Identify the maximum payment difference among all months for each customer.
   - Compare these differences across the top 10 customers to find the highest one.

The final result shows the `customer_id` of the customer with the highest payment difference in any given month, along with the `highest_payment_difference` rounded to two decimal places..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'SQLITE_SAKILA': {'SQLITE_SAKILA': ['ACTOR', 'ADDRESS', 'CATEGORY', 'CITY', 'COUNTRY', 'CUSTOMER', 'FILM', 'FILM_ACTOR', 'FILM_CATEGORY', 'FILM_TEXT', 'INVENTORY', 'LANGUAGE', 'PAYMENT', 'RENTAL', 'STAFF', 'STORE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

I’d like to know the highest payment difference for this customer, with the result rounded to two decimal places., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
customer_id,highest_payment_difference
