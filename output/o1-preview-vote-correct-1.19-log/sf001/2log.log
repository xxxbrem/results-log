2025-01-20 22:05:03 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to a mismatched quotation mark in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, the condition `"COUNTRY" = 'US"` has an opening single quote but an incorrect closing double quote, which causes a syntax error.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "DATE_VALID_STD", "POSTAL_CODE", "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"
FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-22' AND '2023-01-28'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks:** Ensure that the string literal `'US'` is enclosed within matching single quotes.
  
  - Incorrect: `'US"`
  - Correct: `'US'`

- **Syntax:** The rest of the query syntax remains correct. The `BETWEEN` operator is used properly to specify the date range.

By correcting the quotation marks around `'US'`, the query should compile and run without syntax errors. This query will retrieve records for U.S. postal codes during the specified week, displaying the date, postal code, and snowfall amount.

---

**Note:** Always ensure that all string literals in SQL queries are enclosed within matching single (`' '`) or double (`" "`) quotes, and that each opening quote has a corresponding closing quote to avoid syntax errors.

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"DATE_VALID_STD"**: Used to filter records within the specified date range (the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year).
- **"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"**: Used to identify days with snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches.
- **"POSTAL_CODE"**: Used to display the U.S. postal codes.
- **"COUNTRY"**: Used to filter records for the United States.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **"DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-22' AND '2023-01-28'**: To select data from the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year.
- **"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6**: To find days with snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches.
- **"COUNTRY" = 'US'**: To filter records for U.S. postal codes.

These queries are designed to explore the relevant data and to understand the values within the related columns without directly answering the task. Each query serves a different purpose:

1. Identifies the country codes present in the dataset.
2. Lists unique postal codes to gauge geographic coverage.
3. Checks available dates to confirm data availability for the required period.
4. Retrieves snowfall amounts with dates to examine the data.
5. Confirms the format of the "COUNTRY" field for U.S. records.
6. Finds instances where snowfall exceeded 6 inches to understand frequency.
7. Checks snowfall data within the specified week to assess data completeness.
8. Retrieves snowfall data for U.S. postal codes to analyze snowfall distribution.
9. Gathers records for U.S. postal codes during the specified week to understand trends.
10. Lists unique snowfall amounts to understand the range and distribution of snowfall values.

These queries help in understanding the dataset's structure and the values in the relevant columns, which is essential before formulating the final query to answer the task.Query:

Task: Assuming today is April 1, 2024, I would like to know the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year (January 15, 2023, to January 21, 2023), we utilize the `HISTORY_DAY` table from the `STANDARD_TILE` schema of the `GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI` database. This table contains historical weather data, including snowfall amounts (`TOT_SNOWFALL_IN`), dates (`DATE_VALID_STD`), and postal codes (`POSTAL_CODE`).

The resulting data would be structured as follows:

```csv
postal_code,date,snowfall_amount_in
postal_code1:str,date1:date,snowfall1:float > 6
postal_code2:str,date2:date,snowfall2:float > 6
...
```

This table lists each postal code alongside the date and the corresponding snowfall amount in inches (greater than 6 inches) within the specified week..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI': {'STANDARD_TILE': ['CLIMATOLOGY_DAY', 'FORECAST_DAY', 'HISTORY_DAY']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 22:05:54 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Assuming today is April 1, 2024, I would like to know the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year (January 15, 2023, to January 21, 2023), we utilize the `HISTORY_DAY` table from the `STANDARD_TILE` schema of the `GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI` database. This table contains historical weather data, including snowfall amounts (`TOT_SNOWFALL_IN`), dates (`DATE_VALID_STD`), and postal codes (`POSTAL_CODE`).

The resulting data would be structured as follows:

```csv
postal_code,date,snowfall_amount_in
postal_code1:str,date1:date,snowfall1:float > 6
postal_code2:str,date2:date,snowfall2:float > 6
...
```

This table lists each postal code alongside the date and the corresponding snowfall amount in inches (greater than 6 inches) within the specified week. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
