Upon comparing the two SQL queries and their results, we can determine which one is correct based on the accuracy of their joins and calculations.

**Analysis of the First SQL (1result.sql):**

- **Correct Join Condition:** The first SQL correctly joins the `COUNTIES` table with the employment data using `c."geo_id" = e."geoid"`. Both `"geo_id"` and `"geoid"` represent the full geospatial identifier for each county, ensuring an accurate match.
- **Filtering for Utah Counties:** It filters for Utah counties by checking `c."state_fips_code" = '49'`, which is the correct FIPS code for Utah.
- **Data Accuracy:** It selects counties where the construction employment data is not null and greater than zero, ensuring reliable calculations.
- **Percentage Increase Calculation:** It accurately calculates the percentage increase in construction jobs from 2000 to 2018.
- **Result:** The query identifies **Utah County** as having the greatest percentage increase in construction jobs, with an increase of approximately **144.735%**, which aligns with the expected data.

**Analysis of the Second SQL (2result.sql):**

- **Incorrect Join Condition:** The second SQL attempts to join the `COUNTIES` table to the employment data using `c."county_fips_code" = e2000."area_fips"`. However, `"county_fips_code"` contains only the county-specific portion of the FIPS code (typically the last three digits), whereas `"area_fips"` includes both the state and county codes (a combined five-digit code).
- **Missing Concatenation:** To correctly match the `area_fips`, the query should concatenate the state and county FIPS codes, like `CONCAT(c."state_fips_code", c."county_fips_code")`. The omission of this concatenation results in an incorrect join and potentially mismatched records.
- **Data Reliability:** Due to the flawed join condition, the employment data linked to each county may not be accurate, leading to unreliable percentage calculations.
- **Result:** Although it also identifies **Utah County** with the same percentage increase, the correctness of this result is questionable due to the incorrect join.

**Conclusion:**

The first SQL query demonstrates a correct and reliable approach by:

- Using the appropriate fields for joining (`"geo_id"` and `"geoid"`).
- Properly filtering and calculating the percentage increase.
- Ensuring data integrity through accurate joins and conditions.

The second SQL query, on the other hand, contains a critical error in its join condition, making its results less trustworthy.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**
