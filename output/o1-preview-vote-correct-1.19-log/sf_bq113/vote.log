After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Correct Joins:**
  - **`1result.sql`** joins the counties table and the employment data using the `geo_id` from `BLS.GEO_US_BOUNDARIES.COUNTIES` and the `geoid` from the employment tables `BLS.BLS_QCEW._2000_Q4` and `BLS.BLS_QCEW._2018_Q4`. This ensures accurate alignment of county data with employment data.
  - In contrast, **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** attempt to join `area_fips` with `county_fips_code`, which may not correctly align the data because `area_fips` typically combines both state and county FIPS codes, whereas `county_fips_code` includes only the county code.
  
- **Handling of Zero or Null Values:**
  - **`1result.sql`** includes conditions to exclude records where the 2000 employment level is zero or null, preventing division by zero errors in the percentage calculation.
  
- **Accurate Calculation:**
  - The percentage increase is calculated correctly, and the query orders the results to find the county with the greatest increase.

Based on these reasons, **`1result.sql`** provides the most accurate and reliable answer to determine which Utah county experienced the greatest percentage increase in construction jobs from 2000 to 2018.
