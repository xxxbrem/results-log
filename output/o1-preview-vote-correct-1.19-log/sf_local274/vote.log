After comparing both SQL queries, **`0result.sql`** provides a more accurate calculation for the average number of units picked per product using the FIFO method. Here's the reasoning:

- **`0result.sql` Explanation:**
  - It calculates the total quantity picked for each product (`picked_totals`).
  - It orders the inventory batches by purchase date, simulating FIFO, and computes the cumulative inventory (`purchases_ordered`).
  - It allocates quantities from each batch based on the cumulative inventory and the total quantity picked, accounting for partial batch usage (`fifo_allocation`).
  - It counts only the batches from which inventory was actually allocated (`batches_used`).
  - The final calculation of the average units picked per batch is precise, as it divides the total allocated quantity by the exact number of batches used.

- **`2result.sql` Concerns:**
  - It identifies the minimum number of batches needed to fulfill the total picked quantity but may not accurately reflect partial batch usage.
  - It assumes full utilization of batches up to the point where the cumulative inventory meets or exceeds the total quantity picked.
  - This method might overestimate the number of batches used if the cumulative inventory significantly exceeds the quantity needed.

**Conclusion:**

`0result.sql` is the correct SQL query as it accurately reflects the FIFO allocation by considering partial batch usage and counts only the batches that contributed to fulfilling the order.
