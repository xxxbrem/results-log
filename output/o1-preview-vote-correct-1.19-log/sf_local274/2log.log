   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Retrieve product names for products picked in order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p."name"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" p
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl ON p."id" = pl."product_id"
   WHERE pl."order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **View quantities picked per product for order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty_picked"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Check inventory for products picked in order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", i."qty", i."purchase_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   WHERE i."product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Get purchase dates for inventory items (to apply FIFO):**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", i."purchase_id", pu."purchased", i."qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pu ON i."purchase_id" = pu."id"
   WHERE i."product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List purchases for products picked, ordered by purchase date (FIFO order):**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES"
   WHERE "product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   ORDER BY "purchased" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Retrieve full details of picking lines and product names for order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pl."line_no", pl."product_id", p."name", pl."qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" p ON pl."product_id" = p."id"
   WHERE pl."order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Check total inventory quantities per product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_inventory_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY"
   WHERE "product_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
     FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
     WHERE "order_id" = 421
   )
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **View inventory allocations per product, ordered by purchase date (for FIFO):**

15. **List locations involved in picking lines for order 421:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT pl."location_id", l."warehouse", l."aisle", l."position"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."LOCATIONS" l ON pl."location_id" = l."id"
    WHERE pl."order_id" = 421
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Task: Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine which products were picked for order 421 and the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method, we first identify all picking lines associated with order 421 from the `PICKING_LINE` table. Then, we simulate the allocation of picked quantities to inventory batches from the `INVENTORY` table, prioritizing the earliest purchases (FIFO). Finally, we calculate the average number of units picked per inventory batch for each product.

```csv
product_id,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,average_units2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 21:23:19 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine which products were picked for order 421 and the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method, we first identify all picking lines associated with order 421 from the `PICKING_LINE` table. Then, we simulate the allocation of picked quantities to inventory batches from the `INVENTORY` table, prioritizing the earliest purchases (FIFO). Finally, we calculate the average number of units picked per inventory batch for each product.

```csv
product_id,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,average_units2:float
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
