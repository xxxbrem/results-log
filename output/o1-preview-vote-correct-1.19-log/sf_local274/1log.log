2025-01-20 21:21:54 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the placeholder `[product_id]` in your SQL query. In SQL, placeholders like `[product_id]` are not automatically interpreted as variables or parameters. Instead, you need to replace `[product_id]` with an actual product ID value from your data.

**Explanation of the Error:**

- **Error Message:** `invalid identifier 'PRODUCT_ID'`
- **Cause:** The SQL parser is interpreting `[product_id]` literally and doesn't recognize it as a valid identifier or value.
- **Position of Error:** Line 3 at position 25 corresponds to the `[product_id]` in your `WHERE` clause.

**How to Fix It:**

You need to replace `[product_id]` with the actual product IDs you have retrieved from previous queries. From your earlier results, you have two product IDs:

- `6520`
- `4280`

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

To get the inventory entries for each product, run the queries separately for each `product_id`.

1. **For Product ID 6520:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "product_id", "purchase_id", "qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY
   WHERE "product_id" = 6520
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **For Product ID 4280:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "product_id", "purchase_id", "qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY
   WHERE "product_id" = 4280
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

**Notes:**

- **Numeric Values:** Since `"product_id"` is a numeric column (e.g., `NUMBER(38,0)` as per the DDL), you should not enclose the value in single quotes. Use the numeric value directly.
- **String Values:** If you were filtering on a string/text column, you would enclose the value in single quotes.
- **Placeholders:** In SQL scripts, placeholders are often used for illustrative purposes. When executing the query, you must replace them with actual values.

**Why This Works:**

By specifying the actual `product_id`, the SQL query can correctly filter the records in the `INVENTORY` table where the `"product_id"` matches the given value.

**Example Execution:**

Let's assume you execute the corrected query for product ID `6520`:

```sql
SELECT "id", "product_id", "purchase_id", "qty"
FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY
WHERE "product_id" = 6520
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Possible Results:**

```csv
id,product_id,purchase_id,qty
101,6520,201,50.0
102,6520,202,30.0
103,6520,203,20.0
...
```

**Next Steps:**

After retrieving the inventory entries for each product, you can proceed to:

- **Order the Results by Purchase Date (FIFO):** To apply the FIFO method, you may need to join the `INVENTORY` and `PURCHASES` tables and sort by the purchase date.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT i."id", i."product_id", i."purchase_id", i."qty", p."purchased"
  FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY i
  JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES p ON i."purchase_id" = p."id"
  WHERE i."product_id" = 6520
  ORDER BY p."purchased" ASC
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```
  
- **Calculate the Average Units Picked per Batch:** Use the retrieved data to compute the average units picked for each product based on the FIFO allocation.

**Summary:**

- Replace `[product_id]` with the actual product IDs in your queries.
- Ensure numeric values are not enclosed in quotes in SQL.
- Use the corrected queries to retrieve and analyze the necessary data for your task.

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

To retrieve purchases for **product ID 6520**:

```sql
SELECT "id", "purchased", "qty"
FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES
WHERE "product_id" = 6520
ORDER BY "purchased" ASC
LIMIT 1000;
```

To retrieve purchases for **product ID 4280**:

```sql
SELECT "id", "purchased", "qty"
FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES
WHERE "product_id" = 4280
ORDER BY "purchased" ASC
LIMIT 1000;
```

To retrieve purchases for **both product IDs 6520 and 4280**:

```sql
SELECT "id", "purchased", "qty"
FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES
WHERE "product_id" IN (6520, 4280)
ORDER BY "product_id", "purchased" ASC
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Replace the Placeholder:** Remove `[product_id]` and insert the actual product ID(s) you're interested in.
  
  - **Single Product ID:** Use `= 6520` or `= 4280` if querying for one product.
  - **Multiple Product IDs:** Use `IN (6520, 4280)` to include multiple products.

- **Numeric Values:** Since `"product_id"` is a numeric column (`NUMBER(38,0)`), do **not** enclose the values in quotes.

**Example Execution:**

Assuming you run the corrected query for product ID `6520`:

```sql
SELECT "id", "purchased", "qty"
FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES
WHERE "product_id" = 6520
ORDER BY "purchased" ASC
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Possible Results:**

```csv
id,purchased,qty
729,2018-02-26,100.0
739,2018-04-26,200.0
749,2018-06-26,70.0
759,2018-08-26,100.0
769,2018-10-26,72.0
779,2018-12-26,43.0
```

**Note:** Replace `6520` with `4280` to get results for the other product, or use the `IN` clause to get results for both.

---

**Why This Works:**

By providing the actual `product_id` values, the SQL query can correctly filter the records in the `PURCHASES` table where the `"product_id"` matches the given value(s), allowing the query to execute successfully.

**Next Steps:**

- **Retrieve Purchase Data:** Now that the query is corrected, you can retrieve purchase data for the products in question.
- **Apply FIFO Method:** Use the purchase dates and quantities to simulate the FIFO allocation when calculating the average number of units picked per product.
- **Proceed with Analysis:** With the data retrieved, you can proceed to compute the required averages as per your original task.

---

**Summary:**

- **Error Fixed:** Replaced `[product_id]` with actual product IDs.
- **Queries Corrected:** Provided corrected SQL queries for single and multiple product IDs.
- **Execution Ready:** You can now run these queries without encountering the `invalid identifier` error.

**Key Points:**

- **Remove Square Brackets:** The square brackets around `product_id` are not valid in SQL queries. They are sometimes used in documentation to indicate placeholders for you to replace with actual values.
- **Replace with Actual Values:** Substitute `[product_id]` with the actual product IDs you are querying.

---

**General Advice:**

- **Placeholders in SQL:** If you need to parameterize queries (e.g., in application code), you should use parameterized queries provided by your programming language's database library. In raw SQL scripts, you need to provide the actual values.
- **Error Messages:** When you see an `invalid identifier` error, it's often due to referencing a column or variable name that doesn't exist or is misspelled.

---

**Other Corrected Queries:**

Since you asked to correct other SQL statements with similar issues, here are the corrected versions:

1. **Sum of Quantities for Each Product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY
   WHERE "product_id" IN (6520, 4280)
   GROUP BY "product_id";
   ```

2. **Inventory for Specific Product IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", i."purchase_id", p."purchased", i."qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY i
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES p ON i."purchase_id" = p."id"
   WHERE i."product_id" IN (6520, 4280)
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Inventory Ordered by Purchase Date for Specific Products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."id", i."product_id", i."purchase_id", i."qty", p."purchased"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY i
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES p ON i."purchase_id" = p."id"
   WHERE i."product_id" IN (6520, 4280)
   ORDER BY i."product_id", p."purchased" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Purchases for Specific Products Ordered by Date:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "product_id", "purchased", "qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES
   WHERE "product_id" IN (6520, 4280)
   ORDER BY "product_id", "purchased" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

---

**Summary:**

- Replace `[product_id]` with actual product IDs (e.g., `6520`, `4280`).
- Ensure that all identifiers and values are correctly specified in your SQL queries.
- If you're querying for multiple products, use the `IN` clause with a list of product IDs.

**Relevant Tables and Columns**

- **PICKING_LINE**

  - `"order_id"`: To find picking lines associated with order 421.
  - `"product_id"`: To identify which products were picked.
  - `"qty"`: Quantity picked for each product.
  - `"line_no"`: May help in identifying individual picking line entries.

- **INVENTORY**

  - `"product_id"`: To match products picked.
  - `"purchase_id"`: To link inventory records to purchases (for FIFO allocation).
  - `"qty"`: Quantity available in each inventory entry.

- **PURCHASES**

  - `"id"`: Purchase identifier, linked to inventory via `"purchase_id"`.
  - `"product_id"`: To match products.
  - `"purchased"`: Purchase date, to determine FIFO order.
  - `"qty"`: Quantity purchased.

- **PRODUCTS**

  - `"id"`: Product identifier.
  - `"name"`: Product name, for readability.

- **ORDERLINES**

  - `"order_id"`: To verify ordered quantities.
  - `"product_id"`: Products ordered.
  - `"qty"`: Quantity ordered for each product.

**Conditions That May Be Used**

- `"order_id" = 421` in `PICKING_LINE` and `ORDERLINES` to focus on the specific order.
- `"product_id" IN (...)` to filter products picked or ordered.
- Ordering `"purchased"` dates in `PURCHASES` to apply FIFO logic.

**SQL Queries**

1. **Get the products picked for order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PICKING_LINE
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Get the quantities picked for each product in order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", "qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PICKING_LINE
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Get detailed picking lines for order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "picklist_id", "line_no", "product_id", "qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PICKING_LINE
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Get order lines from ORDERLINES for order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", "qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.ORDERLINES
   WHERE "order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Get all inventory entries for a specific product (replace `[product_id]` with actual ID):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "product_id", "purchase_id", "qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY
   WHERE "product_id" = [product_id]
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List all purchases for a specific product, ordered by purchase date (FIFO):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "purchased", "qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES
   WHERE "product_id" = [product_id]
   ORDER BY "purchased" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Get total inventory quantity for a product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT SUM("qty") AS "total_qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY
   WHERE "product_id" = [product_id];
   ```

8. **Get product names from PRODUCTS table for products picked in order 421:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."id", p."name"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PRODUCTS p
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PICKING_LINE pl ON p."id" = pl."product_id"
   WHERE pl."order_id" = 421
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Get purchase dates and quantities for inventory items (for FIFO):**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", i."purchase_id", p."purchased", i."qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY i
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES p ON i."purchase_id" = p."id"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Check the ordered quantities from ORDERLINES for comparison:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", "qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.ORDERLINES
    WHERE "order_id" = 421
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Get all inventory entries, ordered by purchase date (FIFO):**

    ```sql
    SELECT i."id", i."product_id", i."purchase_id", i."qty", p."purchased"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY i
    JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES p ON i."purchase_id" = p."id"
    ORDER BY p."purchased" ASC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Get picking list IDs associated with order 421:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "picklist_id"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PICKING_LINE
    WHERE "order_id" = 421
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Get details of purchases (purchase date and quantity):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "product_id", "purchased", "qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PURCHASES
    ORDER BY "purchased" ASC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Get all products from PRODUCTS table:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "name"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PRODUCTS
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Get inventory quantities for all products:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.INVENTORY
    GROUP BY "product_id"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

By running these queries, we can gain an understanding of the data in the relevant tables and columns, which will help in addressing the original task.

**Note:** For queries where `[product_id]` is mentioned, you should replace `[product_id]` with actual product IDs retrieved from previous queries (e.g., products picked for order 421).Query:

Task: Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine which products were picked for order 421 and the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method, we first identify all picking lines associated with order 421 from the `PICKING_LINE` table. Then, we simulate the allocation of picked quantities to inventory batches from the `INVENTORY` table, prioritizing the earliest purchases (FIFO). Finally, we calculate the average number of units picked per inventory batch for each product.

```csv
product_id,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,average_units2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 21:28:03 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine which products were picked for order 421 and the average number of units picked for each product using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method, we first identify all picking lines associated with order 421 from the `PICKING_LINE` table. Then, we simulate the allocation of picked quantities to inventory batches from the `INVENTORY` table, prioritizing the earliest purchases (FIFO). Finally, we calculate the average number of units picked per inventory batch for each product.

```csv
product_id,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,average_units2:float
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
