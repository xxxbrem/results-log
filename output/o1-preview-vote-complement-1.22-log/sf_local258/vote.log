After reviewing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL script that accurately computes the total wickets taken by each bowler, their economy rate, their strike rate, and their best performance in a single match (formatted as "wickets-runs") while ignoring the extra runs data is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Explanation:**

- **Total Wickets:** The script counts the wickets taken by each bowler by joining the `BALL_BY_BALL` and `WICKET_TAKEN` tables. It filters the types of dismissals to include only those credited to the bowler (e.g., 'bowled', 'caught', 'lbw', 'stumped', 'hit wicket') and excludes dismissals like 'run out', which are not credited to the bowler.

- **Economy Rate:** It calculates the economy rate by dividing the total runs conceded (from the `BATSMAN_SCORED` table) by the total overs bowled. It considers only the runs scored off the bat and ignores extra runs from the `EXTRA_RUNS` table, as per the instruction to "ignore the extra runs data".

- **Strike Rate:** The strike rate is accurately calculated as the number of balls bowled divided by the number of wickets taken, providing a measure of how many balls, on average, a bowler takes to get a wicket.

- **Best Performance:** The script determines each bowler's best performance in a single match by selecting the match where they took the most wickets with the least runs conceded, formatted as "wickets-runs".

Therefore, `1result.sql` effectively meets all the requirements of the task by correctly calculating the total wickets, economy rate, strike rate, and best performance for each bowler while appropriately ignoring extra runs data.
