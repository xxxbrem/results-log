After reviewing both SQL queries and their respective results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice for the following reasons:

1. **Geographic Accuracy**: 
   - **`1result.sql`** filters complaints based on latitude and longitude coordinates that specifically cover the area around **JFK Airport** (latitude between 40.6 and 40.7, longitude between -73.8 and -73.75). This ensures that only complaints relevant to the JFK Airport vicinity are included.
   - **`0result.sql`** filters complaints by the entire **Queens borough**, which is a much larger area and includes complaints not pertinent to the JFK Airport area.

2. **Station Identification**: 
   - **`1result.sql`** accurately selects wind speed data from the JFK Airport weather station using both the **"stn"** and **"wban"** identifiers (`'744860'` and `'94789'` respectively), ensuring precise matching.
   - **`0result.sql`** only uses the **"stn"** identifier, which might include data from other nearby stations if not uniquely combined with the **"wban"** code.

3. **Data Alignment**:
   - Both queries consider data from **2011 to 2020**, but **`1result.sql`** aligns the complaints data and wind speed data more precisely by focusing on the exact location and ensuring that both datasets cover the same dates and areas.

4. **Correlation Calculation**:
   - **`1result.sql`** computes the correlation between daily complaint counts and wind speed specifically for the area around JFK Airport, leading to more accurate and relevant correlation values.
   - The results provided in **`1result.csv`** show the strongest positive and negative correlations with specific complaint types that have over 3000 complaints, as required.

5. **Results**:
   - The output in **`1result.csv`** identifies **"HEAT/HOT WATER"** complaints with the strongest positive correlation (`0.3242`) and **"Unsanitary Condition"** complaints with the strongest negative correlation (`-0.4160`) with wind speed around JFK Airport.
   - These findings are consistent with expectations, as certain complaint types may be influenced by weather conditions like wind speed.

**Therefore, the correct SQL file that addresses the task accurately is:**

```plaintext
1result.sql
