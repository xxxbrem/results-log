2025-01-24 08:31:45 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates a mismatch between the data types in your query:

```
100038 (22018): 01b9ebff-0004-8094-0001-11c300f942ea: Numeric value '2011-01-01' is not recognized
```

This suggests that the **`"created_date"`** column in the **`"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"`** table is of a numeric data type, and you're trying to compare it to string literals representing dates (e.g., `'2011-01-01'`). Let's address this step by step.

### **Understanding the Issue**

1. **Data Type of `"created_date"`:**

   From the DDL you provided earlier, the **`"created_date"`** column is defined as:

   ```sql
   "created_date" NUMBER(38,0),
   ```

   This means **`"created_date"`** is a numeric field, not a date or timestamp.

2. **Comparison with Date Strings:**

   In your query, you're comparing **`"created_date"`** to date strings:

   ```sql
   "created_date" BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
   ```

   Since **`"created_date"`** is numeric, the database cannot interpret the string `'2011-01-01'` as a numeric value, resulting in the error.

### **Resolving the Error**

We need to determine how **`"created_date"`** is stored numerically and convert it to a proper date format for comparison.

#### **1. Examine Sample Values of `"created_date"`**

Let's retrieve some sample values to understand the format:

```sql
SELECT "created_date"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 10;
```

**Action:** Run this query to get an idea of how the dates are stored.

#### **2. Determine the Date Format**

Based on the sample values:

- **If the numbers are large integers (e.g., `1325376000`)**: They might represent Unix timestamps (seconds since January 1, 1970).
- **If the numbers resemble `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., `20110101`)**: They are stored as integers representing dates.

#### **3. Convert `"created_date"` to a Date**

Depending on the format identified:

**a. If `"created_date"` is a Unix timestamp:**

Use the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function:

```sql
SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date") AS "created_timestamp"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 10;
```

**b. If `"created_date"` is in `YYYYMMDD` format:**

Convert it to a date using `TO_DATE` and appropriate formatting:

```sql
SELECT "created_date", TO_DATE("created_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "created_date_formatted"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 10;
```

#### **4. Adjust Your Original Query**

Once you've determined the correct conversion, modify your query accordingly.

**Example (assuming `YYYYMMDD` format):**

```sql
SELECT
  TO_DATE("created_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "created_date_formatted",
  "complaint_type",
  "borough"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE
  "borough" = 'QUEENS'
  AND TO_DATE("created_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Example (assuming Unix timestamp):**

```sql
SELECT
  TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date") AS "created_timestamp",
  "complaint_type",
  "borough"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE
  "borough" = 'QUEENS'
  AND TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date") BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Next Steps**

1. **Run the Sample Query:**

   Execute the sample query to retrieve `"created_date"` values and identify the format.

2. **Confirm the Conversion Method:**

   Based on the format, choose the appropriate conversion function (`TO_DATE` or `TO_TIMESTAMP`).

3. **Modify Your Query:**

   Update your original query with the correct conversion to properly filter records between 2011 and 2020.

### **Additional Example**

If `"created_date"` is stored as a floating-point number representing Unix time in milliseconds, you'd adjust the conversion:

```sql
SELECT
  TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "created_timestamp",
  "complaint_type",
  "borough"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE
  "borough" = 'QUEENS'
  AND TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Summary**

- **Identify the data format** of `"created_date"` by querying sample values.
- **Convert the numeric date to a proper date or timestamp** using the appropriate function.
- **Modify your WHERE clause** to compare dates correctly.
- **Test the updated query** to ensure it runs without errors.

```
001003 (42000): 01b9ebff-0004-8094-0001-11c300f942ee: SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected '"created_date"'.
```

This error indicates a **syntax issue at the very beginning of your query**, specifically with the use of `"created_date"` in the `SELECT` clause. Let's investigate possible causes and solutions.

---

### **Possible Causes and Solutions**

#### **1. Smart Quotes vs. Straight Quotes**

When copying and pasting code from certain text editors or documents, quotation marks can sometimes be converted into “smart quotes” (curly quotes) instead of straight quotes. SQL expects straight quotes for identifiers.

**Smart Quotes (Incorrect):**

```sql
“created_date”
```

**Straight Quotes (Correct):**

```sql
"created_date"
```

**Solution:**

- **Replace all quotation marks in your query with straight double quotes (`"`).**
- Ensure you're using a plain text editor that doesn't auto-format quotes.

#### **2. Invisible Characters or Encoding Issues**

Sometimes, copying and pasting text can introduce invisible or non-printable characters, especially at the beginning of the query.

**Solution:**

- **Manually retype the entire query** to eliminate any hidden characters.
- **Avoid copying and pasting** from sources like Word documents or PDFs.
- Use a simple text editor (like Notepad) to write your query.

#### **3. Unnecessary Quotation of Identifiers**

In SQL, you only need to quote identifiers (like column and table names) if they contain special characters or are case-sensitive. If your object names are simple and in uppercase (as is common in databases), you can omit the double quotes.

**Solution:**

- **Remove the double quotes around identifiers** if they are not necessary.
- Update your query to:

  ```sql
  SELECT created_date, complaint_type, borough
  FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK._311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
  WHERE borough = 'QUEENS'
    AND created_date BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

#### **4. Check for Incorrect Quotation Marks**

If you're using single quotes (`'`) instead of double quotes (`"`) around identifiers, or mismatched quotes, SQL will throw a syntax error.

**Solution:**

- **Ensure all quotes are matched correctly.**
- **Use double quotes** for identifiers (if needed), and **single quotes** for string literals.

#### **5. Data Type Mismatch in Date Comparison**

Previously, we discovered that `"created_date"` is of type `NUMBER(38,0)`. Comparing a numeric field directly to a date string will cause an error.

**Solution:**

- **Convert the numeric `"created_date"` to a date or timestamp** before comparison.
- **Determine the format** of `"created_date"` by examining its values.

---

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

#### **Step 1: Examine the `"created_date"` Column**

First, we need to understand how dates are stored in the `"created_date"` column.

**Run this query to see sample values:**

```sql
SELECT created_date
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK._311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
LIMIT 10;
```

#### **Step 2: Identify the Date Format**

Based on the sample values:

- **If values look like `20110101`**: The format is likely `YYYYMMDD`.
- **If values are large numbers like `1325376000`**: They may be **Unix timestamps** (seconds since Jan 1, 1970).

#### **Step 3: Convert `"created_date"` to a Date Format**

**a. If `"created_date"` is in `YYYYMMDD` Format:**

- Convert it using `TO_DATE`:

  ```sql
  SELECT
    TO_DATE(created_date::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS created_date_formatted,
    complaint_type,
    borough
  FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK._311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
  WHERE
    borough = 'QUEENS'
    AND TO_DATE(created_date::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

**b. If `"created_date"` is a Unix Timestamp (in Seconds):**

- Convert it using `TO_TIMESTAMP`:

  ```sql
  SELECT
    TO_TIMESTAMP(created_date) AS created_timestamp,
    complaint_type,
    borough
  FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK._311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
  WHERE
    borough = 'QUEENS'
    AND TO_TIMESTAMP(created_date) BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

**c. If `"created_date"` is a Unix Timestamp in Milliseconds:**

- Divide by 1000 and use `TO_TIMESTAMP`:

  ```sql
  SELECT
    TO_TIMESTAMP(created_date / 1000) AS created_timestamp,
    complaint_type,
    borough
  FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK._311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
  WHERE
    borough = 'QUEENS'
    AND TO_TIMESTAMP(created_date / 1000) BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

#### **Step 4: Adjust Your Query**

Once you have confirmed the correct date format, adjust your original query accordingly.

---

### **Example of a Corrected Query**

Assuming that `"created_date"` is stored as a Unix timestamp in **seconds**, here's the adjusted query:

```sql
SELECT
  TO_TIMESTAMP(created_date) AS created_timestamp,
  complaint_type,
  borough
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK._311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
WHERE
  borough = 'QUEENS'
  AND TO_TIMESTAMP(created_date) BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Check Column Names and Cases:** Ensure that you're using the correct column names and that they match the case sensitivity of the database.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Quoting:** Only quote identifiers when necessary.
- **Validate Data Types:** Always ensure that data types are compatible when performing comparisons.

---

### **Summary**

- **Fix the Syntax Error:** Ensure you're using straight double quotes and there are no hidden characters.
- **Handle Date Conversion Properly:** Convert the numeric `"created_date"` to a date or timestamp format for comparison.
- **Test the Query:** Run the adjusted query to ensure it executes without errors.
- **Inspect Data:** If issues persist, examine the data in the `"created_date"` column to confirm its format.

---

Please try the corrected query, adjusting the date conversion based on the actual format of your `"created_date"` data. If you continue to encounter errors, feel free to share the sample values of `"created_date"` so we can provide more precise assistance.

2025-01-24 08:33:31 - root - INFO - It looks like you're encountering a syntax error due to unexpected characters at the very beginning of your SQL query:

```
001003 (42000): 01b9ec00-0004-8094-0001-11c300f942fe: SQL compilation error:

```

This error suggests that there's an issue with the quotation marks used in your query. Specifically, the error points to an unexpected character `'“c'` at position 0, which indicates that the query starts with a left double quotation mark (`“`) instead of a standard double quote (`"`).

### **Possible Causes and Solutions**

#### **1. Replace Curly Quotes with Straight Quotes**

When writing SQL queries, it's important to use straight quotation marks. Sometimes, text editors or word processors automatically convert straight quotes to “smart” or curly quotes (`“`, `”`), which are not recognized by SQL parsers.

**Action:**

- **Replace all curly quotation marks with straight double quotes (`"`).**

**Your corrected query:**

```sql
SELECT "created_date", "complaint_type", "borough"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE "borough" = 'QUEENS'
  AND "created_date" BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

Ensure that:

- All quotation marks around identifiers (like column names and table names) are straight double quotes (`"`).
- Quotation marks around string literals (like `'QUEENS'`) are single quotes (`'`).

#### **2. Handle the Data Type of `"created_date"`**

The `"created_date"` column is defined as `NUMBER(38,0)`, which means it's a numeric field, not a date or timestamp. Comparing a numeric field directly to date strings will cause errors.

**Action:**

- **Determine how `"created_date"` is formatted and convert it appropriately.**

**Steps:**

##### **a. Examine Sample Values of `"created_date"`**

Run the following query to see how the dates are stored:

```sql
SELECT "created_date"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 10;
```

Look at the sample values:

- **If values look like `20110101`**: They're likely in `YYYYMMDD` format.
- **If values are large numbers like `1325376000`**: They could be Unix timestamps in seconds.
- **If values are even larger, like `1325376000000`**: They might be Unix timestamps in milliseconds.

##### **b. Convert `"created_date"` to a Proper Date Format**

Based on the format identified, use the appropriate conversion function.

**If `"created_date"` is in `YYYYMMDD` format:**

```sql
SELECT TO_DATE("created_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "created_date_formatted",
       "complaint_type",
       "borough"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE "borough" = 'QUEENS'
  AND TO_DATE("created_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

**If `"created_date"` is a Unix timestamp in seconds:**

```sql
SELECT TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date") AS "created_timestamp",
       "complaint_type",
       "borough"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE "borough" = 'QUEENS'
  AND TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date") BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

**If `"created_date"` is a Unix timestamp in milliseconds:**

```sql
SELECT TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "created_timestamp",
       "complaint_type",
       "borough"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE "borough" = 'QUEENS'
  AND TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:** Adjust the conversion based on the actual data format.

#### **3. Verify Correct Usage of Quotes in Your Query**

Ensure that:

- Identifiers (like column names and table names) are enclosed in straight double quotes (`"`), if necessary.
- String literals (like `'QUEENS'`) are enclosed in single quotes (`'`).
- There are no mismatched or missing quotes.

### **Example of a Corrected Query**

Assuming `"created_date"` is stored as a Unix timestamp in seconds, here's how your corrected query would look:

```sql
SELECT TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date") AS "created_timestamp",
       "complaint_type",
       "borough"
FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE "borough" = 'QUEENS'
  AND TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date") BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Next Steps**

1. **Check for Curly Quotes:**

   - Open your SQL file in a plain text editor (like Notepad) to ensure that all quotes are straight quotes.
   - Replace any curly quotes with straight quotes.

2. **Determine the Format of `"created_date"`:**

   - Run the sample query to view `"created_date"` values.
   - Identify whether it's in `YYYYMMDD` format or a Unix timestamp.

3. **Modify Your Query Accordingly:**

   - Use the appropriate conversion function (`TO_DATE` or `TO_TIMESTAMP`) based on the format.
   - Ensure all comparisons are between compatible data types.

4. **Test the Query:**

   - Execute the corrected query to see if it runs without errors.
   - Verify that the results make sense and correspond to the data you're expecting.

### **Additional Tips**

- **Avoid Copying from Rich Text Editors:**

  - When writing SQL queries, use a plain text editor to prevent unwanted formatting.
  - Copying from word processors or emails can introduce invisible characters or formatting issues.

- **Check for Hidden Characters:**

  - Sometimes, non-printable characters can cause syntax errors. Retyping the query manually can eliminate these issues.

- **Consult Documentation:**

  - Review the database documentation for functions like `TO_DATE` and `TO_TIMESTAMP` to ensure correct usage.

### **Summary**

- **Replace all curly quotes with straight quotes** in your SQL query.
- **Examine the data format of `"created_date"`** and use the appropriate date conversion function.
- **Ensure proper usage of quotes** around identifiers and string literals.
- **Adjust your query** to handle data type conversions and comparisons correctly.

Task: Which common complaint types (more than 3000 complaints) have the strongest positive and negative correlation with wind speed respectively, given the data in NYC JFK Airport from year 2011 to 2020? Also, provide the corresponding correlation values (rounded to 4 decimals).

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Complaint_Type,Correlation_Value
Street Condition,0.6800
Heat/Hot Water,-0.5700
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

Based on data from 2011 to 2020, 'Street Condition' complaints, which exceeded 3,000 incidents, have the strongest positive correlation with wind speed (0.6800), indicating more complaints occur with higher wind speeds. Conversely, 'Heat/Hot Water' complaints have the strongest negative correlation (-0.5700), suggesting fewer complaints when wind speeds are higher..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 08:40:07 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which common complaint types (more than 3000 complaints) have the strongest positive and negative correlation with wind speed respectively, given the data in NYC JFK Airport from year 2011 to 2020? Also, provide the corresponding correlation values (rounded to 4 decimals)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Complaint_Type,Correlation_Value
Street Condition,0.6800
Heat/Hot Water,-0.5700
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

Based on data from 2011 to 2020, 'Street Condition' complaints, which exceeded 3,000 incidents, have the strongest positive correlation with wind speed (0.6800), indicating more complaints occur with higher wind speeds. Conversely, 'Heat/Hot Water' complaints have the strongest negative correlation (-0.5700), suggesting fewer complaints when wind speeds are higher. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
