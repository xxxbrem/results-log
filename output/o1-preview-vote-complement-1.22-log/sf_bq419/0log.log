Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task of identifying the **5 states** with the most storm events from **1980 to 1995**, considering only the top 1000 states with the highest event counts each year (noting that there are only 50 states), the following tables and columns are relevant:

---

### **Relevant Tables and Columns**

**Tables:**
- **NOAA_DATA.NOAA_HISTORIC_SEVERE_STORMS**
  - `"STORMS_1980"`
  - `"STORMS_1981"`
  - `"STORMS_1982"`
  - `"STORMS_1983"`
  - `"STORMS_1984"`
  - `"STORMS_1985"`
  - `"STORMS_1986"`
  - `"STORMS_1987"`
  - `"STORMS_1988"`
  - `"STORMS_1989"`
  - `"STORMS_1990"`
  - `"STORMS_1991"`
  - `"STORMS_1992"`
  - `"STORMS_1993"`
  - `"STORMS_1994"`
  - `"STORMS_1995"`
  
**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `"state"`: Contains state abbreviations where events occurred. **Potential usage**: Grouping and counting events by state.
- `"event_id"`: Unique identifier for each event. **Potential usage**: Counting the number of events.
- `"event_begin_time"`: Start time of the event. **Potential usage**: Verifying event dates if needed.
- `"event_type"`: Type of storm event. **Potential usage**: Filtering by specific event types if necessary.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filtering events between **1980 and 1995** by selecting data from the respective yearly tables.
- Grouping events by `"state"` to count the number of events per state.
- Ordering results by event counts in descending order to identify states with the most events.
- Limiting results to the **top 1000 states** per year (though with only 50 states, all states are included).
- Using state abbreviations for consistency.

Task: Which 5 states had the most storm events from 1980 to 1995, considering only the top 1000 states with the highest event counts each year? Please use state abbreviations.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Could you please clarify what you mean by "considering only the top 1000 states with the highest event counts each year"? Since there are only 50 states, I want to ensure I understand your request correctly to provide an accurate answer..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 11:47:26 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which 5 states had the most storm events from 1980 to 1995, considering only the top 1000 states with the highest event counts each year? Please use state abbreviations., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Could you please clarify what you mean by "considering only the top 1000 states with the highest event counts each year"? Since there are only 50 states, I want to ensure I understand your request correctly to provide an accurate answer. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
