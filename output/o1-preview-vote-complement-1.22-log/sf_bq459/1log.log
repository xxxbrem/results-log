1cc962ab-2f49-46d8-940f-0bfa1a15a2cc,Distinct ERP profiles for auditory processing in infants at-risk for autism and language impairment,2018-01-15,"Early identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is crucial for the formulation of effective intervention programs. Language deficits may be a hallmark feature of ASD and language delay observed in ASD shows striking similarities to that observed in children with language impairment (LI). Auditory processing deficits are seen in both LI and ASD, however, they have not previously been compared directly using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) in the two at-risk populations. This study aims to characterize infants at-risk for ASD (HR-ASD) at the electrophysiological level and to compare them with infants at-risk for LI (HR-LI) and controls, to find specific markers with predictive value. At 12-month-old, auditory processing in HR-ASD, HR-LI and controls was characterized via ERP oddball paradigm. All infants were then evaluated at 20 months, to investigate the associations between auditory processing and language/ASD-related outcomes. In both HR-ASD and HR-LI, mismatch response latency was delayed compared to controls, whereas only HR-ASD showed overall larger P3 amplitude compared to controls. Interestingly, these ERP measures correlated with later expressive vocabulary and M-CHAT critical items in the whole sample. These results may support the use of objective measurement of auditory processing to delineate pathophysiological mechanisms in ASD, as compared to LI."
e2e96c82-6a79-4522-b9b7-ffc0afe85ff9,Exploratory study examining the at-home feasibility of a wearable tool for social-affective learning in children with autism,2018-08-02,"Although standard behavioral interventions for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are effective therapies for social deficits, they face criticism for being time-intensive and overdependent on specialists. Earlier starting age of therapy is a strong predictor of later success, but waitlists for therapies can be 18 months long. To address these complications, we developed Superpower Glass, a machine-learning-assisted software system that runs on Google Glass and an Android smartphone, designed for use during social interactions. This pilot exploratory study examines our prototype tool’s potential for social-affective learning for children with autism. We sent our tool home with 14 families and assessed changes from intake to conclusion through the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), a facial affect recognition task (EGG), and qualitative parent reports. A repeated-measures one-way ANOVA demonstrated a decrease in SRS-2 total scores by an average 7.14 points (F(1,13) = 33.20, p = <.001, higher scores indicate higher ASD severity). EGG scores also increased by an average 9.55 correct responses (F(1,10) = 11.89, p = <.01). Parents reported increased eye contact and greater social acuity. This feasibility study supports using mobile technologies for potential therapeutic purposes."
16820688-6ed4-42eb-86d6-83a9938b68ee,Glutathione and glutamate in schizophrenia: a 7T MRS study,2018-06-22,"In schizophrenia, abnormal neural metabolite concentrations may arise from cortical damage following neuroinflammatory processes implicated in acute episodes. Inflammation is associated with increased glutamate, whereas the antioxidant glutathione may protect against inflammation-induced oxidative stress. We hypothesized that patients with stable schizophrenia would exhibit a reduction in glutathione, glutamate, and/or glutamine in the cerebral cortex, consistent with a post-inflammatory response, and that this reduction would be most marked in patients with “residual schizophrenia”, in whom an early stage with positive psychotic symptoms has progressed to a late stage characterized by long-term negative symptoms and impairments. We recruited 28 patients with stable schizophrenia and 45 healthy participants matched for age, gender, and parental socio-economic status. We measured glutathione, glutamate and glutamine concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left insula, and visual cortex using 7T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Glutathione and glutamate were significantly correlated in all three voxels. Glutamine concentrations across the three voxels were significantly correlated with each other. Principal components analysis (PCA) produced three clear components: an ACC glutathione–glutamate component; an insula-visual glutathione–glutamate component; and a glutamine component. Patients with stable schizophrenia had significantly lower scores on the ACC glutathione–glutamate component, an effect almost entirely leveraged by the sub-group of patients with residual schizophrenia. All three metabolite concentration values in the ACC were significantly reduced in this group. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that excitotoxicity during the acute phase of illness leads to reduced glutathione

b6eaa029-f1bb-4af3-9aa8-a34f2e554159,"Depressive disorders are frequently managed with long-term use of antidepressant medication. Fluoxetine (FLX) is the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to be widely available for the treatment of depression. The present study focuses on the effects and mechanisms of the lipid metabolism abnormalities caused by FLX in patients and in a mouse model of depression. Depression severity was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) serum levels were assessed in 28 patients with depression, aged 31.2±3.3 years, treated with FLX (20 to 60 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Meanwhile, the serum levels of other lipid metabolism-related parameters, such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB), were also determined. The infiuence of FLX on the hepatic lipid profile and hepatic gene expression of both lipogenic and lipolytic enzymes was evaluated in a mouse model of depression treated with FLX (10 mg·kg−1·d−1, ip) for 4 weeks. We showed that the serum TG, TC and LDL levels were significantly increased in patients with depression after FLX treatment. The elevation in serum TG levels in the patients was not affected by gender or family history. FLX treatment did not significantly alter serum HDL, APOA1 or APOB levels in the patients. We further demonstrated in mice with depression that FLX treatment increased the hepatic TG level by increasing the expression of lipogenic enzymes and decreasing the expression of lipolytic enzymes in the liver. Antidepressive therapy with FLX is associated with lipid metabolism abnormalities, which are in part mediated by disturbances in hepatic lipid metabolism homeostasis. The findings contribute to the uncovering of metabolic adverse reactions in the pharmacological therapy of depression."
93ea16cb-04cb-4c23-a2b1-ccc77f20c62b,"Action selection in the basal ganglia is often described within the framework of a standard model, associating low dopaminergic drive with motor suppression. Whilst powerful, this model does not explain several clinical and experimental data, including varying therapeutic efficacy across movement disorders. We tested the predictions of this model in patients with Parkinson’s disease, on and off subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS), focussing on adaptive sensory-motor responses to a changing environment and maintenance of an action until it is no longer suitable. Surprisingly, we observed prolonged perseverance under on-stimulation, and high inter-individual variability in terms of the motor selections performed when comparing the two conditions. To account for these data, we revised the standard model exploring its space of parameters and associated motor functions and found that, depending on effective connectivity between external and internal parts of the globus pallidus and saliency of the sensory input, a low dopaminergic drive can result in increased, dysfunctional, motor switching, besides motor suppression. This new framework provides insight into the biophysical mechanisms underlying DBS, allowing a description in terms of alteration of the signal-to-baseline ratio in the indirect pathway, which better account of known electrophysiological data in comparison with the standard model."
5b6d294b-e3ac-4fdf-aff9-a302d49f8a21,"Adding impurities or defects destroys crystalline order. Occasionally, however, extraordinary behaviour emerges that cannot be explained by perturbing the ordered state. One example is the Kondo effect, where magnetic impurities in metals drastically alter the temperature dependence of resistivity. In Type-II superconductors, disorder generally works to pin vortices, giving zero resistivity below a critical current jc. However, peaks have been observed in the temperature and field dependences of jc. This peak effect is difficult to explain in terms of an ordered Abrikosov vortex lattice. Here we test the widespread paradigm that an order-disorder transition of the vortex ensemble drives the peak effect. Using neutron scattering to probe the vortex order in superconducting vanadium, we uncover an order-disorder transition from a quasi-long-range-ordered phase to a vortex glass. The peak effect, however, is found to lie at higher fields and temperatures, in a region where thermal fluctuations of individual vortices become significant. The disordering of the vortex lattice in a type-II superconductor is widely perceived to underpin unusual peaks in the temperature and field dependence of critical current. By contrast, here Toft-Petersen et al. find an order-disorder transition in a superconducting vanadium sample that is unconnected with peaks observed in critical current."

ba1d19c8-e235-4bf6-95ff-f2022a69e510,"Introduction
The past decade has marked an explosion of research focusing on the trillions of indigenous microorganisms residing within and throughout the human body, collectively termed the microbiota, and their interactions with the eukaryotic host. These previously ignored prokaryotic members of the ‘human holobiont’ have been recognized to provide essential functions for host physiology, including its metabolism, immunity and neuronal development, whereas aberrations in their configuration or function have been suggested to contribute to disease states1,2. Notably, unlike the host genome, the microbiome exhibits a great deal of plasticity and can readily adjust to a large variety of environmental and host-derived stimuli. Of these environmental factors, diet constitutes a pivotal determinant of gut bacterial assembly and genes, thereby rendering it a potentially compelling target of manipulation.
Human nutrition bears profound influences on both individual and population-wide health. As such, nutritional research stands at the centre of medical, economic, cultural and social focus. The concept of “let food be thy medicine” was coined by Hippocrates over 2,000 years ago, and health organizations worldwide have been striving to set standards for a ‘healthy diet’ that define the recommended intake of micronutrients, macronutrients and total calories. The WHO has issued dietary guidelines for healthy weight management, yet obesity and its comorbidities continue to constitute a pandemic, with increasing incidence in both adults and children3. Although many weight-reducing strategies are efficient in the short term, the majority of dieters regain most or all of their previous weight over an intermediate to long-term period4,5. Furthermore, dietary recommendations designed to tackle IBD6,7, IBS8, autoimmune diseases9 and cancer10,11 are often based on inconclusive, conflicting or non-existing medical evidence. The conspicuous gap between the large body of research and the lack of efficacious or conclusive guidelines thereof is a major source of confusion and frustration among dieters, which have given rise to potentially problematic nutritional trends and unsupported practices.
The evident interrelationships between diet and the microbiota and their collective effect on the host, only now beginning to be deciphered, might reconcile some of the discrepancies that have been troubling nutrition researchers and could explain some of the previously unintelligible variability encountered in the response to diet, at times observed in apparently similar conditions. In this Review, we attempt to untangle some aspects of this tripartite diet–microbiota–host crosstalk by discussing each aspect separately and consequently attempt to assemble meaningful and applicable conclusions, which could have direct translational implications. Owing to the vast body of literature, the main focus of this Review is the bacterial component of the microbiota; the role of the virome, mycome and protozoa is illustrated briefly (Boxes 1,2).
Box 1 Diet and fungi, viruses and archaea
A fascinating yet largely unexplored facet of diet–microbiome–host interactions relates to its non-bacterial members — viruses, fungi, archaea, protozoa and multicellular parasites — and the complex network of interdependencies between kingdoms within the gut microbiota. Although most data have accumulated in livestock and other animals, several associations have been made between long-term and short-term dietary patterns and the fungi or archaea in the human gut. Cross-kingdom communication might occur through the host by means of malabsorption, inflammation or bleeding, or through syntrophism, whereby waste products of one microorganism nourish another; for instance, yeast mannan can be utilized by the bacterium .

Box 2 Diet and parasitic infections
Diet might aid in the containment of parasitic infections281,282 or in modulating their severity. For instance, combinations of an elemental diet and infection by the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or the protozoa , but not each of them separately, resulted in deleterious clinical outcomes and increased histological changes to the mouse gut mucosa, and a high-protein diet improved the course of nematode infection in ruminants. Dietary constituents have been proposed to evoke host immune and metabolic transcriptional responses, such as for cinnamaldehyde and jejunal infection with in pigs. However, a more intriguing relationship between protozoa or multicellular eukaryotes and the host is mediated by the bacterial microbiota. This association was reported long before the microbiome field entered the genomic revolution and encompasses various members of the parasitome, including protozoa such as and and worms such as and helminths. This bidirectional interaction extends beyond the gastrointestinal tract, as parasites residing in the biliary tr

16820688-6ed4-42eb-86d6-83a9938b68ee,"In schizophrenia, abnormal neural metabolite concentrations may arise from cortical damage following neuroinflammatory processes implicated in acute episodes. Inflammation is associated with increased glutamate, whereas the antioxidant glutathione may protect against inflammation-induced oxidative stress. We hypothesized that patients with stable schizophrenia would exhibit a reduction in glutathione, glutamate, and/or glutamine in the cerebral cortex, consistent with a post-inflammatory response, and that this reduction would be most marked in patients with “residual schizophrenia”, in whom an early stage with positive psychotic symptoms has progressed to a late stage characterized by long-term negative symptoms and impairments. We recruited 28 patients with stable schizophrenia and 45 healthy participants matched for age, gender, and parental socio-economic status. We measured glutathione, glutamate and glutamine concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left insula, and visual cortex using 7T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Glutathione and glutamate were significantly correlated in all three voxels. Glutamine concentrations across the three voxels were significantly correlated with each other. Principal components analysis (PCA) produced three clear components: an ACC glutathione–glutamate component; an insula-visual glutathione–glutamate component; and a glutamine component. Patients with stable schizophrenia had significantly lower scores on the ACC glutathione–glutamate component, an effect almost entirely leveraged by the sub-group of patients with residual schizophrenia. All three metabolite concentration values in the ACC were significantly reduced in this group. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that excitotoxicity during the acute phase of illness leads to reduced glutathione and glutamate in the residual phase of the illness."
787bc6b7-f5cb-4add-9ad9-0bc430543ede,"Our recent study has revealed that the myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A) is involved in the apoptosis of cortical neurons induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) and histone acetyltransferase p300 (P300) are two well-known regulators for transcription factors; however, their roles in MRTF-A-related effect on neuronal injuries during I/R are still unclear. In this study, in a model rat cerebral I/R injury via middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion, we found that the expression and activity of HDAC5 was upregulated, whereas p300 and MRTF-A were downregulated both in expression and activity during I/R. Their expression changes and the interaction of the MRTF-A with HDAC5 or p300 were further verified by double immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation. In cultured neuronal apoptosis model induced by H2O2, MRTF-A exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect by enhancing the transcription of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 via CArG box binding. MRTF-A-induced anti-apoptotic effect was effectively inhibited by HDAC5, but was significantly enhanced by p300. The results suggest that both HDAC5 and p300 are involved in MRTF-A-mediated effect on neuronal apoptosis during ischemia/reperfusion injury, but with opposite effects."
f1165d80-0ee3-4d15-b203-4c76914d1c60,"A cerebral aneurysm occurs as a result of a weakened blood vessel, which allows blood to flow into a sac or a ballooned section. Recent advancement shows that a new device, ‘flow-diverter’, can divert blood flow away from the aneurysm sac. People found that a flow-diverter based on thin film nitinol (TFN), works very effectively, however there are no studies proving the mechanical safety in irregular, curved blood vessels. Here, we study the mechanical behaviors and structural safety of a novel microstructured TFN membrane through the computational and experimental studies, which establish the fundamental aspects of stretching and bending mechanics of the structure. The result shows a hyper-elastic behavior of the TFN with a negligible strain change up to 180° in bending and over 500% in radial stretching, which is ideal in the use in neurovascular curved arteries. The simulation determines the optimal joint locations between the TFN and stent frame. In vitro experimental test qualitatively demonstrates the mechanical flexibility of the flow-diverter with multi-modal bending. In vivo micro X-ray and histopathology study demonstrate that the TFN can be conformally deployed in the curved blood vessel of a swine model without any significant complications or abnormalities."

# BigQuery Tokenize Definitions

## `tokenise_no_stop`

### Description
Removes common stopwords from a text string and tokenizes the remaining content into an array of words. This function is essential for natural language processing tasks where common words (like "and", "the", etc.) that offer little value in understanding the text's meaning are filtered out to focus on more significant words.

### SQL Definition
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION `spider2-public-data`.word_vectors_us.tokenise_no_stop(text STRING)
AS (
(
    SELECT ARRAY_AGG(word) FROM UNNEST(REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL(
                                REGEXP_REPLACE(text, r'’|\'s(\W)', r'\1'),
                                r'((?:\d+(?:,\d+)*(?:\.\d+)?)+|(?:[\w])+)')) AS word
    WHERE LOWER(word) not in UNNEST(['a', 'about', 'above', 'after', 'again', 'against', 'ain', 'all', 'am', 'an', 'and', 'any', 'are', 'aren', 'arent', 'as', 'at', 'be', 'because', 'been', 'before', 'being', 'below', 'between', 'both', 'but', 'by', 'can', 'couldn', 'couldnt', 'd', 'did', 'didn', 'didnt', 'do', 'does', 'doesn', 'doesnt', 'doing', 'don', 'dont', 'down', 'during', 'each', 'few', 'for', 'from', 'further', 'had', 'hadn', 'hadnt', 'has', 'hasn', 'hasnt', 'have', 'haven', 'havent', 'having', 'he', 'her', 'here', 'hers', 'herself', 'him', 'himself', 'his', 'how', 'i', 'if', 'in', 'into', 'is', 'isn', 'isnt', 'it', 'its', 'itself', 'just', 'll', 'm', 'ma', 'me', 'mightn', 'mightnt', 'more', 'most', 'mustn', 'mustnt', 'my', 'myself', 'needn', 'neednt', 'no', 'nor', 'not', 'now', 'o', 'of', 'off', 'on', 'once', 'only', 'or', 'other', 'our', 'ours', 'ourselves', 'out', 'over', 'own', 're', 's', 'same', 'shan', 'shant', 'she', 'shes', 'should', 'shouldn', 'shouldnt', 'shouldve', 'so', 'some', 'such', 't', 'than', 'that', 'thatll', 'the', 'their', 'theirs', 'them', 'themselves', 'then', 'there', 'these', 'they', 'this', 'those', 'through', 'to', 'too', 'under', 'until', 'up', 've', 'very', 'was', 'wasn', 'wasnt', 'we', 'were', 'weren', 'werent', 'what', 'when', 'where', 'which', 'while', 'who', 'whom', 'why', 'will', 'with', 'won', 'wont', 'wouldn', 'wouldnt', 'y', 'you', 'youd', 'youll', 'your', 'youre', 'yours', 'yourself', 'yourselves', 'youve'])
    )
);
```

### Example Usage
Remove stopwords and tokenize the text from a dataset of book descriptions:
```sql
SELECT 
  book_title,
  `spider2-public-data.word_vectors_us.tokenise_no_stop`(description) AS tokenised_description
FROM 
  book_catalog;
```

## `tokenise_text`

### Description
Tokenizes text by extracting words and numerical values, including handling compound numbers and ignoring punctuation and possessive apostrophes. This function is suitable for preliminary text analysis where basic tokenization is needed without the removal of stopwords.

### SQL Definition
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION `spider2-public-data`.word_vectors_us.tokenise_text(text STRING)
AS (
(
    SELECT REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL(
              REGEXP_REPLACE(text, r'’|\'s(\W)', r'\1'),
                             r'((?:\d+(?:,\d+)*(?:\.\d+)?)+|(?:[\w])+)')
    )
);
```

### Example Usage
Tokenize user comments to analyze the frequency of words in customer feedback:
```sql
SELECT 
  comment_id,
  `spider2-public-data.word_vectors_us.tokenise_text`(user_comment) AS tokenised_comment
FROM 
  user_feedback;
```

1cc962ab-2f49-46d8-940f-0bfa1a15a2cc,Distinct ERP profiles for auditory processing in infants at-risk for autism and language impairment,2018-01-15,"Early identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is crucial for the formulation of effective intervention programs. Language deficits may be a hallmark feature of ASD and language delay observed in ASD shows striking similarities to that observed in children with language impairment (LI). Auditory processing deficits are seen in both LI and ASD, however, they have not previously been compared directly using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) in the two at-risk populations. This study aims to characterize infants at-risk for ASD (HR-ASD) at the electrophysiological level and to compare them with infants at-risk for LI (HR-LI) and controls, to find specific markers with predictive value. At 12-month-old, auditory processing in HR-ASD, HR-LI and controls was characterized via ERP oddball paradigm. All infants were then evaluated at 20 months, to investigate the associations between auditory processing and language/ASD-related outcomes. In both HR-ASD and HR-LI, mismatch response latency was delayed compared to controls, whereas only HR-ASD showed overall larger P3 amplitude compared to controls. Interestingly, these ERP measures correlated with later expressive vocabulary and M-CHAT critical items in the whole sample. These results may support the use of objective measurement of auditory processing to delineate pathophysiological mechanisms in ASD, as compared to LI."
e2e96c82-6a79-4522-b9b7-ffc0afe85ff9,Exploratory study examining the at-home feasibility of a wearable tool for social-affective learning in children with autism,2018-08-02,"Although standard behavioral interventions for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are effective therapies for social deficits, they face criticism for being time-intensive and overdependent on specialists. Earlier starting age of therapy is a strong predictor of later success, but waitlists for therapies can be 18 months long. To address these complications, we developed Superpower Glass, a machine-learning-assisted software system that runs on Google Glass and an Android smartphone, designed for use during social interactions. This pilot exploratory study examines our prototype tool’s potential for social-affective learning for children with autism. We sent our tool home with 14 families and assessed changes from intake to conclusion through the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), a facial affect recognition task (EGG), and qualitative parent reports. A repeated-measures one-way ANOVA demonstrated a decrease in SRS-2 total scores by an average 7.14 points (F(1,13) = 33.20, p = <.001, higher scores indicate higher ASD severity). EGG scores also increased by an average 9.55 correct responses (F(1,10) = 11.89, p = <.01). Parents reported increased eye contact and greater social acuity. This feasibility study supports using mobile technologies for potential therapeutic purposes."
16820688-6ed4-42eb-86d6-83a9938b68ee,Glutathione and glutamate in schizophrenia: a 7T MRS study,2018-06-22,"In schizophrenia, abnormal neural metabolite concentrations may arise from cortical damage following neuroinflammatory processes implicated in acute episodes. Inflammation is associated with increased glutamate, whereas the antioxidant glutathione may protect against inflammation-induced oxidative stress. We hypothesized that patients with stable schizophrenia would exhibit a reduction in glutathione, glutamate, and/or glutamine in the cerebral cortex, consistent with a post-inflammatory response, and that this reduction would be most marked in patients with “residual schizophrenia”, in whom an early stage with positive psychotic symptoms has progressed to a late stage characterized by long-term negative symptoms and impairments. We recruited 28 patients with stable schizophrenia and 45 healthy participants matched for age, gender, and parental socio-economic status. We measured glutathione, glutamate and glutamine concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left insula, and visual cortex using 7T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Glutathione and glutamate were significantly correlated in all three voxels. Glutamine concentrations across the three voxels were significantly correlated with each other. Principal components analysis (PCA) produced three clear components: an ACC glutathione–glutamate component; an insula-visual glutathione–glutamate component; and a glutamine component. Patients with stable schizophrenia had significantly lower scores on the ACC glutathione–glutamate component, an effect almost entirely leveraged by the sub-group of patients with residual schizophrenia. All three metabolite concentration values in the ACC were significantly reduced in this group. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that excitotoxicity during the acute phase of illness leads to reduced glutathione

b6eaa029-f1bb-4af3-9aa8-a34f2e554159,"Depressive disorders are frequently managed with long-term use of antidepressant medication. Fluoxetine (FLX) is the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to be widely available for the treatment of depression. The present study focuses on the effects and mechanisms of the lipid metabolism abnormalities caused by FLX in patients and in a mouse model of depression. Depression severity was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) serum levels were assessed in 28 patients with depression, aged 31.2±3.3 years, treated with FLX (20 to 60 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Meanwhile, the serum levels of other lipid metabolism-related parameters, such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB), were also determined. The infiuence of FLX on the hepatic lipid profile and hepatic gene expression of both lipogenic and lipolytic enzymes was evaluated in a mouse model of depression treated with FLX (10 mg·kg−1·d−1, ip) for 4 weeks. We showed that the serum TG, TC and LDL levels were significantly increased in patients with depression after FLX treatment. The elevation in serum TG levels in the patients was not affected by gender or family history. FLX treatment did not significantly alter serum HDL, APOA1 or APOB levels in the patients. We further demonstrated in mice with depression that FLX treatment increased the hepatic TG level by increasing the expression of lipogenic enzymes and decreasing the expression of lipolytic enzymes in the liver. Antidepressive therapy with FLX is associated with lipid metabolism abnormalities, which are in part mediated by disturbances in hepatic lipid metabolism homeostasis. The findings contribute to the uncovering of metabolic adverse reactions in the pharmacological therapy of depression."
93ea16cb-04cb-4c23-a2b1-ccc77f20c62b,"Action selection in the basal ganglia is often described within the framework of a standard model, associating low dopaminergic drive with motor suppression. Whilst powerful, this model does not explain several clinical and experimental data, including varying therapeutic efficacy across movement disorders. We tested the predictions of this model in patients with Parkinson’s disease, on and off subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS), focussing on adaptive sensory-motor responses to a changing environment and maintenance of an action until it is no longer suitable. Surprisingly, we observed prolonged perseverance under on-stimulation, and high inter-individual variability in terms of the motor selections performed when comparing the two conditions. To account for these data, we revised the standard model exploring its space of parameters and associated motor functions and found that, depending on effective connectivity between external and internal parts of the globus pallidus and saliency of the sensory input, a low dopaminergic drive can result in increased, dysfunctional, motor switching, besides motor suppression. This new framework provides insight into the biophysical mechanisms underlying DBS, allowing a description in terms of alteration of the signal-to-baseline ratio in the indirect pathway, which better account of known electrophysiological data in comparison with the standard model."
5b6d294b-e3ac-4fdf-aff9-a302d49f8a21,"Adding impurities or defects destroys crystalline order. Occasionally, however, extraordinary behaviour emerges that cannot be explained by perturbing the ordered state. One example is the Kondo effect, where magnetic impurities in metals drastically alter the temperature dependence of resistivity. In Type-II superconductors, disorder generally works to pin vortices, giving zero resistivity below a critical current jc. However, peaks have been observed in the temperature and field dependences of jc. This peak effect is difficult to explain in terms of an ordered Abrikosov vortex lattice. Here we test the widespread paradigm that an order-disorder transition of the vortex ensemble drives the peak effect. Using neutron scattering to probe the vortex order in superconducting vanadium, we uncover an order-disorder transition from a quasi-long-range-ordered phase to a vortex glass. The peak effect, however, is found to lie at higher fields and temperatures, in a region where thermal fluctuations of individual vortices become significant. The disordering of the vortex lattice in a type-II superconductor is widely perceived to underpin unusual peaks in the temperature and field dependence of critical current. By contrast, here Toft-Petersen et al. find an order-disorder transition in a superconducting vanadium sample that is unconnected with peaks observed in critical current."

ba1d19c8-e235-4bf6-95ff-f2022a69e510,"Introduction
The past decade has marked an explosion of research focusing on the trillions of indigenous microorganisms residing within and throughout the human body, collectively termed the microbiota, and their interactions with the eukaryotic host. These previously ignored prokaryotic members of the ‘human holobiont’ have been recognized to provide essential functions for host physiology, including its metabolism, immunity and neuronal development, whereas aberrations in their configuration or function have been suggested to contribute to disease states1,2. Notably, unlike the host genome, the microbiome exhibits a great deal of plasticity and can readily adjust to a large variety of environmental and host-derived stimuli. Of these environmental factors, diet constitutes a pivotal determinant of gut bacterial assembly and genes, thereby rendering it a potentially compelling target of manipulation.
Human nutrition bears profound influences on both individual and population-wide health. As such, nutritional research stands at the centre of medical, economic, cultural and social focus. The concept of “let food be thy medicine” was coined by Hippocrates over 2,000 years ago, and health organizations worldwide have been striving to set standards for a ‘healthy diet’ that define the recommended intake of micronutrients, macronutrients and total calories. The WHO has issued dietary guidelines for healthy weight management, yet obesity and its comorbidities continue to constitute a pandemic, with increasing incidence in both adults and children3. Although many weight-reducing strategies are efficient in the short term, the majority of dieters regain most or all of their previous weight over an intermediate to long-term period4,5. Furthermore, dietary recommendations designed to tackle IBD6,7, IBS8, autoimmune diseases9 and cancer10,11 are often based on inconclusive, conflicting or non-existing medical evidence. The conspicuous gap between the large body of research and the lack of efficacious or conclusive guidelines thereof is a major source of confusion and frustration among dieters, which have given rise to potentially problematic nutritional trends and unsupported practices.
The evident interrelationships between diet and the microbiota and their collective effect on the host, only now beginning to be deciphered, might reconcile some of the discrepancies that have been troubling nutrition researchers and could explain some of the previously unintelligible variability encountered in the response to diet, at times observed in apparently similar conditions. In this Review, we attempt to untangle some aspects of this tripartite diet–microbiota–host crosstalk by discussing each aspect separately and consequently attempt to assemble meaningful and applicable conclusions, which could have direct translational implications. Owing to the vast body of literature, the main focus of this Review is the bacterial component of the microbiota; the role of the virome, mycome and protozoa is illustrated briefly (Boxes 1,2).
Box 1 Diet and fungi, viruses and archaea
A fascinating yet largely unexplored facet of diet–microbiome–host interactions relates to its non-bacterial members — viruses, fungi, archaea, protozoa and multicellular parasites — and the complex network of interdependencies between kingdoms within the gut microbiota. Although most data have accumulated in livestock and other animals, several associations have been made between long-term and short-term dietary patterns and the fungi or archaea in the human gut. Cross-kingdom communication might occur through the host by means of malabsorption, inflammation or bleeding, or through syntrophism, whereby waste products of one microorganism nourish another; for instance, yeast mannan can be utilized by the bacterium .

Box 2 Diet and parasitic infections
Diet might aid in the containment of parasitic infections281,282 or in modulating their severity. For instance, combinations of an elemental diet and infection by the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or the protozoa , but not each of them separately, resulted in deleterious clinical outcomes and increased histological changes to the mouse gut mucosa, and a high-protein diet improved the course of nematode infection in ruminants. Dietary constituents have been proposed to evoke host immune and metabolic transcriptional responses, such as for cinnamaldehyde and jejunal infection with in pigs. However, a more intriguing relationship between protozoa or multicellular eukaryotes and the host is mediated by the bacterial microbiota. This association was reported long before the microbiome field entered the genomic revolution and encompasses various members of the parasitome, including protozoa such as and and worms such as and helminths. This bidirectional interaction extends beyond the gastrointestinal tract, as parasites residing in the biliary tr

16820688-6ed4-42eb-86d6-83a9938b68ee,"In schizophrenia, abnormal neural metabolite concentrations may arise from cortical damage following neuroinflammatory processes implicated in acute episodes. Inflammation is associated with increased glutamate, whereas the antioxidant glutathione may protect against inflammation-induced oxidative stress. We hypothesized that patients with stable schizophrenia would exhibit a reduction in glutathione, glutamate, and/or glutamine in the cerebral cortex, consistent with a post-inflammatory response, and that this reduction would be most marked in patients with “residual schizophrenia”, in whom an early stage with positive psychotic symptoms has progressed to a late stage characterized by long-term negative symptoms and impairments. We recruited 28 patients with stable schizophrenia and 45 healthy participants matched for age, gender, and parental socio-economic status. We measured glutathione, glutamate and glutamine concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left insula, and visual cortex using 7T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Glutathione and glutamate were significantly correlated in all three voxels. Glutamine concentrations across the three voxels were significantly correlated with each other. Principal components analysis (PCA) produced three clear components: an ACC glutathione–glutamate component; an insula-visual glutathione–glutamate component; and a glutamine component. Patients with stable schizophrenia had significantly lower scores on the ACC glutathione–glutamate component, an effect almost entirely leveraged by the sub-group of patients with residual schizophrenia. All three metabolite concentration values in the ACC were significantly reduced in this group. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that excitotoxicity during the acute phase of illness leads to reduced glutathione and glutamate in the residual phase of the illness."
787bc6b7-f5cb-4add-9ad9-0bc430543ede,"Our recent study has revealed that the myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A) is involved in the apoptosis of cortical neurons induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) and histone acetyltransferase p300 (P300) are two well-known regulators for transcription factors; however, their roles in MRTF-A-related effect on neuronal injuries during I/R are still unclear. In this study, in a model rat cerebral I/R injury via middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion, we found that the expression and activity of HDAC5 was upregulated, whereas p300 and MRTF-A were downregulated both in expression and activity during I/R. Their expression changes and the interaction of the MRTF-A with HDAC5 or p300 were further verified by double immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation. In cultured neuronal apoptosis model induced by H2O2, MRTF-A exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect by enhancing the transcription of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 via CArG box binding. MRTF-A-induced anti-apoptotic effect was effectively inhibited by HDAC5, but was significantly enhanced by p300. The results suggest that both HDAC5 and p300 are involved in MRTF-A-mediated effect on neuronal apoptosis during ischemia/reperfusion injury, but with opposite effects."
f1165d80-0ee3-4d15-b203-4c76914d1c60,"A cerebral aneurysm occurs as a result of a weakened blood vessel, which allows blood to flow into a sac or a ballooned section. Recent advancement shows that a new device, ‘flow-diverter’, can divert blood flow away from the aneurysm sac. People found that a flow-diverter based on thin film nitinol (TFN), works very effectively, however there are no studies proving the mechanical safety in irregular, curved blood vessels. Here, we study the mechanical behaviors and structural safety of a novel microstructured TFN membrane through the computational and experimental studies, which establish the fundamental aspects of stretching and bending mechanics of the structure. The result shows a hyper-elastic behavior of the TFN with a negligible strain change up to 180° in bending and over 500% in radial stretching, which is ideal in the use in neurovascular curved arteries. The simulation determines the optimal joint locations between the TFN and stent frame. In vitro experimental test qualitatively demonstrates the mechanical flexibility of the flow-diverter with multi-modal bending. In vivo micro X-ray and histopathology study demonstrate that the TFN can be conformally deployed in the curved blood vessel of a swine model without any significant complications or abnormalities."

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: I would like to process articles by tokenizing and normalizing word vectors to compute cosine similarity scores and weighting these vectors by the 0.4th root of word frequency, in order to identify the top 10 most relevant articles related to the phrase "Epigenetics and cerebral organoids: promising directions in autism spectrum disorders". Please show me the id, date, title and cosine similarity scores of them.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
id,date,title,cosine_similarity_score
article_id1:str,date1:date,title1:str,score1:float
article_id2:str,date2:date,title2:str,score2:float
...
```

The table above lists the top 10 most relevant articles related to the phrase "Epigenetics and cerebral organoids: promising directions in autism spectrum disorders". The articles are identified by processing the text through tokenization and normalization of word vectors, computing cosine similarity scores, and weighting these vectors by the 0.4th root of word frequency. Each row provides the article's `id`, `date`, `title`, and the calculated `cosine_similarity_score`..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'WORD_VECTORS_US': {'WORD_VECTORS_US': ['GLOVE_VECTORS', 'NATURE', 'WORD_FREQUENCIES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
