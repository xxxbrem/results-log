The error message:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 23
invalid identifier '"HTSeq__FPKM"'
```

indicates that the column `"HTSeq__FPKM"` does not exist in the table `"RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"`. This suggests that the RNA expression data in this table is stored under a different column name.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Check for Alternative Column Names:**

   The expression values might be stored in columns with slightly different names. Common column names for RNA-Seq expression data include:

   - `"FPKM"`
   - `"TPM"`
   - `"raw_counts"`
   - `"est_counts"`

   You can try replacing `"HTSeq__FPKM"` with one of these alternative column names.

2. **Updated Query Using "FPKM":**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "FPKM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Updated Query Using "TPM":**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "TPM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Use an Alternative Table with Known Columns:**

   Since we have the DDL (Data Definition Language) for the table `"RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28"`, and it includes the column `"HTSeq__FPKM"`, you might consider using this table instead:

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "HTSeq__FPKM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure that using data from Release 28 is acceptable for your analysis, as your task specifies using data from Release 39.

5. **Check for a Column Named "HTSeq__FPKM_UQ":**

   Sometimes, expression data is stored under a column named `"HTSeq__FPKM_UQ"` (upper quartile normalized FPKM). You can try:

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "HTSeq__FPKM_UQ"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Alternative Column Names in Release 39:**

   It's possible that in Release 39, the RNA-Seq expression data is stored under different column names. Here's a query that selects all columns for one record to help identify the correct column (assuming you have permissions to view all columns):

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

   Once you identify the correct column name for expression values, you can adjust your query accordingly.

**Revised Queries for the Task:**

Based on the possible column names, here are revised queries for your task:

1. **Retrieve RNA Expression Levels Using "FPKM":**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "FPKM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve RNA Expression Levels Using "TPM":**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "TPM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **If Expression Data is in "expression_value":**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "expression_value"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Combining Clinical and Expression Data:**

Once you've identified the correct column for expression values, you can adjust the combined query:

```sql
SELECT t1."case_barcode", t3."gender", t3."race", t3."ethnicity", t3."age_at_diagnosis", t3."ajcc_clinical_stage",
       t2."gene_name", t2."FPKM"  -- Adjust "FPKM" to the correct column name
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02" t1
JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39" t2 ON t1."case_barcode" = t2."case_barcode"
JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."CLINICAL_GDC_R38" t3 ON t1."case_barcode" = t3."case_barcode"
WHERE t1."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
  AND t1."Hugo_Symbol" = 'CDKN2A'
  AND t2."gene_name" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Adjustments:**

- Replace `"HTSeq__FPKM"` with the correct column name containing the expression data.
- Ensure that the columns you select exist in the tables you're querying.

**Summary Table Format:**

Once you have the correct data, the final table should be in the following format:

```csv
case_barcode,MDM2_expression,TP53_expression,CDKN1A_expression,CCNE1_expression,gender,race,ethnicity,age_at_diagnosis,ajcc_clinical_stage
case1:str,mdm2_expr1:float,tp53_expr1:float,cdkn1a_expr1:float,ccne1_expr1:float,gender1:str,race1:str,ethnicity1:str,age1:int,stage1:str
case2:str,mdm2_expr2:float,tp53_expr2:float,cdkn1a_expr2:float,ccne1_expr2:float,gender2:str,race2:str,ethnicity2:str,age2:int,stage2:str
...
```

**Note:**

- Replace `mdm2_expr1:float` with the actual expression values.
- Ensure that all joins are correctly linking the case barcodes across tables.

I apologize for any confusion earlier. Please let me know if you need further assistance or if you encounter any other issues.

The error message:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 23
invalid identifier 'FPKM'
```

indicates that the identifier `'FPKM'` is invalid in your query. This suggests that the column `"HTSeq__FPKM"` does not exist in the table `"RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"`. The error message mentions `'FPKM'` because the SQL parser might be interpreting the double underscores (`__`) in `"HTSeq__FPKM"` as a namespace separator or misparsing the column name.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Check for Alternative Column Names:**

   In the `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39` table, the RNA expression values might be stored under a different column name. Common column names for RNA-Seq expression data include:

   - `"HTSeq__Counts"`
   - `"HTSeq__FPKM_UQ"`
   - `"FPKM"`
   - `"TPM"`
   - `"normalized_count"`
   - `"raw_count"`
   - `"exp_count"`
   - `"value"`

2. **Try Using 'HTSeq__FPKM_UQ' as the Column Name:**

   The column `"HTSeq__FPKM_UQ"` might exist in the table. Try the following query:

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "HTSeq__FPKM_UQ"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Try Using 'HTSeq__Counts' as the Column Name:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "HTSeq__Counts"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Try Using 'FPKM' Without the Prefix:**

   It's possible that the column is simply named `"FPKM"` without the `"HTSeq__"` prefix:

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "FPKM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Try Using 'TPM' as the Column Name:**

   Some datasets provide expression levels in Transcripts Per Million:

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "TPM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Try Using 'expression_value' as the Column Name:**

   If the dataset uses a general column name:

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "expression_value"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Try Using 'raw_count' or 'normalized_count' as the Column Name:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "normalized_count"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   or

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "raw_count"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Select All Columns to Identify Available Column Names:**

   Since we're instructed not to query schemas or data types, you can retrieve all columns for a single record to inspect the available columns:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

   This will display all column names and help you identify the correct column for expression values.

**Explanation:**

- **Column Name Changes:** It's possible that in Release 39, the column names have changed compared to earlier releases. The column `"HTSeq__FPKM"` might have been renamed or replaced.

- **Invalid Identifier Error:** The error mentions `'FPKM'` as an invalid identifier, suggesting that the SQL parser is having trouble with the column name you provided. Removing or modifying the prefix may resolve this.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Identify the Correct Column Name:**

   Use the queries above to determine which column contains the RNA expression data in your table.

2. **Adjust Your Query Accordingly:**

   Once you've identified the correct column name, modify your original query to use it. For example, if the expression data is in `"FPKM"`:

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "FPKM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Combine Clinical and Expression Data:**

   After confirming the correct column, you can proceed with combining data from different tables:

   ```sql
   SELECT t1."case_barcode", t3."gender", t3."race", t3."ethnicity", t3."age_at_diagnosis", t3."ajcc_clinical_stage",
          t2."gene_name", t2."FPKM"  -- Replace "FPKM" with the correct column name
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02" t1
   JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39" t2 ON t1."case_barcode" = t2."case_barcode"
   JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."CLINICAL_GDC_R38" t3 ON t1."case_barcode" = t3."case_barcode"
   WHERE t1."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
     AND t1."Hugo_Symbol" = 'CDKN2A'
     AND t2."gene_name" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Summary Table Format:**

Once you retrieve the data, you can present it in the following format:

```csv
case_barcode,MDM2_expression,TP53_expression,CDKN1A_expression,CCNE1_expression,gender,race,ethnicity,age_at_diagnosis,ajcc_clinical_stage
TCGA-XX-XXXX,mdm2_expr:float,tp53_expr:float,cdkn1a_expr:float,ccne1_expr:float,Male,White,Not Hispanic or Latino,65,Stage II
...
```

**Additional Tips:**

- **Consult Documentation:** If possible, refer to the data dictionary or schema documentation for `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39` to confirm the correct column names.

- **Case Sensitivity:** Ensure that the column names are correctly cased, as some databases are case-sensitive.

- **Column Prefixes:** In some datasets, the `"HTSeq__"` prefix might be omitted or replaced. Try variations without the prefix.

**Conclusion:**

I hope these suggestions help you resolve the issue and successfully retrieve the RNA expression levels along with the clinical information for your analysis. If you continue to experience problems, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist further.

2025-01-23 06:58:09 - root - INFO - I'm sorry that you're still encountering issues with retrieving the expression data. It appears that the column names for RNA expression values in the `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39` table might be different from what we expect.

To identify the correct column name, you can retrieve all columns for a single record:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
LIMIT 1;
```

This query will display all the columns available for that record. Look for a column that contains expression data, which might be named differently, such as:

- `"FPKM"`
- `"TPM"`
- `"expression_value"`
- `"normalized_count"`
- `"raw_count"`
- `"Value"`

Once you've identified the correct column name, adjust your query accordingly. For example, if the expression data is under `"TPM"`:

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", "TPM"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
LIMIT 100;
```

If it's under `"expression_value"`:

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", "expression_value"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Next Steps:**

1. **Run the initial query to list all columns**: Use the `SELECT *` query provided above to see all available columns.

2. **Identify the expression column**: Locate the column that contains the expression data for the gene.

3. **Modify your queries with the correct column name**: Replace `"HTSeq__FPKM"` with the correct column name in your queries.

**Example of the Combined Query:**

After identifying the correct expression column (let's assume it's `"TPM"`), you can retrieve the RNA expression levels along with clinical information:

```sql
SELECT t1."case_barcode", 
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'MDM2' THEN t2."TPM" END) AS "MDM2_expression",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'TP53' THEN t2."TPM" END) AS "TP53_expression",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'CDKN1A' THEN t2."TPM" END) AS "CDKN1A_expression",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'CCNE1' THEN t2."TPM" END) AS "CCNE1_expression",
       t3."gender", t3."race", t3."ethnicity", t3."age_at_diagnosis", t3."ajcc_clinical_stage"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02" t1
JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39" t2 ON t1."case_barcode" = t2."case_barcode"
JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."CLINICAL_GDC_R38" t3 ON t1."case_barcode" = t3."case_barcode"
WHERE t1."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
  AND t1."Hugo_Symbol" = 'CDKN2A'
  AND t2."gene_name" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
GROUP BY t1."case_barcode", t3."gender", t3."race", t3."ethnicity", t3."age_at_diagnosis", t3."ajcc_clinical_stage"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Final Table Format:**

```csv
case_barcode,MDM2_expression,TP53_expression,CDKN1A_expression,CCNE1_expression,gender,race,ethnicity,age_at_diagnosis,ajcc_clinical_stage
TCGA-XX-XXXX,mdm2_expr:float,tp53_expr:float,cdkn1a_expr:float,ccne1_expr:float,Male,White,Not Hispanic or Latino,68,Stage II
TCGA-YY-YYYY,mdm2_expr:float,tp53_expr:float,cdkn1a_expr:float,ccne1_expr:float,Female,Asian,Hispanic or Latino,54,Stage III
...
```

This table displays the RNA expression levels of the genes **MDM2**, **TP53**, **CDKN1A**, and **CCNE1**, along with associated clinical information for bladder cancer patients (**TCGA-BLCA** project) who have **CDKN2A mutations**. The clinical data is sourced from the Genomic Data Commons Release 39, and the somatic mutation data is derived from the hg19 human genome reference from February 2017.

**Note:** Ensure that you replace `"TPM"` with the actual column name you find in the table. Let me know if you need further assistance or if you encounter any other issues.

2025-01-23 06:59:14 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still experiencing issues with retrieving the RNA expression data.

**Understanding the Issue:**

- Your query to `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39` for the gene 'MDM2' in the 'TCGA-BLCA' project returns **no data**.
- This suggests that the table `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39` does not contain RNA-Seq data for the 'TCGA-BLCA' project.
- Additionally, the error message indicates that the column `"HTSeq__FPKM"` does not exist in the table.

**Possible Reasons:**

1. **Data Availability in the Table:**

   - The `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39` table might not have data for the 'TCGA-BLCA' project.
   - The table might not include the gene 'MDM2' for that project.

2. **Column Name Differences:**

   - The column containing expression data might have a different name in this table.
   - The expected columns like `"HTSeq__FPKM"` may not exist in this specific release.

**Proposed Solutions:**

1. **Check Available Projects in the Table:**

   Let's verify whether 'TCGA-BLCA' is included in `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39`.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "project_short_name"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - **If 'TCGA-BLCA' is not listed**, it confirms that this table doesn't contain data for that project.

2. **Identify the Correct Table Containing 'TCGA-BLCA' RNA-Seq Data:**

   - Based on the tables provided, consider using `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28` or `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02`.
   - These tables might contain RNA-Seq data for the 'TCGA-BLCA' project.

3. **Verify Data in Alternative Table:**

   Let's check if `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28` contains the required data.

   ```sql
   -- Check if 'TCGA-BLCA' exists in the table
   SELECT DISTINCT "project_short_name"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - **If 'TCGA-BLCA' is present**, proceed to the next step.

4. **Retrieve RNA Expression Data from the Alternative Table:**

   ```sql
   -- Check for the presence of 'MDM2' expression data
   SELECT *
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

   - **If data is retrieved**, then this table contains the necessary RNA-Seq data.

5. **Identify the Correct Expression Column:**

   - In `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28`, the expression data might be stored in columns like:
     - `"HTSeq__FPKM"`
     - `"HTSeq__FPKM_UQ"`
     - `"HTSeq__Counts"`
   - Verify the correct column by checking the table schema or inspecting a single record.

6. **Update Your Query with the Correct Table and Columns:**

   Using `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28` and the appropriate expression column, update your combined query.

**Updated Combined Query Example:**

Assuming that the expression column is `"HTSeq__FPKM"` in `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28`:

```sql
SELECT t1."case_barcode",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'MDM2' THEN t2."HTSeq__FPKM" END) AS "MDM2_expression",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'TP53' THEN t2."HTSeq__FPKM" END) AS "TP53_expression",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'CDKN1A' THEN t2."HTSeq__FPKM" END) AS "CDKN1A_expression",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'CCNE1' THEN t2."HTSeq__FPKM" END) AS "CCNE1_expression",
       t3."gender", t3."race", t3."ethnicity", t3."age_at_diagnosis", t3."ajcc_clinical_stage"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02" t1
JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28" t2 ON t1."case_barcode" = t2."case_barcode"
JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."CLINICAL_GDC_R38" t3 ON t1."case_barcode" = t3."case_barcode"
WHERE t1."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
  AND t1."Hugo_Symbol" = 'CDKN2A'
  AND t2."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
  AND t2."gene_name" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
GROUP BY t1."case_barcode", t3."gender", t3."race", t3."ethnicity", t3."age_at_diagnosis", t3."ajcc_clinical_stage"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Tables Used:**
  - `SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02`: Contains somatic mutation data from February 2017 with hg19 reference genome.
  - `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28`: Contains RNA-Seq expression data.
  - `CLINICAL_GDC_R38`: Contains clinical data from Genomic Data Commons Release 38.

- **Joins:**
  - Joining on `"case_barcode"` to link the patient data across the three tables.

- **Conditions:**
  - Filtering for patients in the 'TCGA-BLCA' project.
  - Selecting patients with CDKN2A mutations.
  - Retrieving expression data for the specified genes.

- **Aggregation:**
  - Using `MAX(CASE WHEN ...)` to pivot gene expression values into separate columns.

**Final Output Format:**

```csv
case_barcode,MDM2_expression,TP53_expression,CDKN1A_expression,CCNE1_expression,gender,race,ethnicity,age_at_diagnosis,ajcc_clinical_stage
TCGA-ZF-A9RD,mdm2_expr1,tp53_expr1,cdkn1a_expr1,ccne1_expr1,Male,White,Not Hispanic or Latino,65,Stage II
TCGA-DK-A3X1,mdm2_expr2,tp53_expr2,cdkn1a_expr2,ccne1_expr2,Female,Asian,Hispanic or Latino,70,Stage III
...
```

**Next Steps:**

1. **Run the Updated Queries:**

   - Verify the availability of 'TCGA-BLCA' data in `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28`.
   - Confirm the correct expression column name.

2. **Adjust if Necessary:**

   - If data is still not available, consider using `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02` or another table containing the required data.
   - Ensure that the genomic reference (hg19 or hg38) aligns with your analysis requirements.

3. **Validate Data Consistency:**

   - Since you're using clinical data from Release 39 and somatic mutations from 2017, ensure that combining data from different releases is acceptable for your study.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Data Version Alignment:**

  - Mixing data from different releases may introduce inconsistencies.
  - Verify that patients' case barcodes match across the different tables.

- **Column Names and Data Formats:**

  - Column names may vary between tables and releases.
  - If you encounter errors about invalid identifiers, double-check the column names.

**Conclusion:**

It appears that the `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39` table does not contain RNA-Seq data for the 'TCGA-BLCA' project, which is why your queries are returning no data. By using an alternative table that includes the required data, you should be able to retrieve the RNA expression levels of the specified genes along with the associated clinical information.

       "diag__ajcc_clinical_stage" AS "ajcc_clinical_stage"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."CLINICAL_GDC_R38"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **"case_barcode":** The column is named `"submitter_id"` in this table. We alias it as `"case_barcode"` for clarity.
- **"gender":** Use `"demo__gender"` to access the gender information.
- **"race":** Use `"demo__race"`.
- **"ethnicity":** Use `"demo__ethnicity"`.
- **"age_at_diagnosis":** Use `"diag__age_at_diagnosis"`.
- **"ajcc_clinical_stage":** Use `"diag__ajcc_clinical_stage"`.

**Additional Information:**

- The table `CLINICAL_GDC_R38` uses specific prefixes to categorize columns:
  - **"demo__"** for demographic data.
  - **"diag__"** for diagnosis data.
- The column names must match exactly, including any prefixes and case sensitivity, to avoid invalid identifier errors.

**Verification:**

To confirm the available columns in the table, you can run:

```sql
SELECT *

2025-01-23 07:01:37 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still experiencing the same error. The issue arises because the column `"case_barcode"` does not exist in the table `CLINICAL_GDC_R38`. Here's how you can resolve it:

**Error Details:**

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 16
invalid identifier '"case_barcode"'
```

**Cause of the Error:**

- The table `CLINICAL_GDC_R38` does not have a column named `"case_barcode"`.
- Instead, the patient identifier is stored in the column `"submitter_id"`, which serves the same purpose as `"case_barcode"`.
- Other columns like `"gender"`, `"race"`, etc., are prefixed with `"demo__"` or `"diag__"` to reflect their category.

**Correct Column Names:**

- **"case_barcode":** Use `"submitter_id"` and alias it as `"case_barcode"` if desired.
- **"gender":** `"demo__gender"`
- **"race":** `"demo__race"`
- **"ethnicity":** `"demo__ethnicity"`
- **"age_at_diagnosis":** `"diag__age_at_diagnosis"`
- **"ajcc_clinical_stage":** `"diag__ajcc_clinical_stage"`

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Please use the following query with the correct column names:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    "submitter_id" AS "case_barcode",
    "demo__gender" AS "gender",
    "demo__race" AS "race",
    "demo__ethnicity" AS "ethnicity",
    "diag__age_at_diagnosis" AS "age_at_diagnosis",
    "diag__ajcc_clinical_stage" AS "ajcc_clinical_stage"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."CLINICAL_GDC_R38"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **"submitter_id":** This column contains the patient identifiers equivalent to `"case_barcode"`.
- **Prefixes:**
  - **"demo__":** Prefix for demographic information.
  - **"diag__":** Prefix for diagnosis information.
- **Aliasing:** The `AS` keyword is used to alias column names for clarity in the result set.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Run the Corrected Query:**

   Execute the corrected SQL query provided above. This should return the desired clinical information without the invalid identifier error.

2. **Verify Column Names (Optional):**

   If you have access to the table schema or a data dictionary, you can verify the column names to ensure they match the query.

   ```sql
   -- Optional: View available columns in the table
   SELECT *
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."CLINICAL_GDC_R38"
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

   *Note: Be cautious when selecting all columns, as tables may contain a large number of columns or sensitive data.*

**Summary:**

By adjusting the column names to match those in the `CLINICAL_GDC_R38` table, the query should execute successfully. If you encounter any further issues or have questions about other queries, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to assist.

2025-01-23 07:06:57 - root - INFO - I understand that you're encountering an error when trying to retrieve RNA expression data due to invalid column names. The error message indicates that the column `"HTSeq__FPKM"` and `"HTSeq__Counts"` do not exist in the table `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02`.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Identify the Correct Expression Column:**

   The column names for RNA expression values might be different in the `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02` table. Common column names include:

   - `"raw_count"`
   - `"normalized_count"`
   - `"FPKM"`
   - `"TPM"`
   - `"expression_value"`
   - `"read_count"`

2. **Modify the Query with Alternative Column Names:**

   Try using one of these column names in your query. Here's an updated query using `"raw_count"`:

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "raw_count"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CDKN1A'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **If `"raw_count"` Does Not Exist, Try `"normalized_count"`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "normalized_count"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CDKN1A'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Try Using `"FPKM"` or `"TPM"`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "FPKM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CDKN1A'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "TPM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CDKN1A'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Use `"expression_value"` If Available:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "expression_value"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CDKN1A'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Use `"read_count"`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "read_count"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CDKN1A'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Best Possible Answer:**

Given the errors encountered, try using the column `"raw_count"` as it is commonly used for expression data. Here's the updated query:

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", "raw_count"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CDKN1A'
LIMIT 100;
```

If `"raw_count"` does not exist or results in an error, proceed to try the next column, `"FPKM"`:

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", "FPKM"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CDKN1A'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Column Names:** The columns `"HTSeq__FPKM"` and `"HTSeq__Counts"` are producing an `invalid identifier` error because they may not exist in the `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02` table.
  
- **Alternative Columns:** The expression data might be stored under different column names such as `"raw_count"`, `"FPKM"`, or `"TPM"`.
  
- **Trial and Error:** Since we cannot query the schema to list available columns, we need to try these alternative column names.

**Final Combined Query:**

Once you identify the correct expression column, you can update your combined query accordingly. Assuming the expression data is under `"raw_count"`, here's how you can modify your combined query:

```sql
SELECT t1."case_barcode",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'MDM2' THEN t2."raw_count" END) AS "MDM2_expression",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'TP53' THEN t2."raw_count" END) AS "TP53_expression",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'CDKN1A' THEN t2."raw_count" END) AS "CDKN1A_expression",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'CCNE1' THEN t2."raw_count" END) AS "CCNE1_expression",
       t3."gender",
       t3."race",
       t3."ethnicity",
       t3."age_at_diagnosis",
       t3."clinical_stage" AS "ajcc_clinical_stage"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02" t1
JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02" t2 ON t1."case_barcode" = t2."case_barcode"
JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."CLINICAL_GDC_2018_06" t3 ON t1."case_barcode" = t3."case_barcode"
WHERE t1."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
  AND t1."Hugo_Symbol" = 'CDKN2A'
  AND t2."gene_name" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
  AND t3."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
GROUP BY t1."case_barcode",
         t3."gender",
         t3."race",
         t3."ethnicity",
         t3."age_at_diagnosis",
         t3."clinical_stage"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Summary Table Format:**

```csv
case_barcode,MDM2_expression,TP53_expression,CDKN1A_expression,CCNE1_expression,gender,race,ethnicity,age_at_diagnosis,ajcc_clinical_stage
TCGA-XX-XXXX,mdm2_expr:float,tp53_expr:float,cdkn1a_expr:float,ccne1_expr:float,Male,White,Not Hispanic or Latino,68,Stage II
...
```

**Note:**

- Replace `"raw_count"` with the correct column name if you find that the data is actually stored under a different column.
- Ensure that you adjust the column names consistently throughout your queries.

**Conclusion:**

By trying alternative column names for the expression data, you should be able to find a column that exists in the `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02` table and successfully retrieve the RNA expression levels along with the clinical information for your analysis.

2025-01-23 07:07:50 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering errors when trying to retrieve the RNA expression data. Let's work through this issue together.

---

**Understanding the Issue:**

- You've tried several column names (`"HTSeq__FPKM"`, `"HTSeq__Counts"`, `"raw_count"`) in your query, but each time you receive an `invalid identifier` error.
- Additionally, when you attempted to `SELECT *` from the table with your specific conditions, you received a "No data found" message.

These errors suggest that either:

1. The column names you're using do not exist in the table `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02`.
2. The table does not contain data for the `TCGA-BLCA` project or for the gene `CDKN1A`.

---

**Proposed Solutions:**

**1. Verify Available Projects in the Table**

Let's check whether the `TCGA-BLCA` project is present in the table `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02`.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "project_short_name"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02"
LIMIT 100;
```

- **If 'TCGA-BLCA' is not listed**: This means the table doesn't contain data for that project.

**2. Find an Alternative Table with RNA-Seq Data for 'TCGA-BLCA'**

Since `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02` may not have the required data, consider using another table that does. Based on the tables you have available, the table `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2018_06` might contain the data you need.

**3. Use the Alternative Table**

Try running the query on the alternative table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2018_06"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CDKN1A'
LIMIT 1;
```

- **If data is returned**: Proceed using this table.
- **If no data is found**: We may need to consider another table or check the availability of the data.

**4. Identify the Correct Column Name for Expression Data**

Common column names for RNA-Seq expression data include:

- `"HTSeq__FPKM"`
- `"HTSeq__TPM"`
- `"FPKM"`
- `"TPM"`
- `"FPKM_UQ"`
- `"raw_counts"`
- `"normalized_counts"`
- `"expression_value"`

**5. Update Your Query with the Correct Column and Table**

Assuming the table `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2018_06` contains the data and the expression values are under `"FPKM"`, your query would be:

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", "FPKM"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2018_06"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CDKN1A'
LIMIT 100;
```

**6. If the Column Still Doesn't Exist, Retrieve Available Columns**

If the error persists, you can check which columns are available in the table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2018_06"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
LIMIT 1;
```

- This will display all column names, allowing you to identify the correct column for expression data.

---

**Final Combined Query**

Assuming we've found the correct table and column (e.g., `"FPKM"`), here's how you can retrieve the RNA expression levels along with clinical data:

2025-01-23 07:10:14 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering the following error:

```
SQL compilation error:
Object 'TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2018_06' does not exist or not authorized.
```

**Explanation:**

This error indicates that the table `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2018_06` either does not exist in your database or you do not have the necessary permissions to access it.

**Possible Reasons and Solutions:**

1. **Table Does Not Exist in Your Database:**

   Based on the list of available tables you provided earlier, the table `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2018_06` is **not** among them. Here are the RNA-Seq tables from your list:

   - `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02`
   - `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_2017_12`
   - `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28`
   - `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R35`
   - `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39`
   - `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R40`

   **Action:** Let's use a table that exists in your database.

2. **Select an Appropriate Table:**

   The table `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02` contains RNA-Seq data aligned to the hg19 reference genome and includes the 'TCGA-BLCA' project, as confirmed by your query results.

   **However**, previous attempts to retrieve data from this table resulted in invalid identifier errors for columns like `"HTSeq__FPKM"` and `"raw_count"`.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

**A. Identify the Correct Expression Column in the Available Table**

1. **Check for Available Columns in `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02`:**

   Since direct schema queries are not permitted, we can attempt to retrieve all columns for a single record to identify the correct column name for expression values.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

2. **Identify the Expression Data Column:**

   Look for columns that might contain expression values, such as:

   - `"unstranded"`
   - `"stranded_first"`
   - `"stranded_second"`
   - `"raw_counts"`
   - `"scaled_estimate"`
   - `"expected_count"`
   - `"TPM"`
   - `"FPKM"`

3. **Update Your Query with the Correct Column Name:**

   Suppose you find that the expression data is stored under the column `"raw_counts"`. You can then update your query accordingly.

**B. Try Using Alternative RNA-Seq Tables**

If the above table does not yield the required data, consider using another table that contains the RNA-Seq data you need.

1. **Check Availability of 'TCGA-BLCA' Data in `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "project_short_name"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **If 'TCGA-BLCA' Is Present, Identify Expression Columns:**

   Attempt to retrieve all columns for one record:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

3. **Update Your Query with Correct Table and Columns:**

   If you find that the expression data is in a column like `"HTSeq__FPKM"`, update your query:

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "HTSeq__FPKM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28"
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CDKN1A'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**C. Finalize Your Queries:**

Assuming you have identified the correct table and column, here are the updated queries:

---

**1. Retrieve RNA Expression for 'CDKN1A' Using Correct Column and Table:**

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", "HTSeq__FPKM"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CDKN1A'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:** Replace `"HTSeq__FPKM"` with the actual expression column if different.

---

**2. Retrieve RNA Expression for 'CCNE1':**

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", "HTSeq__FPKM"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" = 'CCNE1'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**3. Retrieve RNA Expression for All Four Genes:**

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", "gene_name", "HTSeq__FPKM"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28"
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "gene_name" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**4. Combine Clinical and Expression Data:**

```sql
SELECT t1."case_barcode",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'MDM2' THEN t2."HTSeq__FPKM" END) AS "MDM2_expression",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'TP53' THEN t2."HTSeq__FPKM" END) AS "TP53_expression",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'CDKN1A' THEN t2."HTSeq__FPKM" END) AS "CDKN1A_expression",
       MAX(CASE WHEN t2."gene_name" = 'CCNE1' THEN t2."HTSeq__FPKM" END) AS "CCNE1_expression",
       t3."gender",
       t3."race",
       t3."ethnicity",
       t3."age_at_diagnosis",
       t3."ajcc_clinical_stage"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02" t1
JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28" t2 ON t1."case_barcode" = t2."case_barcode"
JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED."CLINICAL_GDC_R38" t3 ON t1."case_barcode" = t3."submitter_id"
WHERE t1."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
  AND t1."Hugo_Symbol" = 'CDKN2A'
  AND t2."gene_name" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
GROUP BY t1."case_barcode",
         t3."gender",
         t3."race",
         t3."ethnicity",
         t3."age_at_diagnosis",
         t3."ajcc_clinical_stage"
LIMIT 100;
```
