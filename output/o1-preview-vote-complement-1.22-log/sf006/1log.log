2025-01-25 07:40:21 - root - INFO - Apologies for the confusion earlier. It appears that the table name was misspecified in the SQL queries I provided. The correct table name is:

- **Table:** `FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES`

So, the corrected SQL query should remove the extra `"CYBERSYN"` in the schema path. Here are the corrected queries:

---

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES`
  - `"ID_RSSD"`: Unique identifier for each financial branch entity.
  - `"START_DATE"`: Date when the branch started operations; used to determine if the branch was operational on the specified dates.
  - `"END_DATE"`: Date when the branch ended operations; used to determine if the branch was still operational on the specified dates. If `NULL`, the branch is still active.
  - `"STATE_ABBREVIATION"`: State where the branch is located; used to group branches by state.
  - `"IS_ACTIVE"`: Indicates if the branch is currently active; may help identify active branches.
  - `"ID_STATE"`: State identifier; potential alternative to `"STATE_ABBREVIATION"`.
  - `"CITY"`: City where the branch is located; may provide additional geographic context.
  - `"CATEGORY"`: Category of the branch; could be used to filter specific types of branches.

**Potential Conditions:**

- To identify branches active on March 1, 2020:
  - `"START_DATE"` <= '2020-03-01'
  - (`"END_DATE"` IS NULL OR `"END_DATE"` >= '2020-03-01')
- To identify branches active on December 31, 2021:
  - `"START_DATE"` <= '2021-12-31'
  - (`"END_DATE"` IS NULL OR `"END_DATE"` >= '2021-12-31')
- To group and count branches by `"STATE_ABBREVIATION"`.

---

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct states with financial branches:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "STATE_ABBREVIATION"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count total number of financial branch entities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "TotalBranches"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES;
   ```

3. **Retrieve branch IDs and operational dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "ID_RSSD", "START_DATE", "END_DATE"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List active branches on March 1, 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "ID_RSSD", "STATE_ABBREVIATION", "START_DATE", "END_DATE"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
   WHERE "START_DATE" <= '2020-03-01'
     AND ("END_DATE" IS NULL OR "END_DATE" >= '2020-03-01')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count active branches per state on March 1, 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "STATE_ABBREVIATION", COUNT(*) AS "ActiveBranches"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
   WHERE "START_DATE" <= '2020-03-01'
     AND ("END_DATE" IS NULL OR "END_DATE" >= '2020-03-01')
   GROUP BY "STATE_ABBREVIATION"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count active branches per state on December 31, 2021:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "STATE_ABBREVIATION", COUNT(*) AS "ActiveBranches"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
   WHERE "START_DATE" <= '2021-12-31'
     AND ("END_DATE" IS NULL OR "END_DATE" >= '2021-12-31')
   GROUP BY "STATE_ABBREVIATION"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find branches that closed between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "ID_RSSD", "BRANCH_NAME", "STATE_ABBREVIATION", "END_DATE"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
   WHERE "END_DATE" BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2021-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List new branches opened between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "ID_RSSD", "BRANCH_NAME", "STATE_ABBREVIATION", "START_DATE"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
   WHERE "START_DATE" BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2021-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count total branches per state regardless of active status:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "STATE_ABBREVIATION", COUNT(*) AS "TotalBranches"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
   GROUP BY "STATE_ABBREVIATION"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve branches currently marked as active:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "ID_RSSD", "BRANCH_NAME", "STATE_ABBREVIATION", "IS_ACTIVE"
    FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
    WHERE "IS_ACTIVE" = TRUE
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Count active branches per state currently:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "STATE_ABBREVIATION", COUNT(*) AS "CurrentlyActiveBranches"
    FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
    WHERE "IS_ACTIVE" = TRUE
    GROUP BY "STATE_ABBREVIATION"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **List branches with missing end dates (possibly still active):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "ID_RSSD", "BRANCH_NAME", "STATE_ABBREVIATION", "END_DATE"
    FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
    WHERE "END_DATE" IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Find branches that changed status between the two dates:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "ID_RSSD", "BRANCH_NAME", "STATE_ABBREVIATION", "START_DATE", "END_DATE"
    FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
    WHERE ("START_DATE" > '2020-03-01' AND "START_DATE" <= '2021-12-31')
       OR ("END_DATE" >= '2020-03-01' AND "END_DATE" < '2021-12-31')
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Count net change in branches per state between the two dates:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      "STATE_ABBREVIATION",
      COUNT(CASE WHEN "START_DATE" BETWEEN '2020-03-02' AND '2021-12-31' THEN 1 END) AS "BranchesOpened",
      COUNT(CASE WHEN "END_DATE" BETWEEN '2020-03-02' AND '2021-12-31' THEN 1 END) AS "BranchesClosed"
    FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES
    GROUP BY "STATE_ABBREVIATION"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

By correcting the table name, these queries should now execute without the previous error. Please ensure to replace any instances of `FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES` with `FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES` in your SQL statements.

Again, I apologize for the oversight. If you encounter any further issues or need additional assistance, please let me know.

description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

This data covers both calendar years (running from January 1st to December 31st) and marketing years. Marketing years typically begin in the month when the harvest of a particular crop starts and end before the beginning of the next year's harvest. This period can vary significantly among different crops and countries, depending on when these crops are sown and harvested. The specific starting month of the marketing year for each crop is essential because it affects how production, stocks, and trade are accounted for and compared year-over-year. Marketing years are used to better align the supply and demand statistics of a commodity with its normal production cycle. Additionally, the USDA's Export Sales Reporting (ESR) data provides weekly updates on the export sales activity of major commodities, further enhancing the understanding of market dynamics within these defined marketing years.

Task: Calculate the percentage change in the number of active financial branch entities for each state, comparing the counts on March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. Active entities are those operational on the specified dates.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Below is the percentage change in the number of active financial branch entities for each state between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021.

```csv
State,PercentageChange
state1:str,percentage_change1:float
state2:str,percentage_change2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'FINANCE__ECONOMICS': {'CYBERSYN': ['BANK_FOR_INTERNATIONAL_SETTLEMENTS_ATTRIBUTES', 'BANK_FOR_INTERNATIONAL_SETTLEMENTS_TIMESERIES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_EMPLOYMENT_ATTRIBUTES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_EMPLOYMENT_TIMESERIES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_PRICE_ATTRIBUTES', 'BUREAU_OF_LABOR_STATISTICS_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'COMPANY_INDEX', 'COMPANY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'COMPANY_SECURITY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'CYBERSYN_DATA_CATALOG', 'CYBERSYN_FINANCIAL_ECONOMIC_INDICATORS_ATTRIBUTES', 'CYBERSYN_FINANCIAL_ECONOMIC_INDICATORS_TIMESERIES', 'EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK_ATTRIBUTES', 'EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK_TIMESERIES', 'FDIC_BRANCH_LOCATIONS_INDEX', 'FDIC_SUMMARY_OF_DEPOSITS_ATTRIBUTES', 'FDIC_SUMMARY_OF_DEPOSITS_TIMESERIES', 'FHFA_HOUSE_PRICE_ATTRIBUTES', 'FHFA_HOUSE_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'FHFA_MORTGAGE_PERFORMANCE_ATTRIBUTES', 'FHFA_MORTGAGE_PERFORMANCE_TIMESERIES', 'FHFA_UNIFORM_APPRAISAL_ATTRIBUTES', 'FHFA_UNIFORM_APPRAISAL_TIMESERIES', 'FINANCIAL_BRANCH_ENTITIES', 'FINANCIAL_CFPB_COMPLAINT', 'FINANCIAL_FRED_ATTRIBUTES', 'FINANCIAL_FRED_TIMESERIES', 'FINANCIAL_FRED_VARIABLE_SERIES_ID_CROSSWALK', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_ATTRIBUTES', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_ENTITIES', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_EVENTS', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_HIERARCHY', 'FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_TIMESERIES', 'FX_RATES_TIMESERIES', 'GEOGRAPHY_HIERARCHY', 'GEOGRAPHY_INDEX', 'GEOGRAPHY_OVERLAPS', 'GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'INTERNATIONAL_MONETARY_FUND_ATTRIBUTES', 'INTERNATIONAL_MONETARY_FUND_TIMESERIES', 'NEWYORKFED_CONSUMER_ATTRIBUTES', 'NEWYORKFED_CONSUMER_TIMESERIES', 'OECD_ATTRIBUTES', 'OECD_TIMESERIES', 'OPENFIGI_SECURITY_INDEX', 'PERMID_SECURITY_INDEX', 'PUBLIC_HOLIDAY_CALENDAR', 'STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'US_ECONOMIC_CENSUS_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_ECONOMIC_CENSUS_TIMESERIES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 07:44:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Calculate the percentage change in the number of active financial branch entities for each state, comparing the counts on March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. Active entities are those operational on the specified dates., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Below is the percentage change in the number of active financial branch entities for each state between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021.

```csv
State,PercentageChange
state1:str,percentage_change1:float
state2:str,percentage_change2:float
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
