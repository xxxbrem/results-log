After comparing both SQL scripts and their results, the correct SQL script is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
```

**Reason:**

The SQL script `0result.sql` correctly calculates the balances of Ethereum addresses by:

- **Including both transactions and traces**: It considers value transfers from the `TRANSACTIONS` table (`tx_received`, `tx_sent`) and the `TRACES` table (`trace_received`, `trace_sent`), specifically where `call_type` is NULL or `'call'`, as per the requirement.
  
- **Considering only successful records**: It filters for successful transactions (`"receipt_status" = 1`) and successful traces (`"status" = 1`), ensuring that only valid transactions are included.
  
- **Applying the correct time filter**: It includes only data **before September 1, 2021** by filtering with `"block_timestamp" < 1630454400000000`, matching the specified cutoff.
  
- **Calculating gas fees accurately**: It calculates the total gas fees paid by each address in the `tx_gas_fees` CTE, subtracting these fees from the balance.
  
- **Aggregating balances correctly**: It sums the total received amounts and subtracts the total sent amounts and gas fees for each address, combining both transactions and traces. This provides an accurate balance for each address.
  
- **Including only addresses with positive balances**: By applying the `WHERE` clause with the condition that the balance must be greater than zero, it filters out addresses with zero or negative balances, focusing on addresses that hold Ether.

Therefore, `0result.sql` accurately fulfills the task requirements by:

- Correctly considering both value transactions and gas fees from **both transactions and traces**.
  
- Ensuring all specified conditions are applied, including success status and time constraints.
  
- Providing a precise calculation of balances that reflects the criteria outlined in the task.

The results produced by `0result.sql` align with the expected outcomes, listing the top 10 Ethereum addresses by balance before September 1, 2021, considering all specified factors.
