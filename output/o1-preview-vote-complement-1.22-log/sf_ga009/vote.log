After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, **2result.sql** is the correct query to calculate the average number of engaged sessions per user for December 2020. Here is the reasoning:

- **Definition of Engaged Session**: An engaged session is a session that meets certain criteria, such as lasting longer than a specified duration or having specific user interactions. In the GA4 data, the `session_engaged` parameter indicates whether a session is considered engaged (`'1'` for engaged, `'0'` for not engaged).

- **First Query (0result.sql)**:
  - This query counts all sessions where the `EVENT_NAME` is `'user_engagement'` without verifying if the session was actually engaged.
  - It does not filter based on the `session_engaged` parameter.
  - As a result, it may include sessions that are not truly engaged according to GA4's definition.

- **Second Query (2result.sql)**:
  - This query correctly filters sessions where the `session_engaged` parameter is `'1'`, ensuring only engaged sessions are counted.
  - It extracts both `session_engaged` and `ga_session_id` from `EVENT_PARAMS`.
  - It groups the data by `USER_PSEUDO_ID` and counts distinct `ga_session_id`s where `session_engaged` is `'1'`.
  - This method aligns with the proper definition of engaged sessions and provides an accurate average.

Therefore, **2result.sql** provides the correct calculation by accurately identifying engaged sessions based on the `session_engaged` parameter.
