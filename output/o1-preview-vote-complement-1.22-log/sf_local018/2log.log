**Relevant Tables and Columns**

Table: **"COLLISIONS"**

- **"collision_date"**: Used to filter accidents by year (e.g., 2021 and 2011).
- **"primary_collision_factor"**: Used to identify the cause of each accident.
- **"case_id"**: Unique identifier for each collision, useful for counting accidents.
- **"pcf_violation_code"**: May provide additional details about the violation.

**Possible Conditions**

- Filter accidents occurring in 2021: `WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%'`.
- Filter accidents occurring in 2011: `WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%'`.
- Group by **"primary_collision_factor"** to count accidents per cause.
- Order results by accident count in descending order to find the most common causes.

**SQL Queries**

1. **Select distinct collision dates to understand the date format.**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "collision_date"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List collisions that occurred in 2021.**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_id", "collision_date", "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List collisions that occurred in 2011.**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_id", "collision_date", "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count total accidents in 2021.**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "total_accidents_2021"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%';
   ```

5. **Count total accidents in 2011.**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "total_accidents_2011"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%';
   ```

6. **Find the number of accidents per cause in 2021.**

   ```sql
   SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "accident_count"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%'
   GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "accident_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find the number of accidents per cause in 2011.**

   ```sql
   SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "accident_count"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%'
   GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "accident_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List distinct primary collision factors.**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find the most common cause of accidents in 2021.**

   ```sql
   SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "accident_count"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%'
   GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "accident_count" DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

10. **Find the number of accidents in 2011 due to the most common cause in 2021.**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS "accident_count_2011"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%'
    AND "primary_collision_factor" = '<most_common_cause>';
    ```

11. **Calculate the percentage share of the most common cause in 2021.**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      (COUNT(*) * 100.0) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS" WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%') AS "percentage_share_2021"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%'
    AND "primary_collision_factor" = '<most_common_cause>';
    ```

12. **Calculate the percentage share of the same cause in 2011.**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      (COUNT(*) * 100.0) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS" WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%') AS "percentage_share_2011"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%'
    AND "primary_collision_factor" = '<most_common_cause>';
    ```

13. **Examine "pcf_violation_code" associated with the most common cause in 2021.**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "pcf_violation_code"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%'
    AND "primary_collision_factor" = '<most_common_cause>'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List collisions with full details for the most common cause in 2021.**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%'
    AND "primary_collision_factor" = '<most_common_cause>'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find the top 5 primary collision factors in 2021.**

    ```sql
    SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "accident_count"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%'

Task: For the most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021, how much did its share (percentage in the annual roal incidents) decrease compared to 10 years earlier?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Cause,Percentage_Decrease
cause_of_accident:str,percentage_decrease:float > 0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021 was **cause_of_accident**. Its share of the annual total incidents decreased by **percentage_decrease**% compared to 2011..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

The most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021 was **cause_of_accident**. Its share of the annual total incidents decreased by **percentage_decrease**% compared to 2011. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
