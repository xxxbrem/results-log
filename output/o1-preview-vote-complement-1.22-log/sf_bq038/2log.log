**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table**: `CITIBIKE_TRIPS`

  - `"start_station_id"`: Identifies the station where the trip started. Potential usage: Determine the starting point of trips.
  - `"end_station_id"`: Identifies the station where the trip ended. Potential usage: Determine the ending point of trips.
  - `"starttime"`: Timestamp of when the trip started. Potential usage: Calculate time windows for trips.
  - `"stoptime"`: Timestamp of when the trip ended. Potential usage: Calculate the duration and time windows of trips.
  - `"tripduration"`: Duration of the trip in seconds. Potential usage: Identify trips within a specific duration.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Group Rides**: Trips that start and end at the same station within a 2-minute window.
  - Condition: `"start_station_id" = "end_station_id"`
  - Condition: `"tripduration" <= 120` (since 2 minutes equals 120 seconds)

These queries help in understanding the data related to the task:

- **Queries 1-2**: Explore the general structure and unique values in the data.
- **Queries 3-5**: Identify trips that qualify as group rides based on the conditions.
- **Queries 6-8**: Calculate counts and proportions of group rides per station.
- **Query 9**: Verify that the time difference between start and end times aligns with the 2-minute window.
- **Query 10**: Analyze the user types participating in group rides.

Task: Can you list the top 10 station id with the highest proportion of group rides? The group rides are trips that start and end at the same station within a 2-minute window.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
station_id,proportion_of_group_rides
station_id1:NUMBER(38,0),proportion1:float<1
station_id2:NUMBER(38,0),proportion2:float<1
station_id3:NUMBER(38,0),proportion3:float<1
station_id4:NUMBER(38,0),proportion4:float<1
station_id5:NUMBER(38,0),proportion5:float<1
station_id6:NUMBER(38,0),proportion6:float<1
station_id7:NUMBER(38,0),proportion7:float<1
station_id8:NUMBER(38,0),proportion8:float<1
station_id9:NUMBER(38,0),proportion9:float<1
station_id10:NUMBER(38,0),proportion10:float<1
(Attention: answer in 10 rows)
```

The table above lists the top 10 station IDs with the highest proportion of group rides. A group ride is defined as a trip that starts and ends at the same station within a 2-minute window. The proportion is calculated by dividing the number of group rides by the total number of trips starting from that station..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NEW_YORK': {'NEW_YORK': ['CITIBIKE_STATIONS', 'CITIBIKE_TRIPS', 'NYPD_MV_COLLISIONS', 'TLC_FHV_TRIPS_2015', 'TLC_FHV_TRIPS_2016', 'TLC_GREEN_TRIPS_2013', 'TLC_GREEN_TRIPS_2014', 'TLC_GREEN_TRIPS_2015', 'TLC_GREEN_TRIPS_2016', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2009', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2010', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2011', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2012', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2013', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2014', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2016', 'TREE_CENSUS_1995', 'TREE_CENSUS_2005', 'TREE_CENSUS_2015', 'TREE_SPECIES', '_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 19:59:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you list the top 10 station id with the highest proportion of group rides? The group rides are trips that start and end at the same station within a 2-minute window., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
station_id,proportion_of_group_rides

The table above lists the top 10 station IDs with the highest proportion of group rides. A group ride is defined as a trip that starts and ends at the same station within a 2-minute window. The proportion is calculated by dividing the number of group rides by the total number of trips starting from that station. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
