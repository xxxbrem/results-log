After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Use of 'transactions' Field:** The query in `2result.sql` identifies purchase events using the `"transactions"` field from the `"totals"` column. This field directly reflects completed transactions at the session level, making it a reliable indicator of purchase events.
  
- **Session-Level Accuracy:** Utilizing `"transactions"` ensures that only sessions with actual completed purchases are counted as purchase events, providing accurate aggregation when calculating average pageviews per visitor.

- **Simplified Logic:** The query avoids the complexity of flattening the `"hits"` column and checking for `"eCommerceAction":"action_type" = '6'` for each hit, which may include actions that do not result in completed transactions.

- **Consistency in Metrics:** Since `"transactions"` is a session-level metric, it aligns well with calculating average pageviews per visitor at the session level, ensuring consistency in the aggregation.

In contrast, `0result.sql` identifies purchase events by examining the `"eCommerceAction":"action_type"` within the `"hits"` column. While action type `'6'` corresponds to purchase events, relying on hit-level data may include sessions where a purchase action was initiated but not completed, potentially leading to less accurate results.

Therefore, `2result.sql` provides a more precise and reliable calculation for the average pageviews per visitor for non-purchase and purchase events each month between June 1st and July 31st, 2017.
