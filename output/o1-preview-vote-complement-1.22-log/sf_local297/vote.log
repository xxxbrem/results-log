After analyzing the three SQL scripts and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script for the given task. Here's the reasoning:

**Reasoning:**

1. **Adjustment of Transaction Amounts Based on Transaction Type:**

   - **`0result.sql`** correctly adjusts the transaction amounts by considering the `txn_type`. Deposits are added, and withdrawals are subtracted from the balance:
     ```sql
     CASE WHEN LOWER(ct."txn_type") = 'deposit' THEN ct."txn_amount"
          WHEN LOWER(ct."txn_type") = 'withdrawal' THEN -ct."txn_amount"
          ELSE 0 END
     ```
   - **`1result.sql`** does **not** adjust the transaction amounts based on the `txn_type`. It simply sums the `txn_amount`, which can lead to incorrect balances because withdrawals should decrease the balance.
     ```sql
     SELECT "customer_id", SUM("txn_amount") AS "current_balance"
     ```
   - **`2result.sql`** adjusts the transaction amounts appropriately but relies on transactions occurring on the 1st of each month. This may not capture the balance accurately if there are customers without transactions on that specific day.

2. **Calculation of Balances up to the Correct Dates:**

   - **`0result.sql`** calculates the balances up to the end of the previous month (`prev_prev_balance_date`) and the end of the most recent month (`prev_balance_date`), aligning with the requirement to measure balances as of the 1st of each month.
   - **`1result.sql`** uses hardcoded dates (`'2020-03-31'` and `'2020-02-29'`), which might not adapt to the most recent data automatically. However, the main issue remains the lack of transaction type adjustment.
   - **`2result.sql`** focuses on balances on the exact 1st day of each month, which can exclude customers who didn't have transactions on that day, potentially underrepresenting the actual percentage.

3. **Growth Rate Calculation:**

   - **`0result.sql`** calculates the growth rate according to the specified condition, properly handling cases where the previous balance is zero.
     ```sql
     CASE
       WHEN "prev_balance" = 0 AND "current_balance" <> 0 THEN "current_balance" * 100
       WHEN "prev_balance" = 0 AND "current_balance" = 0 THEN 0
       ELSE (("current_balance" - "prev_balance") / "prev_balance") * 100
     END AS "growth_rate"
     ```
   - **`1result.sql`** also calculates the growth rate but, due to incorrect balance calculations, the resulting percentage is inflated.
   - **`2result.sql`** calculates the growth rate but may have inaccurate balances due to its reliance on transactions on the 1st day only.

4. **Result Consistency:**

   - The result from **`0result.sql`** (45.4000%) is a reasonable percentage, considering the dataset and proper balance calculations.
   - The result from **`1result.sql`** (89.8000%) seems excessively high, likely due to incorrect balance calculations.
   - The result from **`2result.sql`** (20.1835%) might be low because it possibly excludes customers without transactions on the 1st of the month.

Given these points, **`0result.sql`** best fulfills the task requirements by accurately calculating balances, adjusting for transaction types, and computing the growth rate as specified.
