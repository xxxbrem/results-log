After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL script for calculating the shortest driving distance between each 'The Home Depot' store and its nearest 'Lowe's Home Improvement' store.

**Reason:**

- **Handling Null Values:** The query in `2result.sql` includes additional conditions to filter out any records where the latitude or longitude may be `NULL`. Specifically, it adds:

  ```sql
  AND addr."LATITUDE" IS NOT NULL
  AND addr."LONGITUDE" IS NOT NULL
  ```

  This ensures that only stores with valid geographic coordinates are considered in the distance calculations. Without this check, the distance function might return incorrect results or fail due to `NULL` values.

- **Consistent Distance Calculations:** By filtering out invalid coordinates, `2result.sql` provides more accurate and reliable distance measurements between stores.

- **Query Structure:** Both queries use similar structures with Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to:

  1. Select 'The Home Depot' stores and their coordinates.
  2. Select 'Lowe's Home Improvement' stores and their coordinates.
  3. Calculate distances between all pairs of stores.
  4. Select the nearest 'Lowe's Home Improvement' store for each 'The Home Depot' store.

  However, the inclusion of `NULL` checks in `2result.sql` makes it more robust.
