The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'THE_MET': {'THE_MET': ['IMAGES', 'OBJECTS', 'VISION_API_DATA']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns, understand how they can be used, and explore the data through SQL queries.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`THE_MET.THE_MET.OBJECTS`**
   - **`"object_id"`**: Primary key for artworks; used to join with labels.
   - **`"period"`**: The historical period of each artwork; needed for grouping.

2. **`THE_MET.THE_MET.VISION_API_DATA`**
   - **`"object_id"`**: Foreign key; used to join with artworks.
   - **`"labelAnnotations"`**: VARIANT column containing labels for each artwork.

**Potential Usage:**

- **`"object_id"`**: Join artworks with their corresponding labels.
- **`"period"`**: Group artworks by historical period.
- **`"labelAnnotations"`**: Extract labels associated with each artwork.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Join `OBJECTS` and `VISION_API_DATA` on `"object_id"`.
- Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to extract labels from the VARIANT column.
- Filter labels linked to 50 or more artworks.
- Retrieve the top three labels per period.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **View Sample Data from `OBJECTS` Table**

   ```sql
   SELECT "object_id", "period"
   FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.OBJECTS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **View Sample Data from `VISION_API_DATA` Table**

   ```sql
   SELECT "object_id", "labelAnnotations"
   FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.VISION_API_DATA
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count Artworks with Label Annotations**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "total_artworks_with_labels"
   FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.VISION_API_DATA
   WHERE "labelAnnotations" IS NOT NULL;
   ```

4. **Join Tables on `"object_id"` and View Combined Data**

   ```sql
   SELECT o."object_id", o."period", v."labelAnnotations"
   FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.OBJECTS o
   JOIN THE_MET.THE_MET.VISION_API_DATA v
     ON o."object_id" = v."object_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Extract Label Annotations Using `LATERAL FLATTEN`**

   ```sql
   SELECT v."object_id", f.value AS "label_annotation"
   FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.VISION_API_DATA v,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."labelAnnotations") f
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Examine Structure of Label Annotations**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value
   FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.VISION_API_DATA v,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."labelAnnotations") f
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Extract Label Descriptions and Associate with Periods**

   ```sql
   SELECT o."period", f.value:"description"::STRING AS "label"
   FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.OBJECTS o
   JOIN THE_MET.THE_MET.VISION_API_DATA v
     ON o."object_id" = v."object_id",
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."labelAnnotations") f
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count Occurrences of Each Label per Period**

   ```sql
   SELECT o."period", f.value:"description"::STRING AS "label", COUNT(*) AS "count"
   FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.OBJECTS o
   JOIN THE_MET.THE_MET.VISION_API_DATA v
     ON o."object_id" = v."object_id",
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."labelAnnotations") f
   GROUP BY o."period", "label"
   ORDER BY o."period", "count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Filter Labels Linked to 50 or More Artworks**

   ```sql
   SELECT o."period", f.value:"description"::STRING AS "label", COUNT(*) AS "count"
   FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.OBJECTS o
   JOIN THE_MET.THE_MET.VISION_API_DATA v
     ON o."object_id" = v."object_id",
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."labelAnnotations") f
   GROUP BY o."period", "label"
   HAVING COUNT(*) >= 50
   ORDER BY o."period", "count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve Top Three Labels for Each Period**

    ```sql
    SELECT "period", "label", "count"
    FROM (
      SELECT o."period",
             f.value:"description"::STRING AS "label",
             COUNT(*) AS "count",
             ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY o."period" ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS "rn"
      FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.OBJECTS o
      JOIN THE_MET.THE_MET.VISION_API_DATA v
        ON o."object_id" = v."object_id",
      LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."labelAnnotations") f
      GROUP BY o."period", "label"
      HAVING COUNT(*) >= 50
    ) sub
    WHERE "rn" <= 3
    ORDER BY "period", "count" DESC;
    ```

11. **List All Distinct Historical Periods**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "period"
    FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.OBJECTS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Count Artworks per Period**

    ```sql
    SELECT "period", COUNT(DISTINCT "object_id") AS "artwork_count"
    FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.OBJECTS
    GROUP BY "period"
    ORDER BY "artwork_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Identify Most Common Labels Across All Periods**

    ```sql
    SELECT f.value:"description"::STRING AS "label", COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM THE_MET.THE_MET.VISION_API_DATA v,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."labelAnnotations") f
    GROUP BY "label"
    ORDER BY "count" DESC

    WHERE o."period" = 'Impressionism'
    GROUP BY "label"
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 50
    ORDER BY "count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help explore the data and understand the relationships between historical periods and associated labels. By examining the outputs of these queries, you can gain insights into the distribution of labels across different periods and identify the most frequent labels. The queries range from simple data retrieval to complex aggregations and filtering.

**Note:** All column names are enclosed in double quotations to adhere to SQL syntax requirements. The `LATERAL FLATTEN` function is used to unpack the VARIANT (JSON) data in the `"labelAnnotations"` column, allowing us to extract label descriptions. The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is employed to rank labels within each period for selecting the top three.Query:

Task: What are the top three most frequently associated labels with artworks from each historical period in The Met's collection, only considering labels linked to 50 or more artworks? Provide me with the period, label, and the associated count.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To find the top three most frequently associated labels with artworks from each historical period in The Met's collection, considering only labels linked to 50 or more artworks, the results would be structured as follows:

```csv
Period,Label,Count
period1:str,label1:str,count1:int
period1:str,label2:str,count2:int
period1:str,label3:str,count3:int
period2:str,label1:str,count1:int
period2:str,label2:str,count2:int
period2:str,label3:str,count3:int
...
```

**Explanation:**  
- **Period**: The historical period of the artworks (e.g., "Renaissance", "Baroque").
- **Label**: The label associated with the artworks, identified by image analysis (e.g., "Portrait", "Landscape").
- **Count**: The number of artworks from that period associated with the label (only including labels linked to 50 or more artworks).

Each group of three rows corresponds to a historical period and lists its top three labels along with their counts..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'THE_MET': {'THE_MET': ['IMAGES', 'OBJECTS', 'VISION_API_DATA']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 04:55:45 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the top three most frequently associated labels with artworks from each historical period in The Met's collection, only considering labels linked to 50 or more artworks? Provide me with the period, label, and the associated count., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find the top three most frequently associated labels with artworks from each historical period in The Met's collection, considering only labels linked to 50 or more artworks, the results would be structured as follows:

```csv
Period,Label,Count
period1:str,label1:str,count1:int
period1:str,label2:str,count2:int
period1:str,label3:str,count3:int
period2:str,label1:str,count1:int
period2:str,label2:str,count2:int
period2:str,label3:str,count3:int
...
```

**Explanation:**  
- **Period**: The historical period of the artworks (e.g., "Renaissance", "Baroque").
- **Label**: The label associated with the artworks, identified by image analysis (e.g., "Portrait", "Landscape").
- **Count**: The number of artworks from that period associated with the label (only including labels linked to 50 or more artworks).

Each group of three rows corresponds to a historical period and lists its top three labels along with their counts. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 04:56:05 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the top three most frequently associated labels with artworks from each historical period in The Met's collection, only considering labels linked to 50 or more artworks? Provide me with the period, label, and the associated count., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find the top three most frequently associated labels with artworks from each historical period in The Met's collection, considering only labels linked to 50 or more artworks, the results would be structured as follows:

```csv
Period,Label,Count
period1:str,label1:str,count1:int
period1:str,label2:str,count2:int
period1:str,label3:str,count3:int
period2:str,label1:str,count1:int
period2:str,label2:str,count2:int
period2:str,label3:str,count3:int
...
```

**Explanation:**  
- **Period**: The historical period of the artworks (e.g., "Renaissance", "Baroque").
- **Label**: The label associated with the artworks, identified by image analysis (e.g., "Portrait", "Landscape").
- **Count**: The number of artworks from that period associated with the label (only including labels linked to 50 or more artworks).

Each group of three rows corresponds to a historical period and lists its top three labels along with their counts. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 04:56:40 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the top three most frequently associated labels with artworks from each historical period in The Met's collection, only considering labels linked to 50 or more artworks? Provide me with the period, label, and the associated count., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find the top three most frequently associated labels with artworks from each historical period in The Met's collection, considering only labels linked to 50 or more artworks, the results would be structured as follows:

```csv
Period,Label,Count
period1:str,label1:str,count1:int
period1:str,label2:str,count2:int
period1:str,label3:str,count3:int
period2:str,label1:str,count1:int
period2:str,label2:str,count2:int
period2:str,label3:str,count3:int
...
```

**Explanation:**  
- **Period**: The historical period of the artworks (e.g., "Renaissance", "Baroque").
- **Label**: The label associated with the artworks, identified by image analysis (e.g., "Portrait", "Landscape").
- **Count**: The number of artworks from that period associated with the label (only including labels linked to 50 or more artworks).

Each group of three rows corresponds to a historical period and lists its top three labels along with their counts. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 04:57:14 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the top three most frequently associated labels with artworks from each historical period in The Met's collection, only considering labels linked to 50 or more artworks? Provide me with the period, label, and the associated count., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find the top three most frequently associated labels with artworks from each historical period in The Met's collection, considering only labels linked to 50 or more artworks, the results would be structured as follows:

```csv
Period,Label,Count
period1:str,label1:str,count1:int
period1:str,label2:str,count2:int
period1:str,label3:str,count3:int
period2:str,label1:str,count1:int
period2:str,label2:str,count2:int
period2:str,label3:str,count3:int
...
```

**Explanation:**  
- **Period**: The historical period of the artworks (e.g., "Renaissance", "Baroque").
- **Label**: The label associated with the artworks, identified by image analysis (e.g., "Portrait", "Landscape").
- **Count**: The number of artworks from that period associated with the label (only including labels linked to 50 or more artworks).

Each group of three rows corresponds to a historical period and lists its top three labels along with their counts. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
