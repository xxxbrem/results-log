Upon comparing the SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that `1result.sql` is the correct SQL.

**Reasoning:**

- **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):** This script uses `MIN_BY` and `MAX_BY` functions, which are not standard SQL functions and may not be supported in all database systems. Relying on non-standard functions can lead to compatibility issues.

- **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`):** This script utilizes standard SQL functions and window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`) to accurately calculate the first and last trip durations per month. By partitioning the data by month and ordering by `start_date`, it effectively identifies the first and last trips. Additionally, it computes the highest and lowest trip durations using standard aggregation functions. This approach is efficient, clear, and compatible with most SQL databases.

- **Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):** While this script also uses standard SQL functions, it adds unnecessary complexity with multiple common table expressions (CTEs) and additional date conversions. It achieves the same result as Candidate 1 but in a less efficient and more convoluted manner.

Given these considerations, `1result.sql` is the correct and most appropriate choice.
