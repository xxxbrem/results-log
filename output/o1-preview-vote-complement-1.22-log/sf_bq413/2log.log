2025-01-25 05:48:14 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to a data type mismatch between the numeric `date_inserted` column and the string date `'2024-01-01'`. Here's how to resolve the issue.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Error Message:** `Numeric value '2024-01-01' is not recognized`
- **Cause:** The `"date_inserted"` column is of type `NUMBER(38,0)`, and you're comparing it to a string date `'2024-01-01'`. This results in a data type mismatch.

**Details:**

- **"date_inserted" Column:** This column is of numeric type and likely stores the date as a Unix timestamp (number of seconds since January 1, 1970).
- **String Date Comparison:** Directly comparing a numeric column to a string date causes an error because the database cannot implicitly convert between these types.

---

**Solutions:**

1. **Convert the String Date to a Numeric Timestamp:**

   - **Step 1:** Convert `'2024-01-01'` to its equivalent Unix timestamp.
     - `'2024-01-01'` corresponds to Unix timestamp **1704067200**.
   - **Step 2:** Use this numeric value in your query.
   - **Revised Query:**

     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS"
     WHERE "date_inserted" >= 1704067200
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

2. **Convert "date_inserted" to a Date Type for Comparison:**

   - **Step 1:** Use the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function to convert `"date_inserted"` from a numeric value to a timestamp.
   - **Step 2:** Compare it with the string date `'2024-01-01'`.
   - **Revised Query:**

     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS"
     WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

3. **Use the "date_normal" Column Instead:**

   - **Note:** The `"date_normal"` column is of type `DATE`, allowing for direct date comparisons.
   - **Revised Query:**

     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS"
     WHERE "date_normal" >= '2024-01-01'
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

---

**Applying the Solution to Your Task:**

To retrieve the venue titles of publications inserted from 2024 onwards, associated with research organizations in 'Qianjiang', while prioritizing the venue titles as specified, here's how you can adjust your query.

**Step 1:** Correct the Date Comparison.

- Use `TO_TIMESTAMP("date_inserted")` to convert the numeric timestamp to a date for comparison.

**Step 2:** Flatten the `research_org_city_names` array to search for 'Qianjiang'.

- Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to unnest the `research_org_city_names` array.

**Step 3:** Retrieve and Prioritize Venue Titles.

- Use `COALESCE` to prioritize the venue titles from `journal`, then `proceedings_title`, `book_title`, and `book_series_title`.

**Final Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  COALESCE("p"."journal"::STRING, "p"."proceedings_title"::STRING, "p"."book_title"::STRING, "p"."book_series_title"::STRING) AS "venue_title"
FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_org_city_names") AS "city"
WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'
  AND "city"."value"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation of the Query:**

- **`SELECT DISTINCT`:** Ensures that duplicate venue titles are not returned.
- **`COALESCE(...) AS "venue_title"`:** Selects the first non-null venue title in the order of priority.
- **`LATERAL FLATTEN`:** Unnests the `research_org_city_names` array to access individual city names.
- **`TO_TIMESTAMP("p"."date_inserted") >= '2024-01-01'`:** Converts the numeric `date_inserted` to a timestamp for comparison.
- **`"city"."value"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'`:** Filters for publications associated with 'Qianjiang'.
- **`LIMIT 100`:** Limits the result set to 100 records.

---

**Alternate Query Using "date_normal":**

If you prefer to use the `date_normal` column:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  COALESCE("p"."journal"::STRING, "p"."proceedings_title"::STRING, "p"."book_title"::STRING, "p"."book_series_title"::STRING) AS "venue_title"
FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_org_city_names") AS "city"
WHERE "p"."date_normal" >= '2024-01-01'
  AND "city"."value"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Additional Notes:**

- **Understanding "date_inserted":** It's crucial to know the format and timezone of the `date_inserted` values. If they are in milliseconds, you may need to adjust by dividing by 1000.
- **Verifying Data Types:** Always ensure that the data types you're comparing are compatible. Use appropriate conversion functions when necessary.
- **Testing with Sample Data:** It may help to retrieve some sample `date_inserted` values to confirm their format:

  ```sql
  SELECT "date_inserted"
  FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS"
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

---

**Final Output Format:**

Based on your task, the output should be in CSV format with the venue titles:

```csv
venue_title
title1:str
title2:str
...
```

---

**Summary:**

- **Error Cause:** Data type mismatch between numeric `date_inserted` and string date.
- **Solution:** Convert `date_inserted` to a date or convert the string date to a numeric timestamp.
- **Adjusted Query:** Use `TO_TIMESTAMP` or use `date_normal` for date comparisons.
- **Output:** Retrieve the prioritized venue titles in CSV format.

  ""preferred"": ""Governments create contests to allocate resources to stakeholders, e.g., grants, contracts. The actions of these stakeholders can generate a positive externality for themselves—the contest winner can attract additional outside funding and donations from third-parties who want to jump on the winner’s bandwagon. Herein we examine the externalities arising from these contests created by governance and their impact on a virtuous circle of governance contests. Among various conditions that make governance virtuous, we focus on the equilibrium expected payoffs of stakeholders, the difference in them, and the rent-dissipation rates. Our study shows that the impact of externalities on the efficiency of governance depends on two key factors: (i) the choice of governance contests, the player-externality and the winner-externality, and (ii) the relative efficiency of stakeholders’ efforts.""

2025-01-25 05:50:07 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 26
invalid identifier '"city"."value"'
```

indicates that the identifier `"city"."value"` is invalid. This is due to a mismatch in the column name casing or incorrect quoting of identifiers.

In Snowflake, identifiers (such as table names, column names, aliases) are case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes. Also, the `FLATTEN` function returns columns with uppercase names unless explicitly defined otherwise.

When you use `LATERAL FLATTEN`, the output columns are:

- `INDEX`
- `KEY`
- `PATH`
- `VALUE`
- `THIS`
- `SEQ`

By default, these columns are in uppercase unless they were created with double quotes in a specific case.

**Cause of the Error:**

- You're referencing `"city"."value"` in your SELECT and WHERE clauses.
- However, since `FLATTEN` returns the column `VALUE` in uppercase, you need to reference it as `"VALUE"` or without quotes (assuming it's uppercase in the schema).

**Corrected Query:**

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "p"."id", "city"."VALUE"::STRING AS "city_name"
FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS "p",
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_org_city_names") AS "city"
WHERE "city"."VALUE"::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **Changed `"city"."value"` to `"city"."VALUE"`:**
  - The `VALUE` column from `FLATTEN` is in uppercase by default.
  - Using the correct case ensures the identifier is valid.

- **Consistent Use of Double Quotes:**
  - Since you've used double quotes for identifiers, you need to maintain the exact case.
  - If the column names are in uppercase, they must be referenced in uppercase when quoted.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Alternative Without Double Quotes:**
  - If you prefer, you can omit double quotes and use uppercase identifiers:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT p.id, city.VALUE::STRING AS city_name
    FROM DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19.DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19.PUBLICATIONS AS p,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => p.research_org_city_names) AS city
    WHERE city.VALUE::STRING ILIKE '%Qianjiang%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

- **Verifying Column Names:**
  - You can run a sample query to verify the column names returned by `FLATTEN`:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."DIMENSIONS_AI_COVID19"."PUBLICATIONS" AS p,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "p"."research_org_city_names") AS city
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

    This will display the columns and help confirm the correct casing.

- **Understanding IDENTIFIER Case Sensitivity:**
  - In Snowflake:
    - Unquoted identifiers are converted to uppercase.
    - Quoted identifiers are case-sensitive.
  - Therefore, using double quotes requires exact casing.

**Summary:**

- **Issue:** Invalid identifier due to incorrect casing of the column name.
- **Solution:** Reference the `VALUE` column in uppercase as `"VALUE"` when using double quotes.
- **Corrected Query Provided.**

---

By making this correction, your query should execute without the `invalid identifier` error, allowing you to retrieve the desired data.
