Begin Exploring Related Columns
Relevant tables and columns:

**Table: PACKAGING**

- `"id"`: Identifier for each packaging container. Potential usage: to uniquely identify each packaging container.
- `"name"`: Name of the packaging container. Potential usage: to display or filter packaging containers by their names.

**Table: PACKAGING_RELATIONS**

- `"packaging_id"`: The ID of the packaging container. Potential usage: to find which containers include other items or containers.
- `"contains_id"`: The ID of the item or packaging contained within another packaging container. Potential usage: to identify the items or containers that are included within a packaging container.
- `"qty"`: The quantity of the contained item or packaging. Potential usage: to calculate total quantities of items within packaging containers.

Conditions that may be used:

- Quantities greater than 500: `"qty" > 500`
- Summing quantities of all items contained within each packaging container.
- Considering nested packaging containers by linking `"packaging_id"` and `"contains_id"` recursively.

---

Here are the SQL queries to explore the relevant data:

1. **Select all records from the PACKAGING table to view all packaging containers:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select all records from the PACKAGING_RELATIONS table to see how packaging containers are related:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find distinct packaging container IDs that contain other items or containers:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "packaging_id" FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find distinct item or container IDs that are contained within packaging containers:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id" FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Select packaging relations where the quantity of contained items is greater than 500:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "packaging_id", "contains_id", "qty" 
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" 
   WHERE "qty" > 500 
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join PACKAGING and PACKAGING_RELATIONS to get the names of packaging containers and their contents:**
   ```sql
   SELECT pr."packaging_id", p."name" AS "packaging_name", pr."contains_id", pr."qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p ON pr."packaging_id" = p."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Select total quantities of items contained within each packaging container:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "packaging_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
   GROUP BY "packaging_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find packaging containers where the total quantity of contained items exceeds 500:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "packaging_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
   GROUP BY "packaging_id"
   HAVING SUM("qty") > 500
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Get the names of packaging containers with total contained quantities and filter those exceeding 500:**
   ```sql
   SELECT p."name" AS "packaging_name", SUM(pr."qty") AS "total_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p ON pr."packaging_id" = p."id"
   GROUP BY p."name"
   HAVING SUM(pr."qty") > 500
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List all items or containers contained within each packaging along with their individual quantities:**
    ```sql
    SELECT pr."packaging_id", p."name" AS "packaging_name", pr."contains_id", pr."qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p ON pr."packaging_id" = p."id"
    ORDER BY pr."packaging_id", pr."contains_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Identify packaging containers that contain specific items in large quantities (e.g., quantities greater than 500):**
    ```sql
    SELECT pr."packaging_id", pr."contains_id", pr."qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
    WHERE pr."qty" > 500
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Find packaging containers along with the names of the items or containers they contain:**
    ```sql
    SELECT pr."packaging_id", p1."name" AS "packaging_name", pr."contains_id", p2."name" AS "contained_name", pr."qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p1 ON pr."packaging_id" = p1."id"
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p2 ON pr."contains_id" = p2."id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Select all packaging containers that do not contain any items (i.e., packaging containers with no entries in PACKAGING_RELATIONS):**
    ```sql
    SELECT p."id", p."name"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING" p
    LEFT JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr ON p."id" = pr."packaging_id"
    WHERE pr."packaging_id" IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List the quantities of items contained within each packaging container, sorted by quantity descending:**
    ```sql
    SELECT pr."packaging_id", pr."contains_id", pr."qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
    ORDER BY pr."qty" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find the maximum quantity of items contained within any packaging container:**
    ```sql
    SELECT MAX("qty") AS "max_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

16. **Get the packaging containers that contain the maximum quantity of items:**
    ```sql
    SELECT pr."packaging_id", pr."contains_id", pr."qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
    WHERE pr."qty" = (SELECT MAX("qty") FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS")
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

17. **Calculate the average quantity of items contained within packaging containers:**
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG("qty") AS "average_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

18. **List packaging containers along with the count of different items they contain:**
    ```sql
    SELECT pr."packaging_id", COUNT(DISTINCT pr."contains_id") AS "item_count"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
    GROUP BY pr."packaging_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

19. **Identify packaging containers that contain more than 10 different items:**
    ```sql
    SELECT pr."packaging_id", COUNT(DISTINCT pr."contains_id") AS "item_count"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
    GROUP BY pr."packaging_id"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT pr."contains_id") > 10
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

20. **Find the total quantity of each contained item across all packaging containers:**
    ```sql
    SELECT pr."contains_id", SUM(pr."qty") AS "total_contained_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
    GROUP BY pr."contains_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the relationships between packaging containers and the items they contain, as well as the quantities involved. By exploring these queries, we can analyze which packaging containers include items in quantities greater than 500, considering all items contained within each container.Query:

Task: Which packaging containers include items in quantities greater than 500, considering all items contained within each container?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
packaging_id,name,total_quantity
id1:int,name1:str,total_quantity1:int > 500
id2:int,name2:str,total_quantity2:int > 500
...
```

The packaging containers listed above have total quantities of items exceeding 500, considering all items contained within each container recursively..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

The packaging containers listed above have total quantities of items exceeding 500, considering all items contained within each container recursively. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
