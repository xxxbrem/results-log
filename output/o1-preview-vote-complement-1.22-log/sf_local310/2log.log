2025-01-25 19:07:51 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of the alias `"RA"` in the outer query, where it's not recognized. The alias `"RA"` is only defined within the subquery `TP` and cannot be referenced outside of it. To fix this, you should reference the `"year"` column from the subquery `TP` instead.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT TP."year", MAX(TP."total_points") AS "max_driver_points"
FROM (
  SELECT R."driver_id", RA."year", SUM(R."points") AS "total_points"
  FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" R
  JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" RA ON R."race_id" = RA."race_id"
  GROUP BY R."driver_id", RA."year"
) TP
GROUP BY TP."year"
ORDER BY TP."year"
LIMIT 100;
```

In this corrected query:

- Replace `RA."year"` with `TP."year"` in the outer `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` clauses.
- Now, the outer query references the `"year"` column from the subquery `TP`, where `"year"` is included in the SELECT statement.

**Similarly, update other queries where the alias is misreferenced.**

---

**Adjusted Queries and Steps to Obtain the Final Answer:**

1. **Find Maximum Driver Points per Year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT TP."year", MAX(TP."total_points") AS "max_driver_points"
   FROM (
     SELECT R."driver_id", RA."year", SUM(R."points") AS "total_points"
     FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" R
     JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" RA ON R."race_id" = RA."race_id"
     GROUP BY R."driver_id", RA."year"
   ) TP
   GROUP BY TP."year"
   ORDER BY TP."year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find Maximum Constructor Points per Year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT TP."year", MAX(TP."total_points") AS "max_constructor_points"
   FROM (
     SELECT CR."constructor_id", RA."year", SUM(CR."points") AS "total_points"
     FROM "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS" CR
     JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" RA ON CR."race_id" = RA."race_id"
     GROUP BY CR."constructor_id", RA."year"
   ) TP
   GROUP BY TP."year"
   ORDER BY TP."year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Combine Maximum Driver and Constructor Points per Year and Calculate Sum:**

   ```sql
   SELECT D."year", D."max_driver_points", C."max_constructor_points",
     (D."max_driver_points" + C."max_constructor_points") AS "sum_points"
   FROM (
     SELECT TP."year", MAX(TP."total_points") AS "max_driver_points"
     FROM (
       SELECT R."driver_id", RA."year", SUM(R."points") AS "total_points"
       FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" R
       JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" RA ON R."race_id" = RA."race_id"
       GROUP BY R."driver_id", RA."year"
     ) TP
     GROUP BY TP."year"
   ) D
   JOIN (
     SELECT TP."year", MAX(TP."total_points") AS "max_constructor_points"
     FROM (
       SELECT CR."constructor_id", RA."year", SUM(CR."points") AS "total_points"
       FROM "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS" CR
       JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" RA ON CR."race_id" = RA."race_id"
       GROUP BY CR."constructor_id", RA."year"
     ) TP
     GROUP BY TP."year"
   ) C ON D."year" = C."year"
   ORDER BY "sum_points" ASC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

**Explanation:**

- **Step 1:** Calculate the total points for each driver per year and then find the maximum driver points for each year.
- **Step 2:** Calculate the total points for each constructor per year and then find the maximum constructor points for each year.
- **Step 3:** Join the results from steps 1 and 2 on the `"year"` column and compute the sum of the maximum driver and constructor points for each year.
- **Step 4:** Order the results by the `"sum_points"` in ascending order to find the years with the lowest sums.
- **Step 5:** Limit the result to the top three years.

---

**Final Answer:**

After executing the corrected queries, you will obtain the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest.

```csv
Year,Sum_of_Highest_Points
year1:int,sum1:float
year2:int,sum2:float
year3:int,sum3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

**Note:** Replace `year1`, `year2`, `year3` with the actual years, and `sum1`, `sum2`, `sum3` with the corresponding sums from your query results.

---

**Additional Tips:**

- Ensure all column names and aliases are correctly referenced in each scope of your SQL queries.
- Double-check joins and groupings to make sure they align with your data structure.
- When encountering similar errors, verify that all aliases used in the outer queries are defined at that level or are brought up from subqueries.

**Conclusion:**

By correcting the alias references and executing the updated queries, you can successfully identify the three years with the lowest combined maximum points for drivers and constructors.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

To solve the task, we need to determine the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor for each year, sum them, and then find the three years with the lowest sums. The relevant tables and columns are:

1. **"RESULTS" Table:**
   - **"driver_id"**: Used to identify drivers.
   - **"constructor_id"**: Used to identify constructors.
   - **"race_id"**: Used to link results to races.
   - **"points"**: Points scored by a driver in a race.

2. **"CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS" Table:**
   - **"constructor_id"**: Identifies constructors.
   - **"race_id"**: Links constructor results to races.
   - **"points"**: Points scored by a constructor in a race.

3. **"RACES" Table:**
   - **"race_id"**: Unique identifier for each race.
   - **"year"**: The year in which the race took place.

**Conditions and Joins:**

- Join **"RESULTS"** and **"RACES"** on **"race_id"** to associate driver points with the corresponding year.
- Join **"CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS"** and **"RACES"** on **"race_id"** to associate constructor points with the corresponding year.
- Aggregate points per **"driver_id"** and **"year"** to find total points per driver per year.
- Aggregate points per **"constructor_id"** and **"year"** to find total points per constructor per year.
- Determine the maximum points achieved by any driver and any constructor for each year.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve all unique years from the "RACES" table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
   ORDER BY "year" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **View driver points from the "RESULTS" table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "race_id", "points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Join "RESULTS" and "RACES" to get driver points with years:**

   ```sql
   SELECT R."driver_id", R."race_id", RA."year", R."points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" R

   FROM (
     SELECT R."driver_id", RA."year", SUM(R."points") AS "total_points"
     FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" R
     JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" RA ON R."race_id" = RA."race_id"
     GROUP BY R."driver_id", RA."year"
   ) TP
   GROUP BY RA."year"

Task: List the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To find the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest, we calculate the maximum points for drivers and constructors in each year, sum them, and then select the three years with the lowest sums.

```csv
Year,Sum_of_Highest_Points
year1:int,sum1:float
year2:int,sum2:float
year3:int,sum3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
