Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task of listing the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns, and understand how they can be used.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`DRIVER_STANDINGS`**
   - `"driver_id"`: Identifies each driver.
   - `"race_id"`: Links driver standings to races.
   - `"points"`: Cumulative points of a driver up to that race.

2. **`CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS`**
   - `"constructor_id"`: Identifies each constructor.
   - `"race_id"`: Links constructor standings to races.
   - `"points"`: Cumulative points of a constructor up to that race.

3. **`RACES`**
   - `"race_id"`: Unique identifier for each race.
   - `"year"`: The year in which the race took place.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Joins:**
  - Join `"DRIVER_STANDINGS"` and `"RACES"` on `"race_id"` to get the year for driver standings.
  - Join `"CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS"` and `"RACES"` on `"race_id"` to get the year for constructor standings.
  
- **Aggregations:**
  - Use `MAX("points")` to find the highest points achieved by any driver or constructor in a given year.
  - Group data by `"year"` to aggregate yearly standings.
  
- **Ordering:**
  - Order the results by the sum of the highest points to identify the years with the lowest sums.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

```sql
-- Query 1: List all available years from the RACES table
SELECT DISTINCT "year"
FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
ORDER BY "year" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql

SELECT "race_id", "year"

```

```sql
-- Query 3: Get maximum points per driver across all races
SELECT "driver_id", MAX("points") AS "max_points"
FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVER_STANDINGS"

```

```sql
-- Query 4: Get driver standings with race years included
SELECT ds."driver_id", r."year", ds."race_id", ds."points"
FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVER_STANDINGS" ds

  ON ds."race_id" = r."race_id"

These queries help us understand how the data is structured and how we can extract the necessary information to address the task. They explore the relationships between drivers, constructors, races, and points, and set the foundation for calculating and comparing the sums of the highest points across different years.Query:

Task: List the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To find the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest, we calculate the maximum points for drivers and constructors in each year, sum them, and then select the three years with the lowest sums.

```csv
Year,Sum_of_Highest_Points
year1:int,sum1:float
year2:int,sum2:float
year3:int,sum3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 19:07:46 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing List the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest, we calculate the maximum points for drivers and constructors in each year, sum them, and then select the three years with the lowest sums.

```csv
Year,Sum_of_Highest_Points
year1:int,sum1:float
year2:int,sum2:float
year3:int,sum3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
