Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task of listing the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest, we need to analyze the relevant tables and columns. 

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`F1.F1.RESULTS`**
   - `"driver_id"`: To identify each driver.
   - `"constructor_id"`: To identify each constructor.
   - `"race_id"`: To link results to races and get the year.
   - `"points"`: Points earned by a driver in a race (used to calculate total points per driver and per constructor).

2. **`F1.F1.RACES`**
   - `"race_id"`: To join with results and get the year.
   - `"year"`: The year of the race.

3. **`F1.F1.DRIVERS`**
   - `"driver_id"`: To identify drivers (if needed for additional details).

4. **`F1.F1.CONSTRUCTORS`**
   - `"constructor_id"`: To identify constructors (if needed for additional details).

**Potential Usage:**

- `"RESULTS"."points"`: To calculate total points per driver and per constructor per year.
- `"RESULTS"."driver_id"` and `"RESULTS"."constructor_id"`: To group points by driver and constructor.
- `"RESULTS"."race_id"` and `"RACES"."race_id"`: To join these tables and obtain the year.
- `"RACES"."year"`: To group data per year.
- Conditions may include grouping by year and ordering the results to find the maximum points.

    ) AS "constructor_max"
ON "driver_max"."year" = "constructor_max"."year"
ORDER BY "sum_of_highest_points" ASC
LIMIT 3;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Queries 1-4**: Basic retrievals to understand the data in RACES, DRIVERS, and CONSTRUCTORS tables.
- **Queries 5-6**: Fetching points from RESULTS and joining with RACES to get the year.
- **Queries 7-8**: Calculating total points per driver per year and finding the maximum driver points per year.
- **Queries 9-10**: Calculating total points per constructor per year and finding the maximum constructor points per year.
- **Query 11**: Combining maximum driver and constructor points per year into a single result set.
- **Query 12**: Calculating the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and constructor per year.
- **Query 13**: Listing the three years with the lowest sum of highest points achieved by any driver and constructor.

These queries gradually build upon each other to address different aspects of the task, ultimately leading to the solution.

Task: List the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To find the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest, we calculate the maximum points for drivers and constructors in each year, sum them, and then select the three years with the lowest sums.

```csv
Year,Sum_of_Highest_Points
year1:int,sum1:float
year2:int,sum2:float
year3:int,sum3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
