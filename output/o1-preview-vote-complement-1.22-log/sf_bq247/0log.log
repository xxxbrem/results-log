US-5560978-A,"A basecoat for a nonstick coating system wherein the basecoat comprises a high temperature binder resin, preferably polyamideimide resin, and a filamentary powder, preferably a nickel powder, which is combined with the high temperature binder to yield a spongelike coating which with appropriate application has a rough surface and an internal structure containing interlocking channels. These channels may be impregnated by subsequently applied coatings, especially nonstick fluoropolymer coatings."
US-5590131-A,"An efficient distributed queueing random access method and network system provide, in the medium access control layer in networks with broadcast channels, for conserving reservation bandwidth and concomitantly providing immediate transmission access, wherein, prior to receiving a first time slot, a plurality of reservation slot parameters are initialized by a user."
US-5596790-A,"The invention relates to a hose clamp (1) with a clamp body (3) which encloses a hose end (2) essentially in a ring with overlapping end areas (4,5). In the clamped state, the clamp body has an initial diameter, and using a clamping tool, the clamp body (3) can be spread to a second, larger diameter against its own spring force. In a first end area (4), there is a catch projection (6) which is offset rearward relative to its outer front edge (7) and which can be engaged with a second end area (5) of the clamp body (3) to achieve the spread state. The second end area (5) has a longitudinally extended recess (8) which holds first end area (4) which is correspondingly narrower. To be able to easily spread and release hose clamp (1), in a way which enables the attainment of the spread state is to be easily recognizable, a catch projection (6) is provided on the first end area (4,) in the spread state of the clamp body, rests against the front edge (10) of the second end area (5)."
US-5614871-A,"There is disclosed a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit capable of being operated at low power supply voltages and accomplishing low electric power consumption. The circuit permits the duty cycle to be controlled well. The circuit is capable of operating at high speeds. The circuit comprises a first and a second dynamic latch circuits producing oscillation output. Each dynamic latch circuit consists of a series combination of a P-channel MOS transistor and an N-channel MOS transistor. An output terminal is connected to the junction of these two transistors. The output from each latch circuit is inverted according to the voltage at the gate of each MOS transistor and dynamically latches the state of the output. This inversion is performed by turning on the MOS transistors by first and second capacitive elements and by first and second comparator circuits. The capacitive elements are charged and discharged by the outputs from the dynamic latch circuits. Voltages for charging the capacitive elements are applied to the comparator circuits. The switching operation is performed at a higher speed than where a flop-flop is used. Consequently, the oscillation frequency is improved. These MOS transistors do not simultaneously conduct and so electric currents passing through the transistors can be suppressed. Since the timing at which the inversion is made is determined by the charging rates of the capacitive elements, the duty cycle can be controlled well."
US-5635026-A,"Chemical (typically kraft) pulp having enhanced intrinsic fiber strength and bleachability compared to pulp produced using conventional or modified kraft cooking is produced by using high alkali and/or pH cooking. After being impregnated with a first cooking liquor (e.g. white liquor) having low effective alkali, the first liquor is extracted from the pulp, and it is impregnated with a second cooking liquor having an effective alkali concentration of at least 25 g/l and cooked at cooking temperature (e.g. 140°-190° C.) to produce a spent second cooking liquor having a residual effective alkali concentration of at least about 15 g/l, which is then extracted from the pulp. The spent second liquor may be used to preheat incoming white liquor, and then flashed and used as the first liquor. The pH of the first liquor is typically less than about 13.0, and the residual pH of the spent second liquor is about 13.0 or more."

Begin Exploring Related Columns
Certainly! Let's consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task.

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

- **Table**: `PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS`
  - **Column**: `"family_id"`: Used to group publications by family and count the number of publications per family.
  - **Column**: `"publication_number"`: Used to identify individual publications and to join with other tables.
  - **Column**: `"abstract_localized"`: Contains the abstract in a VARIANT (JSON-like) format, which may need to be parsed to extract the abstract text.

- **Table**: `PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.ABS_AND_EMB`
  - **Column**: `"publication_number"`: Used to join with the `PUBLICATIONS` table.
  - **Column**: `"abstract"`: Contains the abstract as a VARCHAR, which may be easier to work with.
  - **Column**: `"abstract_translated"`: Indicates if the abstract was translated.

### Potential Conditions:

- Exclude publications with empty abstracts.
- Limit the results to the top 6 families with the most publications.
- Join tables on `"publication_number"` to access abstracts.
- Extract text from VARIANT columns using JSON parsing functions.

US-5560978-A,"A basecoat for a nonstick coating system wherein the basecoat comprises a high temperature binder resin, preferably polyamideimide resin, and a filamentary powder, preferably a nickel powder, which is combined with the high temperature binder to yield a spongelike coating which with appropriate application has a rough surface and an internal structure containing interlocking channels. These channels may be impregnated by subsequently applied coatings, especially nonstick fluoropolymer coatings."
US-5590131-A,"An efficient distributed queueing random access method and network system provide, in the medium access control layer in networks with broadcast channels, for conserving reservation bandwidth and concomitantly providing immediate transmission access, wherein, prior to receiving a first time slot, a plurality of reservation slot parameters are initialized by a user."
US-5596790-A,"The invention relates to a hose clamp (1) with a clamp body (3) which encloses a hose end (2) essentially in a ring with overlapping end areas (4,5). In the clamped state, the clamp body has an initial diameter, and using a clamping tool, the clamp body (3) can be spread to a second, larger diameter against its own spring force. In a first end area (4), there is a catch projection (6) which is offset rearward relative to its outer front edge (7) and which can be engaged with a second end area (5) of the clamp body (3) to achieve the spread state. The second end area (5) has a longitudinally extended recess (8) which holds first end area (4) which is correspondingly narrower. To be able to easily spread and release hose clamp (1), in a way which enables the attainment of the spread state is to be easily recognizable, a catch projection (6) is provided on the first end area (4,) in the spread state of the clamp body, rests against the front edge (10) of the second end area (5)."
US-5614871-A,"There is disclosed a voltage-controlled oscillator circuit capable of being operated at low power supply voltages and accomplishing low electric power consumption. The circuit permits the duty cycle to be controlled well. The circuit is capable of operating at high speeds. The circuit comprises a first and a second dynamic latch circuits producing oscillation output. Each dynamic latch circuit consists of a series combination of a P-channel MOS transistor and an N-channel MOS transistor. An output terminal is connected to the junction of these two transistors. The output from each latch circuit is inverted according to the voltage at the gate of each MOS transistor and dynamically latches the state of the output. This inversion is performed by turning on the MOS transistors by first and second capacitive elements and by first and second comparator circuits. The capacitive elements are charged and discharged by the outputs from the dynamic latch circuits. Voltages for charging the capacitive elements are applied to the comparator circuits. The switching operation is performed at a higher speed than where a flop-flop is used. Consequently, the oscillation frequency is improved. These MOS transistors do not simultaneously conduct and so electric currents passing through the transistors can be suppressed. Since the timing at which the inversion is made is determined by the charging rates of the capacitive elements, the duty cycle can be controlled well."
US-5635026-A,"Chemical (typically kraft) pulp having enhanced intrinsic fiber strength and bleachability compared to pulp produced using conventional or modified kraft cooking is produced by using high alkali and/or pH cooking. After being impregnated with a first cooking liquor (e.g. white liquor) having low effective alkali, the first liquor is extracted from the pulp, and it is impregnated with a second cooking liquor having an effective alkali concentration of at least 25 g/l and cooked at cooking temperature (e.g. 140°-190° C.) to produce a spent second cooking liquor having a residual effective alkali concentration of at least about 15 g/l, which is then extracted from the pulp. The spent second liquor may be used to preheat incoming white liquor, and then flashed and used as the first liquor. The pH of the first liquor is typically less than about 13.0, and the residual pH of the spent second liquor is about 13.0 or more."

Task: For the top 6 valid family has the most publications? provide their family id and non-empty publication abstracts.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
family_id,abstract_localized
family_id1:str,abstract1:str
family_id1:str,abstract2:str
...
family_id2:str,abstract1:str
...
family_id3:str,abstract1:str
...
family_id4:str,abstract1:str
...
family_id5:str,abstract1:str
...
family_id6:str,abstract1:str
...
```
(Attention: Listed are the top 6 valid family_ids with the most publications and their non-empty publication abstracts.).
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS_GOOGLE': {'PATENTS_GOOGLE': ['ABS_AND_EMB', 'CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
