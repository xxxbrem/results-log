After comparing both SQL queries, I recommend selecting **`1result.sql`** as the correct script for the following reasons:

1. **Alignment with Kruskal-Wallis Formula**: The second SQL query (`1result.sql`) closely follows the standard Kruskal-Wallis H-score formula:
   \[
   H = \frac{12}{N(N+1)} \sum_{i=1}^{g} n_i (\bar{R}_i - \bar{R})^2
   \]
   - **`N`**: Total number of observations.
   - **`n_i`**: Number of observations in group *i*.
   - **`R̄_i`**: Average rank of group *i*.
   - **`R̄`**: Overall mean rank.

2. **Correct Handling of Ranks and Ties**:
   - The query computes ranks using the `RANK()` window function.
   - It calculates average ranks for tied values, which is essential for the Kruskal-Wallis test when data contain ties.
   - By using `AVG(r.rank_start) OVER (PARTITION BY r."log_expression")`, it ensures tied observations share the same average rank.

3. **Accurate Calculation of Group Statistics**:
   - It computes group-wise counts (`n_i`), sum of ranks (`sum_ranks`), and average ranks (`R_i`) correctly.
   - The total statistics (`N` and `mean_rank`) are accurately derived from the data.

4. **Direct Application of the H-score Formula**:
   - The final H-score is calculated using:
     ```sql
     ROUND(
         (12.0 / (sum_term.N * (sum_term.N + 1))) * sum_term.sum_value, 4
     ) AS "H-score"
     ```
   - This matches the standard formula without omitting any terms.

5. **Simplicity and Clarity**:
   - The second query is more straightforward, making it easier to verify each step.
   - It reduces potential errors associated with more complex calculations in the first query.

6. **Consistency with Statistical Methods**:
   - The method used in `1result.sql` is consistent with how statistical software packages (e.g., R, Python's SciPy) compute the Kruskal-Wallis test.

Given these reasons, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script to compute the Kruskal-Wallis H-score for the given data.
