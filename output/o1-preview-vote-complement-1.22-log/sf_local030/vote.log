Upon comparing the two SQL queries and their results, here are the observations:

---

### **Option 1: `0result.sql`**

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT city_payments."customer_city" AS "city", ROUND(city_stats."average_payment", 4) AS "average_payment", city_stats."order_count"
FROM
(
    SELECT c."customer_city", SUM(op."payment_value") AS "total_payments"
    FROM "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."OLIST_ORDERS" AS o
    JOIN "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."OLIST_CUSTOMERS" AS c
      ON o."customer_id" = c."customer_id"
    JOIN "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."OLIST_ORDER_PAYMENTS" AS op
      ON o."order_id" = op."order_id"
    WHERE o."order_status" = 'delivered'
    GROUP BY c."customer_city"
    ORDER BY "total_payments" ASC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 5
) AS city_payments
JOIN
(
    SELECT c."customer_city", ROUND(AVG(op."payment_value"), 4) AS "average_payment", COUNT(DISTINCT o."order_id") AS "order_count"
    FROM "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."OLIST_ORDERS" AS o
    JOIN "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."OLIST_CUSTOMERS" AS c
      ON o."customer_id" = c."customer_id"
    JOIN "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."OLIST_ORDER_PAYMENTS" AS op
      ON o."order_id" = op."order_id"
    WHERE o."order_status" = 'delivered'
    GROUP BY c."customer_city"
) AS city_stats
ON city_payments."customer_city" = city_stats."customer_city"
ORDER BY city_payments."total_payments" ASC;
```

**Result (`0result.csv`):**

```
city,average_payment,order_count
sabaudia,20.42,1
polo petroquimico de triunfo,20.70,1
jenipapo de minas,22.58,1
tamboara,24.09,1
santo antonio do rio abaixo,24.23,1
```

### **Option 2: `2result.sql`**

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    "c"."customer_city" AS "city",
    ROUND(AVG("p"."payment_value"), 4) AS "average_payment",
    COUNT(DISTINCT "o"."order_id") AS "order_count"
FROM
    "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."OLIST_CUSTOMERS" AS "c"
    JOIN "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."OLIST_ORDERS" AS "o"
        ON "c"."customer_id" = "o"."customer_id"
    JOIN "BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE"."OLIST_ORDER_PAYMENTS" AS "p"
        ON "o"."order_id" = "p"."order_id"
WHERE
    "o"."order_status" = 'delivered'
GROUP BY
    "c"."customer_city"
ORDER BY
    SUM("p"."payment_value") ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Result (`2result.csv`):**

```
city,average_payment,order_count
sabaudia,20.42,1
polo petroquimico de triunfo,20.70,1
jenipapo de minas,22.58,1
tamboara,24.09,1
santo antonio do rio abaixo,24.23,1
```

### **Comparison and Decision:**

**Similarities:**

- Both queries aim to find the **average payments and order counts** for the **five cities with the lowest total payments** from delivered orders.
- Both queries filter orders where `"order_status" = 'delivered'`.
- The results from both queries are identical, listing the same five cities with their average payments and order counts.

**Differences:**

- **Option 1 (`0result.sql`):**
  - Uses **subqueries and a JOIN** to first select the five cities with the lowest total payments (`city_payments`), then joins with a subquery containing all city statistics (`city_stats`).
  - It involves two separate aggregations and an explicit join on `"customer_city"`.

- **Option 2 (`2result.sql`):**
  - Performs the calculations in a **single query** without additional subqueries or joins.
  - Groups by `"customer_city"`, calculates average payment and order count, and orders the results by the sum of payments per city.
  - It directly limits the result to the top five cities after ordering.

**Reasoning:**

- **Efficiency and Simplicity:**
  - Option 2 is **more concise and efficient** because it achieves the desired result in one query without the complexity of subqueries and additional joins.
  - It reduces the computational overhead by eliminating unnecessary steps.

- **Readability and Maintenance:**
  - Option 2 is **easier to read and maintain** due to its straightforward approach.
  - It clearly shows the grouping, aggregation, and ordering in a sequential manner.

- **Best Practice:**
  - Using a single query when possible is generally a better practice as it simplifies the SQL script and can improve performance.
  - It reduces the chance for errors that might occur when managing multiple subqueries and joins.

**Conclusion:**

- **Option 2 (`2result.sql`)** is the **correct answer** as it efficiently fulfills the task requirements using a simpler and more effective approach.
- It provides the same accurate results with less complexity.
