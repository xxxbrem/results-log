## Projection Calculation Method

### Steps for Projection Calculation

1. **Aggregate Historical Sales Data**

   - **Data Collection**: Gather sales data for products sold in France, including sales amounts each month for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.
   - **Summarize Sales**: Sum up the sales amounts for each product, country, month, and year.

2. **Calculate Average Sales**

   - **Monthly Averages**: Compute the average sales amount for each product and month across all available months to establish a baseline of typical sales.

3. **Project Sales for 2021**

   - **Identify Changes**: Determine how sales changed from 2019 to 2020 for each product and month. Calculate the percentage change in sales from 2019 to 2020.
   - **Apply Changes**: Use this percentage change to estimate the sales for each month in 2021.

   **Projection Formula**:
   - For 2021:
     - Calculate the difference in sales between 2020 and 2019.
     - Compute the percentage change relative to 2019 sales.
     - Apply this percentage change to the 2020 sales to estimate 2021 sales.
     - The formula used in the SQL query is:

       ```plaintext
       (((Sales in 2020 - Sales in 2019) / Sales in 2019) * Sales in 2020) + Sales in 2020
       ```

     - This formula calculates the projected sales for 2021 based on the observed trend from 2019 to 2020.

   - For other years (not 2021):
     - Use the average sales value calculated for each month.

4. **Adjust for Currency Conversion**

   - **Conversion Rates**: Convert the projected sales figures into USD using monthly conversion rates.
   - **Currency Adjustment**: Multiply the projected sales figures by the conversion rates to adjust to USD. If specific rates are not available, use a default rate of 1.

5. **Calculate Monthly Averages in USD**

   - **Monthly Projections**: Compute the average projected sales for each month in 2021, adjusting for currency conversion. Round the results to two decimal places.

6. **Compile Results**

   - **Organize Data**: Arrange the projected sales figures in a report, showing the estimated sales for each month in USD.

### Summary

The projection calculation involves analyzing historical sales data from 2019 and 2020 to determine trends, applying these trends to estimate sales for 2021, and adjusting for currency differences. The result is a forecast of monthly sales in USD for 2021.

Task: What is the average monthly projected sales in USD for France in 2021? Please use data from 2019 and 2020 for projection. Ensure all values are converted to USD based on the 2021 exchange rates.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Month,Projected_Sales_USD
January,projected_sales1:float
February,projected_sales2:float
March,projected_sales3:float
April,projected_sales4:float
May,projected_sales5:float
June,projected_sales6:float
July,projected_sales7:float
August,projected_sales8:float
September,projected_sales9:float
October,projected_sales10:float
November,projected_sales11:float
December,projected_sales12:float
```

**Explanation:**

The projected average monthly sales in USD for France in 2021 are calculated using historical sales data from 2019 and 2020. The steps involved in the projection are:

1. **Data Aggregation**: Sales data for France from 2019 and 2020 are aggregated monthly to obtain total sales amounts for each month.

2. **Percentage Change Calculation**: For each month, the percentage change in sales from 2019 to 2020 is calculated using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Sales}_{2020} - \text{Sales}_{2019}}{\text{Sales}_{2019}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]

3. **Sales Projection for 2021**: The calculated percentage change is applied to the 2020 sales to estimate the 2021 sales for each month:

   \[
   \text{Projected Sales}_{2021} = \text{Sales}_{2020} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Percentage Change}}{100\%}\right)
   \]

4. **Currency Conversion**: The projected sales amounts are converted to USD using the 2021 monthly exchange rates from the `CURRENCY` table. If specific rates are not available, a default rate of 1 is used.

5. **Result Compilation**: The projected sales in USD for each month are averaged and presented in the table above.

These projections provide an estimate of the average monthly sales in USD for France in 2021, helping in financial planning and analysis..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'COMPLEX_ORACLE': {'COMPLEX_ORACLE': ['CHANNELS', 'COSTS', 'COUNTRIES', 'CURRENCY', 'CUSTOMERS', 'PRODUCTS', 'PROMOTIONS', 'SALES', 'SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'TIMES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 06:43:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the average monthly projected sales in USD for France in 2021? Please use data from 2019 and 2020 for projection. Ensure all values are converted to USD based on the 2021 exchange rates., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Month,Projected_Sales_USD
January,projected_sales1:float
February,projected_sales2:float
March,projected_sales3:float
April,projected_sales4:float
May,projected_sales5:float
June,projected_sales6:float
July,projected_sales7:float
August,projected_sales8:float
September,projected_sales9:float
October,projected_sales10:float
November,projected_sales11:float
December,projected_sales12:float
```

**Explanation:**

The projected average monthly sales in USD for France in 2021 are calculated using historical sales data from 2019 and 2020. The steps involved in the projection are:

1. **Data Aggregation**: Sales data for France from 2019 and 2020 are aggregated monthly to obtain total sales amounts for each month.

2. **Percentage Change Calculation**: For each month, the percentage change in sales from 2019 to 2020 is calculated using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Sales}_{2020} - \text{Sales}_{2019}}{\text{Sales}_{2019}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]

3. **Sales Projection for 2021**: The calculated percentage change is applied to the 2020 sales to estimate the 2021 sales for each month:

   \[
   \text{Projected Sales}_{2021} = \text{Sales}_{2020} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Percentage Change}}{100\%}\right)
   \]

4. **Currency Conversion**: The projected sales amounts are converted to USD using the 2021 monthly exchange rates from the `CURRENCY` table. If specific rates are not available, a default rate of 1 is used.

5. **Result Compilation**: The projected sales in USD for each month are averaged and presented in the table above.

These projections provide an estimate of the average monthly sales in USD for France in 2021, helping in financial planning and analysis. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
