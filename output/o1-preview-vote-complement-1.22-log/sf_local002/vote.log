After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Category Filtering:** `0result.sql` correctly joins the `PRODUCT_CATEGORY_NAME_TRANSLATION` table to filter products where the English category name is 'toys'. This approach ensures that all toy products are included, even if there are variations or multiple Portuguese category names corresponding to 'toys'.

- **Robust and Maintainable:** By using the English category name, the query is more maintainable and less prone to errors that might arise from hardcoding the Portuguese category name 'brinquedos', as done in `1result.sql`.

- **Consistent Date Calculations:** `0result.sql` calculates the day number (`day_num`) by taking the difference from '2017-01-01', which aligns precisely with the start date of the training data period.

- **Same Results with Better Methodology:** Although both queries produce the same numerical result for the total moving averages, `0result.sql` achieves this through a more reliable and semantically clear method, enhancing code readability and future-proofing the query against potential data changes.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**
