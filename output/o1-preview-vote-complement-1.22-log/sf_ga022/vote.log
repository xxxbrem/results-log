**Answer:**

After analyzing the three SQL queries, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct and most appropriate SQL script for calculating the weekly customer retention rate as per the given requirements.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Explicit Timezone Conversion:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses the `CONVERT_TIMEZONE` function to accurately convert the `user_first_touch_timestamp` from UTC to Shanghai timezone (`Asia/Shanghai`). This ensures that users are correctly included in the cohort based on the Shanghai timezone, which was specified in the task.
   - The conversion is done using:
     ```sql
     CONVERT_TIMEZONE('UTC', 'Asia/Shanghai', TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("user_first_touch_timestamp" / 1000000)) AS "first_touch_time_shanghai"
     ```
   - This method reduces the risk of errors related to timezone offsets and daylight saving time changes.

2. **Clear Cohort Definition:**
   - By converting timestamps to Shanghai time and comparing them directly to `'2018-09-01 00:00:00'` and `'2018-09-07 23:59:59'`, it is clear that the cohort includes users who first used the app within the exact period specified.
   - The condition used is:
     ```sql
     WHERE "first_touch_time_shanghai" >= '2018-09-01 00:00:00' AND "first_touch_time_shanghai" <= '2018-09-07 23:59:59'
     ```

3. **Comprehensive Event Inclusion:**
   - The script unions all event tables from September 1st to September 28th to ensure that all relevant events are considered when calculating retention over the following three weeks.
   - It categorizes users based on the week they returned using the `CASE` statement, which enhances readability and maintainability.

4. **Readability and Maintainability:**
   - The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) like `cohort`, `events_after_cohort`, and `week_users` makes the query modular and easier to understand.
   - Explicitly naming weeks as `'Week 1'`, `'Week 2'`, and `'Week 3'` makes the final output clear.

5. **Avoids Hardcoded Timestamp Values:**
   - Unlike the other scripts, **`0result.sql`** does not use hardcoded microsecond timestamp values, which can be error-prone and less transparent.
   - By performing the timezone conversion and using standard datetime strings for comparison, the script ensures accuracy and makes it easier for others to verify or modify the date ranges if needed.

**Conclusion:**

Given these reasons, **`0result.sql`** is the most appropriate and correct script for calculating the weekly customer retention rate for new users who first used the app in the first week of September 2018 in Shanghai timezone.
