**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `_1000_GENOMES`.`VARIANTS`
  - `"reference_name"`: Reference names (chromosome numbers)
  - `"start"`: Start positions of the variants
  - `"end"`: End positions of the variants
  - `"reference_bases"`: Reference bases
  - `"alternate_bases"`: Alternate bases
  - `"VT"`: Variant type
  - `"SVTYPE"`: Structural variant type
  - `"HWE"`: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium chi-squared score
  - `"AF"`: Allele frequency
  - `"AC"`: Allele counts (possibly in VARIANT format)
  - `"AN"`: Total number of alleles
  - `"call"`: Genotype calls (VARIANT type containing individual genotype information)

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `"reference_name" = '17'` to select variants on chromosome 17
- `"start" >= 41196311 AND "end" <= 41277499` to select variants within the specified position range
- `"VT"` filters for specific variant types (e.g., `"VT" = 'SNP'`)
- `"HWE" IS NOT NULL` to select variants with available chi-squared scores

Task: What are the reference names, start positions, end positions, reference bases, alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores (calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), and the observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, including their allele frequencies and allele frequencies, for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41196311 and 41277499?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)

This table provides information about variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41,196,311 and 41,277,499. It includes the reference names, start and end positions, reference and alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, as well as their allele frequencies..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'_1000_GENOMES': {'_1000_GENOMES': ['PEDIGREE', 'SAMPLE_INFO', 'VARIANTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
