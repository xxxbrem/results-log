Begin Exploring Related Columns
Consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task.

**Table:** `VARIANTS`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `"reference_name"`: Contains the reference names (e.g., chromosome numbers like '17'). Used to filter variants on chromosome 17.
- `"start"`: Start positions of the variants. Used to select variants within the specified position range.
- `"end"`: End positions of the variants.
- `"reference_bases"`: The reference bases at the variant position.
- `"alternate_bases"`: The alternate bases for the variant.
- `"VT"`: Variant type (e.g., 'SNP', 'INDEL'). Used to identify variant types.
- `"HWE"`: Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium chi-squared score. Used as the chi-squared scores.
- `"AF"`: Allele frequency. Used to get allele frequencies.
- `"AC"`: Allele count of the alternate allele.
- `"AN"`: Total number of alleles, used to calculate expected genotype counts.
- `"call"`: Contains genotype calls for samples. Could be used to calculate observed genotype counts.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filter for chromosome 17: `"reference_name" = '17'`
- Position range filter: `"start" BETWEEN 41196311 AND 41277499`
- Non-null values: e.g., `"HWE" IS NOT NULL`

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: What are the reference names, start positions, end positions, reference bases, alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores (calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), and the observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, including their allele frequencies and allele frequencies, for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41196311 and 41277499?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
reference_name,start,end,reference_bases,alternate_bases,variant_type,chi_squared_score,observed_homo_ref,observed_heterozygous,observed_homo_alt,expected_homo_ref,expected_heterozygous,expected_homo_alt,allele_frequency
reference_name:str,start:int,end:int,reference_bases:str,alternate_bases:str,variant_type:str,chi_squared_score:float,observed_homo_ref:int,observed_heterozygous:int,observed_homo_alt:int,expected_homo_ref:float,expected_heterozygous:float,expected_homo_alt:float,allele_frequency:float
reference_name:str,start:int,end:int,reference_bases:str,alternate_bases:str,variant_type:str,chi_squared_score:float,observed_homo_ref:int,observed_heterozygous:int,observed_homo_alt:int,expected_homo_ref:float,expected_heterozygous:float,expected_homo_alt:float,allele_frequency:float
...
```

This table provides information about variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41,196,311 and 41,277,499. It includes the reference names, start and end positions, reference and alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, as well as their allele frequencies..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'_1000_GENOMES': {'_1000_GENOMES': ['PEDIGREE', 'SAMPLE_INFO', 'VARIANTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

This table provides information about variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41,196,311 and 41,277,499. It includes the reference names, start and end positions, reference and alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, as well as their allele frequencies. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-25 08:07:27 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the reference names, start positions, end positions, reference bases, alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores (calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), and the observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, including their allele frequencies and allele frequencies, for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41196311 and 41277499?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

This table provides information about variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41,196,311 and 41,277,499. It includes the reference names, start and end positions, reference and alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, as well as their allele frequencies. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
