**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **PACKAGING**

  - `"id"`: Unique identifier for a packaging item.
    - *Potential usage*: To identify each packaging combination.
  - `"name"`: Name of the packaging item.
    - *Potential usage*: To display or filter packaging combinations by name.

- **PACKAGING_RELATIONS**

  - `"packaging_id"`: ID of the packaging item that contains other items.
    - *Potential usage*: To find which items are contained within each packaging combination.
  - `"contains_id"`: ID of the item that is contained within another packaging item.
    - *Potential usage*: To identify the items contained within each packaging combination.
  - `"qty"`: Quantity of the contained item within the packaging combination.
    - *Potential usage*: To calculate the total quantity of items within each packaging combination.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Joining **PACKAGING** and **PACKAGING_RELATIONS** tables on `"id"` and `"packaging_id"` or `"contains_id"` to relate packaging combinations with their contents.
- Filtering packaging items that are not contained within any other packaging (top-level packaging combinations).
- Aggregating quantities to compute total quantities within combinations.
- Using `DISTINCT` to find unique packaging items or combinations.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Select all packaging items:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "name"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **Select all packaging relations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "packaging_id", "contains_id", "qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **List packaging combinations and their contained items with quantities:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."name" AS "packaging_name", c."name" AS "contained_item_name", pr."qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS pr
    JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING p ON pr."packaging_id" = p."id"
    JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING c ON pr."contains_id" = c."id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Find packaging items not contained within any other packaging (top-level packaging):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "name"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING
    WHERE "id" NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **Select packaging items that do not contain any other items (leaf packaging items):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "name"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING
    WHERE "id" NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "packaging_id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Get the total quantity of items directly contained in each packaging combination:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "packaging_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_direct_qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
    GROUP BY "packaging_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **List packaging combinations with the number of different items they contain:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "packaging_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "contains_id") AS "number_of_contained_items"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
    GROUP BY "packaging_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. **Select packaging relations where quantity is greater than a specific value (e.g., 5):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "packaging_id", "contains_id", "qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
    WHERE "qty" > 5
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **List all packaging items with their total direct quantities (including those with no contents):**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."id", p."name", COALESCE(SUM(pr."qty"), 0) AS "direct_total_qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING p
    LEFT JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS pr ON p."id" = pr."packaging_id"
    GROUP BY p."id", p."name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **Find total quantity each item is contained across all packaging combinations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "contains_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty_contained"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
    GROUP BY "contains_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: What is the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering all items contained within each combination?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
average_total_quantity
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The average total quantity across all final packaging combinations is calculated by summing the quantities of all items contained within each final packaging combination, including all nested items and their quantities, and then computing the average of these totals across all final packaging combinations..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The average total quantity across all final packaging combinations is calculated by summing the quantities of all items contained within each final packaging combination, including all nested items and their quantities, and then computing the average of these totals across all final packaging combinations. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
