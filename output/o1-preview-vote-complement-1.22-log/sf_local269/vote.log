The correct SQL query is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

Both `0result.sql` and `1result.sql` aim to calculate the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering all items contained within each combination (including nested items). They both use recursive common table expressions (CTEs) to achieve this, and both yield the correct average total quantity of **946.0000**.

However, after comparing the two queries, `1result.sql` is chosen as the correct answer because:

1. **Clarity and Simplicity:**

   - `1result.sql` constructs the recursive CTE `RecursivePackaging` starting from the final packaging combinations (those not contained within any other packaging) and recursively joins the `PACKAGING_RELATIONS` to traverse down to the leaf items (bottles).
   - It defines `LeafItems` separately, making the logic clear when filtering for leaf items in the summation.
   - The query is straightforward and easier to understand, making it more maintainable.

2. **Accurate Reflection of the Problem:**

   - The query accurately reflects the hierarchical structure of the packaging combinations, properly multiplying quantities at each level of nesting.
   - It ensures that only the quantities of leaf items (actual products, not further packaging) are summed to calculate the total quantity per final packaging.

3. **Efficient Use of SQL Constructs:**

   - By utilizing a well-structured recursive CTE and clear joins, the query is efficient and leverages SQL's capabilities effectively.
   - It avoids unnecessary complexity, such as CASE statements or additional subqueries, that are present in `0result.sql`.

In conclusion, `1result.sql` provides a correct, clear, and efficient solution to the problem, making it the preferred choice.
