After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL that answers the task.

**Reasoning:**

- **Task Requirements:**
  - **Find the most common next page** after `/home` pages for visitors who were part of the **"Data Share"** campaign in **January 2017**.
  - **Determine the maximum duration time** (in seconds) that these visitors spent on the `/home` page.

- **Analysis of SQL Queries:**

  - **`0result.sql`:**
    - **Most Common Next Page:** `/google+redesign/apparel/men++s/men++s+outerwear`
    - **Maximum Duration Seconds:** `1785.2740`
    - **Issue:** According to prior sample data, the most common next page after `/home` is `/home` itself, not `/google+redesign/apparel/men++s/men++s+outerwear`. Therefore, this result does not align with the expected outcome.

  - **`1result.sql`:**
    - **Most Common Next Page:** `/home`
    - **Maximum Duration Seconds:** `1547.9700`
    - **Issue:** While it correctly identifies `/home` as the most common next page, the maximum duration is lower than that observed in prior data (e.g., `1785.2740` seconds in `2result.sql`). This suggests it may not have captured the maximum duration accurately.

  - **`2result.sql`:**
    - **Most Common Next Page:** `/home`
    - **Maximum Duration Seconds:** `1785.2740`
    - **Alignment with Task:**
      - Correctly identifies `/home` as the most common next page after `/home` pages for the "Data Share" campaign in January 2017.
      - Provides the maximum duration time that matches the highest observed duration in the data.
    - **Conclusion:** This SQL query best fulfills the task requirements.
