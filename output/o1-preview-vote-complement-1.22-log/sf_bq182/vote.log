After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here's the reasoning:

- **Structured Approach with CTEs**: `2result.sql` uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into logical steps, enhancing readability and maintainability.
  
  - **`pull_requests` CTE**: Extracts repositories involved in pull request events on January 18, 2023.
  - **`pull_requests_per_repo` CTE**: Calculates the number of pull requests per repository.
  - **`primary_language_per_repo` CTE**: Determines the primary language for each repository based on the highest byte count.
  - **`repos_with_primary_language` CTE**: Selects repositories and their primary languages.
  
- **Accurate Calculation**: The query correctly joins the repositories' primary languages with their respective pull request counts and sums the total pull requests per language.
  
- **Correct Filtering and Ordering**: It filters programming languages with more than 5 pull requests and orders the results by `total_pull_requests` in descending order, which aligns with the task's requirements.

Therefore, the SQL query in `2result.sql` accurately addresses the task.
