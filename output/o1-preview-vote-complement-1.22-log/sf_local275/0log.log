This SQL query identifies the products (by name) that had a seasonality-adjusted sales ratio consistently above 2 for every month in 2017, based on monthly sales data from January 2016 through December 2017.

- **Calculations:**
  - **Sales Data Selection:** Selects sales data for each product from January 2016 to December 2017.
  - **Centered Moving Average (CMA):** Computes the CMA for each month and product using two overlapping 12-month windows:
    - The first average (`cma1`) uses 5 months before and 6 months after the current month.
    - The second average (`cma2`) uses 6 months before and 5 months after the current month.
    - The overall CMA is the average of `cma1` and `cma2`.
  - **Sales-to-CMA Ratio:** Calculates the ratio of actual sales to the CMA for each month in 2017.
- **Filtering Criteria:**
  - Considers only months in the year 2017.
  - Selects products where the sales-to-CMA ratio is greater than 2 for all 12 months.
  - Ensures that there are no NULL values in the sales quantity or CMA calculations.
- **Final Output:**
  - Returns the names of products that meet the criteria.

**Note:** This query accounts for empty or NULL values in the data by including conditions to exclude records where the sales quantity or CMA is NULL.

# Explanation of Metrics

## 1. Sales-to-CMA Ratio
- **Definition**: This ratio compares actual sales to the centered moving average (CMA) of sales.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Centered Moving Average (CMA)**: The CMA is a smoothed value of sales calculated over a rolling 12-month period. It averages sales from the months before and after a given month, specifically using two overlapping windows (5 months before and 6 months after, and vice versa).
  - **Sales-to-CMA Ratio**: The ratio is computed by dividing the actual sales amount for a month by its corresponding CMA value. A ratio greater than 2 indicates that the actual sales are more than twice the smoothed average for that period, suggesting significantly higher-than-average sales.

## 2. 12-Month Overlapping Windows
- **Definition**: A method to smooth sales data over time by averaging values in a specified window.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Window Size**: The window spans 12 months, with the specific approach involving overlapping periods. 
  - **First Window**: For a given month, this window includes 5 months before and 6 months after.
  - **Second Window**: Another window includes 6 months before and 5 months after the given month.
  - **Averaging**: Sales data is averaged over these two overlapping windows to compute the CMA. This method smooths out fluctuations by considering both the past and future sales in the calculation.

## 3. Restriction to the 7th and 30th Months
- **Definition**: A filter applied to focus calculations within a specific range of months.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Time Range**: Only the months between the 7th and 30th time steps (which correspond to specific periods) are considered for calculating the CMA and ratio.
  - **Purpose**: This restriction is used to avoid edge effects in the data where the moving average might be less reliable (e.g., at the very beginning or end of the available data). By focusing on these months, the calculations are more stable and meaningful.

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"`
  - **"product_id"**: Used to identify the products for which sales quantities are recorded.
  - **"mth"**: Represents the month of the sales data in 'YYYY-MM' format. Used to filter data for the required time frame (January 2016 to December 2017).
  - **"qty"**: The quantity of products sold in the given month. Used to calculate monthly sales figures.

- **Table:** `"ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS"`
  - **"id"**: Matches with "product_id" in the `MONTHLY_SALES` table to associate sales data with product names.
  - **"name"**: The name of the product. Required to display the product names in the final result.

**Conditions and Considerations:**

- **Time Frame Filter:** Sales data from January 2016 (`'2016-01'`) to December 2017 (`'2017-12'`) is relevant for calculating the seasonality-adjusted sales ratio.
- **Calculation of CMA:** Centered Moving Average (CMA) needs to be calculated using overlapping 12-month windows.
- **Sales-to-CMA Ratio:** For each product and month, compute the ratio of actual sales to CMA and determine if it's consistently above 2 for all months in 2017.
- **Product Identification:** Need to join `MONTHLY_SALES` and `PRODUCTS` tables on "product_id" and "id" to get product names.

Task: Which products (by name) had a seasonality-adjusted sales ratio consistently above 2 for the entire year of 2017, based on monthly sales data from January 2016?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the products that had a seasonality-adjusted sales ratio consistently above 2 for every month in 2017, we analyzed the monthly sales data from January 2016 through December 2017. The seasonality-adjusted sales ratio was calculated by dividing each month's actual sales by the centered moving average (CMA) of sales, using overlapping 12-month windows as specified.

The products that consistently maintained a sales-to-CMA ratio above 2 throughout 2017 are:

```csv
product_name
Product1:str
Product2:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 15:47:06 - root - INFO - It appears that the SQL query is returning no data because no products meet the strict condition of having a seasonality-adjusted sales ratio consistently above 2 for **every month in 2017**. To investigate this further and understand which products come close to this criterion, you can adjust the query to display the number of months each product had a ratio above 2.

Here's the modified SQL query:

```sql

    SELECT DISTINCT "mth"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
),

        ms."qty"
    FROM

    JOIN months_with_timestep ON ms."mth" = months_with_timestep."mth"
    JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" p ON ms."product_id" = p."id"
),
cma_data AS (
    SELECT
        sd1."product_id",
        sd1."product_name",
        sd1."time_step",
        sd1."mth",
        sd1."qty",
        /* Compute CMA1 */
        (SELECT AVG(sd2."qty")
         FROM sales_data sd2
         WHERE sd2."product_id" = sd1."product_id"
           AND sd2."time_step" BETWEEN sd1."time_step" -5 AND sd1."time_step" +6
        ) AS "cma1",
        /* Compute CMA2 */
        (SELECT AVG(sd2."qty")
         FROM sales_data sd2
         WHERE sd2."product_id" = sd1."product_id"
           AND sd2."time_step" BETWEEN sd1."time_step" -6 AND sd1."time_step" +5
        ) AS "cma2"
    FROM sales_data sd1
    WHERE sd1."time_step" BETWEEN 7 AND 30
),
cma_ratio AS (
    SELECT
        "product_id",
        "product_name",
        "time_step",
        "mth",
        "qty",
        ("cma1" + "cma2") / 2 AS "cma",
        "qty" / NULLIF(("cma1" + "cma2") / 2, 0) AS "ratio"
    FROM cma_data
),
filtered_ratio AS (
    SELECT
        *
    FROM cma_ratio
    WHERE "time_step" BETWEEN 13 AND 24  /* Months in 2017 */
)
SELECT
    "product_name",
    "months_in_2017",
    "months_ratio_gt_2"
FROM
    (
    SELECT
        "product_id",
        "product_name",
        COUNT(*) AS "months_in_2017",
        COUNT(CASE WHEN "ratio" > 2 THEN 1 END) AS "months_ratio_gt_2"
    FROM filtered_ratio
    GROUP BY "product_id", "product_name"
    )
ORDER BY "months_ratio_gt_2" DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Adjusted Final Selection:**
  - Instead of filtering out products that don't meet the condition, the query now displays the **number of months** each product had a ratio greater than 2.
  - This helps identify products that had high seasonality-adjusted sales ratios in 2017, even if they didn't maintain it for all 12 months.

- **Potential Reasons for No Results:**
  - The condition requiring the ratio to be above 2 for **all 12 months** of 2017 might be too strict.
  - Seasonal fluctuations, data anomalies, or insufficient data can result in no products meeting this criterion.

**Next Steps:**

- **Analyze the Results:**
  - Run the modified query to see which products had the highest number of months with a ratio above 2.
  - This can help you identify products with strong sales performance relative to their moving averages.

- **Adjust Criteria if Necessary:**
  - Consider relaxing the condition to products that had a ratio above 2 for **most months** in 2017, such as at least 6 or 9 months.
  - Modify the `WHERE` clause accordingly, for example:
    ```sql
    WHERE
        "months_in_2017" = 12
        AND "months_ratio_gt_2" >= 9;
    ```

- **Verify Calculations:**
  - Ensure that the calculations for the Centered Moving Average (CMA) and ratios are correct.
  - Check for any data issues, such as missing months or zero sales, that could affect the averages.

**Example Output:**

Assuming you adjust the criteria to products with a ratio above 2 for at least 6 months, the output might look like this:

```csv
product_name,months_in_2017,months_ratio_gt_2
Reindeer Fuel,12,8
Coalminers Sweat,12,5
Hoppy Crude Oil,12,4
...
```

**Note:**

- The actual output will depend on your data.
- No products may have a ratio above 2 for all 12 months, but some may come close.

**Conclusion:**

By modifying the query, you can get a better understanding of how products performed relative to their moving averages and make informed decisions based on the data trends.

Let me know if you need further assistance or clarification on any part of the query or the calculations involved.

2025-01-26 15:47:08 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which products (by name) had a seasonality-adjusted sales ratio consistently above 2 for the entire year of 2017, based on monthly sales data from January 2016?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To identify the products that had a seasonality-adjusted sales ratio consistently above 2 for every month in 2017, we analyzed the monthly sales data from January 2016 through December 2017. The seasonality-adjusted sales ratio was calculated by dividing each month's actual sales by the centered moving average (CMA) of sales, using overlapping 12-month windows as specified.

The products that consistently maintained a sales-to-CMA ratio above 2 throughout 2017 are:

```csv
product_name
Product1:str
Product2:str
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 15:50:24 - root - INFO - To identify the products that had a seasonality-adjusted sales ratio consistently above 2 for every month in 2017, we analyzed the monthly sales data from January 2016 through December 2017. The seasonality-adjusted sales ratio was calculated by dividing each month's actual sales by the centered moving average (CMA) of sales, using overlapping 12-month windows as specified.

After performing the analysis, we found that **no products** consistently maintained a sales-to-CMA ratio above 2 throughout 2017.

**Explanation:**

- **Date Range Generation:** We create a complete list of months from January 2016 to December 2018 to ensure all months are accounted for, even if a product has zero sales in a month.

- **Sales Data Preparation:** We cross-join products with months to get all possible combinations and left join the actual sales data. This allows us to fill missing months with zero sales using `COALESCE`.

- **CMA Calculation:**
  - **CMA1:** Calculated using a window of 12 months centered around each month (5 months before and 6 months after).
  - **CMA2:** Calculated using the window shifted by one month (6 months before and 5 months after).
  - **Final CMA:** The average of `CMA1` and `CMA2`.

- **Ratio Calculation:** For each month in 2017 (time steps 13 to 24), we compute the ratio of actual sales to the CMA.

- **Filtering Products:** We select products that have data for all 12 months in 2017 and have a sales-to-CMA ratio greater than 2 in every month.

**Note:** After running this query, we determined that no products met the specified criteria of maintaining a sales-to-CMA ratio above 2 for all months in 2017.
