After analyzing both SQL scripts and their results, **2result.sql** better addresses the task requirements. Here's why:

### Comparison of the SQL Scripts:

**0result.sql:**

- **Approach:**
  - Identifies new users created in 2021.
  - Determines if a user has asked any question (`Asked_Question`), regardless of when.
  - Checks if a user has answered any question within 30 days of creation (`Answered_Within_30_Days`).
  - Calculates percentages based on the total number of new users.

- **Issues:**
  - `Asked_Question` considers users who asked questions at any time, not specifically within their first 30 days.
  - When calculating the percentage of users who asked and then answered within 30 days, it includes users who may have asked questions after 30 days.
  - This could inflate the percentage of users who are considered active within their first 30 days.

**2result.sql:**

- **Approach:**
  - Identifies new users created in 2021.
  - Finds the timestamp of a user's first question and first answer.
  - Determines if the first question and first answer occurred within 30 days of user creation.
  - Calculates `asked_and_answered_within_30` by checking if both events happened within the first 30 days.
  - Computes percentages based on the total number of new users.

- **Advantages:**
  - Accurately identifies users who both asked a question and answered a question within their first 30 days.
  - Aligns with the task requirement: "*...percentage of those who asked questions and then answered questions within their first 30 days*."
  - Provides a precise computation by considering the timing of both activities in relation to user creation.

### Conclusion:

**2result.sql** is the correct SQL script because it:

- Precisely calculates the users who both asked and answered questions within their first 30 days.
- Ensures that only users who engaged in both activities within the specified timeframe are included in the percentage.
- Aligns perfectly with the task's requirements for monthly statistics.
