Task: What percentage of each country’s population was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the percentage of each country's population that was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020, we use the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table from the `COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK` database. This table contains cumulative confirmed cases (`cumulative_confirmed`) and population data (`population`) for each country on each date. By selecting records where the `date` is '2020-06-30' and the `aggregation_level` is 0 (which represents country-level data), we can calculate the percentage using the formula:

\[
\text{percentage\_confirmed} = \left( \frac{\text{cumulative\_confirmed}}{\text{population}} \right) \times 100
\]

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
country_name,cumulative_confirmed,population,percentage_confirmed
country1:str,cumulative_confirmed:int,population:int,percentage:float (0<=percentage<=100)
country2:str,cumulative_confirmed:int,population:int,percentage:float (0<=percentage<=100)
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK': {'COVID19_OPEN_DATA': ['COMPATIBILITY_VIEW', 'COVID19_OPEN_DATA'], 'WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION': ['POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY'], 'WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_DEBT', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_EDUCATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_EDUCATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY'], 'WORLD_BANK_WDI': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'FOOTNOTES', 'INDICATORS_DATA', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIME']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 23:07:08 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What percentage of each country’s population was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the percentage of each country's population that was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020, we use the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table from the `COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK` database. This table contains cumulative confirmed cases (`cumulative_confirmed`) and population data (`population`) for each country on each date. By selecting records where the `date` is '2020-06-30' and the `aggregation_level` is 0 (which represents country-level data), we can calculate the percentage using the formula:

\[
\text{percentage\_confirmed} = \left( \frac{\text{cumulative\_confirmed}}{\text{population}} \right) \times 100
\]

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
country_name,cumulative_confirmed,population,percentage_confirmed
country1:str,cumulative_confirmed:int,population:int,percentage:float (0<=percentage<=100)
country2:str,cumulative_confirmed:int,population:int,percentage:float (0<=percentage<=100)
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-24 23:08:10 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-24 23:08:10 - root - INFO - To determine the percentage of each country's population that was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020, we use the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table from the `COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK` database. This table contains cumulative confirmed cases (`cumulative_confirmed`) and population data (`population`) for each country on each date. By selecting records where the `date` is `'2020-06-30'` and the `aggregation_level` is `0` (which represents country-level data), we can calculate the percentage using the formula:

\[
\text{percentage\_confirmed} = \left( \frac{\text{cumulative\_confirmed}}{\text{population}} \right) \times 100
\]

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
country_name,cumulative_confirmed,population,percentage_confirmed
country1:str,cumulative_confirmed:int,population:int,percentage:float (0<=percentage<=100)
country2:str,cumulative_confirmed:int,population:int,percentage:float (0<=percentage<=100)
...
```

Here is the SQL query to obtain this result, ensuring that we round the percentage to four decimal places and handle NULL values appropriately:

```sql
SELECT
  "country_name",
  "cumulative_confirmed",
  "population",
  ROUND(("cumulative_confirmed" / "population") * 100, 4) AS "percentage_confirmed"
FROM
  "COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"
WHERE
  "date" = '2020-06-30'
  AND "aggregation_level" = 0
  AND "population" IS NOT NULL
  AND "population" > 0
  AND "cumulative_confirmed" IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
  "percentage_confirmed" DESC NULLS LAST;

2025-01-24 23:08:12 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What percentage of each country’s population was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the percentage of each country's population that was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020, we use the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table from the `COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK` database. This table contains cumulative confirmed cases (`cumulative_confirmed`) and population data (`population`) for each country on each date. By selecting records where the `date` is '2020-06-30' and the `aggregation_level` is 0 (which represents country-level data), we can calculate the percentage using the formula:

\[
\text{percentage\_confirmed} = \left( \frac{\text{cumulative\_confirmed}}{\text{population}} \right) \times 100
\]

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
country_name,cumulative_confirmed,population,percentage_confirmed
country1:str,cumulative_confirmed:int,population:int,percentage:float (0<=percentage<=100)
country2:str,cumulative_confirmed:int,population:int,percentage:float (0<=percentage<=100)
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-24 23:09:05 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-24 23:09:05 - root - INFO - To determine the percentage of each country's population that was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020, we use the `COVID19_OPEN_DATA` table from the `COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK` database. This table contains cumulative confirmed cases (`cumulative_confirmed`) and population data (`population`) for each country on each date. By selecting records where the `date` is `'2020-06-30'` and the `aggregation_level` is `0` (which represents country-level data), we can calculate the percentage using the formula:

\[
\text{percentage\_confirmed} = \left( \frac{\text{cumulative\_confirmed}}{\text{population}} \right) \times 100
\]

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
country_name,cumulative_confirmed,population,percentage_confirmed
country1:str,cumulative_confirmed:int,population:int,percentage:float (0<=percentage<=100)
country2:str,cumulative_confirmed:int,population:int,percentage:float (0<=percentage<=100)
...
```

Here is the SQL query to obtain this result, keeping all decimals to four decimal places and ensuring that NULL values are handled appropriately:

```sql
SELECT
  "country_name",
  "cumulative_confirmed",
  "population",
  ROUND(("cumulative_confirmed" / "population") * 100, 4) AS "percentage_confirmed"
FROM
  "COVID19_OPEN_WORLD_BANK"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"."COVID19_OPEN_DATA"
WHERE
  "date" = '2020-06-30'
  AND "aggregation_level" = 0
  AND "population" IS NOT NULL
  AND "population" > 0
  AND "cumulative_confirmed" IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
  "percentage_confirmed" DESC NULLS LAST;
