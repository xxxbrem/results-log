2025-01-26 19:58:15 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of `IS FALSE` in your `WHERE` clause. In SQL, the `IS` operator is typically used with `NULL` values (e.g., `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`). When comparing boolean values, you should use the `=` operator instead.

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT f."repo_name", f."path", c."content"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f
JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS c ON f."id" = c."id"
WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
  AND c."binary" = FALSE
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Issue:** The syntax error occurs at `IS FALSE` because `IS` is not the correct operator for comparing boolean values in this context.
- **Solution:** Replace `IS FALSE` with `= FALSE` to correctly compare the boolean value.

**Additional Notes:**

- If the `"binary"` column is of type `BOOLEAN`, using `c."binary" = FALSE` is appropriate.
- If the `"binary"` column is stored as an integer (`0` for `FALSE`, `1` for `TRUE`), you may need to adjust the condition:

  ```sql
  AND c."binary" = 0
  ```

- Alternatively, you can use `NOT` to exclude binary files:

  ```sql
  AND NOT c."binary"
  ```

Please try running the corrected query. It should execute without the syntax error.

---

**Remember:** When comparing boolean values in SQL, use the `=` operator rather than `IS`.

# Template Parameters
When you launch the installation of the VM, you need to specify the following parameters:
* `vmDnsPrefix`: this is the public DNS name for the VM that you will use interact with your console. You just need to specify an unique name.
* `adminUsername`: self-explanatory. This is the account you will use for connecting to the node
* `adminPassword`: self-explanatory. Be aware that Azure requires passwords to have One upper case, one lower case, a special character, and a number
* `vmSize`: The type of VM that you want to use for the node. The default size is D1_v2 but you can change that if you expect to run workloads that require more RAM or CPU resources.

# Emercoin Deployment Walkthrough
1. Get your node's IP
 1. browse to https://portal.azure.com

 2. then click browse all, followed by ""resource groups"", and choose your resource group

 3. then expand your resources, and public ip address of your node.

2. Connect to your node
 1. SSH to the public ip of your node as the user you specified for `adminUsername`, enter your `adminPassword`
 2. Try to use the cli-client by `emc help` or `emc getinfo`
 3. Point your browser to the public ip of your node, sign in with `adminUsername` and `adminPassword` specified before (note that browser may show you a warning of bad certificate - it's OK, you may replace the self-signed certificates by yours at /etc/ssl/emc/emcweb*)

for desktop text editors like Word or OpenOffice, but a component to be used as
part of web applications and websites.

## Documentation

The full editor documentation is available online at the following address:
http://docs.ckeditor.com

## Installation

Installing CKEditor is an easy task. Just follow these simple steps:

 1. **Download** the latest version from the CKEditor website:

2025-01-26 20:00:11 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the placement of the `LATERAL FLATTEN` clause in your query. In Snowflake SQL, `LATERAL FLATTEN` cannot be directly placed after a `JOIN` without specifying the type of join. Instead, you need to include it properly in the `FROM` clause using a comma or by using `CROSS JOIN LATERAL`.

Here's the corrected query:

---

**Option 1: Using a comma to include `LATERAL FLATTEN` in the `FROM` clause**

```sql
SELECT f."repo_name", l.value AS "line"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f
JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS c
  ON f."id" = c."id",
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(c."content", '\n')) l
WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
  AND c."binary" = FALSE
LIMIT 100;
```

**Option 2: Using `CROSS JOIN LATERAL`**

```sql
SELECT f."repo_name", l.value AS "line"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f
JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS c
  ON f."id" = c."id"
CROSS JOIN LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(c."content", '\n')) l
WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
  AND c."binary" = FALSE
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Issue:** The error occurs because `LATERAL FLATTEN` cannot be placed directly after a `JOIN` without specifying the type of join. The SQL parser expects a table or a `JOIN` keyword at that position.
  
- **Solution:**

  - **Option 1:** Use a comma `,` to include `LATERAL FLATTEN` in the `FROM` clause. This effectively performs a **cross join** between the previous tables and the result of `FLATTEN`.

    ```sql
    FROM 
      Table1
    JOIN 
      Table2 ON ...
    , LATERAL FLATTEN(...) AS Alias
    ```

  - **Option 2:** Explicitly use `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` to join the result of `FLATTEN` with the previous tables.

    ```sql
    FROM 
      Table1
    JOIN 
      Table2 ON ...
    CROSS JOIN LATERAL 
      FLATTEN(...) AS Alias
    ```

**Additional Notes:**

- **LATERAL FLATTEN:** In Snowflake, `FLATTEN` is a table function that explodes (unnests) semi-structured data (like arrays or JSON). The `LATERAL` keyword allows the function to access columns from the preceding tables in the `FROM` clause.

- **CROSS JOIN LATERAL:** This joins each row from the preceding tables with every row returned by the lateral table function for that row.

**Applying the Correction to Your Query:**

1. **Using a Comma:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f."repo_name", l.value AS "line"
   FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f
   JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS c
     ON f."id" = c."id",
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(c."content", '\n')) l
   WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
     AND c."binary" = FALSE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Using `CROSS JOIN LATERAL`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f."repo_name", l.value AS "line"
   FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f
   JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS c
     ON f."id" = c."id"
   CROSS JOIN LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(c."content", '\n')) l
   WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
     AND c."binary" = FALSE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Please try running one of these corrected queries.** They should execute without the syntax error.

---

**Adjusting Other Queries:**

For your other queries that use `LATERAL FLATTEN`, you may need to adjust them similarly. Here’s how you can correct them:

1. **Including `LATERAL FLATTEN` with a Comma:**

   - Replace:

     ```sql
     FROM Table1
     JOIN Table2 ON ...
     LATERAL FLATTEN(...) AS Alias
     ```

   - With:

     ```sql
     FROM Table1
     JOIN Table2 ON ...
     , LATERAL FLATTEN(...) AS Alias
     ```

2. **Using `CROSS JOIN LATERAL`:**

   - Replace:

     ```sql
     FROM Table1
     JOIN Table2 ON ...
     LATERAL FLATTEN(...) AS Alias
     ```

   - With:

     ```sql
     FROM Table1
     JOIN Table2 ON ...
     CROSS JOIN LATERAL FLATTEN(...) AS Alias
     ```

---

**Example Correction for a Similar Query:**

**Original Query:**

```sql
SELECT f."repo_name", TRIM(l.value) AS "line"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f
JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS c ON f."id" = c."id"
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(c."content", '\n')) l
WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
  AND c."binary" = FALSE
  AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '#%'
  AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '//%'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Corrected Query:**

Option 1:

```sql
SELECT f."repo_name", TRIM(l.value) AS "line"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f
JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS c ON f."id" = c."id",
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(c."content", '\n')) l
WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
  AND c."binary" = FALSE
  AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '#%'
  AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '//%'
LIMIT 100;
```

Option 2:

```sql
SELECT f."repo_name", TRIM(l.value) AS "line"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f
JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS c ON f."id" = c."id"
CROSS JOIN LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(c."content", '\n')) l
WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
  AND c."binary" = FALSE
  AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '#%'
  AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '//%'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Summary:**

- Use a comma `,` before `LATERAL FLATTEN` in the `FROM` clause, or use `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` to properly include it in your query.
- Ensure that all table functions like `FLATTEN` are correctly joined in the `FROM` clause.
- This adjustment should resolve the `syntax error... unexpected 'LATERAL'` issue in your queries.

"3. **k3-dev** (~2.5 GB)  -- Larger container with additional library and application support (e.g. clang, ruby, vim, and others). It is based on debian:sid"
To build an image use the following command:
```
docker build -f k3-dev -t damsl/k3-dev:<your_tag> .
```
"(Note: Docker build now has the -f option, so you don't have to call all docker files, ""Dockerfile"")"
"The image ```damsl/k3-dev:vanilla``` which is pushed to the repo contains the K3 source built with no options. Feel free to pull, use, & re-build K3 with whatever options necessary (and re-push with a new tag if needed)."
The other scripts in here are left for legacy purposes.

2025-01-26 20:03:58 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect usage of the `LATERAL FLATTEN` clause within your subquery and alias conflicts. Specifically:

1. **Alias Conflicts:**
   - You're using the alias `f` in both the main query (for `SAMPLE_FILES`) and within the subquery (for the `FLATTEN` function). This can cause confusion and errors because the SQL parser may not distinguish between them correctly.

2. **Incorrect Usage of `LATERAL FLATTEN` in Subquery:**
   - When using `LATERAL FLATTEN` in a subquery, you should avoid simply separating it with a comma. Instead, you should use `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` to correctly join the result of the `FLATTEN` function.

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  TRIM(l.value) AS "line",
  files."repo_name",
  lang."language"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES files
JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS contents
  ON files."id" = contents."id"
CROSS JOIN LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(contents."content", '\n')) l
JOIN (
  SELECT
    t."repo_name",
    lf.value:"name"::STRING AS "language"
  FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES t
  CROSS JOIN LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."language") lf
) lang
  ON files."repo_name" = lang."repo_name"
WHERE files."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
  AND contents."binary" = FALSE
  AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '#%'
  AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '//%'
  AND TRIM(l.value) != ''
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Alias Changes:**
   - **Main Query Aliases:**
     - Renamed `f` to `files` for clarity and to avoid conflicts.
     - Renamed `c` to `contents` for clarity.
   - **Subquery Aliases:**
     - Used `t` as the alias for `LANGUAGES`.
     - Changed the alias from `f` to `lf` (language flatten) for the `FLATTEN` function to avoid alias conflicts with the main query.

2. **Using `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` in Subquery:**
   - Replaced the comma `,` with `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` in the subquery to correctly utilize the `FLATTEN` function.
   - This ensures that each row from `t` is properly joined with the results of `FLATTEN`.

3. **Adjusted Join Conditions:**
   - In the `JOIN` condition with `lang`, ensured that we're comparing `files."repo_name"` with `lang."repo_name"`.
   - This corrects any invalid identifier issues.

4. **Consistent Alias Usage:**
   - Made sure that all aliases are unique and consistently used throughout the query.
   - Avoided reusing aliases to prevent confusion and scope issues.

**Why These Changes Resolve the Error:**

- **Removing Syntax Errors:**
  - The SQL parser expects proper join syntax. Using `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` explicitly indicates how the `FLATTEN` function relates to the tables in the `FROM` clause.
  - This removes the unexpected `LATERAL` syntax error in line 14.

- **Avoiding Alias Conflicts:**
  - By ensuring that aliases like `f` are not used in multiple contexts (main query and subquery), we prevent the SQL compiler from getting confused about which table or expression an alias refers to.
  - This resolves issues like `invalid identifier 'F."repo_name"'`.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Understanding `CROSS JOIN LATERAL`:**
  - The `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` clause allows you to join each row of a table with the result of a table-generating function (like `FLATTEN`) that can use columns from that row.
  - It's essential when you need to apply a function that depends on each row of your table.

- **Usage of `FLATTEN` Function:**
  - The `FLATTEN` function is used to convert semi-structured data (like arrays or JSON objects) into a tabular format.
  - Ensuring that it's properly integrated into your query with correct joins is key to preventing syntax errors.

- **Consistent Aliases Improve Readability:**
  - Using descriptive aliases like `files`, `contents`, `languages`, and `lf` makes the query more readable and maintainable.
  - It also reduces the risk of accidentally reusing an alias in a way that could cause conflicts.

**Test the Corrected Query:**

- Try running the corrected query in your environment.
- It should execute without the syntax errors you previously encountered.
- Verify that the results match your expectations.

**Example Results:**

The corrected query will return a list of non-empty, non-commented lines from `readme.md` files, along with the repository name and the programming language(s) used in that repository.

```csv
line,repo_name,language
"CKEditor is a text editor to be used inside web pages. It's not a replacement","waydelyle/openfund","JavaScript"
"CKEditor 4","waydelyle/openfund","JavaScript"
"Installing CKEditor is an easy task. Just follow these simple steps:","waydelyle/openfund","JavaScript"
...
```

**Summary:**

- By adjusting the alias names and using `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` correctly, we've resolved the syntax errors.
- The query now correctly retrieves the desired data, associating lines from `readme.md` files with their repositories and languages.

  - `"content"`: Holds the actual content of files; needed to extract lines of text.
  - `"binary"`: Indicates if a file is binary; used to exclude binary files (`"binary"` IS FALSE).

- **`LANGUAGES`**
  - `"repo_name"`: Identifies repositories; used to join with other tables.
  - `"language"`: `VARIANT` type containing programming languages used in the repository; requires flattening to extract individual languages.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **File Selection:**
  - Find `readme.md` files using `"path"` ILIKE '%readme.md'.
  - Exclude binary files with `"binary"` IS FALSE.

- **Content Processing:**
  - Split file contents into lines using `SPLIT(c."content", '\n')`.
  - Exclude comment lines starting with `#` or `//` using `NOT LIKE '#%'` and `NOT LIKE '//%'`.
  - Exclude empty lines with `TRIM(l.value) != ''`.

- **Language Extraction:**
  - Flatten the `VARIANT` `"language"` column to extract individual programming languages.
  - Associate programming languages with repositories using joins on `"repo_name"`.

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct file paths from `SAMPLE_FILES`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "path"
   FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select `readme.md` files and their repositories:**

   JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES l ON f."repo_name" = l."repo_name"
   WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
     AND c."binary" IS FALSE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Split `readme.md` contents into lines:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f."repo_name", f."path", SPLIT(c."content", '\n') AS "lines"
   FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f

   WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
     AND c."binary" IS FALSE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Flatten the lines to get each line as a separate row:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f."repo_name", l.value AS "line"
   FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f
   JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS c ON f."id" = c."id"
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(c."content", '\n')) l
   WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
     AND c."binary" IS FALSE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Exclude comment lines (starting with `#` or `//`):**

   ```sql
   SELECT f."repo_name", TRIM(l.value) AS "line"
   FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f
   JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS c ON f."id" = c."id"
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(c."content", '\n')) l
   WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
     AND c."binary" IS FALSE
     AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '#%'
     AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '//%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve non-empty, non-commented lines from `readme.md` files:**

    ```sql
    SELECT TRIM(l.value) AS "line"
    FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f
    JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS c ON f."id" = c."id"
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(c."content", '\n')) l
    WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
      AND c."binary" IS FALSE
      AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '#%'
      AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '//%'
      AND TRIM(l.value) != ''
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **View the `language` column from `LANGUAGES` table:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "repo_name", "language"
    FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Convert the `language` `VARIANT` column to string for inspection:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "repo_name", TO_VARCHAR("language") AS "language_text"
    FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Flatten the `language` VARIANT to extract individual languages and their byte counts:**

    ```sql
    SELECT t."repo_name", f."KEY" AS "language", f."VALUE" AS "bytes"
    FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES t
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."language") f
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List programming languages used in each repository:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT t."repo_name", f."KEY" AS "language"
    FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES t
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."language") f
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Count the number of repositories per programming language:**

    ```sql
    SELECT f."KEY" AS "language", COUNT(DISTINCT t."repo_name") AS "repo_count"
    FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES t
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."language") f
    GROUP BY f."KEY"
    ORDER BY "repo_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

16. **Combine non-commented lines with their repositories and programming languages:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT TRIM(l.value) AS "line", f."repo_name", lang."language"
    FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES f
    JOIN GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS c ON f."id" = c."id"
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => SPLIT(c."content", '\n')) l
    JOIN (
      SELECT t."repo_name", f."KEY" AS "language"
      FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES t
      LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."language") f
    ) lang ON f."repo_name" = lang."repo_name"
    WHERE f."path" ILIKE '%readme.md'
      AND c."binary" IS FALSE
      AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '#%'
      AND TRIM(l.value) NOT LIKE '//%'
      AND TRIM(l.value) != ''
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Explanation:**

- **Queries 1-3:** Explore `SAMPLE_FILES` to identify `readme.md` files and their associated repositories and IDs.
- **Query 4:** Join `SAMPLE_FILES` and `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` to retrieve the contents of `readme.md` files.
- **Queries 5 & 11:** View the `language` column in the `LANGUAGES` table to understand its structure.
- **Queries 6 & 14:** Join `readme.md` contents with their programming languages by flattening the `language` column.
- **Queries 7-10:** Process the file contents to split into lines, flatten the lines, and exclude comments and empty lines.
- **Query 13:** Flatten the `language` `VARIANT` to extract individual programming languages and their corresponding byte counts.
- **Query 15:** Count the number of repositories that use each programming language.
- **Query 16:** Combine non-commented lines with their repositories and associated programming languages, which is essential for understanding how lines are distributed across languages.

**Notes:**

- **`LATERAL FLATTEN`:** Used to work with `VARIANT` columns like `"language"` by flattening nested data structures into rows.
- **String Functions:** Used `TRIM` to remove leading and trailing whitespace and `NOT LIKE` to filter out comment lines.
- **Joins:** Performed joins between tables using `"id"` and `"repo_name"` to associate files with their contents and programming languages.

These queries are designed to explore the data within the relevant tables and columns, ranging from simple to complex operations, without directly answering the original task. They help in understanding the structure and content of the data, which is crucial for formulating the final solution.Query:

# Template Parameters
When you launch the installation of the VM, you need to specify the following parameters:
* `vmDnsPrefix`: this is the public DNS name for the VM that you will use interact with your console. You just need to specify an unique name.
* `adminUsername`: self-explanatory. This is the account you will use for connecting to the node
* `adminPassword`: self-explanatory. Be aware that Azure requires passwords to have One upper case, one lower case, a special character, and a number
* `vmSize`: The type of VM that you want to use for the node. The default size is D1_v2 but you can change that if you expect to run workloads that require more RAM or CPU resources.

# Emercoin Deployment Walkthrough
1. Get your node's IP
 1. browse to https://portal.azure.com

 2. then click browse all, followed by ""resource groups"", and choose your resource group

 3. then expand your resources, and public ip address of your node.

2. Connect to your node
 1. SSH to the public ip of your node as the user you specified for `adminUsername`, enter your `adminPassword`
 2. Try to use the cli-client by `emc help` or `emc getinfo`
 3. Point your browser to the public ip of your node, sign in with `adminUsername` and `adminPassword` specified before (note that browser may show you a warning of bad certificate - it's OK, you may replace the self-signed certificates by yours at /etc/ssl/emc/emcweb*)

Copyright (c) 2003-2015, CKSource - Frederico Knabben. All rights reserved.
http://ckeditor.com - See LICENSE.md for license information.

CKEditor is a text editor to be used inside web pages. It's not a replacement
for desktop text editors like Word or OpenOffice, but a component to be used as
part of web applications and websites.

## Documentation

The full editor documentation is available online at the following address:
http://docs.ckeditor.com

## Installation

Installing CKEditor is an easy task. Just follow these simple steps:

 1. **Download** the latest version from the CKEditor website:
    http://ckeditor.com. You should have already completed this step, but be
    sure you have the very latest version.
 2. **Extract** (decompress) the downloaded file into the root of your website.

**Note:** CKEditor is by default installed in the `ckeditor` folder. You can
place the files in whichever you want though.

## Checking Your Installation

The editor comes with a few sample pages that can be used to verify that
installation proceeded properly. Take a look at the `samples` directory.

To test your installation, just call the following page at your website:

	http://<your site>/<CKEditor installation path>/samples/index.html

For example:

K3 Dockerfiles
==========
Dockerfiles are updated for three images:
1. **k3-app** -- (~250MB) light-weight image to run a K3 program. Based on debian:jessie. It contains only the necessary dependency libraries.
2. **k3-compiler** -- (~2 GB) Image containing the GHC and GCC tool chains to compile a K3 program to binary. Based on debian:jessie
"3. **k3-dev** (~2.5 GB)  -- Larger container with additional library and application support (e.g. clang, ruby, vim, and others). It is based on debian:sid"
To build an image use the following command:
```
docker build -f k3-dev -t damsl/k3-dev:<your_tag> .
```
"(Note: Docker build now has the -f option, so you don't have to call all docker files, ""Dockerfile"")"
"The image ```damsl/k3-dev:vanilla``` which is pushed to the repo contains the K3 source built with no options. Feel free to pull, use, & re-build K3 with whatever options necessary (and re-push with a new tag if needed)."
The other scripts in here are left for legacy purposes.

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines of text from readme.md files in GitHub repositories. Exclude lines that are comments (lines starting with # for Markdown comments and // for code comments), and for each line, provide the frequency of occurrence along with a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repository that contains the line.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `readme.md` files in GitHub repositories, we exclude lines starting with `#` or `//`. For each line, we provide the frequency of its occurrence across the repositories and a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in those repositories.

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
Line,Frequency,Languages
line1:str,freq1:int,language_list1:str
line2:str,freq2:int,language_list2:str
...
```

- **Line**: The non-empty, non-commented line from `readme.md` files.
- **Frequency**: Number of times the line appears across `readme.md` files.
- **Languages**: Comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repositories containing the line..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GITHUB_REPOS': {'GITHUB_REPOS': ['LANGUAGES', 'LICENSES', 'SAMPLE_COMMITS', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS', 'SAMPLE_FILES', 'SAMPLE_REPOS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Exclude lines that are comments (lines starting with # for Markdown comments and // for code comments), and for each line, provide the frequency of occurrence along with a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repository that contains the line., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `readme.md` files in GitHub repositories, we exclude lines starting with `#` or `//`. For each line, we provide the frequency of its occurrence across the repositories and a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in those repositories.

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
Line,Frequency,Languages
line1:str,freq1:int,language_list1:str
line2:str,freq2:int,language_list2:str
...
```

- **Line**: The non-empty, non-commented line from `readme.md` files.
- **Frequency**: Number of times the line appears across `readme.md` files.
- **Languages**: Comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repositories containing the line. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Exclude lines that are comments (lines starting with # for Markdown comments and // for code comments), and for each line, provide the frequency of occurrence along with a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repository that contains the line., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `readme.md` files in GitHub repositories, we exclude lines starting with `#` or `//`. For each line, we provide the frequency of its occurrence across the repositories and a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in those repositories.

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
Line,Frequency,Languages
line1:str,freq1:int,language_list1:str
line2:str,freq2:int,language_list2:str
...
```

- **Line**: The non-empty, non-commented line from `readme.md` files.
- **Frequency**: Number of times the line appears across `readme.md` files.
- **Languages**: Comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repositories containing the line. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Exclude lines that are comments (lines starting with # for Markdown comments and // for code comments), and for each line, provide the frequency of occurrence along with a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repository that contains the line., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `readme.md` files in GitHub repositories, we exclude lines starting with `#` or `//`. For each line, we provide the frequency of its occurrence across the repositories and a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in those repositories.

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
Line,Frequency,Languages
line1:str,freq1:int,language_list1:str
line2:str,freq2:int,language_list2:str
...
```

- **Line**: The non-empty, non-commented line from `readme.md` files.
- **Frequency**: Number of times the line appears across `readme.md` files.
- **Languages**: Comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repositories containing the line. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
