After comparing the SQL scripts and their results, **2result.sql** appears to be the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Cohort Definition:** `2result.sql` precisely defines the cohort of new users by selecting users whose `user_first_touch_timestamp` falls between July 2, 2018, and July 9, 2018, using the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function for accurate date conversions.
  
- **Consistent Event Selection:** It selects events for each week by ensuring the `event_timestamp` falls within the exact date range for that week, again using `TO_TIMESTAMP` for clarity and precision.
  
- **Consistency in Results:** The retention counts in `2result.sql` are consistent and logically coherent across weeks. The slight differences in counts compared to the other scripts indicate careful handling of the data.
  
- **Explicit Date Ranges:** By explicitly specifying date ranges for each week's events, `2result.sql` minimizes errors that might arise from timestamp calculations or time zone issues.
  
- **Alignment with Retention Analysis Principles:** The script follows standard retention analysis methodology by comparing the cohort against subsequent weeks accurately.

**Conclusion:**
