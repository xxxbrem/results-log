2025-01-27 05:21:19 - root - INFO - The error occurs because the column **c."ChrOrd"** is being used in the **ORDER BY** clause but is neither included in the **SELECT** list nor in the **GROUP BY** clause. In SQL, when you use an aggregate function with a **GROUP BY**, any columns referenced in the **SELECT**, **HAVING**, or **ORDER BY** clauses must either be:

- Included in the **GROUP BY** clause, or
- Used in an aggregate function.

To fix this error, you need to include **c."ChrOrd"** in both the **SELECT** list and the **GROUP BY** clause. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT c."Chr", c."ChrOrd", c."Type", COUNT(*) AS "EventCount"
FROM "MITELMAN"."PROD"."CYTOCONVERTED" c
JOIN "MITELMAN"."PROD"."CYTOGEN" g
  ON c."RefNo" = g."RefNo" AND c."CaseNo" = g."CaseNo"
WHERE g."Morph" = '3111' OR g."Topo" = '0401'
GROUP BY c."Chr", c."ChrOrd", c."Type"
ORDER BY c."ChrOrd"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Included c."ChrOrd" in the SELECT clause:** This allows us to see the chromosome ordinal in the results.

- **Added c."ChrOrd" to the GROUP BY clause:** Since we're grouping data to count events per chromosome and type, we need to include all non-aggregated columns from the SELECT clause in the GROUP BY clause.

- **Ordering by c."ChrOrd":** Now that c."ChrOrd" is part of the SELECT and GROUP BY clauses, we can safely use it in the ORDER BY clause.

**Additional Note:**

Including c."ChrOrd" in the **GROUP BY** clause ensures that the grouping correctly accounts for the chromosome order, which is important for sorting and analyzing the data accurately.

**Alternative Option:**

If you prefer not to include c."ChrOrd" in your output and only want to use it for ordering, you can still include it in the **GROUP BY** and **ORDER BY** clauses without selecting it:

```sql
SELECT c."Chr", c."Type", COUNT(*) AS "EventCount"
FROM "MITELMAN"."PROD"."CYTOCONVERTED" c
JOIN "MITELMAN"."PROD"."CYTOGEN" g
  ON c."RefNo" = g."RefNo" AND c."CaseNo" = g."CaseNo"
WHERE g."Morph" = '3111' OR g."Topo" = '0401'
GROUP BY c."Chr", c."ChrOrd", c."Type"
ORDER BY c."ChrOrd"
LIMIT 100;
```

But note that some SQL dialects require all expressions in the ORDER BY clause to be either in the SELECT list or in the GROUP BY clause.

**Summary:**

- **Include c."ChrOrd" in SELECT and GROUP BY clauses.**
- **This allows you to ORDER BY c."ChrOrd" without errors.**

**Proceeding with Data Analysis:**

Now that the query is corrected, you can proceed to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across the specified cohort, sorting the results by chromosome ordinal.

This query corrects the join condition by removing the `'chr'` prefix from both `"Chr"` and `"chromosome"` columns to ensure they match properly. It also filters out any entries where the `"cytoband_name"` is `NULL`, addressing the issue of empty columns in the results.

Task: Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'MITELMAN': {'PROD': ['AUTHORREFERENCE', 'CYTOBANDS_HG38', 'CYTOCONVERTED', 'CYTOCONVERTEDLOG', 'CYTOGEN', 'CYTOGENINV', 'CYTOGENINVVALID', 'KARYABNORM', 'KARYBIT', 'KARYBREAK', 'KARYCLONE', 'KODER', 'MOLBIOLCLINASSOC', 'MOLCLINABNORM', 'MOLCLINBREAK', 'MOLCLINGENE', 'RECURRENTDATA', 'RECURRENTNUMDATA', 'REFERENCE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 05:28:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:29:15 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:31:42 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:35:04 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:37:34 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:39:30 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:43:40 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
