## ST_WITHIN

Returns true if the first geospatial object is fully contained by the second geospatial object. In other words:

The first GEOGRAPHY object g1 is fully contained by the second GEOGRAPHY object g2.
The first GEOMETRY object g1 is fully contained by the second GEOMETRY object g2.

Calling ST_WITHIN(g1, g2) is equivalent to calling ST_CONTAINS(g2, g1).
Although ST_COVEREDBY and ST_WITHIN might seem similar, the two functions have subtle differences. For details on the differences between “covered by” and “within”, see the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM).

Note This function does not support using a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection as input values.

Tip You can use the search optimization service to improve the performance of queries that call this function.
For details, see Search Optimization Service.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `NOAA_DATA`.`NOAA_GSOD`.`STATIONS`
   - **Column:** `"usaf"`: Identifies the USAF station number. *Potential usage:* To find the station '94728' corresponding to Central Park.
   - **Column:** `"name"`: Name of the weather station. *Potential usage:* To verify the station name.
   - **Column:** `"lat"` and `"lon"`: Latitude and longitude of the station. *Potential usage:* To locate the station geographically.

2. **Table:** `NOAA_DATA`.`NOAA_GSOD`.`GSOD2015` (Assuming `GSOD2015` exists in the dataset)
   - **Column:** `"stn"`: Station number matching `"usaf"` in the `STATIONS` table. *Potential usage:* To link weather data to the station.
   - **Column:** `"year"`, `"mo"`, `"da"`: Year, month, and day of the observation. *Potential usage:* To filter data for July 15, 2015.
   - **Column:** `"temp"`: Average temperature for the day. *Potential usage:* To determine the average temperature recorded by the station.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `"stn"` = '94728': To select data from the Central Park weather station.
- `"year"` = '2015', `"mo"` = '07', `"da"` = '15': To filter data for July 15, 2015.
- `"temp"`: To retrieve temperature data.
- Since no bike trip or ZIP code data is available in the provided tables, we cannot proceed further on that aspect.

**Explanation:**

The above queries aim to retrieve temperature data for July 15, 2015, from the Central Park weather station '94728' and other stations. However, since the provided datasets do not include any bike trip data or ZIP code information, we are unable to determine which bike trip in New York City started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature for that day. The necessary bike trip and ZIP code data are not available in the given tables.Query:
SELECT *
FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2015"
WHERE "year" = '2015' AND "mo" = '07' AND "da" = '15'

Task: Can you tell me which bike trip in New York City on July 15, 2015, started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature for that day, as recorded by the Central Park weather station '94728'? If there's more than one trip that meets these criteria, I'd like to know about the one that starts in the smallest ZIP Code and ends in the largest ZIP Code.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: I'm sorry, but based on the provided datasets, I cannot determine which bike trip in New York City on July 15, 2015, started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature, as recorded by the Central Park weather station '94728'. The datasets you've provided contain NOAA weather data but do not include bike trip information or ZIP Code data necessary to answer this question..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

## ST_WITHIN

Returns true if the first geospatial object is fully contained by the second geospatial object. In other words:

The first GEOGRAPHY object g1 is fully contained by the second GEOGRAPHY object g2.
The first GEOMETRY object g1 is fully contained by the second GEOMETRY object g2.

Calling ST_WITHIN(g1, g2) is equivalent to calling ST_CONTAINS(g2, g1).
Although ST_COVEREDBY and ST_WITHIN might seem similar, the two functions have subtle differences. For details on the differences between “covered by” and “within”, see the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM).

Note This function does not support using a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection as input values.

Tip You can use the search optimization service to improve the performance of queries that call this function.
For details, see Search Optimization Service.

See also:ST_CONTAINS , ST_COVEREDBY


## Syntax

ST_WITHIN( <geography_expression_1> , <geography_expression_2> )

ST_WITHIN( <geometry_expression_1> , <geometry_expression_2> )


## Arguments


geography_expression_1A GEOGRAPHY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geography_expression_2A GEOGRAPHY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geometry_expression_1A GEOMETRY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geometry_expression_2A GEOMETRY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.


## Returns

BOOLEAN.

## Examples


## GEOGRAPHY examples

This shows a simple use of the ST_WITHIN function:

create table geospatial_table_01 (g1 GEOGRAPHY, g2 GEOGRAPHY);
insert into geospatial_table_01 (g1, g2) values 
    ('POLYGON((0 0, 3 0, 3 3, 0 3, 0 0))', 'POLYGON((1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2, 1 1))');

Copy SELECT ST_WITHIN(g1, g2) 
    FROM geospatial_table_01;
+-------------------+
| ST_WITHIN(G1, G2) |

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `NOAA_DATA`.`NOAA_GSOD`.`STATIONS`
   - **Column:** `"usaf"`: Identifies the USAF station number. *Potential usage:* To find the station '94728' corresponding to Central Park.
   - **Column:** `"name"`: Name of the weather station. *Potential usage:* To verify the station name.
   - **Column:** `"lat"` and `"lon"`: Latitude and longitude of the station. *Potential usage:* To locate the station geographically.

2. **Table:** `NOAA_DATA`.`NOAA_GSOD`.`GSOD2015` (Assuming `GSOD2015` exists in the dataset)
   - **Column:** `"stn"`: Station number matching `"usaf"` in the `STATIONS` table. *Potential usage:* To link weather data to the station.
   - **Column:** `"year"`, `"mo"`, `"da"`: Year, month, and day of the observation. *Potential usage:* To filter data for July 15, 2015.
   - **Column:** `"temp"`: Average temperature for the day. *Potential usage:* To determine the average temperature recorded by the station.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `"stn"` = '94728': To select data from the Central Park weather station.
- `"year"` = '2015', `"mo"` = '07', `"da"` = '15': To filter data for July 15, 2015.
- `"temp"`: To retrieve temperature data.
- Since no bike trip or ZIP code data is available in the provided tables, we cannot proceed further on that aspect.

        FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2015"
        WHERE "year" = '2015' AND "mo" = '07' AND "da" = '15'
    ) LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Explanation:**

The above queries aim to retrieve temperature data for July 15, 2015, from the Central Park weather station '94728' and other stations. However, since the provided datasets do not include any bike trip data or ZIP code information, we are unable to determine which bike trip in New York City started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature for that day. The necessary bike trip and ZIP code data are not available in the given tables.Query:
SELECT *
FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2015"
WHERE "year" = '2015' AND "mo" = '07' AND "da" = '15'
LIMIT 100;

Task: Can you tell me which bike trip in New York City on July 15, 2015, started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature for that day, as recorded by the Central Park weather station '94728'? If there's more than one trip that meets these criteria, I'd like to know about the one that starts in the smallest ZIP Code and ends in the largest ZIP Code.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: I'm sorry, but based on the provided datasets, I cannot determine which bike trip in New York City on July 15, 2015, started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature, as recorded by the Central Park weather station '94728'. The datasets you've provided contain NOAA weather data but do not include bike trip information or ZIP Code data necessary to answer this question..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

## ST_WITHIN

Returns true if the first geospatial object is fully contained by the second geospatial object. In other words:

The first GEOGRAPHY object g1 is fully contained by the second GEOGRAPHY object g2.
The first GEOMETRY object g1 is fully contained by the second GEOMETRY object g2.

Calling ST_WITHIN(g1, g2) is equivalent to calling ST_CONTAINS(g2, g1).
Although ST_COVEREDBY and ST_WITHIN might seem similar, the two functions have subtle differences. For details on the differences between “covered by” and “within”, see the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM).

Note This function does not support using a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection as input values.

Tip You can use the search optimization service to improve the performance of queries that call this function.
For details, see Search Optimization Service.

See also:ST_CONTAINS , ST_COVEREDBY


## Syntax

ST_WITHIN( <geography_expression_1> , <geography_expression_2> )

ST_WITHIN( <geometry_expression_1> , <geometry_expression_2> )


## Arguments


geography_expression_1A GEOGRAPHY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geography_expression_2A GEOGRAPHY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geometry_expression_1A GEOMETRY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geometry_expression_2A GEOMETRY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.


## Returns

BOOLEAN.

## Examples


## GEOGRAPHY examples

This shows a simple use of the ST_WITHIN function:

create table geospatial_table_01 (g1 GEOGRAPHY, g2 GEOGRAPHY);

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `NOAA_DATA`.`NOAA_GSOD`.`STATIONS`
   - **Column:** `"usaf"`: Identifies the USAF station number. *Potential usage:* To find the station '94728' corresponding to Central Park.
   - **Column:** `"name"`: Name of the weather station. *Potential usage:* To verify the station name.
   - **Column:** `"lat"` and `"lon"`: Latitude and longitude of the station. *Potential usage:* To locate the station geographically.

2. **Table:** `NOAA_DATA`.`NOAA_GSOD`.`GSOD2015` (Assuming `GSOD2015` exists in the dataset)
   - **Column:** `"stn"`: Station number matching `"usaf"` in the `STATIONS` table. *Potential usage:* To link weather data to the station.
   - **Column:** `"year"`, `"mo"`, `"da"`: Year, month, and day of the observation. *Potential usage:* To filter data for July 15, 2015.
   - **Column:** `"temp"`: Average temperature for the day. *Potential usage:* To determine the average temperature recorded by the station.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `"stn"` = '94728': To select data from the Central Park weather station.
- `"year"` = '2015', `"mo"` = '07', `"da"` = '15': To filter data for July 15, 2015.
- `"temp"`: To retrieve temperature data.
- Since no bike trip or ZIP code data is available in the provided tables, we cannot proceed further on that aspect.

**Sample SQL Queries:**

**Explanation:**

The above queries aim to retrieve temperature data for July 15, 2015, from the Central Park weather station '94728' and other stations. However, since the provided datasets do not include any bike trip data or ZIP code information, we are unable to determine which bike trip in New York City started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature for that day. The necessary bike trip and ZIP code data are not available in the given tables.Query:
SELECT *
FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2015"
WHERE "year" = '2015' AND "mo" = '07' AND "da" = '15'
LIMIT 100;

Task: Can you tell me which bike trip in New York City on July 15, 2015, started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature for that day, as recorded by the Central Park weather station '94728'? If there's more than one trip that meets these criteria, I'd like to know about the one that starts in the smallest ZIP Code and ends in the largest ZIP Code.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: I'm sorry, but based on the provided datasets, I cannot determine which bike trip in New York City on July 15, 2015, started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature, as recorded by the Central Park weather station '94728'. The datasets you've provided contain NOAA weather data but do not include bike trip information or ZIP Code data necessary to answer this question..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
