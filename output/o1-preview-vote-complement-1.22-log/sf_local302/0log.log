End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Analyze the average sales performance impact 12 weeks before and after June 15, 2020, across various attributes like regions, platforms, age bands, demographics, and customer types. Identify and provide the attribute with the highest negative impact on sales, detailing the average percentage change in sales for that attribute.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Attribute,Average_Percentage_Change
attribute_name:str,average_percentage_change:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The attribute with the highest negative impact on sales is **attribute_name**, with an average percentage change of **average_percentage_change%** over the analyzed period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'BANK_SALES_TRADING': {'BANK_SALES_TRADING': ['BITCOIN_MEMBERS', 'BITCOIN_PRICES', 'BITCOIN_TRANSACTIONS', 'CLEANED_WEEKLY_SALES', 'CUSTOMER_NODES', 'CUSTOMER_REGIONS', 'CUSTOMER_TRANSACTIONS', 'INTEREST_MAP', 'INTEREST_METRICS', 'SHOPPING_CART_CAMPAIGN_IDENTIFIER', 'SHOPPING_CART_EVENTS', 'SHOPPING_CART_EVENT_IDENTIFIER', 'SHOPPING_CART_PAGE_HIERARCHY', 'SHOPPING_CART_USERS', 'VEG_CAT', 'VEG_LOSS_RATE_DF', 'VEG_TXN_DF', 'VEG_WHSLE_DF', 'WEEKLY_SALES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 05:14:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Analyze the average sales performance impact 12 weeks before and after June 15, 2020, across various attributes like regions, platforms, age bands, demographics, and customer types. Identify and provide the attribute with the highest negative impact on sales, detailing the average percentage change in sales for that attribute., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Attribute,Average_Percentage_Change
attribute_name:str,average_percentage_change:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The attribute with the highest negative impact on sales is **attribute_name**, with an average percentage change of **average_percentage_change%** over the analyzed period. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
