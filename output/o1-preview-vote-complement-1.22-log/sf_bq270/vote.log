After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Data Processing Logic:**

   - **`2result.sql`** carefully structures the data processing by first flattening the `"hits"` array and then the `"product"` array within the hits. This reflects the hierarchical nature of the data, ensuring that each product within each hit is accurately represented.
   - By creating separate Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for `"flattened_hits"` and `"flattened_products"`, **`2result.sql`** provides clear and modular steps that enhance readability and maintainability.

2. **Handling of `isImpression`:**

   - **`2result.sql`** explicitly checks for `"isImpression"` being `NULL` or `FALSE` when calculating the sums for actions. This ensures that product impressions are properly excluded from the counts, which is critical for accurate conversion rate calculations.
   - While **`1result.sql`** also filters out impressions, **`2result.sql`** does so during the aggregation step, which can be more efficient and less error-prone.

3. **Aggregation and Conversion Rate Calculation:**

   - **`2result.sql`** uses `SUM` with conditional expressions to aggregate the counts directly, which is a standard and efficient method in SQL for such calculations.
   - The use of `NULLIF` prevents division by zero errors when calculating the conversion rates.
   - The query groups the results by month using `TO_CHAR("event_date", 'Mon-YYYY')`, ensuring that the months are correctly formatted and sorted.

4. **Results Consistency:**

   - Both queries produce the same conversion rates for the given period, confirming that they are functionally equivalent in terms of output.
   - However, the structure and clarity of **`2result.sql`** make it a better choice for accuracy and future maintenance.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the structured approach, accurate handling of impressions, and efficient aggregation, **`2result.sql`** is the correct and preferred SQL query to calculate the monthly add-to-cart and purchase conversion rates from January to March 2017.
