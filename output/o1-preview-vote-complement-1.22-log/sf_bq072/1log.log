Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS**
  - `"Age"`: Used to filter records where age is between 12 and 18.
  - `"Race"`: Used to identify the race of the deceased; will be joined with the RACE table to get the race description.
  - `"Icd10Code"`: Used to determine the cause of death; will be joined with the ICD10CODE table to get cause descriptions.
  - `"Id"`: Unique identifier for each death record.

- **DEATH.DEATH.RACE**
  - `"Code"`: Race code that corresponds to the `"Race"` column in DEATHRECORDS.
  - `"Description"`: Provides the race description (e.g., "Black or African American").

- **DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE**
  - `"Code"`: ICD-10 code that corresponds to the `"Icd10Code"` column in DEATHRECORDS.
  - `"Description"`: Provides the cause of death description, used to identify vehicle-related and firearm-related deaths.

**Potential Conditions:**

- Filter `"Age"` between 12 and 18.
- Identify race code for Black individuals by querying the RACE table.
- Use `"Description"` in ICD10CODE to find ICD-10 codes related to vehicle incidents and firearms.
- Join tables to combine necessary information.

Each of these queries explores different aspects of the data to help understand which records and conditions are relevant to the task. By examining the results of these queries, we can identify the precise ICD-10 codes for vehicle-related incidents and firearms, confirm race codes for Black individuals, and understand the distribution of deaths across ages 12 to 18. This exploration is essential for constructing an accurate query to answer the original task.Query:

Task: Please tell me the total and Black deaths due to vehicle-related incidents and firearms separately, for each age from 12 to 18.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Age,Total_Deaths_Vehicle,Black_Deaths_Vehicle,Total_Deaths_Firearms,Black_Deaths_Firearms
12,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
13,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
14,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
15,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
16,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
17,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
18,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
```

This table displays the total and Black deaths due to vehicle-related incidents and firearms separately for each age from 12 to 18. The `deaths:int` placeholders represent integer values for the number of deaths, which would be retrieved from the database..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'DEATH': {'DEATH': ['ACTIVITYCODE', 'AGERECODE12', 'AGERECODE27', 'AGERECODE52', 'AGETYPE', 'BRIDGEDRACEFLAG', 'DAYOFWEEKOFDEATH', 'DEATHRECORDS', 'EDUCATION1989REVISION', 'EDUCATION2003REVISION', 'EDUCATIONREPORTINGFLAG', 'ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS', 'HISPANICORIGIN', 'HISPANICORIGINRACERECODE', 'ICD10CODE', 'INFANTAGERECODE22', 'MANNEROFDEATH', 'MARITALSTATUS', 'METHODOFDISPOSITION', 'PLACEOFDEATHANDDECEDENTSSTATUS', 'PLACEOFINJURY', 'RACE', 'RACEIMPUTATIONFLAG', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE5', 'RECORDAXISCONDITIONS', 'RESIDENTSTATUS', 'TEMP_DEATHS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 03:22:32 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please tell me the total and Black deaths due to vehicle-related incidents and firearms separately, for each age from 12 to 18., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Age,Total_Deaths_Vehicle,Black_Deaths_Vehicle,Total_Deaths_Firearms,Black_Deaths_Firearms
12,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
13,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
14,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
15,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
16,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
17,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
18,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
```

This table displays the total and Black deaths due to vehicle-related incidents and firearms separately for each age from 12 to 18. The `deaths:int` placeholders represent integer values for the number of deaths, which would be retrieved from the database. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
