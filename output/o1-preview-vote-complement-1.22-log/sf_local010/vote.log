**Comparison and Selection of the Correct SQL Script**

After carefully reviewing and comparing the three SQL scripts (`0result.sql`, `1result.sql`, and `2result.sql`) along with their respective results, the appropriate script that accurately addresses the task is `0result.sql`. Here's the reasoning:

---

### **Understanding the Task**

**Objective:** Distribute all the unique city pairs into distance ranges based on their average distance across all routes between them, specifically into the ranges:

- Less than 1000 km (`0-1000`)
- 1000 km up to but not including 2000 km (`1000-2000`)
- 2000 km up to but not including 3000 km (`2000-3000`)
- 3000 km up to but not including 4000 km (`3000-4000`)
- 4000 km up to but not including 5000 km (`4000-5000`)
- 5000 km up to but not including 6000 km (`5000-6000`)
- 6000 km and above (`6000+`)

**Question:** How many pairs are there in the distance range with the fewest unique city pairs?

### **Analysis of Each SQL Script**

#### **Option 0: `0result.sql`**

**Approach:**

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Joins `FLIGHTS` with `AIRPORTS_DATA` on both departure and arrival airports.
   - Extracts the English names of the cities using `GET(PARSE_JSON(...), 'en')::STRING`.
   - Retrieves the coordinates for both departure and arrival airports.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Standardizes city pairs using `LOWER`, `LEAST`, and `GREATEST` to ensure each pair is unique and ordered lexicographically.
   - Parses the longitude and latitude from the coordinates string by removing parentheses and splitting the string.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Uses the `ST_DISTANCE` function on `ST_MAKEPOINT`s created from the coordinates to calculate the geodesic distance between city pairs.
   - Converts the distance from meters to kilometers.

4. **Average Distance Computation:**
   - Groups by city pairs and calculates the average distance using `AVG(distance_km)`.

5. **Categorization into Distance Ranges:**
   - Assigns each city pair to a distance range based on the average distance.

6. **Final Aggregation:**
   - Counts the number of city pairs in each distance range.
   - Identifies the range(s) with the minimum number of pairs.

**Result:**
- The smallest number of city pairs in a range is **3**.

#### **Option 1: `1result.sql`**

**Approach:**

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Similar to Option 0, but uses `LEAST` and `GREATEST` directly on the city names without parsing JSON.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Parses coordinates by removing parentheses and splitting the string.
   - Converts coordinate strings to numeric longitude and latitude values.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Manually computes distances using the **Haversine formula**, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes.
   - Converts degrees to radians for the trigonometric functions.

4. **Average Distance Computation:**
   - Groups by city pairs and computes the average distance.

5. **Categorization into Distance Ranges:**
   - Assigns each city pair to a distance range using slightly different boundary conditions (e.g., `avg_distance <= 1000`).

6. **Final Aggregation:**
   - Counts the number of city pairs in each distance range.
   - Identifies the range(s) with the minimum number of pairs.

**Issues:**

- **Possible Calculation Errors:** Manual implementation of the Haversine formula can be error-prone if not implemented correctly.
- **Boundary Conditions:** The use of `<=` and `>` may cause off-by-one errors at the exact boundary values.

**Result:**
- The smallest number of city pairs in a range is **3**.

#### **Option 2: `2result.sql`**

**Approach:**

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Parses the English city names from the JSON field using `(PARSE_JSON(...):"en")::STRING`.
   - Extracts and cleans coordinates, converting them into numeric values.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Creates spatial points using `ST_POINT` from the coordinates.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Calculates distances using `ST_DISTANCE` between the spatial points, which ensures accurate geodesic computations.

4. **Average Distance Computation:**
   - Groups by city pairs and computes the average distance.

5. **Categorization into Distance Ranges:**
   - Uses a slightly different range labeling system (e.g., `'0-999 km'` instead of `'0-1000'`), which could lead to inconsistencies in range assignment.

6. **Final Aggregation:**
   - Counts the number of city pairs in each distance range.
   - Finds the smallest number of pairs across ranges.

**Issues:**

- **Range Definitions:** The labels and conditions for ranges are inconsistent with the specified ranges in the task. For example, the first range is `'0-999 km'` instead of `'0-1000'`.
- **Parsing Complexity:** The parsing steps are more complex, increasing the risk of errors.

**Result:**
- The smallest number of city pairs in a range is **3**.

### **Reasoning for Selecting `0result.sql`**

- **Accuracy in Data Parsing:**
  - Correctly extracts city names from JSON using `GET(PARSE_JSON(...), 'en')::STRING`.
  - Reliably parses coordinates into numeric longitude and latitude.

- **Use of Spatial Functions:**
  - Employs `ST_DISTANCE` and `ST_MAKEPOINT`, which are robust and accurate for geospatial calculations.
  - Ensures that distances are calculated over the earth's surface accurately.

- **Correct Range Definitions:**
  - Uses precise range boundaries as per the task requirements.
  - Assigns city pairs to ranges using `<` operators, which appropriately handles boundary conditions.

- **Ordering of City Pairs:**
  - Uses `LOWER`, `LEAST`, and `GREATEST` to standardize city pairs, preventing duplicate pairs in different orders.

- **Clarity and Maintainability:**
  - The SQL script is well-structured with clear Common Table Expressions (CTEs), making it easier to understand and verify.

- **Consistency with Task Requirements:**
  - Each step in `0result.sql` aligns precisely with the requirements outlined in the task, reducing the likelihood of errors.

### **Conclusion**

Considering the accuracy, adherence to the task requirements, and robustness of the SQL script, **`0result.sql` is the correct answer**.
