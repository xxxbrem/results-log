Begin Exploring Related Columns
To find the top 5 countries with the highest average runs per match for all players across all seasons and include their batting averages, we need to identify the relevant tables, columns, and potential conditions.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **PLAYER**
   - `"player_id"`: To identify each player uniquely.
   - `"country_name"`: To determine the country each player belongs to.

2. **PLAYER_MATCH**
   - `"player_id"`: To link players to matches they have played.
   - `"match_id"`: To identify matches.

3. **BATSMAN_SCORED**
   - `"match_id"`: To link runs to specific matches.
   - `"over_id"`, `"ball_id"`, `"innings_no"`: To identify each ball.
   - `"runs_scored"`: The number of runs scored on each ball.

4. **BALL_BY_BALL**
   - `"match_id"`, `"over_id"`, `"ball_id"`, `"innings_no"`: To link to BATSMAN_SCORED.
   - `"striker"`: The `"player_id"` of the batsman who faced the ball.

5. **WICKET_TAKEN**
   - `"player_out"`: The `"player_id"` of the player who was dismissed.
   - `"match_id"`, `"over_id"`, `"ball_id"`, `"innings_no"`: To link to specific dismissals.

**Potential Conditions:**

- **Joins:**
  - Join **BATSMAN_SCORED** and **BALL_BY_BALL** on `"match_id"`, `"over_id"`, `"ball_id"`, and `"innings_no"` to get the runs scored by each striker.
  - Join the result with **PLAYER** using `"player_id"` to get the country of each batsman.
  - Join with **PLAYER_MATCH** to get the number of matches played by each player.
  - Join with **WICKET_TAKEN** to get the number of times a player was dismissed.

- **Aggregations:**
  - Sum of `"runs_scored"` for each player or country.
  - Count of matches played by each player.
  - Count of dismissals for each player.

- **Grouping:**
  - Group by `"player_id"` and `"country_name"` to calculate totals per player.
  - Group by `"country_name"` to calculate totals per country.

- **Limitations:**
  - Use `LIMIT 100` to restrict the number of rows returned.
  - Use `DISTINCT` to get unique records where necessary.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List All Countries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_name"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."PLAYER"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count of Players per Country:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "player_id") AS "player_count"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."PLAYER"
   GROUP BY "country_name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Total Runs Scored by Each Player:**

   ```sql
   SELECT bb."striker", SUM(bs."runs_scored") AS "total_runs"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."BATSMAN_SCORED" bs
   JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL" bb
     ON bs."match_id" = bb."match_id"
     AND bs."over_id" = bb."over_id"
     AND bs."ball_id" = bb."ball_id"
     AND bs."innings_no" = bb."innings_no"
   GROUP BY bb."striker"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Total Runs Scored by Players from Each Country:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."country_name", SUM(bs."runs_scored") AS "total_runs"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."BATSMAN_SCORED" bs
   JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL" bb
     ON bs."match_id" = bb."match_id"
     AND bs."over_id" = bb."over_id"
     AND bs."ball_id" = bb."ball_id"
     AND bs."innings_no" = bb."innings_no"
   JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."PLAYER" p
     ON bb."striker" = p."player_id"
   GROUP BY p."country_name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Number of Matches Played by Each Player:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "player_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "match_id") AS "matches_played"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."PLAYER_MATCH"
   GROUP BY "player_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Number of Dismissals per Player:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "player_out", COUNT(*) AS "dismissals"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."WICKET_TAKEN"
   GROUP BY "player_out"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate Batting Average for Each Player:**

   ```sql
   SELECT runs."player_id", runs."total_runs", outs."dismissals",
     (runs."total_runs" / NULLIF(outs."dismissals", 0)) AS "batting_average"
   FROM (
     SELECT bb."striker" AS "player_id", SUM(bs."runs_scored") AS "total_runs"
     FROM "IPL"."IPL"."BATSMAN_SCORED" bs
     JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL" bb
       ON bs."match_id" = bb."match_id"
       AND bs."over_id" = bb."over_id"
       AND bs."ball_id" = bb."ball_id"
       AND bs."innings_no" = bb."innings_no"
     GROUP BY bb."striker"
   ) runs
   LEFT JOIN (
     SELECT "player_out", COUNT(*) AS "dismissals"
     FROM "IPL"."IPL"."WICKET_TAKEN"
     GROUP BY "player_out"
   ) outs
     ON runs."player_id" = outs."player_out"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   SELECT runs."player_id", runs."total_runs", matches."matches_played",
     (runs."total_runs" / NULLIF(matches."matches_played", 0)) AS "average_runs_per_match"
   FROM (
     SELECT bb."striker" AS "player_id", SUM(bs."runs_scored") AS "total_runs"
     FROM "IPL"."IPL"."BATSMAN_SCORED" bs
     JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL" bb
       ON bs."match_id" = bb."match_id"
       AND bs."over_id" = bb."over_id"
       AND bs."ball_id" = bb."ball_id"
       AND bs."innings_no" = bb."innings_no"
     GROUP BY bb."striker"
   ) runs
   LEFT JOIN (
     SELECT "player_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "match_id") AS "matches_played"
     FROM "IPL"."IPL"."PLAYER_MATCH"
     GROUP BY "player_id"
   ) matches
     ON runs."player_id" = matches."player_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Total Runs and Matches per Country:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."country_name", SUM(bs."runs_scored") AS "total_runs",
     COUNT(DISTINCT pm."match_id") AS "total_matches"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."PLAYER" p
   JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."PLAYER_MATCH" pm
     ON p."player_id" = pm."player_id"
   JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL" bb
     ON p."player_id" = bb."striker"
   JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."BATSMAN_SCORED" bs
     ON bb."match_id" = bs."match_id"
     AND bb."over_id" = bs."over_id"
     AND bb."ball_id" = bs."ball_id"
     AND bb."innings_no" = bs."innings_no"
   GROUP BY p."country_name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate Batting Average per Country:**

    ```sql
    SELECT country_runs."country_name", country_runs."total_runs", country_outs."dismissals",
      (country_runs."total_runs" / NULLIF(country_outs."dismissals", 0)) AS "batting_average"
    FROM (
      SELECT p."country_name", SUM(bs."runs_scored") AS "total_runs"
      FROM "IPL"."IPL"."PLAYER" p
      JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL" bb
        ON p."player_id" = bb."striker"
      JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."BATSMAN_SCORED" bs
        ON bb."match_id" = bs."match_id"
        AND bb."over_id" = bs."over_id"
        AND bb."ball_id" = bs."ball_id"
        AND bb."innings_no" = bs."innings_no"
      GROUP BY p."country_name"
    ) country_runs
    LEFT JOIN (
      SELECT p."country_name", COUNT(*) AS "dismissals"
      FROM "IPL"."IPL"."PLAYER" p
      JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."WICKET_TAKEN" wt
        ON p."player_id" = wt."player_out"
      GROUP BY p."country_name"
    ) country_outs
      ON country_runs."country_name" = country_outs."country_name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the data relevant to the task:

- Queries 1-2 gather basic information about countries and players.
- Queries 3-4 calculate total runs scored by players and countries.
- Queries 5-6 determine the number of matches played and dismissals per player.
- Queries 7-8 calculate batting averages and average runs per match for each player.
- Queries 9-10 aggregate runs, matches, and batting averages on a country level.

**Note:** The `NULLIF` function is used to prevent division by zero errors when calculating averages. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that players or countries with zero matches or dismissals are included in the results.

**Important Points:**

- All column names are enclosed in double quotations as required.
- Each query is different and serves to understand the values in related columns.
- `LIMIT 100` is used in each query to restrict the output.
- No CTEs or schema checks are used.
- `DISTINCT` and aggregations are employed where appropriate.
- The knowledge used is solely based on the provided tables and columns.Query:

Task: Can you help me find the top 5 countries with the highest average runs per match for all players across all seasons, and also include their batting averages?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The top 5 countries with the highest average runs per match for all players across all seasons, along with their batting averages, are:

```csv
Country,Average_Runs_per_Match,Batting_Average
country1:str,average_runs_per_match1:float,batting_average1:float
country2:str,average_runs_per_match2:float,batting_average2:float
country3:str,average_runs_per_match3:float,batting_average3:float
country4:str,average_runs_per_match4:float,batting_average4:float
country5:str,average_runs_per_match5:float,batting_average5:float
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Country**: The name of the country.
- **Average_Runs_per_Match**: Calculated by dividing the total runs scored by all players from the country by the total number of matches they played.
- **Batting_Average**: Calculated by dividing the total runs scored by the total number of times the players were dismissed (got out).

These metrics provide insight into the overall performance of players from each country in terms of both consistency (batting average) and impact per match (average runs per match)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'IPL': {'IPL': ['BALL_BY_BALL', 'BATSMAN_SCORED', 'EXTRA_RUNS', 'MATCH', 'PLAYER', 'PLAYER_MATCH', 'TEAM', 'WICKET_TAKEN']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The top 5 countries with the highest average runs per match for all players across all seasons, along with their batting averages, are:

```csv
Country,Average_Runs_per_Match,Batting_Average
country1:str,average_runs_per_match1:float,batting_average1:float
country2:str,average_runs_per_match2:float,batting_average2:float

country4:str,average_runs_per_match4:float,batting_average4:float
country5:str,average_runs_per_match5:float,batting_average5:float
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Country**: The name of the country.
- **Average_Runs_per_Match**: Calculated by dividing the total runs scored by all players from the country by the total number of matches they played.
- **Batting_Average**: Calculated by dividing the total runs scored by the total number of times the players were dismissed (got out).

These metrics provide insight into the overall performance of players from each country in terms of both consistency (batting average) and impact per match (average runs per match). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
