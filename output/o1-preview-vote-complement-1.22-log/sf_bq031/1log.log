2025-01-26 04:43:35 - root - INFO - Apologies for the confusion. The error occurred because the column `"stn"` does not exist in the `"NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS"` table. In the `STATIONS` table, the station identifier is stored under the column `"usaf"`, not `"stn"`.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "usaf", "wban", "name", "state", "country"
FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS"
WHERE "name" ILIKE '%ROCHESTER%'
LIMIT 100;
```

This query selects the correct columns and should execute without errors. It retrieves the `"usaf"` and `"wban"` identifiers along with the station name, state, and country for stations whose names contain "ROCHESTER".

**Explanation:**

- **Issue with the Original Query:**
  - The column `"stn"` does not exist in the `STATIONS` table.
  - The station identifier column in `STATIONS` is named `"usaf"`.

- **Resolution:**
  - Replace `"stn"` with `"usaf"` in the SELECT clause and any JOIN conditions involving the `STATIONS` table.

**Next Steps:**

If you need to join the `GSOD2019` table with the `STATIONS` table, ensure you join on the correct columns:

```sql
SELECT g."stn", g."wban", g."year", g."mo", g."da", g."temp", g."prcp", g."wdsp", g."gust",
       s."name", s."state", s."country"
FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2019" AS g
INNER JOIN "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS" AS s
ON g."stn" = s."usaf" AND g."wban" = s."wban"
WHERE s."name" ILIKE '%ROCHESTER%'
  AND g."year" = '2019'
  AND g."mo" IN ('01', '02', '03')
ORDER BY g."mo", g."da"
LIMIT 100;
```

In this query:

- **Join Condition:**
  - `g."stn" = s."usaf"` joins the weather data with the station metadata.
  - `g."wban" = s."wban"` ensures the correct matching of records.

- **Filters:**
  - `s."name" ILIKE '%ROCHESTER%'` filters for stations in Rochester.
  - `g."year" = '2019'` selects data from the year 2019.
  - `g."mo" IN ('01', '02', '03')` selects records from the first season (January to March).
  
Make sure to replace `"GSOD2019"` with the actual table name for the year 2019 if it differs.

**Note:** Always verify the column names in your tables when constructing SQL queries to avoid such errors.

Task: Show me the daily weather data (temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) in Rochester for the first season of year 2019, converted to Celsius, centimeters, and meters per second, respectively. Also, include the moving averages (window size = 8) and the differences between the moving averages for up to 8 days prior (all values rounded to one decimal place, sorted by date in ascending order, and records starting from 2019-01-09).

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Date,Temperature_Celsius,Precipitation_cm,Wind_Speed_mps,Temperature_MA8_Celsius,Precipitation_MA8_cm,Wind_Speed_MA8_mps,Temperature_Difference_Celsius,Precipitation_Difference_cm,Wind_Speed_Difference_mps
2019-01-09,temperature1:float,precipitation1:float,wind_speed1:float,ma_temperature1:float,ma_precipitation1:float,ma_wind_speed1:float,diff_temperature1:float,diff_precipitation1:float,diff_wind_speed1:float

```

This table presents the daily weather data for Rochester starting from January 9, 2019. It includes temperature (in Celsius), precipitation (in centimeters), and wind speed (in meters per second), along with their 8-day moving averages and the differences between the current moving average and up to 8 days prior. All values are rounded to one decimal place and sorted by date in ascending order..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 04:50:28 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Show me the daily weather data (temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) in Rochester for the first season of year 2019, converted to Celsius, centimeters, and meters per second, respectively. Also, include the moving averages (window size = 8) and the differences between the moving averages for up to 8 days prior (all values rounded to one decimal place, sorted by date in ascending order, and records starting from 2019-01-09)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Date,Temperature_Celsius,Precipitation_cm,Wind_Speed_mps,Temperature_MA8_Celsius,Precipitation_MA8_cm,Wind_Speed_MA8_mps,Temperature_Difference_Celsius,Precipitation_Difference_cm,Wind_Speed_Difference_mps

This table presents the daily weather data for Rochester starting from January 9, 2019. It includes temperature (in Celsius), precipitation (in centimeters), and wind speed (in meters per second), along with their 8-day moving averages and the differences between the current moving average and up to 8 days prior. All values are rounded to one decimal place and sorted by date in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
