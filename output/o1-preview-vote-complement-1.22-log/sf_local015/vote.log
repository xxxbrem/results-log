After comparing both SQL queries, the **first SQL (`1result.sql`)** is the correct one to use.

**Reason:**

- **Specific Filtering on Riders (Drivers):** The first SQL includes the condition `LOWER(v."victim_role") = 'driver'`, which ensures that only **motorcycle riders (drivers)** are included in the analysis. This is crucial because the task is to calculate the percentages for motorcycle riders specifically, excluding passengers or other parties.

- **Comprehensive Vehicle Type Matching:** It uses `p."statewide_vehicle_type" ILIKE '%motorcycle%'`, which captures all records where the vehicle type includes the word "motorcycle", ensuring that all types of motorcycles are considered.

- **Accurate Helmet Usage Determination:** The query checks both `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` for indications of helmet usage, accurately categorizing riders into 'Wearing_Helmet', 'Not_Wearing_Helmet', or 'Unknown'.

In contrast, the **second SQL (`2result.sql`)**:

- **Does Not Filter on Victim Role:** It lacks a condition on `victim_role`, which means it could include passengers, pedestrians, or others who are not motorcycle riders, potentially skewing the results.

- **Specific Vehicle Type Value:** It filters on `p."statewide_vehicle_type" = 'motorcycle or scooter'`, which might exclude some records if there are variations in how motorcycles are labeled in the data (e.g., 'motorcycle', 'motorcycle or scooter').

Therefore, the first SQL better aligns with the task requirements by accurately focusing on motorcycle riders involved in fatal accidents and properly assessing helmet usage among them.
