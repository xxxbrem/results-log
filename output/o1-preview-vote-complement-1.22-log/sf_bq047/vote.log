0result.sql

I chose `0result.sql` because it best fulfills the task requirements:

1. **Focus on Data Near LaGuardia and JFK Airports**: The SQL script specifically filters complaints to those occurring near LaGuardia and JFK airports by using precise latitude and longitude ranges. This ensures that the analysis is centered on the areas around the two airports, as requested.

2. **Time Period from 2008 to 2017**: It filters both the temperature data and complaint data to the specified 10-year period starting from 2008 and ending in 2017.

3. **Complaint Types with More Than 5,000 Occurrences**: The script aggregates total complaints per type and filters to include only those complaint types that have a total complaint count greater than 5,000, complying with the "common" complaints criterion.

4. **Calculation of Total Complaint Count and Total Day Count**: It calculates the total number of complaints (`Total_Complaint_Count`) and the total number of days (`Total_Day_Count`) for each complaint type.

5. **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**: The script computes the Pearson correlation coefficients between temperature and both the complaint count and the complaint percentage:

   - **Complaint Count Correlation**: It calculates the correlation between daily temperature and the daily count of complaints for each type.
   - **Complaint Percentage Correlation**: It calculates the correlation between daily temperature and the percentage of complaints of each type relative to the total complaints on that day.

6. **Filtering for Strong Correlations**: It filters the results to include only those complaint types where the absolute value of the Pearson correlation coefficient is greater than 0.5, satisfying the "strongly correlated" criterion.

7. **Correct Statistical Computations**: The script correctly uses statistical functions such as `COVAR_POP`, `STDDEV_POP`, and applies the Pearson correlation formula accurately.

8. **Clean and Readable Structure**: The SQL script is well-structured with Common Table Expressions (CTEs), which makes it easier to understand and maintain.

The results in `0result.csv` align with expectations for complaints that are temperature-dependent. For example, the `HEAT/HOT WATER` and `HEATING` complaint types show a strong negative correlation with temperature, which is logical because such complaints are more frequent in colder weather.

In comparison, the other SQL scripts (`1result.sql` and `2result.sql`) have some limitations:

- **`1result.sql`**: While it also focuses on the airports and computes the necessary statistics, it includes complaint types with correlation coefficients below the specified threshold (e.g., `Dead Tree` with a correlation coefficient of `0.4839`). This indicates that the filtering criteria are not consistently applied.

- **`2result.sql`**: This script appears to consider data from all of New York City rather than focusing specifically on the areas around LaGuardia and JFK airports. It includes complaint types that may not be as relevant to the airport areas and could skew the analysis away from the intended focus.

Therefore, `0result.sql` is the correct choice as it accurately addresses all the requirements of the task and provides meaningful insights into the relationship between complaint types and daily temperature in the vicinity of LaGuardia and JFK airports over the specified time period.
