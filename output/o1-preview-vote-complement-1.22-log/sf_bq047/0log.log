Begin Exploring Related Columns
The relevant tables and columns are:

**From `NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"`:**

- `"complaint_type"`: Identifies the type of complaint. Used to group and count complaints by type.
- `"created_date"`: Timestamp of when the complaint was created. Used to filter complaints by date and aggregate daily counts.
- `"latitude"`, `"longitude"`: Coordinates of the complaint location. Used to filter complaints near LaGuardia and JFK airports.

**From `NEW_YORK_NOAA.NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS`:**

- `"usaf"`, `"wban"`: Station identifiers. Used to locate the specific weather stations for LaGuardia and JFK airports.
- `"name"`: Name of the weather station. Used to identify stations corresponding to the airports.
- `"lat"`, `"lon"`: Coordinates of the station. Used to verify the station's location.

**From `NEW_YORK_NOAA.NOAA_GSOD.GSODYYYY` (for years 2008 to 2017):**

- `"stn"`: USAF station identifier. Used to match with `"usaf"` from `STATIONS`.
- `"wban"`: WBAN station identifier.
- `"year"`, `"mo"`, `"da"`: Date components. Used to filter data by date and join with complaint data.
- `"temp"`: Average daily temperature. Used to analyze the relationship with complaint counts.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Date range between **2008-01-01** and **2017-12-31**.
- Filtering complaints to those near LaGuardia and JFK airports using latitude and longitude ranges.
- Selecting complaint types with total occurrences greater than **5000**.
- Filtering GSOD data to include only data from the relevant weather stations.

Below are SQL queries to explore the data:

1. **Find station IDs for LaGuardia and JFK airports:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "usaf", "wban", "name", "country", "state", "lat", "lon"
   FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS
   WHERE "name" ILIKE '%JFK%' OR "name" ILIKE '%LaGuardia%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve weather data for these stations in 2008:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "stn", "wban", "year", "mo", "da", "temp"
   FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2008
   WHERE ("stn" = 'XXXX' AND "wban" = 'YYYY') OR ("stn" = 'ZZZZ' AND "wban" = 'WWWW')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *Replace 'XXXX', 'YYYY', 'ZZZZ', 'WWWW' with actual station IDs from Query 1.*

3. **View sample `"created_date"` values from complaints data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "created_date"
   FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List distinct complaint types and their counts:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "complaint_type", COUNT(*) AS "count"
   FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   GROUP BY "complaint_type"
   ORDER BY "count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve complaints near JFK Airport:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "complaint_type", "latitude", "longitude"

Task: Could you help me analyze the relationship between each complaint type and daily temperature in New York city, focusing on data in airports LaGuardia and JFK over the 10 years starting from 2008? Calculate the total complaint count, the total day count, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (rounded to 4 decimals) between temperature and both the count and percentage of each common (>5000 occurrences) and strongly correlated (absolute value > 0.5) complaint type.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Complaint_Type,Total_Complaints,Total_Days,Correlation_Count,Correlation_Percentage
complaint_type1:str,count1:int >5000,total_days:int,correlation_count1:float,correlation_percentage1:float
complaint_type2:str,count2:int >5000,total_days:int,correlation_count2:float,correlation_percentage2:float
...
(Attention: Only include complaint types with total complaints >5000 and absolute correlation coefficient >0.5)
```

To analyze the relationship between complaint types and daily temperature at LaGuardia and JFK airports over the 10 years starting from 2008, we aggregated the complaint data from the `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` table, focusing on complaints occurring near these airports. We joined this data with daily temperature data from the `GSOD` tables corresponding to the years 2008 to 2017 for the relevant weather stations. We calculated the total complaint count, total day count, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (rounded to 4 decimals) between temperature and both the count and percentage of each complaint type. Only complaint types with more than 5,000 occurrences and a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) are included in the results..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
