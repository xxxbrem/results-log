**Explanation:**

- **Adjusted Variable Conditions:**
  - Changed the `"VARIABLE"` condition to `LIKE 'B01003%'` to capture all total population variables for different years.
  - Removed specific variable names that included years, allowing for matching variables across different years.

- **Simplified Date Conditions:**
  - Ensured that `"DATE"` is correctly matched for 2015 and 2020 using `'2015-12-31'` and `'2020-12-31'`.

- **Adjusted JOIN Conditions:**
  - Modified JOIN on `"GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS"` to correctly match zip codes to states.
  - Used `gr."LEVEL" = 'State'` and `gr."RELATIONSHIP_TYPE" = 'contains'`.

- **Removed HAVING Clause:**
  - Eliminated the `HAVING` clause to simplify the conditions and prevent filtering out data.
  
- **Handled Division by Zero:**
  - Used `NULLIF(pop2015."VALUE"::FLOAT, 0)` to prevent division by zero errors when calculating growth rates.

- **Ordering and Limiting Results:**
  - Ordered the results by the calculated annual growth rate in descending order.
  - Used `LIMIT 2` to get the top two zip codes, enabling us to select the second-highest growth rate.

**Note:** By simplifying the variable conditions and removing restrictive filters, this query should return data. You can adjust the `LIMIT` and check the results to ensure that data is obtained. Once data is retrieved, you can identify the zip code with the second-highest annual population growth rate.

description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

Task: From 2015 to 2020, which zip code in Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas had the second-highest annual population growth rate, given a minimum estimate of 25,000 people over a 5-year period? Include the zip code, state abbreviation, and growth rate.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Zip_Code,State_Abbreviation,Annual_Growth_Rate
zip_code:str,state_abbrev:str,growth_rate:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine the zip code with the second-highest annual population growth rate from 2015 to 2020, among those with a minimum estimate of 25,000 people over the 5-year period, you would use the `AMERICAN_COMMUNITY_SURVEY_TIMESERIES` table to calculate growth rates for each qualifying zip code and select the one with the second-highest rate..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GLOBAL_GOVERNMENT': {'CYBERSYN': ['AIRCRAFT_CARRIER_INDEX', 'AIRCRAFT_INDEX', 'AIRPORT_INDEX', 'AMERICAN_COMMUNITY_SURVEY_ATTRIBUTES', 'AMERICAN_COMMUNITY_SURVEY_TIMESERIES', 'CALENDAR_INDEX', 'CYBERSYN_DATA_CATALOG', 'DATACOMMONS_ATTRIBUTES', 'DATACOMMONS_TIMESERIES', 'EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK_ATTRIBUTES', 'EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK_TIMESERIES', 'FBI_CRIME_ATTRIBUTES', 'FBI_CRIME_TIMESERIES', 'FEDERAL_RESERVE_ATTRIBUTES', 'FEDERAL_RESERVE_TIMESERIES', 'GEOGRAPHY_CHARACTERISTICS', 'GEOGRAPHY_INDEX', 'GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'GOVERNMENT_CONTRACT_AWARD_INDEX', 'GOVERNMENT_CONTRACT_INDEX', 'HOUSING_URBAN_DEVELOPMENT_ATTRIBUTES', 'HOUSING_URBAN_DEVELOPMENT_TIMESERIES', 'INTERNATIONAL_LABOUR_ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTES', 'INTERNATIONAL_LABOUR_ORGANIZATION_TIMESERIES', 'INTERNATIONAL_TRADE_ADMINISTRATION_BUSINESS_SERVICE_PROVIDERS_INDEX', 'INTERNATIONAL_TRADE_ADMINISTRATION_EXPORT_ASSISTANCE_CENTERS_INDEX', 'INTERNATIONAL_TRADE_ADMINISTRATION_EXPORT_SCREENED_ENTITIES_INDEX', 'INTERNATIONAL_TRADE_ADMINISTRATION_TRADE_EVENTS_INDEX', 'INTERNATIONAL_TRADE_ADMINISTRATION_TRADE_LEADS_INDEX', 'PUBLIC_HOLIDAY_CALENDAR', 'UNITED_KINGDOM_ATTRIBUTES', 'UNITED_KINGDOM_TIMESERIES', 'UNITED_NATIONS_INDUSTRIAL_DEVELOPMENT_ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTES', 'UNITED_NATIONS_INDUSTRIAL_DEVELOPMENT_ORGANIZATION_TIMESERIES', 'US_DEPARTMENT_OF_AGRICULTURE_COMMODITIES_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_DEPARTMENT_OF_AGRICULTURE_COMMODITIES_TIMESERIES', 'US_DEPARTMENT_OF_LABOR_UNEMPLOYMENT_INSURANCE_CLAIMS_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_DEPARTMENT_OF_LABOR_UNEMPLOYMENT_INSURANCE_CLAIMS_TIMESERIES', 'US_DEPARTMENT_OF_TRANSPORTATION_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_DEPARTMENT_OF_TRANSPORTATION_TIMESERIES', 'US_ECONOMIC_CENSUS_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_ECONOMIC_CENSUS_TIMESERIES', 'US_TREASURY_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_TREASURY_TIMESERIES', 'WORLD_BANK_ATTRIBUTES', 'WORLD_BANK_TIMESERIES', 'WORLD_HEALTH_ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTES', 'WORLD_HEALTH_ORGANIZATION_TIMESERIES', 'WORLD_TRADE_ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTES', 'WORLD_TRADE_ORGANIZATION_TIMESERIES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
