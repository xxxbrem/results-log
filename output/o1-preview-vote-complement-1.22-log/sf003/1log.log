2025-01-23 15:05:17 - root - INFO - The error occurred because the SQL query was processing a large amount of data without appropriate filters, causing it to exceed the time limit. To fix this issue, we need to:

1. **Add Filters to Limit Data:**
   - Specify the `DATE` for 2015 and 2020.
   - Include the population variable code for total population estimates.
   - Filter ZIP codes with a minimum population estimate of 25,000 in 2020.

2. **Use the Correct Population Variable:**
   - The variable code for total population in the American Community Survey (ACS) is **`B01003_001E`**.

3. **Adjust the Growth Rate Calculation:**
   - Calculate the annual growth rate over the 5-year period.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
WITH growth AS (
  SELECT acs2015."GEO_ID",
         ((acs2020."VALUE" - acs2015."VALUE") / NULLIF(acs2015."VALUE", 0)) * 100 / 5 AS "ANNUAL_GROWTH_RATE"
  FROM
    (SELECT "GEO_ID", "VALUE"
     FROM "GLOBAL_GOVERNMENT"."CYBERSYN"."AMERICAN_COMMUNITY_SURVEY_TIMESERIES"
     WHERE "DATE" = '2015-12-31' AND "VARIABLE" = 'B01003_001E') acs2015
  JOIN
    (SELECT "GEO_ID", "VALUE"
     FROM "GLOBAL_GOVERNMENT"."CYBERSYN"."AMERICAN_COMMUNITY_SURVEY_TIMESERIES"
     WHERE "DATE" = '2020-12-31' AND "VARIABLE" = 'B01003_001E' AND "VALUE" >= 25000) acs2020
  ON acs2015."GEO_ID" = acs2020."GEO_ID"
),
ranked_growth AS (
  SELECT growth.*,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY growth."ANNUAL_GROWTH_RATE" DESC) AS "RANK"
  FROM growth
)
SELECT ranked_growth."GEO_ID",
       geo."GEO_NAME" AS "ZIP_CODE",
       state_char."VALUE" AS "STATE_ABBR",
       ranked_growth."ANNUAL_GROWTH_RATE"
FROM ranked_growth
JOIN "GLOBAL_GOVERNMENT"."CYBERSYN"."GEOGRAPHY_INDEX" geo
  ON ranked_growth."GEO_ID" = geo."GEO_ID"
JOIN "GLOBAL_GOVERNMENT"."CYBERSYN"."GEOGRAPHY_CHARACTERISTICS" state_char
  ON geo."GEO_ID" = state_char."GEO_ID" AND state_char."RELATIONSHIP_TYPE" = 'USPS_ZIP_CODE_STATE_ABBREVIATION'
WHERE ranked_growth."RANK" = 2;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Filtering by Date and Variable:**
  - The subqueries `acs2015` and `acs2020` select records for the years 2015 and 2020, respectively.
  - We filter by the total population variable code `'B01003_001E'`.

- **Calculating Annual Growth Rate:**
  - We compute the population growth between 2015 and 2020.
  - The annual growth rate is calculated by dividing the total growth over 5 years.

- **Filtering by Minimum Population:**
  - We include only ZIP codes (`GEO_IDs`) where the 2020 population is at least 25,000.

- **Ranking and Selecting the Second-Highest Growth Rate:**
  - We use `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank the ZIP codes by growth rate in descending order.
  - We select the ZIP code with a rank of 2.

- **Joining to Get ZIP Code and State Abbreviation:**
  - We join with `GEOGRAPHY_INDEX` to get the ZIP code name (`GEO_NAME`).
  - We join with `GEOGRAPHY_CHARACTERISTICS` to get the state abbreviation where `RELATIONSHIP_TYPE` is `'USPS_ZIP_CODE_STATE_ABBREVIATION'`.

**Note:** This query should run efficiently without timing out because it limits the data to specific dates and variables, reducing the amount of data processed.

**Result Format:**

The query will return one row with the following columns:

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

table_name,GLOBAL_GOVERNMENT.CYBERSYN.FX_RATES_TIMESERIES
description,"Foreign exchange rates for currency pairs (base and quote currencies), with data from FRED, ECB, and BIS.

Foreign exchange (FX) rates are the rates at which one currency can be exchanged for another. These rates fluctuate based on various factors including economic indicators, market sentiment, political events, and global financial stability. Foreign exchange rates are crucial for international trade and finance, as they determine how much of one currency is needed to buy a unit of another currency. These rates can be floating, changing continuously based on market forces, or they might be pegged (fixed) to another major currency or basket of currencies, managed by a country's central bank. FX rates data is provided historically by FRED (pre-2000) and by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for 2000 onwards. To note, these data sources often do not publish the exchange rate every day.

Provides historical values for each currency pair collected by BASE_CURRENCY_ID and QUOTE_CURRENCY_ID.

Task: From 2015 to 2020, which zip code in Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas had the second-highest annual population growth rate, given a minimum estimate of 25,000 people over a 5-year period? Include the zip code, state abbreviation, and growth rate.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: I'm unable to provide the specific zip code with the second-highest annual population growth rate from 2015 to 2020 meeting the specified criteria, as this detailed data is not available. To obtain this information, please consult the American Community Survey data from 2015 to 2020 for precise population statistics at the zip code level..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GLOBAL_GOVERNMENT': {'CYBERSYN': ['AIRCRAFT_CARRIER_INDEX', 'AIRCRAFT_INDEX', 'AIRPORT_INDEX', 'AMERICAN_COMMUNITY_SURVEY_ATTRIBUTES', 'AMERICAN_COMMUNITY_SURVEY_TIMESERIES', 'CALENDAR_INDEX', 'CYBERSYN_DATA_CATALOG', 'DATACOMMONS_ATTRIBUTES', 'DATACOMMONS_TIMESERIES', 'EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK_ATTRIBUTES', 'EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK_TIMESERIES', 'FBI_CRIME_ATTRIBUTES', 'FBI_CRIME_TIMESERIES', 'FEDERAL_RESERVE_ATTRIBUTES', 'FEDERAL_RESERVE_TIMESERIES', 'GEOGRAPHY_CHARACTERISTICS', 'GEOGRAPHY_INDEX', 'GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'GOVERNMENT_CONTRACT_AWARD_INDEX', 'GOVERNMENT_CONTRACT_INDEX', 'HOUSING_URBAN_DEVELOPMENT_ATTRIBUTES', 'HOUSING_URBAN_DEVELOPMENT_TIMESERIES', 'INTERNATIONAL_LABOUR_ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTES', 'INTERNATIONAL_LABOUR_ORGANIZATION_TIMESERIES', 'INTERNATIONAL_TRADE_ADMINISTRATION_BUSINESS_SERVICE_PROVIDERS_INDEX', 'INTERNATIONAL_TRADE_ADMINISTRATION_EXPORT_ASSISTANCE_CENTERS_INDEX', 'INTERNATIONAL_TRADE_ADMINISTRATION_EXPORT_SCREENED_ENTITIES_INDEX', 'INTERNATIONAL_TRADE_ADMINISTRATION_TRADE_EVENTS_INDEX', 'INTERNATIONAL_TRADE_ADMINISTRATION_TRADE_LEADS_INDEX', 'PUBLIC_HOLIDAY_CALENDAR', 'UNITED_KINGDOM_ATTRIBUTES', 'UNITED_KINGDOM_TIMESERIES', 'UNITED_NATIONS_INDUSTRIAL_DEVELOPMENT_ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTES', 'UNITED_NATIONS_INDUSTRIAL_DEVELOPMENT_ORGANIZATION_TIMESERIES', 'US_DEPARTMENT_OF_AGRICULTURE_COMMODITIES_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_DEPARTMENT_OF_AGRICULTURE_COMMODITIES_TIMESERIES', 'US_DEPARTMENT_OF_LABOR_UNEMPLOYMENT_INSURANCE_CLAIMS_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_DEPARTMENT_OF_LABOR_UNEMPLOYMENT_INSURANCE_CLAIMS_TIMESERIES', 'US_DEPARTMENT_OF_TRANSPORTATION_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_DEPARTMENT_OF_TRANSPORTATION_TIMESERIES', 'US_ECONOMIC_CENSUS_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_ECONOMIC_CENSUS_TIMESERIES', 'US_TREASURY_ATTRIBUTES', 'US_TREASURY_TIMESERIES', 'WORLD_BANK_ATTRIBUTES', 'WORLD_BANK_TIMESERIES', 'WORLD_HEALTH_ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTES', 'WORLD_HEALTH_ORGANIZATION_TIMESERIES', 'WORLD_TRADE_ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTES', 'WORLD_TRADE_ORGANIZATION_TIMESERIES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Include the zip code, state abbreviation, and growth rate., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: I'm unable to provide the specific zip code with the second-highest annual population growth rate from 2015 to 2020 meeting the specified criteria, as this detailed data is not available. To obtain this information, please consult the American Community Survey data from 2015 to 2020 for precise population statistics at the zip code level.

2025-01-23 15:13:56 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing From 2015 to 2020, which zip code in Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas had the second-highest annual population growth rate, given a minimum estimate of 25,000 people over a 5-year period? Include the zip code, state abbreviation, and growth rate., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: I'm unable to provide the specific zip code with the second-highest annual population growth rate from 2015 to 2020 meeting the specified criteria, as this detailed data is not available. To obtain this information, please consult the American Community Survey data from 2015 to 2020 for precise population statistics at the zip code level. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-23 15:17:24 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing From 2015 to 2020, which zip code in Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas had the second-highest annual population growth rate, given a minimum estimate of 25,000 people over a 5-year period? Include the zip code, state abbreviation, and growth rate., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: I'm unable to provide the specific zip code with the second-highest annual population growth rate from 2015 to 2020 meeting the specified criteria, as this detailed data is not available. To obtain this information, please consult the American Community Survey data from 2015 to 2020 for precise population statistics at the zip code level. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
