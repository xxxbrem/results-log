**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- `"channelGrouping"`: Used to group data by different marketing channels.
- `"country"`: Identifies the country associated with each session or transaction.
- `"transactions"`: Represents the number of transactions in a session.
- `"fullVisitorId"`: Unique identifier for each visitor; could be used to count unique visitors.
- `"date"`: The date of the session; may be useful for time-based analysis.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Channels that include transactions from more than one country.
- Sessions where `"transactions"` is greater than zero.
- Grouping data to find the country with the highest total transactions within each channel.

**SQL Queries:**

```sql
-- 1. Retrieve distinct channel groupings
SELECT DISTINCT "channelGrouping"
FROM "ECOMMERCE"."ECOMMERCE"."ALL_SESSIONS"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 2. Retrieve distinct countries
SELECT DISTINCT "country"
FROM "ECOMMERCE"."ECOMMERCE"."ALL_SESSIONS"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 3. Get the count of distinct countries per channel grouping
SELECT "channelGrouping", COUNT(DISTINCT "country") AS "country_count"
FROM "ECOMMERCE"."ECOMMERCE"."ALL_SESSIONS"
GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 4. Identify channels with transactions from more than one country
SELECT "channelGrouping"
FROM "ECOMMERCE"."ECOMMERCE"."ALL_SESSIONS"
GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 5. List transactions per country and channel grouping
SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", "transactions"
FROM "ECOMMERCE"."ECOMMERCE"."ALL_SESSIONS"
WHERE "transactions" > 0
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 6. Calculate total transactions per country within each channel grouping
SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", SUM("transactions") AS "total_transactions"
FROM "ECOMMERCE"."ECOMMERCE"."ALL_SESSIONS"
GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 7. Find the maximum transactions per country for each channel grouping
SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", MAX("transactions") AS "max_transactions"
FROM "ECOMMERCE"."ECOMMERCE"."ALL_SESSIONS"
GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 8. List countries within each channel grouping that have transactions
SELECT DISTINCT "channelGrouping", "country"
FROM "ECOMMERCE"."ECOMMERCE"."ALL_SESSIONS"
WHERE "transactions" > 0
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 9. Retrieve total transactions for channels with multiple countries
SELECT "channelGrouping", SUM("transactions") AS "total_transactions"
FROM "ECOMMERCE"."ECOMMERCE"."ALL_SESSIONS"
GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 10. List countries with their total transactions, ordered by transactions descending within each channel
SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", SUM("transactions") AS "total_transactions"
FROM "ECOMMERCE"."ECOMMERCE"."ALL_SESSIONS"
GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
ORDER BY "channelGrouping", "total_transactions" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

These queries will help in understanding the distribution of transactions across countries and channel groupings, and they set the groundwork for identifying the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping that includes transactions from more than one country.Query:

Task: Identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, provided that the channel includes transactions from more than one country. What is the transaction total for that country?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Channel_Grouping,Country,Total_Transactions
channel1:str,country1:str,total_transactions1:int
channel2:str,country2:str,total_transactions2:int
...
```

For each channel grouping that includes transactions from more than one country, the table lists the country with the highest total transactions and the total number of transactions for that country..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ECOMMERCE': {'ECOMMERCE': ['ALL_SESSIONS', 'ALL_SESSIONS_RAW', 'CATEGORIES', 'CHECKOUT_NUDGE', 'CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_2_RESULTS', 'DAYS_WITH_RAIN', 'PARTITIONS', 'PARTITION_BY_DAY', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_LIST', 'REV_TRANSACTIONS', 'REV_TRANSACTIONS_VIEW', 'SALES_BY_SKU', 'SALES_REPORT', 'SITE_WIDE_PROMOTION', 'WEB_ANALYTICS', 'WEB_ANALYTICS_TEST']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 21:19:59 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, provided that the channel includes transactions from more than one country. What is the transaction total for that country?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Channel_Grouping,Country,Total_Transactions
channel1:str,country1:str,total_transactions1:int
channel2:str,country2:str,total_transactions2:int
...
```

For each channel grouping that includes transactions from more than one country, the table lists the country with the highest total transactions and the total number of transactions for that country. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
