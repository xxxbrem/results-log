Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to consider the following table and columns:

- **Table**: `ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS`
    - `"channelGrouping"`: Used to group data by channel.
    - `"country"`: Used to identify the country of each session.
    - `"transactions"`: Used to calculate the number of transactions.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Only include channel groupings that have transactions from more than one country.
- For each such channel, identify the country with the highest total transactions.

Here are at least 10 SQL queries to explore the data:

1. **View distinct channel groupings:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "channelGrouping"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **View distinct countries:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "country"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **Total transactions per country:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "country"
    ORDER BY total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Total transactions per channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
    ORDER BY total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **Countries within each channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Number of countries per channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", COUNT(DISTINCT "country") AS country_count
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Total transactions per country within each channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ORDER BY "channelGrouping", total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. **Channel groupings with transactions from more than one country:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **Country with highest total transactions per channel grouping (for channels with multiple countries):**
    ```sql
    SELECT t1."channelGrouping", t1."country", t1.total_transactions
    FROM (
        SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ) t1
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT "channelGrouping"
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    ) t2 ON t1."channelGrouping" = t2."channelGrouping"
    ORDER BY t1."channelGrouping", t1.total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **Top country per channel grouping with transactions from multiple countries:**
    ```sql
    SELECT t."channelGrouping", t."country", t.total_transactions
    FROM (
        SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "channelGrouping" ORDER BY SUM("transactions") DESC) AS rn
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ) t
    WHERE t.rn = 1
      AND t."channelGrouping" IN (
        SELECT "channelGrouping"
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    )
    ORDER BY t."channelGrouping"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Session count per country and channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", COUNT(*) AS session_count
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ORDER BY "channelGrouping", session_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Average transactions per country and channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", AVG("transactions") AS avg_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ORDER BY "channelGrouping", avg_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Total transaction revenue per country and channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", SUM("totalTransactionRevenue") AS total_revenue
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ORDER BY "channelGrouping", total_revenue DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Channels with the number of countries they reach:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", COUNT(DISTINCT "country") AS country_count
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
    ORDER BY country_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **List of countries per channel grouping (only channels with multiple countries):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    WHERE "channelGrouping" IN (
        SELECT "channelGrouping"
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    )
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ORDER BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

16. **Total transactions per country (only for channels with multiple countries):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    WHERE "channelGrouping" IN (
        SELECT "channelGrouping"
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    )
    GROUP BY "country"
    ORDER BY total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

17. **Countries contributing most to total transactions across all channels:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "country"
    ORDER BY total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution of transactions across different countries and channel groupings. They assist in identifying the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, specifically for channels that include transactions from more than one country.Query:

Task: Identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, provided that the channel includes transactions from more than one country. What is the transaction total for that country?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Channel_Grouping,Country,Total_Transactions
channel1:str,country1:str,total_transactions1:int
channel2:str,country2:str,total_transactions2:int
...
```

For each channel grouping that includes transactions from more than one country, the table lists the country with the highest total transactions and the total number of transactions for that country..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ECOMMERCE': {'ECOMMERCE': ['ALL_SESSIONS', 'ALL_SESSIONS_RAW', 'CATEGORIES', 'CHECKOUT_NUDGE', 'CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_2_RESULTS', 'DAYS_WITH_RAIN', 'PARTITIONS', 'PARTITION_BY_DAY', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_LIST', 'REV_TRANSACTIONS', 'REV_TRANSACTIONS_VIEW', 'SALES_BY_SKU', 'SALES_REPORT', 'SITE_WIDE_PROMOTION', 'WEB_ANALYTICS', 'WEB_ANALYTICS_TEST']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ECOMMERCE': {'ECOMMERCE': ['ALL_SESSIONS', 'ALL_SESSIONS_RAW', 'CATEGORIES', 'CHECKOUT_NUDGE', 'CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_2_RESULTS', 'DAYS_WITH_RAIN', 'PARTITIONS', 'PARTITION_BY_DAY', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_LIST', 'REV_TRANSACTIONS', 'REV_TRANSACTIONS_VIEW', 'SALES_BY_SKU', 'SALES_REPORT', 'SITE_WIDE_PROMOTION', 'WEB_ANALYTICS', 'WEB_ANALYTICS_TEST']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to consider the following table and columns:

- **Table**: `ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS`
    - `"channelGrouping"`: Used to group data by channel.
    - `"country"`: Used to identify the country of each session.
    - `"transactions"`: Used to calculate the number of transactions.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Only include channel groupings that have transactions from more than one country.
- For each such channel, identify the country with the highest total transactions.

Here are at least 10 SQL queries to explore the data:

1. **View distinct channel groupings:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "channelGrouping"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **View distinct countries:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "country"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **Total transactions per country:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "country"
    ORDER BY total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Total transactions per channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
    ORDER BY total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **Countries within each channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Number of countries per channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", COUNT(DISTINCT "country") AS country_count
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Total transactions per country within each channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ORDER BY "channelGrouping", total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. **Channel groupings with transactions from more than one country:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **Country with highest total transactions per channel grouping (for channels with multiple countries):**
    ```sql
    SELECT t1."channelGrouping", t1."country", t1.total_transactions
    FROM (
        SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"

    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution of transactions across different countries and channel groupings. They assist in identifying the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, specifically for channels that include transactions from more than one country.Query:

Task: Identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, provided that the channel includes transactions from more than one country. What is the transaction total for that country?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Channel_Grouping,Country,Total_Transactions
channel1:str,country1:str,total_transactions1:int
channel2:str,country2:str,total_transactions2:int
...
```

For each channel grouping that includes transactions from more than one country, the table lists the country with the highest total transactions and the total number of transactions for that country..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ECOMMERCE': {'ECOMMERCE': ['ALL_SESSIONS', 'ALL_SESSIONS_RAW', 'CATEGORIES', 'CHECKOUT_NUDGE', 'CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_2_RESULTS', 'DAYS_WITH_RAIN', 'PARTITIONS', 'PARTITION_BY_DAY', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_LIST', 'REV_TRANSACTIONS', 'REV_TRANSACTIONS_VIEW', 'SALES_BY_SKU', 'SALES_REPORT', 'SITE_WIDE_PROMOTION', 'WEB_ANALYTICS', 'WEB_ANALYTICS_TEST']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to consider the following table and columns:

- **Table**: `ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS`
    - `"channelGrouping"`: Used to group data by channel.
    - `"country"`: Used to identify the country of each session.
    - `"transactions"`: Used to calculate the number of transactions.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Only include channel groupings that have transactions from more than one country.
- For each such channel, identify the country with the highest total transactions.

Here are at least 10 SQL queries to explore the data:

1. **View distinct channel groupings:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "channelGrouping"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **View distinct countries:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "country"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **Total transactions per country:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "country"
    ORDER BY total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Total transactions per channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
    ORDER BY total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **Countries within each channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Number of countries per channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", COUNT(DISTINCT "country") AS country_count
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Total transactions per country within each channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ORDER BY "channelGrouping", total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. **Channel groupings with transactions from more than one country:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **Country with highest total transactions per channel grouping (for channels with multiple countries):**
    ```sql
    SELECT t1."channelGrouping", t1."country", t1.total_transactions
    FROM (
        SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ) t1
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT "channelGrouping"
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    ) t2 ON t1."channelGrouping" = t2."channelGrouping"
    ORDER BY t1."channelGrouping", t1.total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **Top country per channel grouping with transactions from multiple countries:**
    ```sql
    SELECT t."channelGrouping", t."country", t.total_transactions
    FROM (
        SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "channelGrouping" ORDER BY SUM("transactions") DESC) AS rn
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ) t
    WHERE t.rn = 1
      AND t."channelGrouping" IN (
        SELECT "channelGrouping"
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    )
    ORDER BY t."channelGrouping"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Session count per country and channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", COUNT(*) AS session_count
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ORDER BY "channelGrouping", session_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Average transactions per country and channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", AVG("transactions") AS avg_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ORDER BY "channelGrouping", avg_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Total transaction revenue per country and channel grouping:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country", SUM("totalTransactionRevenue") AS total_revenue
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ORDER BY "channelGrouping", total_revenue DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Channels with the number of countries they reach:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", COUNT(DISTINCT "country") AS country_count
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
    ORDER BY country_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **List of countries per channel grouping (only channels with multiple countries):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "channelGrouping", "country"
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    WHERE "channelGrouping" IN (
        SELECT "channelGrouping"
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1

    GROUP BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    ORDER BY "channelGrouping", "country"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

16. **Total transactions per country (only for channels with multiple countries):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    WHERE "channelGrouping" IN (
        SELECT "channelGrouping"
        FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
        GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "country") > 1
    )
    GROUP BY "country"
    ORDER BY total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

17. **Countries contributing most to total transactions across all channels:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "country", SUM("transactions") AS total_transactions
    FROM ECOMMERCE.ECOMMERCE.ALL_SESSIONS
    GROUP BY "country"
    ORDER BY total_transactions DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution of transactions across different countries and channel groupings. They assist in identifying the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, specifically for channels that include transactions from more than one country.Query:

Task: Identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, provided that the channel includes transactions from more than one country. What is the transaction total for that country?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Channel_Grouping,Country,Total_Transactions
channel1:str,country1:str,total_transactions1:int
channel2:str,country2:str,total_transactions2:int
...
```

For each channel grouping that includes transactions from more than one country, the table lists the country with the highest total transactions and the total number of transactions for that country..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ECOMMERCE': {'ECOMMERCE': ['ALL_SESSIONS', 'ALL_SESSIONS_RAW', 'CATEGORIES', 'CHECKOUT_NUDGE', 'CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_2_RESULTS', 'DAYS_WITH_RAIN', 'PARTITIONS', 'PARTITION_BY_DAY', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_LIST', 'REV_TRANSACTIONS', 'REV_TRANSACTIONS_VIEW', 'SALES_BY_SKU', 'SALES_REPORT', 'SITE_WIDE_PROMOTION', 'WEB_ANALYTICS', 'WEB_ANALYTICS_TEST']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
