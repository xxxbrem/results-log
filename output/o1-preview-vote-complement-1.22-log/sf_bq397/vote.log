2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

Both SQL queries aim to solve the task of identifying the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, provided that the channel includes transactions from more than one country. They both produce the same results, as shown in their respective CSV outputs.

**Comparing the SQL Queries:**

- **1result.sql:**
  - Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to create intermediate tables (`transactions_table`, `channel_country_counts`, `transactions_with_rn`).
  - First calculates total transactions per channel and country.
  - Counts the number of countries per channel.
  - Filters channels with more than one country.
  - Assigns row numbers to rank countries within each channel.
  - Selects the top country per channel based on total transactions.

- **2result.sql:**
  - Uses a subquery to identify channels with transactions from more than one country.
  - Directly calculates total transactions per channel and country for those channels.
  - Assigns row numbers to rank countries within each channel.
  - Selects the top country per channel based on total transactions.
  - More concise and efficient due to fewer subqueries and tables.

**Why `2result.sql` is the Better Choice:**

- **Efficiency and Readability:**
  - `2result.sql` is more concise and easier to read.
  - It avoids unnecessary joins and intermediate tables, which can improve performance.

- **Direct Approach:**
  - It directly filters the channels with more than one country using an `IN` clause.
  - This approach reduces complexity and makes the query more straightforward.

- **Same Result with Less Complexity:**
  - Both queries produce the same correct result.
  - However, `2result.sql` achieves this with less code and complexity.

Given these points, `2result.sql` is the correct and more optimal SQL query that answers the task.
