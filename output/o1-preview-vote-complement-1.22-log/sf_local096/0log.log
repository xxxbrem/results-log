SELECT DISTINCT m."year", m."MID"

```

This query selects distinct years and movie IDs from the `MOVIE` table, excludes records with null or empty years, orders the results by year, and limits the output to 100 rows.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- `MOVIE`:
  - `"MID"`: Movie ID, used to uniquely identify each movie and join with other tables.
  - `"year"`: Release year of the movie, used to group films by year.
  
- `M_CAST`:
  - `"MID"`: Movie ID, used to link cast members to movies.
  - `"PID"`: Person ID, used to identify actors in each movie.
  
- `PERSON`:
  - `"PID"`: Person ID, used to uniquely identify each person and join with other tables.
  - `"Gender"`: Gender of the person, used to determine if an actor is female.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Join `M_CAST` with `PERSON` on `"PID"` to get the gender of each actor in a movie.
- Check if all actors in a movie are female by ensuring all associated `"Gender"` values are 'Female'.
- Group movies by `"year"` to calculate the proportion per year.
- Use DISTINCT to get unique movies or actors where necessary.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all movies with their release years:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "MID", "year"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."MOVIE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all cast members for movies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "MID", "PID"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."M_CAST"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all persons with their genders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "PID", "Gender"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."PERSON"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get distinct genders of all persons:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Gender"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."PERSON"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count total number of films per year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "year", COUNT(DISTINCT "MID") AS "Total_Films"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."MOVIE"
   GROUP BY "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT "PID", "Name"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."PERSON"
   WHERE "Gender" ILIKE '%Female%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get all movies with only female actors (attempting to find such movies):**
   ```sql

   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."M_CAST" mc
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."PERSON" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
   GROUP BY mc."MID"
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p."Gender" ILIKE '%Female%' THEN mc."PID" END) = COUNT(mc."PID")
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List movies and count of male actors in each:**
   ```sql
   SELECT mc."MID", COUNT(DISTINCT p."PID") AS "Male_Actors"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."M_CAST" mc
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."PERSON" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
   WHERE p."Gender" ILIKE '%Male%'
   GROUP BY mc."MID"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List movies where all cast members are female:**
   ```sql
   SELECT mc."MID"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."M_CAST" mc
   JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."PERSON" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
   GROUP BY mc."MID"
   HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN p."Gender" NOT ILIKE '%Female%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Get the number of female actors in each movie:**
    ```sql
    SELECT mc."MID", COUNT(DISTINCT p."PID") AS "Female_Actors"
    FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."M_CAST" mc
    JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."PERSON" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
    WHERE p."Gender" ILIKE '%Female%'
    GROUP BY mc."MID"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Find total number of actors in each movie:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "MID", COUNT(DISTINCT "PID") AS "Total_Actors"
    FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."M_CAST"
    GROUP BY "MID"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **List movies along with the genders of their cast members:**
    ```sql
    SELECT mc."MID", p."Gender"
    FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."M_CAST" mc
    JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."PERSON" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Get movies released each year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "year", "MID"
    FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."MOVIE"
    ORDER BY "year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List movies with the count of male and female actors:**
    ```sql
    SELECT mc."MID",
           SUM(CASE WHEN p."Gender" ILIKE '%Female%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "Female_Actors",
           SUM(CASE WHEN p."Gender" ILIKE '%Male%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "Male_Actors"
    FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."M_CAST" mc
    JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."PERSON" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
    GROUP BY mc."MID"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Identify movies that have no cast members (if any):**
    ```sql
    SELECT m."MID", m."title"
    FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."MOVIE" m
    LEFT JOIN DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."M_CAST" mc ON m."MID" = mc."MID"
    WHERE mc."MID" IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the relationships between movies, cast members, and their genders, which are essential for calculating the proportion of female-actor-only films per year.Query:
SELECT "MID", "year"
   FROM DB_IMDB.DB_IMDB."MOVIE"
   LIMIT 100;
Answer:
MID,year

Task: I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Proportion of Female-Actor-Only Films,Total Number of All Films
year1:int,proportion1:float, total_films1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float, total_films2:int
...
```

This table shows, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors, along with the total number of all films released in those years..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'DB_IMDB': {'DB_IMDB': ['COUNTRY', 'GENRE', 'LANGUAGE', 'LOCATION', 'MOVIE', 'M_CAST', 'M_COUNTRY', 'M_DIRECTOR', 'M_GENRE', 'M_LANGUAGE', 'M_LOCATION', 'M_PRODUCER', 'PERSON']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 17:15:26 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Proportion of Female-Actor-Only Films,Total Number of All Films
year1:int,proportion1:float, total_films1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float, total_films2:int
...
```

This table shows, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors, along with the total number of all films released in those years. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
