**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `LEGISLATORS`

   - **"id_bioguide"**
     - *Potential usage:* Unique identifier for legislators; used to join with `LEGISLATORS_TERMS` and identify individual legislators.
   - **"full_name"**, **"first_name"**, **"last_name"**
     - *Potential usage:* Legislator names; may be used for reporting or additional identification.
   - **"birthday"**
     - *Potential usage:* Not directly relevant to the task.

2. **Table:** `LEGISLATORS_TERMS`

   - **"id_bioguide"**
     - *Potential usage:* Foreign key to `LEGISLATORS`; links terms to legislators.
   - **"term_number"**
     - *Potential usage:* Indicates the term sequence; used to identify first terms (`"term_number" = 1`).
   - **"term_start"**
     - *Potential usage:* Start date of the term; used to filter terms that began between 1917 and 1999.
   - **"term_end"**
     - *Potential usage:* End date of the term; used to determine if a legislator was still in office at a specific time.
   - **"state"**
     - *Potential usage:* State represented; used to filter for Colorado legislators (`"state" = 'CO'`).
   - **"district"**, **"class"**, **"party"**
     - *Potential usage:* Additional term details; may be used for more detailed analysis but not directly relevant to the retention rate calculation.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Filter for Colorado legislators:**
  - `"state" = 'CO'`
- **Identify first terms starting between 1917 and 1999:**
  - `"term_number" = 1`
  - `"term_start" BETWEEN '1917-01-01' AND '1999-12-31'`
- **Track retention up to 20 years later:**
  - Calculate the duration from `"term_start"` to subsequent years to determine if legislators remained in office.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all unique states represented in the `LEGISLATORS_TERMS` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "state"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.LEGISLATORS_TERMS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve term details for legislators from Colorado:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id_bioguide", "term_start", "term_end", "term_number"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.LEGISLATORS_TERMS
   WHERE "state" = 'CO'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find the earliest term start date among Colorado legislators:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("term_start") AS "earliest_term_start"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.LEGISLATORS_TERMS
   WHERE "state" = 'CO';
   ```

4. **List Colorado legislators who started their first term between 1917 and 1999:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "id_bioguide", "term_start", "term_number"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.LEGISLATORS_TERMS
   WHERE "state" = 'CO' AND "term_number" = 1 AND "term_start" BETWEEN '1917-01-01' AND '1999-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count the number of Colorado legislators who started their first term between 1917 and 1999:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "id_bioguide") AS "number_of_legislators"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.LEGISLATORS_TERMS
   WHERE "state" = 'CO' AND "term_number" = 1 AND "term_start" BETWEEN '1917-01-01' AND '1999-12-31';
   ```

6. **Retrieve all terms for a sample Colorado legislator:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id_bioguide", "term_number", "term_start", "term_end"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.LEGISLATORS_TERMS
   WHERE "id_bioguide" = 'sample_id'
   ORDER BY "term_number"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *(Replace `'sample_id'` with an actual legislator's identifier to view their terms.)*

7. **Calculate term durations for Colorado legislators:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id_bioguide", "term_number", "term_start", "term_end",
          DATEDIFF('day', "term_start", "term_end") AS "term_duration_days"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.LEGISLATORS_TERMS
   WHERE "state" = 'CO'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get the number of terms served by each Colorado legislator who started their first term between 1917 and 1999:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id_bioguide", COUNT(*) AS "number_of_terms"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.LEGISLATORS_TERMS
   WHERE "state" = 'CO' AND "id_bioguide" IN (
       SELECT "id_bioguide"
       FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.LEGISLATORS_TERMS
       WHERE "state" = 'CO' AND "term_number" = 1 AND "term_start" BETWEEN '1917-01-01' AND '1999-12-31'
   )
   GROUP BY "id_bioguide"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List term dates for Colorado legislators, ordered by legislator and term start date:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id_bioguide", "term_number", "term_start", "term_end"
   FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.LEGISLATORS_TERMS
   WHERE "state" = 'CO'
   ORDER BY "id_bioguide", "term_start"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate total years of service for each Colorado legislator who started between 1917 and 1999:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "id_bioguide",
           MIN("term_start") AS "first_term_start",
           MAX("term_end") AS "last_term_end",
           DATEDIFF('year', MIN("term_start"), MAX("term_end")) AS "years_of_service"
    FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.LEGISLATORS_TERMS
    WHERE "state" = 'CO' AND "id_bioguide" IN (
        SELECT "id_bioguide"
        FROM CITY_LEGISLATION.CITY_LEGISLATION.LEGISLATORS_TERMS
        WHERE "state" = 'CO' AND "term_number" = 1 AND "term_start" BETWEEN '1917-01-01' AND '1999-12-31'
    )
    GROUP BY "id_bioguide"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help understand the data related to Colorado legislators, their term details, and how long they served, which are essential for calculating the annual retention rate up to 20 years for those who started their first term between 1917 and 1999.Query:

Task: What is the annual retention rate for Colorado legislators who started their first term between 1917 and 1999, tracked up to 20 years later?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Retention_Rate
1,rate1:float[0,100]
2,rate2:float[0,100]
...
20,rate20:float[0,100]
```

The table above displays the annual retention rates (in percentage) for Colorado legislators who began their first term between 1917 and 1999, tracked for each year up to 20 years later. The retention rate for each year indicates the proportion of these legislators who remained in office after that number of years..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CITY_LEGISLATION': {'CITY_LEGISLATION': ['ALIENS', 'ALIENS_DETAILS', 'ALIENS_LOCATION', 'ALIEN_DATA', 'CITIES', 'CITIES_COUNTRIES', 'CITIES_CURRENCIES', 'CITIES_LANGUAGES', 'JOB_COMPANY', 'JOB_POSTINGS_FACT', 'LEGISLATION_DATE_DIM', 'LEGISLATORS', 'LEGISLATORS_TERMS', 'SKILLS_DIM', 'SKILLS_JOB_DIM']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
