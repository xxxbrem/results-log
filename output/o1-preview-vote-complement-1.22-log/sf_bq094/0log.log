Task: Please display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each), the following table presents the required information:

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,candidates_names,total_small_dollar_donations
committee1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidates_names1:str,total_small_dollar_donations1:float > 0
committee2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidates_names2:str,total_small_dollar_donations2:float > 0
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **committee_name**: The name of the committee from the `COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **number_of_supported_candidates**: The number of candidates the committee supports, derived from the `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **candidates_names**: The names of the supported candidates, in alphabetical order and separated by commas, from the `CANDIDATE_2016` table.
- **total_small_dollar_donations**: The total amount of small-dollar donations (over $0 and under $200 each) received by the committee, calculated from the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table.

Note: The actual data is represented by placeholders since the specific records are not provided..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 14:52:16 - root - INFO - To display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each), the following SQL query can be used:

```sql
SELECT
    c."cmte_nm" AS committee_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT cc."cand_id") AS number_of_supported_candidates,
    LISTAGG(DISTINCT cd."cand_name", ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY cd."cand_name") AS candidates_names,
    SUM(i."transaction_amt") AS total_small_dollar_donations
FROM FEC.FEC.COMMITTEE_2016 c
JOIN FEC.FEC.CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016 cc ON c."cmte_id" = cc."cmte_id"
JOIN FEC.FEC.CANDIDATE_2016 cd ON cc."cand_id" = cd."cand_id"
JOIN FEC.FEC.INDIVIDUALS_2016 i ON c."cmte_id" = i."cmte_id"
WHERE cc."cand_election_yr" = 2016
  AND i."transaction_amt" > 0
  AND i."transaction_amt" < 200
GROUP BY c."cmte_nm"
HAVING SUM(i."transaction_amt") > 0
```

This query performs the following steps:

- Joins the `COMMITTEE_2016`, `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016`, and `CANDIDATE_2016` tables to link committees with the candidates they support for the 2016 election.
- Joins the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table to identify committees that received small-dollar donations (over $0 and under $200 each).
- Filters donations to include only small-dollar amounts greater than $0 and less than $200.
- Groups the results by committee name.
- Counts the number of unique candidates supported by each committee.
- Aggregates the candidate names in alphabetical order, separated by commas.
- Sums the total small-dollar donations per committee.
- Ensures that only committees with total small-dollar donations greater than $0 are included.

This will produce a table with the required information:

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,candidates_names,total_small_dollar_donations
committee1_name,int_num_candidates1,"candidate_name1, candidate_name2, ...",float_total_donations1
committee2_name,int_num_candidates2,"candidate_name3, candidate_name4, ...",float_total_donations2
...

2025-01-25 14:52:19 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each), the following table presents the required information:

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,candidates_names,total_small_dollar_donations
committee1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidates_names1:str,total_small_dollar_donations1:float > 0
committee2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidates_names2:str,total_small_dollar_donations2:float > 0
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **committee_name**: The name of the committee from the `COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **number_of_supported_candidates**: The number of candidates the committee supports, derived from the `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **candidates_names**: The names of the supported candidates, in alphabetical order and separated by commas, from the `CANDIDATE_2016` table.
- **total_small_dollar_donations**: The total amount of small-dollar donations (over $0 and under $200 each) received by the committee, calculated from the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table.

Note: The actual data is represented by placeholders since the specific records are not provided. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-25 14:53:52 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each), the following table presents the required information:

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,candidates_names,total_small_dollar_donations
committee1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidates_names1:str,total_small_dollar_donations1:float > 0
committee2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidates_names2:str,total_small_dollar_donations2:float > 0
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **committee_name**: The name of the committee from the `COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **number_of_supported_candidates**: The number of candidates the committee supports, derived from the `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **candidates_names**: The names of the supported candidates, in alphabetical order and separated by commas, from the `CANDIDATE_2016` table.
- **total_small_dollar_donations**: The total amount of small-dollar donations (over $0 and under $200 each) received by the committee, calculated from the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table.

Note: The actual data is represented by placeholders since the specific records are not provided. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

**Notes:**

- Enclosed column and table names in double quotes to match the case-sensitive identifiers as defined in the database schema.
- Used `CAST(column_name AS STRING)` to ensure correct data types and remove unnecessary quotation marks in the results.
- Corrected the references to column names to match the exact identifiers in the database (e.g., `c."cmte_id"` instead of `c.cmte_id`).
- This query selects committees from the `COMMITTEE_2016` table that supported candidates in the `CANDIDATE_2016` table for the 2016 election year and received small-dollar donations (over $0 and under $200 each) from the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table.
- The results include the committee name, number of supported candidates, a list of candidates' names in alphabetical order, and the total amount of small-dollar donations received.

2025-01-25 14:55:28 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each), the following table presents the required information:

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,candidates_names,total_small_dollar_donations
committee1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidates_names1:str,total_small_dollar_donations1:float > 0
committee2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidates_names2:str,total_small_dollar_donations2:float > 0
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **committee_name**: The name of the committee from the `COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **number_of_supported_candidates**: The number of candidates the committee supports, derived from the `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **candidates_names**: The names of the supported candidates, in alphabetical order and separated by commas, from the `CANDIDATE_2016` table.
- **total_small_dollar_donations**: The total amount of small-dollar donations (over $0 and under $200 each) received by the committee, calculated from the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table.

Note: The actual data is represented by placeholders since the specific records are not provided. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-25 14:56:38 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each), the following table presents the required information:

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,candidates_names,total_small_dollar_donations
committee1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidates_names1:str,total_small_dollar_donations1:float > 0
committee2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidates_names2:str,total_small_dollar_donations2:float > 0
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **committee_name**: The name of the committee from the `COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **number_of_supported_candidates**: The number of candidates the committee supports, derived from the `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **candidates_names**: The names of the supported candidates, in alphabetical order and separated by commas, from the `CANDIDATE_2016` table.
- **total_small_dollar_donations**: The total amount of small-dollar donations (over $0 and under $200 each) received by the committee, calculated from the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table.

Note: The actual data is represented by placeholders since the specific records are not provided. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
