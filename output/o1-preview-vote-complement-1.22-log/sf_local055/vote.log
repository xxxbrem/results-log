Upon comparing the two SQL scripts, we can observe the following differences:

1. **Method of Determining Best-Selling and Least-Selling Artists:**

   - **`0result.sql`** determines the best-selling and least-selling artists based on the **number of tracks sold**. It counts the number of invoice lines (`COUNT(ii."InvoiceLineId")`) associated with each artist.
   
   - **`2result.sql`** determines the best-selling and least-selling artists based on the **total revenue generated**. It sums up the total sales amount (`SUM(ii."UnitPrice" * ii."Quantity")`) for each artist.

2. **Alignment with the Task Requirements:**

   - The task specifies identifying the best-selling and least-selling artists, with a tie-breaker based on the artist's name in alphabetical order if necessary.
   
   - In the context of music sales, "best-selling" typically refers to the **number of units sold** rather than the total revenue. This is especially relevant when all tracks have the same unit price, as in this dataset.

3. **Consistency in Data:**

   - Given that all tracks in the dataset have the same unit price (as observed from the data snippets where `"UnitPrice"` is consistently `0.99`), the total revenue is directly proportional to the number of tracks sold. However, basing the best-selling artist on the **number of tracks sold** is more accurate per the industry's standard practices.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above analysis, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script as it aligns with the task's intent by identifying the best-selling and least-selling artists based on the number of tracks sold.
