2025-01-25 00:37:00 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to a mismatched quotation mark in the condition for the `"major_category"`. Specifically, the string `'Theft and Handling"` starts with a single quote but ends with a double quote, which causes a syntax error.

**Issue in your query:**

```sql
... AND "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling" AND ...
```

To fix this, ensure that the string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'` or double quotes `"..."`. In SQL, it's standard to use single quotes for string literals.

**Corrected SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME."CRIME_BY_LSOA"
WHERE "borough" = 'Westminster' AND "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling' AND "minor_category" = 'Other Theft'
LIMIT 100;
```

Now, the query should execute without any syntax errors.

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks:** Ensure that the string literals `'Westminster'`, `'Theft and Handling'`, and `'Other Theft'` are enclosed in single quotes.
- **Column Names:** Column names are enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"borough"`, `"major_category"`, `"minor_category"`).

**Additional Tip:**

- Always check for matching quotation marks in your SQL statements to prevent syntax errors.
- It's a good practice to be consistent with the use of quotation marks: use single quotes for string literals and double quotes (if necessary) for identifiers.

---

By correcting the quotation marks, your SQL query should work as intended.

2025-01-25 00:37:40 - root - INFO - The error message you're receiving indicates a syntax error at the very beginning of your SQL query:

```
SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected '.'.
```

This suggests that the SQL parser encountered an unexpected period `'.'` at the start of the query, which likely points to an issue with how the fully qualified table name is specified. Additionally, there's a mismatched quotation mark in your query.

Let's address both issues step by step.

---

### **Issue 1: Mismatched Quotation Marks**

In your `WHERE` clause, the condition for `"major_category"` has mismatched quotation marks:

```sql
"major_category" = 'Theft and Handling"
```

- **Problem:** The string starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`.
- **Solution:** Ensure that string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`.

**Corrected Condition:**

```sql
"major_category" = 'Theft and Handling'
```

---

### **Issue 2: Syntax Error at Position 0 Due to Unexpected '.'**

The error message indicates a problem at the very start of your query, specifically an unexpected period `'.'`. This often occurs when there's an issue with how the database, schema, and table names are referenced.

In your `FROM` clause, you have:

```sql
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME."CRIME_BY_LSOA"
```

- **Possible Causes:**
  - The database (`LONDON`) or schema (`LONDON_CRIME`) names might need to be enclosed in double quotes.
  - There might be an extra period `'.'` or an unexpected character at the beginning of your query.
  - Using quotes inconsistently for identifiers may confuse the parser.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Ensure Proper Quotation for Identifiers:**

   In SQL (and specifically in Snowflake SQL), identifiers (like database names, schema names, and table names) are usually not case-sensitive and don't need to be enclosed in quotes unless they contain special characters or are case-sensitive.

   - **Without Quotes:**

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
     ```

   - **With Double Quotes Around Each Identifier:**

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM "LONDON"."LONDON_CRIME"."CRIME_BY_LSOA"
     ```

   Choose one style and be consistent.

2. **Check for Unintended Characters:**

   Ensure there's no unintended character (like a period `'.'`) before the `SELECT` statement.

   - **Incorrect:**

     ```sql
     .SELECT * FROM ...
     ```

   - **Correct:**

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM ...
     ```

   Even an accidental character preceding the `SELECT` keyword can cause a syntax error at position 0.

3. **Set the Context for Database and Schema (Optional):**

   If possible, you can set the database and schema context, so you don't need to specify them in your query.

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE LONDON;
   USE SCHEMA LONDON_CRIME;

   SELECT * FROM "CRIME_BY_LSOA"
   WHERE "borough" = 'Westminster' AND "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling' AND "minor_category" = 'Other Theft'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

### **Corrected SQL Query**

Applying these corrections, your SQL query should be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
WHERE "borough" = 'Westminster' AND "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling' AND "minor_category" = 'Other Theft'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Or, with double quotes around identifiers:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM "LONDON"."LONDON_CRIME"."CRIME_BY_LSOA"
WHERE "borough" = 'Westminster' AND "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling' AND "minor_category" = 'Other Theft'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Final Steps**

1. **Ensure No Leading Characters:**

   Make sure there's no accidental character before the `SELECT` keyword in your query editor.

2. **Consistent Quotation Marks:**

   - Use single quotes `'...'` for string literals.
   - Use double quotes `"..."` for identifiers if necessary.

3. **Check Database and Schema Names:**

   Verify that:

   - The database `LONDON` and schema `LONDON_CRIME` exist and are accessible.
   - You have the necessary permissions to query the table.

---

### **Summary**

- **Fixed Mismatched Quotes:** Corrected the string literal for `"major_category"` to use matching single quotes.
- **Adjusted Identifier Quotation:** Ensured that identifiers are properly quoted or unquoted consistently.
- **Checked for Unintended Characters:** Verified that there's no extraneous character (like a period `'.'`) at the beginning of the query.

---

### **Example of the Corrected Query in Use**

```sql
SELECT * FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
WHERE "borough" = 'Westminster' AND "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling' AND "minor_category" = 'Other Theft'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Or, with fully quoted identifiers:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM "LONDON"."LONDON_CRIME"."CRIME_BY_LSOA"
WHERE "borough" = 'Westminster' AND "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling' AND "minor_category" = 'Other Theft'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Consistency Is Key:** Be consistent with your use of quotation marks throughout your SQL statement.
- **Use of Aliases (Optional):**

  To make your query cleaner, you can use table aliases:

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA AS c
  WHERE c."borough" = 'Westminster' AND c."major_category" = 'Theft and Handling' AND c."minor_category" = 'Other Theft'
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Database Documentation:**

  Consult your database's documentation for specifics on how to reference database, schema, and table names, especially regarding the use of quotation marks and case sensitivity.

---

By applying these corrections, your query should execute successfully without syntax errors. If you continue to encounter issues, please double-check for any hidden characters or typos and ensure that your database and schema contexts are correctly set.

2025-01-25 00:38:11 - root - INFO - It appears that there's still a mismatched quotation mark in your SQL query, specifically in the condition for `"major_category"`. This mismatch is causing the SQL parser to throw an error.

**Your SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME."CRIME_BY_LSOA"
   WHERE "borough" = 'Westminster' AND "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling" AND "minor_category" = 'Other Theft'
   LIMIT 100;
```

**Issue:**

- **Mismatched Quotation Marks in `"major_category"` Condition:**

  ```sql
  "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling"
  ```

  - Starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`.
  - This causes the parser to misinterpret the string literal and leads to a syntax error.

**Error Message:**

```
SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected '"major_category"'.
```

- The error indicates that the parser encountered an unexpected `"major_category"` at the very beginning (position 0) of the query. This can occur when the mismatched quotes cause the parser to think the query ended prematurely.

**Solution:**

- **Ensure Matching Quotation Marks:**
  - Use single quotes `'...'` consistently for string literals.
  - Use double quotes `"..."` for identifiers (like column names) if necessary.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME."CRIME_BY_LSOA"
WHERE "borough" = 'Westminster' AND "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling' AND "minor_category" = 'Other Theft'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Fixed Quotation Marks:**
  - Changed `'Theft and Handling"` to `'Theft and Handling'` to ensure matching single quotes.
- **Consistent Use of Quotes:**
  - All string literals (`'Westminster'`, `'Theft and Handling'`, `'Other Theft'`) are enclosed in single quotes.
  - Identifiers (column names) are enclosed in double quotes when needed.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Check for Hidden Characters:**
  - Ensure there are no hidden or extra characters (like an accidental period `.` or space) at the beginning of your query.
  - Sometimes, copying and pasting can introduce unintended characters.
- **Copy the Entire Query:**
  - Make sure you're copying and pasting the entire query into your SQL editor.
- **Use an SQL Editor with Syntax Highlighting:**
  - This can help you visually identify mismatched quotes or syntax errors.
- **Test the Query Incrementally:**
  - Start with a simpler query to ensure it runs, then add conditions one by one.

**Example of Testing Incrementally:**

1. **Basic Select Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME."CRIME_BY_LSOA"
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

2. **Add Borough Condition:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME."CRIME_BY_LSOA"
   WHERE "borough" = 'Westminster'
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Add Major Category Condition:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME."CRIME_BY_LSOA"
   WHERE "borough" = 'Westminster' AND "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling'
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Add Minor Category Condition:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME."CRIME_BY_LSOA"
   WHERE "borough" = 'Westminster' AND "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling' AND "minor_category" = 'Other Theft'
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

By adding conditions step by step, you can identify exactly where the error occurs if it persists.

**Final Recommendation:**

- **Try Running the Corrected Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME."CRIME_BY_LSOA"
  WHERE "borough" = 'Westminster' AND "major_category" = 'Theft and Handling' AND "minor_category" = 'Other Theft'
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **If Errors Persist:**
  - Double-check for any remaining mismatched quotes or typos.
  - Ensure that the database and schema names (`LONDON`, `LONDON_CRIME`) are correct and that you have the necessary permissions.

**Conclusion:**

By correcting the mismatched quotation marks, your query should execute successfully without syntax errors. If you continue to encounter issues, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist further.

Task: Could you provide the total number of 'Other Theft' incidents within the 'Theft and Handling' category for each year in the Westminster borough?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the total number of 'Other Theft' incidents within the 'Theft and Handling' category for each year in the Westminster borough, we would aggregate the data from the `CRIME_BY_LSOA` table, filtering for records where the `borough` is 'Westminster', the `major_category` is 'Theft and Handling', and the `minor_category` is 'Other Theft'. The results would be grouped by the `year` column.

The data would be presented in the following format:

```csv
Year,Total_Incidents
year1:int,total1:int
year2:int,total2:int
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LONDON': {'LONDON_CRIME': ['CRIME_BY_LSOA'], 'LONDON_FIRE_BRIGADE': ['FIRE_BRIGADE_SERVICE_CALLS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the total number of 'Other Theft' incidents within the 'Theft and Handling' category for each year in the Westminster borough, we would aggregate the data from the `CRIME_BY_LSOA` table, filtering for records where the `borough` is 'Westminster', the `major_category` is 'Theft and Handling', and the `minor_category` is 'Other Theft'.
