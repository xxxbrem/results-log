2025-01-26 11:04:11 - root - INFO - The syntax error you're encountering occurs because the `WHERE` clause cannot stand alone in SQL; it must be part of a complete SQL statement, such as a `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. Starting a query with `WHERE` without a preceding `SELECT` statement will result in a syntax error.

**Correct Usage:**

If you want to select records from the `VARIANTS` table where the `"reference_name"` is one of the autosomal chromosomes (1-22), you should include the `WHERE` clause within a `SELECT` statement. Here's how you can modify your query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
WHERE "reference_name" IN ('1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22');
```

**Explanation:**

- **`SELECT *`:** This tells the database to select all columns from the table.
- **`FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"`:** Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.
- **`WHERE "reference_name" IN (...);`** Filters the records to include only those where `"reference_name"` is one of the specified chromosomes.

**Example with a Limit:**

If you want to limit the number of returned records to 100, you can add a `LIMIT` clause:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
WHERE "reference_name" IN ('1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22')
LIMIT 100;
```

**Additional Information:**

- **`SELECT` Statement:** Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.
- **`WHERE` Clause:** Filters the result set to include only records that meet specified conditions.
- **Order Matters:** In SQL, the `WHERE` clause comes after the `FROM` clause and cannot be used before a `SELECT` statement.

**Key Points:**

- Always start your query with a `SELECT` statement when retrieving data.
- The `WHERE` clause refines your query and must follow the `FROM` clause.
- Ensure that all SQL commands are part of a complete and syntactically correct statement.

**Let me know** if you need further assistance or have any other questions!

2025-01-26 11:09:50 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the placeholder `<position>` in your SQL query. In SQL, placeholders like `<position>` are not recognized and cause syntax errors because the `<` and `>` characters are not valid in this context.

**Explanation:**

- **Syntax Error at `<`:** The SQL parser reads `<` as the beginning of a comparison operator (less than), but since it's part of `<position>`, which is not a valid identifier or value, it raises a syntax error.
- **Unexpected Characters:** The parser doesn't expect `<` and `>` in that position unless they are used in a valid expression.

**Solution:**

To fix this error, you need to replace `<position>` with an actual numerical value representing the position you're interested in. If you don't have a specific position in mind and want to execute the query for all positions on chromosome '1', you can remove the `v."start"` condition.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

If you have a specific position (for example, `12345678`), the query would be:

```sql
SELECT
  f.value:"call_set_name"::STRING AS "Sample_ID",
  f.value:"genotype"::VARIANT::STRING AS "Genotype"
FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" v,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."call") f
WHERE v."reference_name" = '1' AND v."start" = 12345678
LIMIT 100;
```

**Or**, if you want to retrieve data for all positions on chromosome '1':

```sql
SELECT
  f.value:"call_set_name"::STRING AS "Sample_ID",
  f.value:"genotype"::VARIANT::STRING AS "Genotype"
FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" v,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."call") f
WHERE v."reference_name" = '1'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Notes:**

- **Replace `<position>` with an actual numeric value:** The placeholder `<position>` should be replaced with the actual position number you are querying.
- **Removing the Position Condition:** If you're not filtering by a specific position, you can omit the `v."start"` condition altogether.
- **Sample Output:**

  When you run the corrected query, you should receive output similar to:

  ```plaintext
  Sample_ID   | Genotype
  ------------+---------
  HG00261     | [0,1]
  HG00593     | [0,0]
  NA12749     | [1,1]
  ...         | ...
  ```

**Additional Information:**

- **Understanding `LATERAL FLATTEN`:** The `LATERAL FLATTEN` function is used to parse and expand the nested `VARIANT` columns such as `"call"` so that each element can be accessed individually.
- **Column Aliases:** We use `AS "Sample_ID"` and `AS "Genotype"` to make the output columns easier to understand.

**Let me know** if you need further assistance or have any other questions!

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **VARIANTS**:
   - `"reference_name"`: Used to identify the chromosome of the variant. We can use this to filter out sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) and focus on autosomes (chromosomes 1-22).
   - `"AF"`: Allele Frequency of the variant. We can use this to identify common variants with `"AF" ≥ 0.05`.
   - `"VT"`: Variant Type. Used to categorize variants (e.g., SNP, INDEL).
   - `"call"`: Contains genotype information for each sample. We can extract sample IDs and their genotypes to determine which samples carry the variant.
   - Other columns like `"start"`, `"end"`, `"reference_bases"`, and `"alternate_bases"` can be used for variant position and alleles.

2. **SAMPLE_INFO**:
   - `"Sample"`: Sample ID. Used to link genotype calls to sample metadata.
   - `"Super_Population"`: Super population code. Used to group samples by super populations.
   - `"Super_Population_Description"`: Description of the super population.
   - Other columns like `"Gender"`, `"Population"`, `"Population_Description"` provide additional sample metadata.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter for autosomal chromosomes:

  ```sql
  WHERE "reference_name" IN ('1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','11','12','13','14','15','16','17','18','19','20','21','22')
  ```

- Filter for common variants with allele frequency ≥ 0.05:

  ```sql
  WHERE "AF" >= 0.05
  ```

- Exclude sex chromosomes:

  ```sql
  WHERE "reference_name" NOT IN ('X', 'Y', 'MT')
  ```

- Join between `VARIANTS` and `SAMPLE_INFO` on sample IDs extracted from `"call"` and `"Sample"`.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct chromosomes in the `VARIANTS` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "reference_name"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve variants with allele frequency ≥ 0.05:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "reference_name", "start", "end", "AF"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
   WHERE "AF" >= 0.05
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve common variants on autosomal chromosomes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "reference_name", "start", "end", "AF"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
   WHERE "AF" >= 0.05
     AND "reference_name" IN ('1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','11','12','13','14','15','16','17','18','19','20','21','22')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List distinct super populations from `SAMPLE_INFO`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Super_Population", "Super_Population_Description"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."SAMPLE_INFO"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count samples per super population:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Super_Population", COUNT(*) AS "Sample_Count"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."SAMPLE_INFO"
   GROUP BY "Super_Population"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List distinct variant types from `VARIANTS`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "VT"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Retrieve samples with their super populations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Sample", "Super_Population"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."SAMPLE_INFO"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Explore the structure of the `"call"` column in `VARIANTS`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "reference_name", "start", "AF", "call"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Flatten the `"call"` column to extract sample IDs and genotypes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     v."reference_name",
     v."start",
     v."AF",
     f.value:"sampleId"::STRING AS "Sample_ID",
     f.value:"genotype"::VARIANT AS "Genotype"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" v,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."call") f
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Inspect the contents of the flattened `"call"` column:**

    ```sql
    SELECT f.value
    FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" v,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."call") f
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Explore the `"alternate_bases"` column by flattening it:**

    ```sql
    SELECT v."reference_name", v."start", f.value::STRING AS "Alternate_Base"
    FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" v,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."alternate_bases") f
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Count variants per variant type:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "VT", COUNT(*) AS "Variant_Count"
    FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
    GROUP BY "VT"
    ORDER BY "Variant_Count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Get allele frequency distribution for autosomal variants:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "AF", COUNT(*) AS "Variant_Count"
    FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
    WHERE "reference_name" IN ('1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','11','12','13','14','15','16','17','18','19','20','21','22')
    GROUP BY "AF"
    ORDER BY "AF" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Count variants per autosomal chromosome:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "reference_name", COUNT(*) AS "Variant_Count"
    FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
    WHERE "reference_name" IN ('1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','11','12','13','14','15','16','17','18','19','20','21','22')
    GROUP BY "reference_name"
    ORDER BY CAST("reference_name" AS INTEGER)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Retrieve sample IDs and genotypes for a specific variant:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      f.value:"sampleId"::STRING AS "Sample_ID",
      f.value:"genotype"::VARIANT AS "Genotype"
    FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" v,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."call") f
    WHERE v."reference_name" = '1' AND v."start" = <position> -- Replace <position> with actual position
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Note:** In the above queries:

- Replace `<position>` with an actual position value when needed.
- The `"call"` and `"alternate_bases"` columns are of type `VARIANT` (JSON-like structure). We use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to explode these arrays and access individual elements.
- We enclose all column names in double quotations to match the exact column names in the database.
- We limit each query to 100 rows using `LIMIT 100` as specified.
- We avoid using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and focus on `SELECT` queries only.

These queries help in understanding the data and structures within the relevant tables and columns, which is essential before constructing the final analysis for the task.Query:
SELECT *
FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
WHERE "reference_name" IN ('1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22');

Task: Identify the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared by different combinations of super populations, total population size for each super population, variant types, and sample counts. Exclude sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) from the analysis.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Super_Population_Combination,Total_Population_Size,Variant_Type,Sample_Count,Number_of_Common_Autosomal_Variants
super_population_combination:str,total_population_size:int,variant_type:str,sample_count:int,number_of_variants:int
...
```

**Explanation:**
The table lists the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared among different combinations of super populations. Each row represents a unique combination of super populations, providing the total population size for that combination, the types of variants considered, the sample counts, and the number of common autosomal variants identified. Sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) have been excluded from the analysis to focus solely on autosomal variants..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'_1000_GENOMES': {'_1000_GENOMES': ['PEDIGREE', 'SAMPLE_INFO', 'VARIANTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

The error occurred because the `ARRAY_CONTAINS` function expected both arguments to be of compatible types, but there was a type mismatch between the array and the value. To resolve this, we modified the `combination_sizes` CTE to avoid using `ARRAY_CONTAINS` and instead utilized `SPLIT_TO_TABLE` to split the `Super_Population_Combination` into individual rows for joining.

Here are the key changes:

1. **Avoided `ARRAY_CONTAINS`:**
   - Replaced `ARRAY_CONTAINS(SPLIT(...), ps."Super_Population")` with a join using `SPLIT_TO_TABLE`.
   - This eliminates the type mismatch issue and allows for proper joining.

2. **Used `SPLIT_TO_TABLE`:**
   - The `combination_sizes` CTE now uses `TABLE(SPLIT_TO_TABLE(vc.Super_Population_Combination, ' & '))` to split the combinations into individual super populations.
   - Each super population is then joined with `population_sizes` to calculate the total population size.

3. **Adjusted `population_sizes` Calculation:**
   - Calculated the `Total_Population_Size` for 'ASN' by summing the sample counts of 'EAS' and 'SAS'.
   - Used a `CASE` statement to handle 'ASN' separately.

4. **Modified the `WHERE` Clause:**
   - In `variant_data`, replaced the list of chromosomes with `NOT IN ('X', 'Y', 'MT')` to exclude sex chromosomes.

5. **Final SELECT Statement:**
   - Retained the final output structure as required, including the `ORDER BY` clause with `NULLS LAST`.

**Note:**

- By using `TABLE(SPLIT_TO_TABLE(...))`, we effectively unnest the combined super populations into individual rows, enabling us to join and aggregate correctly.
- The corrected query should now execute without errors and produce the desired result.

2025-01-26 11:14:56 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Identify the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared by different combinations of super populations, total population size for each super population, variant types, and sample counts. Exclude sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) from the analysis., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Super_Population_Combination,Total_Population_Size,Variant_Type,Sample_Count,Number_of_Common_Autosomal_Variants
super_population_combination:str,total_population_size:int,variant_type:str,sample_count:int,number_of_variants:int
...
```

**Explanation:**
The table lists the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared among different combinations of super populations. Each row represents a unique combination of super populations, providing the total population size for that combination, the types of variants considered, the sample counts, and the number of common autosomal variants identified. Sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) have been excluded from the analysis to focus solely on autosomal variants. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
