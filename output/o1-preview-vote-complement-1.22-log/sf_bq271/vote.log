After comparing the two SQL queries, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer. This query:

- **Accurately filters** orders from the year 2021 using the `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ...) = 2021` condition.
- **Groups** the data by month, country, product department, and product category as required.
- **Calculates** the number of orders, number of unique purchasers, and profit (total retail price minus total cost) correctly.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
```
