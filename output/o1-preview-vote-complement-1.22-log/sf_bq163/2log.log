2025-01-26 20:11:40 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're encountering this error. Let's work together to figure out the cause and find a solution.

**Error Message:**

```
002003 (02000): 01b9f9fb-0004-8343-0001-11c300fbacc6: SQL compilation error:
Schema 'HTAN_2.HTAN' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error indicates that the database or schema specified in the query is either incorrect, does not exist, or you do not have the necessary permissions to access it.

---

### **Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Database and Schema Names Might Be Swapped:**

   It's possible that the database and schema names are reversed in your query. In Snowflake, the fully qualified table name follows the format:

   ```
   "Database_Name"."Schema_Name"."Table_Name"
   ```

   **Action:** Try swapping 'HTAN_2' and 'HTAN' in your query.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
   FROM "HTAN"."HTAN_2"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Verify Database and Schema Existence:**

   The error suggests that either the database 'HTAN_2' or the schema 'HTAN' does not exist in your Snowflake account, or you lack the necessary permissions.

   **Action:**

   - **Check Available Databases:**

     ```sql
     SHOW DATABASES;
     ```

   - **Check Schemas in the Database:**

     ```sql
     SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN_2";
     ```

     or, if 'HTAN' is the database:

     ```sql
     SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN";
     ```

   - **Based on the output, adjust your query to use the correct database and schema names.**

3. **Permission Issues:**

   You might not have the necessary permissions to access the schema or database.

   **Action:**

   - **Contact your database administrator** to ensure that you have access rights to the 'HTAN_2' database and the 'HTAN' schema.

4. **Misspelling or Case Sensitivity:**

   Snowflake object names are case-sensitive when double-quoted.

   **Action:**

   - **Ensure that the database, schema, and table names are spelled correctly and match the case as defined in Snowflake.**
   - If object names were created without quotes (in uppercase by default), you can reference them in uppercase without quotes.

     Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT clusters
     FROM HTAN_2.HTAN.SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

     or, if the objects were created in lowercase with quotes:

     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
     FROM "htan_2"."htan"."scrnaseq_msk_sclc_epithelial_cells_current"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

5. **Current Database and Schema Context:**

   If you've already set the database and schema context in your session, you don't need to specify them in the query.

   **Action:**

   - **Set the Database and Schema:**

     ```sql
     USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
     USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
     ```

   - **Then, run your query without specifying the database and schema:**

     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
     FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

6. **Check Object Availability:**

   Verify that the table 'SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT' exists in the specified schema.

   **Action:**

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "HTAN_2"."HTAN";
   ```

    - **If the table is not listed, confirm the correct table name.**

---

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Swap Database and Schema Names (if applicable):**

   Try the adjusted query:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
   FROM "HTAN"."HTAN_2"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Set Database and Schema Context:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
   USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
   ```

   Then run:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
   FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Check Your Access Permissions:**

   Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the database and schema. Contact your administrator if you're unsure.

4. **Verify Object Names and Cases:**

   Double-check the spelling and case of the database, schema, and table names. Adjust them in your query accordingly.

---

### **Example with Adjusted Query:**

Assuming that the database is 'HTAN', schema is 'HTAN_2', and the table name remains the same, the query would be:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
FROM "HTAN"."HTAN_2"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

Or, if the context has been set:

```sql
USE DATABASE "HTAN";
USE SCHEMA "HTAN_2";

SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Using Quotation Marks Unless Necessary:**

  If object names were created without quotes, they are stored in uppercase by default. You can reference them without quotes.

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT CLUSTERS
  FROM HTAN_2.HTAN.SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Ensure Correct Use of Quotation Marks:**

  If you use double quotes, make sure the object names match exactly in case.

- **List All Databases, Schemas, and Tables You Have Access To:**

  ```sql
  SHOW DATABASES;
  -- Choose the correct database.

  SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "Your_Database";
  -- Choose the correct schema.

  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "Your_Database"."Your_Schema";
  -- Verify the table exists.
  ```

---

### **Summary:**

The error occurs because the specified schema 'HTAN_2.HTAN' is not found or you lack access. By verifying the correct database and schema names, checking permissions, and ensuring correct object naming and casing, you should be able to resolve the issue.

If you continue to face problems, please share any additional error messages or information, and I'll be happy to assist further.

---

### **Error Details:**

**Input SQL:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
FROM HTAN_2.HTAN.SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT
LIMIT 100;
```

**Error Message:**

```
002003 (02000): 01b9f9fb-0004-7d15-0001-11c300fb9fc6: SQL compilation error:
Database 'HTAN' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error indicates that the database named **'HTAN'** is not recognized in your Snowflake environment or you don't have permissions to access it.

---

### **Possible Causes and Solutions:**

#### **1. Database and Schema Names Might Be Swapped:**

Given the error message and the table structure information you provided, it seems there might be confusion with the database and schema names.

**Provided Table Structure:**

```plaintext
{ 'HTAN_2': { 'HTAN': [ list of tables ] } }
```

In this structure:

- **Database Name:** `HTAN_2`
- **Schema Name:** `HTAN`

However, in your error message, it's indicating that **Database 'HTAN' does not exist**.

**Solution:**

Try swapping the database and schema names in your query.

**Adjusted Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
FROM "HTAN"."HTAN_2"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

#### **2. Verify Correct Database and Schema Names:**

It's essential to ensure that you're using the correct database and schema names as they exist in your environment.

**Actions:**

- **List Available Databases:**

  ```sql
  SHOW DATABASES;
  ```

  - **Check if 'HTAN' or 'HTAN_2' is listed.**

- **If 'HTAN' is a Database:**

  - Use 'HTAN' as the database and 'HTAN_2' as the schema.

  - **Set Database and Schema:**

    ```sql
    USE DATABASE "HTAN";
    USE SCHEMA "HTAN_2";
    ```

  - **Run the Query:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
    FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

- **If 'HTAN_2' is the Database:**

  - Use 'HTAN_2' as the database and 'HTAN' as the schema.

  - **Set Database and Schema:**

    ```sql
    USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
    USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
    ```

  - **Run the Query:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
    FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

#### **3. Confirm Object Names and Case Sensitivity:**

Snowflake is case-sensitive when object names are enclosed in double quotes.

- **Ensure Correct Case:**
  
  - If your database, schema, or table names were created with specific casing, you must reference them exactly as they were created.
  
- **Check for Case Differences:**

  - If the database is actually named 'htan_2' (all lowercase), and the schema is 'htan', adjust your query accordingly.

  **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
  FROM "htan_2"."htan"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

  Or, if object names were created without quotes (default uppercase), you can write:

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT clusters
  FROM HTAN_2.HTAN.SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

---

#### **4. Check Your Permissions:**

It's possible that you don't have the necessary permissions to access the 'HTAN' database.

**Action:**

- **Contact Your Database Administrator:**

  - Ensure that you have the correct permissions to access the databases and schemas required.

---

#### **5. Verify the Table Exists in the Specified Schema:**

Ensure that the table 'SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT' exists in the schema you're referencing.

**Actions:**

- **List Tables in the Schema:**

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "HTAN_2"."HTAN";
  ```

  Or, if swapped:

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "HTAN"."HTAN_2";
  ```

- **Check if the table is listed. If not, adjust the database and schema names accordingly.**

---

### **Recommended Steps:**

1. **Swap Database and Schema in Your Query:**

   Try the adjusted query with swapped database and schema names:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
   FROM "HTAN"."HTAN_2"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Set the Database and Schema Context:**

   - **If 'HTAN' is the Database:**

     ```sql
     USE DATABASE "HTAN";
     USE SCHEMA "HTAN_2";
     ```

   - **If 'HTAN_2' is the Database:**

     ```sql
     USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
     USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
     ```

   - **Then run your query without specifying the database and schema:**

     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
     FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

3. **Verify Database Existence:**

   Run:

   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

   - **If 'HTAN' does not appear, and only 'HTAN_2' is listed, then 'HTAN_2' is your correct database.**

4. **Verify Schema Existence:**

   Run:

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN_2";
   ```

   - **Ensure 'HTAN' is listed as a schema in 'HTAN_2'.**

   Or:

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN";
   ```

   - **Check if 'HTAN_2' is the schema in 'HTAN'.**

5. **Check Table Availability:**

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "HTAN_2"."HTAN";
   ```

   Or, if swapped:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "HTAN"."HTAN_2";
   ```

   - **Confirm that 'SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT' is listed among the tables.**

---

### **Example Using 'HTAN_2' as Database and 'HTAN' as Schema:**

1. **Set Database and Schema:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
   USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
   FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

### **Example Using 'HTAN' as Database and 'HTAN_2' as Schema:**

1. **Set Database and Schema:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "HTAN";
   USE SCHEMA "HTAN_2";
   ```

2. **Run the Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
   FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Ambiguity with Quotation Marks:**

  - In Snowflake, unquoted object names are automatically converted to uppercase.
  - If you use quotes and your object names are in lowercase or mixed case, ensure you match the exact case.

- **Confirm Object Name Spelling:**

  - Double-check for any typos in the database, schema, and table names.

- **Check for Synonyms or Aliases:**

  - Sometimes, databases have synonyms or aliases for schemas or tables.

---

### **Final Recommendation:**

Given the error messages, it's highly likely that swapping the database and schema names in your query will resolve the issue.

**Try this Adjusted Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
FROM "HTAN"."HTAN_2"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Summary:**

- **Error Cause:** The database 'HTAN' does not exist or you're not authorized to access it.
- **Solution:** Swap the database and schema names in your query or set them explicitly in your session.

2025-01-26 20:13:51 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still encountering the same error. Let's take a closer look and try to resolve this issue.

---

### **Error Details:**

**Input SQL:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
FROM HTAN_2.HTAN.SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT
LIMIT 100;
```

**Error Message:**

```
002003 (02000): 01b9f9fd-0004-8343-0001-11c300fbacd6: SQL compilation error:
Schema 'HTAN_2.HTAN' does not exist or not authorized.
```

The error indicates that Snowflake is interpreting `'HTAN_2.HTAN'` as a single schema name, rather than recognizing `'HTAN_2'` as the database and `'HTAN'` as the schema. This confusion could be due to the absence of quotation marks around the database and schema names, especially if they contain special characters like underscores or are case-sensitive.

---

### **Possible Solutions:**

#### **1. Use Double Quotes Around Database and Schema Names:**

Enclose the database and schema names in double quotes to ensure that Snowflake correctly interprets them.

**Rewritten Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

By adding double quotes around `"HTAN_2"` and `"HTAN"`, we explicitly define them as separate entities: the database and the schema, respectively.

#### **2. Check Case Sensitivity:**

Snowflake is case-sensitive when object names are enclosed in double quotes. Ensure that the database, schema, and table names are exactly as they appear in your environment.

- **If the names are in uppercase:**

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT "CLUSTERS"
  FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **If the names are in lowercase:**

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
  FROM "htan_2"."htan"."scrnaseq_msk_sclc_epithelial_cells_current"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

Check the exact casing of your database, schema, and table names, and adjust the query accordingly.

#### **3. Set the Database and Schema Context:**

To simplify your queries and avoid fully qualifying the table name each time, you can set the database and schema context for your session.

**Steps:**

1. **Set the Database:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
   ```

2. **Set the Schema:**

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
   ```

3. **Run the Query Without Fully Qualifying the Table Name:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
   FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

This approach ensures that all subsequent queries use the specified database and schema unless changed.

#### **4. Verify Available Databases and Schemas:**

Ensure that the `'HTAN_2'` database and `'HTAN'` schema exist and that you have access to them.

**List Available Databases:**

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

- Confirm that `'HTAN_2'` is listed.

**List Schemas in `'HTAN_2'` Database:**

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN_2";
```

- Confirm that `'HTAN'` is listed.

**List Tables in `'HTAN'` Schema:**

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "HTAN_2"."HTAN";
```

- Check if `'SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT'` is listed among the tables.

#### **5. Check Permissions:**

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the `'HTAN_2'` database and the `'HTAN'` schema.

- **Action:** Contact your database administrator to verify and grant the required permissions if necessary.

---

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Try the Adjusted Query with Quotation Marks:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
   FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Check the Case of Object Names:**

   - Verify the exact spelling and case of the database, schema, and table names.
   - Adjust the query to match the exact case.

3. **Set the Context and Simplify the Query:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
   USE SCHEMA "HTAN";

   SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
   FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Verify Database and Schema Existence:**

   - Ensure that you have access to `'HTAN_2'` and that it contains the `'HTAN'` schema.
   - Use the `SHOW DATABASES` and `SHOW SCHEMAS` commands as shown above.

---

### **Example of Setting Context and Running the Query:**

```sql
-- Set the database context
USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";

-- Set the schema context
USE SCHEMA "HTAN";

-- Run your query
SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Ambiguity with Object Names:**

  - Always use double quotes around database, schema, and table names, especially if they contain special characters or are case-sensitive.

- **Check for Typographical Errors:**

  - Ensure there are no typos in the object names.
  - For example, verify that it's `'SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT'` and not a variation.

- **Verify Your Role:**

  - Ensure that your Snowflake user role has the necessary access rights.
  - You can check your current role with:

    ```sql
    SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
    ```

---

### **Summary:**

- The error occurs because Snowflake is misinterpreting the database and schema names.
- Enclose database and schema names in double quotes to clearly define them.
- Ensure that the case of object names matches exactly as they were created.
- Setting the database and schema context can simplify your queries.
- Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the database and schema.

```
SQL compilation error:
Schema 'HTAN_2.HTAN' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error suggests that Snowflake is not recognizing the database and schema names as you've specified them. Let's work step-by-step to resolve this issue.

---

### **Possible Causes and Solutions**

#### **1. Enclose Database and Schema Names in Double Quotes**

When dealing with database and schema names that contain special characters (like underscores) or when case sensitivity is important, it's necessary to enclose each identifier in double quotes.

**Action:**

Modify your query to include double quotes around the database, schema, and table names:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **2. Verify Case Sensitivity**

Snowflake is case-sensitive when object names are enclosed in double quotes. If your database, schema, or table names were created in a specific case, you need to reference them exactly as they were created.

- **If the names are in lowercase:**

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
  FROM "htan_2"."htan"."scrnaseq_msk_sclc_epithelial_cells_current"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **If the names are in uppercase (default when created without quotes):**

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT CLUSTERS
  FROM HTAN_2.HTAN.SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

#### **3. Set the Database and Schema Context**

Setting the context for your session can simplify your queries and avoid potential issues with fully qualified names.

**Action:**

1. **Set the Database:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
   ```

2. **Set the Schema:**

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
   ```

3. **Run Your Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
   FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

This way, you're telling Snowflake explicitly which database and schema to use, reducing the chance of misinterpretation.

#### **4. Verify Database and Schema Existence**

Ensure that the database `'HTAN_2'` and the schema `'HTAN'` exist in your Snowflake environment and that you have access to them.

**Action:**

- **List Available Databases:**

  ```sql
  SHOW DATABASES;
  ```

  Check if `'HTAN_2'` is listed.

- **List Schemas in `'HTAN_2'` Database:**

  ```sql
  SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN_2";
  ```

  Verify that `'HTAN'` is listed as a schema.

- **List Tables in `'HTAN'` Schema:**

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "HTAN_2"."HTAN";
  ```

  Ensure that `'SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT'` appears in the list.

#### **5. Check Permissions**

It's possible that you don't have the necessary permissions to access the specified schema or database.

**Action:**

- **Contact Your Database Administrator** to confirm that you have the appropriate permissions for `'HTAN_2'` and `'HTAN'`.

#### **6. Check for Typographical Errors**

Ensure that all names are spelled correctly and match the exact case as they appear in your environment.

**Action:**

- Double-check the spelling of `'HTAN_2'`, `'HTAN'`, and `'SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT'`.

#### **7. Avoid Ambiguity in Schema Specification**

The error message indicates that Snowflake might be interpreting `'HTAN_2.HTAN'` as a single schema name rather than as a database and schema.

**Action:**

- Always separate the database and schema names with a dot and enclose them in double quotes if necessary.

- **Correct Format:**

  ```sql
  FROM "Database_Name"."Schema_Name"."Table_Name"
  ```

#### **8. Try Using Fully Qualified Names Without Quotes**

If object names were created without quotes and in uppercase, you can reference them without quotes.

**Action:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CLUSTERS
FROM HTAN_2.HTAN.SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Summary of Steps to Resolve the Error**

1. **Modify Your Query to Include Quotes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
   FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Ensure Correct Case Sensitivity:**

   - Match the case of your database, schema, and table names exactly.

3. **Set the Database and Schema Context:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
   USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
   ```

4. **Confirm Object Existence and Permissions:**

   - Use `SHOW DATABASES;`, `SHOW SCHEMAS;`, and `SHOW TABLES;` to verify existence.
   - Contact your administrator if you lack necessary permissions.

### **Example Adjusted Query**

```sql
-- Set the database and schema context
USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
USE SCHEMA "HTAN";

-- Run your query
SELECT DISTINCT "clusters"
FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Additional Tips**

- **Check for Hidden Characters or Spaces:**

  - Ensure there's no invisible whitespace or hidden characters in your query.

- **Avoid Mixing Quoted and Unquoted Identifiers:**

  - Consistency is key. If you start using double quotes for object names, apply them throughout your query.

- **Verify Your Current Role:**

  - Your Snowflake user role might not have the necessary privileges.

  ```sql
  SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
  ```

- **Review Documentation:**

  - Refer to the [Snowflake Documentation on Object Identifiers](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/identifiers-syntax.html) for more details.

### **Conclusion**

The error you're experiencing is likely due to Snowflake misinterpreting your database and schema names. By enclosing your database, schema, and table names in double quotes and ensuring the correct case sensitivity, you should be able to resolve the issue.

If after trying these steps you're still encountering problems, please consider reaching out to your database administrator for assistance, as there might be permissions issues or other environment-specific factors at play.
