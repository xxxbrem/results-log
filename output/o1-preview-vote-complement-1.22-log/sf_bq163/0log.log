2025-01-26 20:11:34 - root - INFO - I see that the error occurred because of the way the database, schema, and table names were specified in the SQL query.

In Snowflake, when specifying fully qualified table names, each identifier (database, schema, table) should be individually enclosed in double quotes if necessary, and separated by dots.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

By enclosing each identifier in double quotes and separating them properly, we ensure that Snowflake correctly interprets the database, schema, and table names.

Similarly, I will correct the other SQL queries accordingly.

    ```

---

**Explanation:**

The error message indicates that the schema `'HTAN_2.HTAN'` does not exist or is not authorized. This suggests that Snowflake is interpreting `'HTAN_2.HTAN'` as a single schema name, rather than recognizing `'HTAN_2'` as the database and `'HTAN'` as the schema.

To correct this, you should fully qualify the table name by separately enclosing each identifier (database, schema, table) in double quotes and separating them with dots. The correct format is:

```sql
FROM "database_name"."schema_name"."table_name"
```

By adjusting the SQL queries accordingly, you should be able to execute them without encountering the schema not found error.

---

**Note:** Remember to ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the specified database, schema, and tables. If you continue to encounter authorization errors, please check with your database administrator.

2025-01-26 20:12:05 - root - INFO - It appears that you're still encountering the same error because the database, schema, and table names in your SQL query are not properly specified. From the error message:

```
SQL compilation error:
Schema 'HTAN_2.HTAN' does not exist or not authorized.
```

Snowflake is interpreting `'HTAN_2.HTAN'` as a single schema name, rather than recognizing `'HTAN_2'` as the database and `'HTAN'` as the schema.

### **Correct SQL Query**

Please try running the corrected SQL query with each part properly enclosed in double quotes:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Enclose Each Identifier in Double Quotes:** Ensure that you enclose the **database name**, **schema name**, and **table name** each in double quotes and separate them with periods (`.`).
  
- **Correct Order:** The order should be `"DatabaseName"."SchemaName"."TableName"`.

### **If the Error Persists**

If you still receive the same error after using the corrected query, there are a few possible reasons:

1. **Database or Schema Does Not Exist:**

   - **Verify Database and Schema Names:** Double-check that the database `"HTAN_2"` and schema `"HTAN"` exist in your Snowflake environment.
   - **List Available Databases:**

     ```sql
     SHOW DATABASES;
     ```

   - **List Schemas in the Database:**

     ```sql
     SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN_2";
     ```

2. **Lack of Permissions:**

   - **Check Permissions:** You might not have the necessary permissions to access the database or schema. Contact your database administrator to ensure you have the required access.

3. **Set the Context to the Correct Database and Schema:**

   - **Use Database and Schema Commands:**

     ```sql
     USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
     USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
     ```

   - **Then Run the Query Without Specifying the Database and Schema:**

     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
     FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
   FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Verify Database and Schema Existence:**

   - **Check Available Databases:**

     ```sql
     SHOW DATABASES;
     ```

     **Expected Output:**

     | name    |
     |---------|
     | HTAN_2  |
     | ...     |

   - **Check Schemas in Database:**

     ```sql
     SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN_2";
     ```

     **Expected Output:**

     | name |
     |------|
     | HTAN |
     | ...  |

3. **Check Table Existence:**

   - **List Tables in Schema:**

     ```sql
     SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "HTAN_2"."HTAN";
     ```

     **Look for "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT" in the list.**

4. **Ensure You Have Access Privileges:**

   - **Check Your Roles and Grants:**

     ```sql
     SHOW GRANTS TO USER CURRENT_USER();
     ```

   - **If Necessary, Request Access from the Administrator.**

### **Example of Full Workflow**

1. **Set the Context (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
   USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
   ```

2. **Run the Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
   FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

### **Additional Tips**

- **Case Sensitivity:** Snowflake is case-sensitive when identifiers are enclosed in double quotes. Ensure that the names match exactly, including uppercase and lowercase letters.

- **Verify Spelling:** Make sure there are no typos in the database, schema, or table names.

- **Check for Correct Permissions:** If you suspect a permissions issue, contact your Snowflake administrator to verify that you have the necessary privileges.

### **Summary**

2025-01-26 20:12:34 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering the same error when running your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
FROM HTAN_2.HTAN."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Error Message:**

```
002003 (02000): 01b9f9fc-0004-7d15-0001-11c300fb9fca: SQL compilation error:
Schema 'HTAN_2.HTAN' does not exist or not authorized.
```

---

### **Explanation of the Issue**

The error is occurring because Snowflake is interpreting `HTAN_2.HTAN` as a single schema name, rather than recognizing `HTAN_2` as the database and `HTAN` as the schema.

In your query, the database and schema names are not properly enclosed in double quotes. This causes Snowflake to misinterpret the identifiers and fail to locate the schema.

### **Corrected SQL Query**

Please try running the corrected SQL query below, ensuring you **copy it exactly as shown**, including all double quotes:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Enclose Each Identifier in Double Quotes:**
  - `"HTAN_2"`: Database name
  - `"HTAN"`: Schema name
  - `"SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"`: Table name

- **Correct Order and Syntax:**
  - The fully qualified table name should be in the format: `"DatabaseName"."SchemaName"."TableName"`

### **Why This Correction Matters**

By enclosing each part (database, schema, table) in double quotes, you ensure that Snowflake correctly parses and recognizes each identifier separately. Without the double quotes, Snowflake might misinterpret the identifiers, leading to the schema not found error.

---

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. **Copy and Run the Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
   FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Make sure to include all double quotes as shown.**

2. **Set the Context to the Correct Database and Schema (Optional):**

   If you prefer, you can set your session to use the specific database and schema, which allows you to reference the table without fully qualifying it:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
   USE SCHEMA "HTAN";

   SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
   FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Verify That the Database and Schema Exist:**

   If you're still encountering errors, it's possible that:

   - The database `"HTAN_2"` does not exist.
   - The schema `"HTAN"` does not exist within that database.
   - You do not have the necessary permissions to access them.

   **To check available databases:**

   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

   **To check schemas in the database:**

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN_2";
   ```

4. **Check for Correct Permissions:**

   - Ensure that your user account has the necessary privileges to access the `"HTAN_2"` database and `"HTAN"` schema.
   - You can check your grants with:

     ```sql
     SHOW GRANTS TO USER CURRENT_USER();
     ```

   - If you lack permissions, please contact your database administrator.

---

### **Example of Full Workflow**

1. **Set the Database and Schema Context:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
   USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
   ```

2. **Run the Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
   FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

### **Additional Troubleshooting Tips**

- **Case Sensitivity:**

  - Snowflake is case-sensitive when using double quotes.
  - Ensure that the database, schema, and table names are spelled exactly as they appear in your Snowflake instance, including capitalization.

- **Double-Check Spelling and Typos:**

  - Verify that there are no typos in the database, schema, or table names.

- **Check Table Existence:**

  - After setting the context to the correct database and schema, list the tables to confirm the table exists:

    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "HTAN";
    ```

    - Look for `"SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"` in the list.

- **No Quotation Marks:**

  - If your database and schema names are fully uppercase and contain no special characters, you might omit the double quotes:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
    FROM HTAN_2.HTAN.SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

  - However, if any names contain lowercase letters or special characters (like underscores), it's safer to include the double quotes.

---

### **Summary**

- **Ensure Proper Quoting:** Enclose each identifier (database, schema, table) in double quotes if they include special characters or are case-sensitive.

- **Verify Names and Permissions:** Confirm that the database and schema exist and that you have access.

- **Set Context When Necessary:** Use the `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands to set your session context.

- **Copy the Corrected Query Exactly:** Make sure to use the corrected query as provided, including all punctuation and quotation marks.

---

### **Please Try Again**

Please try running the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Key Points to Address the Issue**

1. **Enclose Each Identifier in Double Quotes:**

   - Enclose **each** of the database name, schema name, and table name in double quotes.
   - **Correct Format:**
     ```sql
     FROM "DatabaseName"."SchemaName"."TableName"
     ```

2. **Check Database and Schema Existence:**

   - **Verify** that the database and schema exist in your Snowflake environment.
   - **Ensure** that you have access privileges to them.

3. **Set Session Context (Optional):**

   - Use the `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands to set your session context.

---

### **Step-by-Step Solution**

#### **1. Use Correctly Formatted SQL Query**

Please run the following SQL query **exactly as shown**, ensuring you include all double quotes around the database, schema, and table names:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Double Quotes Are Essential:**

  - `"HTAN_2"`: Database name
  - `"HTAN"`: Schema name
  - `"SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"`: Table name

- **Case Sensitivity:**

  - Snowflake is **case-sensitive** when identifiers are enclosed in double quotes.
  - Ensure that the names match exactly, including uppercase and lowercase letters.

#### **2. If Error Persists, Verify Database and Schema**

If you still receive the error, it's possible that:

- **The database `"HTAN_2"` does not exist in your environment.**
- **The schema `"HTAN"` does not exist within `"HTAN_2"`.**
- **You do not have the required permissions to access them.**

**To Verify:**

**a. List Available Databases**

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

- **Check if `"HTAN_2"` appears in the list.**

**b. If `"HTAN_2"` Exists, List Schemas in It**

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN_2";
```

- **Check if `"HTAN"` appears in the list of schemas.**

**c. If `"HTAN"` Exists, List Tables in It**

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "HTAN_2"."HTAN";
```

- **Check if `"SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"` appears in the list.**

#### **3. If Database or Schema Does Not Exist, Adjust Accordingly**

**Possible Reasons:**

- **The database might be named differently**, such as `"HTAN"` instead of `"HTAN_2"`.
- **The schema might be `"PUBLIC"`** or another default schema.

**Actions:**

- **List All Databases to Find the Correct One**

  ```sql
  SHOW DATABASES;
  ```

- **Try Using a Different Database or Schema**

  - For example, if there's a database named `"HTAN"`, try:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
    FROM "HTAN"."HTAN_2"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

  - Or, if the schema is `"PUBLIC"`:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
    FROM "HTAN_2"."PUBLIC"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

#### **4. Set Session Context to Simplify Queries**

If you can locate the correct database and schema, set them in your session:

```sql
USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
```

Then, run the query without specifying the database and schema:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
FROM "SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **5. Check Your Access Permissions**

If you still face issues:

- **You may not have the necessary permissions** to access the database or schema.
- **Contact your Snowflake administrator** to verify your access rights.

---

### **Example Workflow**

**1. List Databases:**

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

**Possible Output:**

| name       |
|------------|
| HTAN       |
| HTAN_2     |
| OTHER_DB   |

- **Identify the correct database**, e.g., `"HTAN"`.

**2. List Schemas in the Identified Database:**

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN";
```

**Possible Output:**

| name     |
|----------|
| PUBLIC   |
| HTAN_2   |
| OTHER_SCHEMA   |

- **Identify the correct schema**, e.g., `"PUBLIC"` or `"HTAN_2"`.

**3. List Tables in the Schema:**

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "HTAN"."PUBLIC";
```

- **Look for the table `"SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"` in the list.**

**4. Adjust Your Query Accordingly:**

If the table is found under `"HTAN"."PUBLIC"`, your query becomes:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
FROM "HTAN"."PUBLIC"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Summary**

- **Ensure Correct Quoting and Identifier Usage:**

  - Enclose database, schema, and table names in double quotes if they contain special characters or lowercase letters.

- **Verify Database and Schema Existence:**

  - Use `SHOW DATABASES` and `SHOW SCHEMAS` to identify the correct database and schema.

- **Set Session Context:**

  - Use `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` to set your context and simplify queries.

- **Check Permissions:**

  - Ensure you have the necessary access rights to the database, schema, and table.

- **Adjust Query Based on Findings:**

  - Modify your query to use the correct database and schema names as found in your environment.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **Run `SHOW DATABASES` and `SHOW SCHEMAS` to identify the correct database and schema.**

2. **Adjust your SQL query to reference the correct database and schema, ensuring all identifiers are properly quoted.**

3. **If you do not have access to the required database or schema, contact your Snowflake administrator for assistance.**

4. **Once you have the correct database and schema, proceed with your analysis.**

---

### **Alternative Considerations**

- **Possible Database and Schema Names:**

  - **Database:** `"HTAN"`
  - **Schema:** `"PUBLIC"` or another schema.

- **Alternative Query Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
  FROM "HTAN"."PUBLIC"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Adjust According to Your Environment:**

  - Replace `"HTAN"` and `"PUBLIC"` with the actual database and schema names available to you.

---

### **Please Try the Following**

1. **List Databases:**

   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

2. **Identify the Database Containing Your Data.**

3. **List Schemas in That Database:**

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "Your_Database_Name";
   ```

4. **Identify the Schema Containing Your Tables.**

5. **List Tables in That Schema:**

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "Your_Database_Name"."Your_Schema_Name";
   ```

6. **Adjust Your Query Accordingly:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "HTAN_Participant_ID"
   FROM "Your_Database_Name"."Your_Schema_Name"."SCRNASEQ_MSK_SCLC_EPITHELIAL_CELLS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

### **Final Note**

If you continue to experience issues after following these steps, please provide the output of the `SHOW DATABASES` and `SHOW SCHEMAS` commands (ensuring any sensitive information is removed). This will help identify the correct database and schema to use in your queries.

2025-01-26 20:14:11 - root - INFO - It seems you're encountering a syntax error indicating that the SQL parser is seeing the `FROM` keyword unexpectedly at the very beginning of your query. This suggests that the `SELECT` statement might be missing or not recognized due to formatting issues.

Here's the query you provided:

```sql
SELECT "HTAN_Participant_ID", "Age_at_Diagnosis"
   FROM HTAN_2.HTAN."CLINICAL_TIER1_DIAGNOSIS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
```

**Error Message:**

```
001003 (42000): SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'FROM'.
```

### **Possible Causes and Solutions**

#### **1. Missing or Incorrect `SELECT` Keyword**

- **Issue:** The error indicates that the parser is encountering `FROM` at position 0, suggesting that the `SELECT` keyword might be missing or there's an issue with the beginning of the query.
- **Solution:** Ensure that the `SELECT` keyword is present and correctly placed at the very start of the query without any preceding spaces or invisible characters.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT "HTAN_Participant_ID", "Age_at_Diagnosis"
FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."CLINICAL_TIER1_DIAGNOSIS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Steps:**

1. **Copy the Query Exactly:** Make sure to copy the query exactly as shown, including all keywords and quotation marks.

2. **Check for Hidden Characters:** Sometimes, when copying and pasting, invisible characters or extra spaces can be introduced before `SELECT`. Ensure that there is nothing before the `SELECT` keyword.

3. **Remove Indentation Before `FROM`:** Ensure that `FROM` aligns properly under `SELECT` without extra spaces or tabs that might confuse the parser.

#### **2. Proper Quoting of Identifiers**

- **Issue:** SQL may misinterpret database, schema, and table names if they are not properly enclosed, especially if they contain special characters or lowercase letters.
- **Solution:** Enclose database, schema, and table names in double quotes. Ensure each identifier is correctly quoted and separated by dots.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT "HTAN_Participant_ID", "Age_at_Diagnosis"
FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."CLINICAL_TIER1_DIAGNOSIS_CURRENT"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **3. Check for Syntax Errors**

- **Issue:** Unintentional line breaks, missing commas, or misaligned keywords can cause syntax errors.
- **Solution:** Ensure that the SQL syntax is correct and that there are no unintended line breaks or missing commas.

**Ensure the Query Format Is:**

```sql
SELECT "Column1", "Column2"
FROM "DatabaseName"."SchemaName"."TableName"
LIMIT Number;
```

#### **4. Verify Database and Schema Existence**

- **Issue:** The database or schema might not exist in your environment, or you might not have the necessary permissions.
- **Solution:** Verify that the database `"HTAN_2"` and schema `"HTAN"` exist and that you have access to them.

**Steps to Verify:**

- **List Available Databases:**

  ```sql
  SHOW DATABASES;
  ```

- **List Schemas in a Database:**

  ```sql
  SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN_2";
  ```

- **List Tables in a Schema:**

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "HTAN_2"."HTAN";
  ```

- **Set the Database and Schema Context:**

  ```sql
  USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
  USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
  ```

  After setting the context, you can reference the table without specifying the database and schema:

  ```sql
  SELECT "HTAN_Participant_ID", "Age_at_Diagnosis"
  FROM "CLINICAL_TIER1_DIAGNOSIS_CURRENT"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

#### **5. Ensure Proper Case Sensitivity**

- **Issue:** Snowflake is case-sensitive when identifiers are enclosed in double quotes.
- **Solution:** Verify that you are using the correct case for database, schema, table names, and column names.

**Example:**

- If the column names are actually in uppercase without quotes, you might try:

  ```sql
  SELECT HTAN_PARTICIPANT_ID, AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS
  FROM HTAN_2.HTAN.CLINICAL_TIER1_DIAGNOSIS_CURRENT
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- Or, if using quotes, ensure that the case matches exactly:

  ```sql
  SELECT "HTAN_Participant_ID", "Age_at_Diagnosis"
  FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."CLINICAL_TIER1_DIAGNOSIS_CURRENT"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

#### **6. Check for Any Leading Characters or Comments**

- **Issue:** If there's a character like a semicolon (`;`), a comment symbol, or any non-printable character before `SELECT`, the parser may fail.
- **Solution:** Ensure that the query starts exactly with `SELECT` and nothing precedes it.

### **Action Steps**

1. **Copy and Run the Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "HTAN_Participant_ID", "Age_at_Diagnosis"
   FROM "HTAN_2"."HTAN"."CLINICAL_TIER1_DIAGNOSIS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Ensure No Hidden Characters Before `SELECT`:**

   - Place the cursor at the very beginning of the line and press `Delete` to remove any hidden characters.

3. **Set Context (Optional):**

   - If the database and schema exist and you have access, set them as the default context:

     ```sql
     USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
     USE SCHEMA "HTAN";

     SELECT "HTAN_Participant_ID", "Age_at_Diagnosis"
     FROM "CLINICAL_TIER1_DIAGNOSIS_CURRENT"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

4. **Verify Database and Schema Names:**

   - Run the following commands to check the existence of the database and schema:

     ```sql
     SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'HTAN%';
     SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "HTAN_2";
     ```

   - Adjust the database and schema names in your query if necessary.

5. **Check Permissions:**

   - Ensure that your user account has the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table.
   - Contact your database administrator if you suspect permission issues.

### **Example of a Successful Query Execution**

Here’s how you might proceed to ensure the query runs successfully:

1. **Set the Context:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "HTAN_2";
   USE SCHEMA "HTAN";
   ```

2. **Run the Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "HTAN_Participant_ID", "Age_at_Diagnosis"
   FROM "CLINICAL_TIER1_DIAGNOSIS_CURRENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - Ensure that this query starts with `SELECT` and that there are no extra characters before it.

### **If the Issue Persists**

- **Try a Simple Query to Test Connectivity:**

  ```sql
  SELECT 1;
  ```

  - If this fails, there might be a broader issue with your session or permissions.

- **Contact Support or Administrator:**

  - If none of the above solutions work, consider reaching out to your database administrator for assistance.

### **Summary**

- **Ensure the `SELECT` Keyword Is Present:** The error suggests `SELECT` might be missing or there's an issue at the very start of the query.
- **Properly Quote Identifiers:** Enclose database, schema, and table names in double quotes if necessary.
- **Check for Hidden Characters:** Remove any invisible characters before `SELECT`.
- **Verify Database, Schema, and Table Names:** Confirm their existence and correct spelling.
- **Set Session Context:** Use `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` to avoid fully qualifying table names.
- **Confirm Permissions:** Ensure you have access to the necessary database objects.
