2025-01-24 21:54:35 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error occurs because the column `"state_name"` does not exist in the table `DISTRACT_2015`. While `DISTRACT_2016` includes the `"state_name"` column, `DISTRACT_2015` does not. 

**How to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Use `"state_number"` Instead of `"state_name"`:**

   Since `"state_number"` is present in `DISTRACT_2015`, you can modify your query to use `"state_number"`:

   ```sql
   SELECT "state_number", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "accident_count"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015
   WHERE "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT IN ('Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', 'Not Reported')
   GROUP BY "state_number"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   This will give you the accident counts per state number.

2. **Join with `ACCIDENT_2015` to Get `"state_name"`:**

   The `ACCIDENT_2015` table contains both `"state_number"` and `"state_name"`. You can join `DISTRACT_2015` with `ACCIDENT_2015` on `"state_number"` and `"consecutive_number"` to retrieve the `"state_name"`.

   **Corrected SQL Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT a."state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT d."consecutive_number") AS "accident_count"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
   JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.ACCIDENT_2015 a
     ON d."state_number" = a."state_number" AND d."consecutive_number" = a."consecutive_number"
   WHERE d."driver_distracted_by_name" NOT IN ('Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', 'Not Reported')
   GROUP BY a."state_name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   This query will correctly provide the accident counts per state name by combining data from both tables.

**Additional Information:**

- Ensure that when referencing columns, they exist in the specified table.
- When columns are missing, consider joining with another table that contains the required information.
- Always check the schema of the tables to verify the available columns.

**Next Steps:**

- **For 2015 Data:**

  Use the corrected query above to get the accident counts per state for 2015.

- **For 2016 Data:**

  Since `DISTRACT_2016` includes `"state_name"`, your original query should work for 2016:

  ```sql
  SELECT "state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "accident_count"
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2016
  WHERE "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT IN ('Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', 'Not Reported')
  GROUP BY "state_name"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

---

**Final Note:**

By adjusting your queries as shown, you should be able to retrieve the required data for both years and proceed with calculating the number of traffic accidents per 100,000 people due to driver distraction for each state.

2025-01-24 21:56:18 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error occurs because the column `"zipcode"` is not recognized in the table `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`. This is likely due to case sensitivity in Snowflake when using double-quoted identifiers.

In Snowflake:

- Unquoted identifiers are automatically uppercased and are case-insensitive.
- Quoted identifiers are case-sensitive and must match the case used when the table was created.

**How to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Use Unquoted Uppercase Column Names:**

   Try referencing the columns without double quotes and use uppercase letters. This way, Snowflake will interpret the identifiers as uppercase, which matches the default column names if they were created without quotes.

   ```sql
   SELECT ZIPCODE, POPULATION
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Or Use Quoted Column Names with Exact Case:**

   If the columns were created with quoted identifiers preserving their case, you need to match that exact case in your query. Based on the DDL provided, the column names may be in uppercase.

   ```sql
   SELECT "ZIPCODE", "POPULATION"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

Option 1: Using unquoted uppercase column names.

```sql
SELECT ZIPCODE, POPULATION
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
LIMIT 100;
```

Option 2: Using quoted column names with exact case matching the table's column names.

```sql
SELECT "ZIPCODE", "POPULATION"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
LIMIT 100;
```

**Additional Information:**

- **Why the Error Occurs:** When you use double quotes around `"zipcode"`, Snowflake treats it as a case-sensitive identifier. If the column in the table is named `"ZIPCODE"` (in uppercase), using `"zipcode"` will cause an `invalid identifier` error.
  
- **Case Sensitivity in Snowflake:**
  - **Unquoted Identifiers:** Treated as uppercase and case-insensitive. Writing `zipcode`, `ZIPCODE`, or `ZipCode` without quotes will all refer to the same column `ZIPCODE`.
  - **Quoted Identifiers:** Treated as case-sensitive. You must match the exact case used when the column was created.

**Next Steps:**

- **Try the Corrected Query:** Run the corrected query using one of the options above.
- **Consistency in Querying:** Decide whether to use quoted identifiers consistently or to stick with unquoted identifiers and uppercase column names to avoid similar issues in the future.

**Final Note:**

By adjusting your query to match the case sensitivity rules in Snowflake, you should be able to retrieve the data without errors.

---

**Example Execution with Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT ZIPCODE, POPULATION
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010
LIMIT 100;
```

This should return the first 100 rows with the `ZIPCODE` and `POPULATION` columns from the `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` table.

2025-01-24 21:58:21 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error occurs because of case sensitivity and the use of quoted identifiers in Snowflake.

In Snowflake:

- **Unquoted identifiers** (e.g., `ZIPCODE`, `STATE_NAME`) are **automatically uppercased** and are **case-insensitive**.
- **Quoted identifiers** (e.g., `"zipcode"`, `"state_name"`) are **case-sensitive** and must match the exact case used when the table was created.

In your query, you're referencing `z.STATE_NAME` without quotes, so Snowflake interprets it as `Z.STATE_NAME` (uppercase). However, based on the table definition (`DDL`), the column in `ZIPCODE_AREA` is `"state_name"` (all lowercase and quoted). This mismatch causes the `invalid identifier 'Z.STATE_NAME'` error.

**How to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Use Quoted Column Names with Exact Case:**

   Since the columns were created with quoted identifiers in lowercase, you need to reference them exactly as they exist in the table schema, including the quotes and matching the case.

   **Corrected SQL Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."zipcode", p."population", z."state_name"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
   JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
     ON p."zipcode" = z."zipcode"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Ensure All Column References Match the Exact Case:**

   - **For `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` Table:**
     - Columns are created with lowercase names and quoted (e.g., `"zipcode"`, `"population"`).
   - **For `ZIPCODE_AREA` Table:**
     - Columns are also lowercase and quoted (e.g., `"zipcode"`, `"state_name"`).

**Additional Information:**

- **Why the Error Occurs:**
  - When you reference `z.STATE_NAME` without quotes, Snowflake looks for a column named `STATE_NAME` in uppercase. Since the actual column is `"state_name"` (lowercase), it doesn't find a match.
- **Case Sensitivity Rules in Snowflake:**
  - **Unquoted Identifiers:** Automatically uppercased and case-insensitive.
  - **Quoted Identifiers:** Case-sensitive and must match exactly as defined.

**Final Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT p."zipcode", p."population", z."state_name"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p."zipcode" = z."zipcode"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:** Execute the corrected query to retrieve the data.
- **Consistent Use of Identifiers:** When working with tables that have quoted identifiers, always use double quotes and match the case exactly.
- **Review Other Queries:** Ensure that other SQL queries in your workflow also follow this convention to avoid similar errors.

**Example Execution with Corrected Query:**

Running the corrected query should yield results similar to:

```plaintext
zipcode   | population | state_name
----------+------------+-------------
01001     | 100000     | Massachusetts
01001     | 100000     | Massachusetts
...       | ...        | ...
```

---

**Summary:**

To fix the error:

- Enclose column names in double quotes if they are case-sensitive (i.e., if they were created with quotes).
- Match the exact case of the column names as they appear in the table schema.
- Ensure consistency in using quoted identifiers throughout your SQL statements.

By making these adjustments, your query should execute successfully without errors.

2025-01-24 21:58:50 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
invalid identifier 'P."zipcode"'
```

occurs due to **case sensitivity** and the usage of **quoted identifiers** in Snowflake.

In your query:

```sql
SELECT p.ZIPCODE, p.POPULATION, z.STATE_NAME
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p.ZIPCODE = z.ZIPCODE
LIMIT 100
```

you're referencing columns without quotes and in uppercase (e.g., `p.ZIPCODE`), while the actual column names in the tables are defined with **quoted lowercase identifiers** (e.g., `"zipcode"`).

**Understanding the Error:**

- **Case Sensitivity in Snowflake:**
  - **Unquoted Identifiers:** Treated as uppercase and case-insensitive. When you write `p.ZIPCODE`, Snowflake looks for a column named `ZIPCODE` (uppercase) in table `p`.
  - **Quoted Identifiers:** Treated as case-sensitive and must match the exact case used when the column was created. The column `"zipcode"` (lowercase) is different from `ZIPCODE` (uppercase).

- **Your Tables' Column Definitions:**
  - In `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`, the columns are defined with **quoted lowercase identifiers** (e.g., `"zipcode"`, `"population"`).
  - Similarly, in `ZIPCODE_AREA`, the columns are also defined with **quoted lowercase identifiers** (e.g., `"zipcode"`, `"state_name"`).

- **The Error Message:**
  - The error message mentions `invalid identifier 'P."zipcode"'` because Snowflake cannot find a column named `ZIPCODE` (uppercase) in table `p`, and it's indicating an issue with the column reference.

**Solution:**

To resolve the error, you need to:

1. **Use Quoted Identifiers with Exact Case:**
   - Enclose the column names in double quotes.
   - Match the exact case of the column names as they exist in the table definitions.

2. **Modify Your Query Accordingly:**

   **Corrected SQL Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."zipcode", p."population", z."state_name"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
   JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
     ON p."zipcode" = z."zipcode"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Why This Works:**

- By using `"zipcode"` and `"population"` with quotes and matching the exact case, you're correctly referencing the columns as they are defined in the table.
- This tells Snowflake to look for columns named exactly `"zipcode"` and `"population"` (lowercase), which exist in your tables.
- The join condition `p."zipcode" = z."zipcode"` now correctly matches the columns from both tables.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Consistency:** When working with tables that have quoted identifiers, it's best to consistently use quoted identifiers in your queries.
- **Column Names:** Always verify the exact case and spelling of column names in your table definitions, especially when they are created with quotes.
- **Testing:** After making these changes, run the query to ensure it executes successfully and returns the expected results.

**Example Execution:**

Running the corrected query should return data similar to:

```plaintext
zipcode  | population | state_name
---------+------------+-------------
01001    | 100000     | Massachusetts
01002    | 105000     | Massachusetts
...      | ...        | ...
```

**Summary:**

- The error was caused by a mismatch between the case of the column names in your query and the actual column names in the tables.
- Using quoted identifiers with the exact case resolves the issue.
- Adjust your query to include quotes around column names and match the case exactly as defined in the tables.

**Final Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT p."zipcode", p."population", z."state_name"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p."zipcode" = z."zipcode"
LIMIT 100;
```

By making these adjustments, your query should execute successfully without any errors.

```sql
SELECT p.ZIPCODE, p.POPULATION, z.STATE_NAME
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p.ZIPCODE = z.ZIPCODE
LIMIT 100
```

- **`p.ZIPCODE` and `p.POPULATION`:** If these columns were created without quotes and in uppercase, this should work fine.
- **`z.STATE_NAME`:** Here lies the problem. You're referencing `STATE_NAME` without quotes, so Snowflake looks for a column named `STATE_NAME` (uppercase) in the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table.
- However, if the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table defines the column as `"state_name"` (lowercase and quoted), then `STATE_NAME` (uppercase) does not match `"state_name"` (lowercase), resulting in the `invalid identifier` error.

**Solution:**

To fix this error, you need to reference the column names exactly as they are defined in the table, including using double quotes and matching the case.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT p.ZIPCODE, p.POPULATION, z."state_name"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p.ZIPCODE = z."zipcode"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **`z."state_name"`:**
   - Enclose `"state_name"` in double quotes and match the exact case as defined in the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table.
   - If the column was created as `"state_name"` (all lowercase and quoted), you must reference it exactly like this.

2. **`z."zipcode"` in the JOIN condition:**
   - Similarly, if the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table has the `"zipcode"` column defined in lowercase and quoted, use `z."zipcode"`.

3. **`p.ZIPCODE` and `p.POPULATION`:**
   - If the columns in `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` are unquoted and uppercase (as inferred from your earlier successful queries), you can reference them without quotes.

**Why This Works:**

- By matching the exact column names (including case) and using quotes where appropriate, Snowflake can correctly identify the columns.
- Snowflake treats unquoted identifiers as **uppercase**, so `p.ZIPCODE` refers to the `ZIPCODE` column (assuming it exists in uppercase).
- Quoted identifiers are **case-sensitive**, so `z."state_name"` refers exactly to the `"state_name"` column in lowercase.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Check the Column Definitions:**
  - You can query the **information schema** to inspect the exact column names and confirm their cases.

    ```sql
    SELECT COLUMN_NAME
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'ZIPCODE_AREA';
    ```

- **Consistency:**
  - When working with tables that use quoted identifiers with specific cases, it's best to consistently use quotes and match cases in your queries.

**Example Execution After Correction:**

Running the corrected query should return results like:

| ZIPCODE | POPULATION | state_name   |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| 01001   | 10000      | Massachusetts|
| 01002   | 15000      | Massachusetts|
| ...     | ...        | ...          |

**Summary:**

- The error was due to a mismatch between the case of the column names in your query and how they are defined in the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table.
- In Snowflake, **case sensitivity matters when using quoted identifiers**.
- Adjust your query to match the exact case of the column names and use double quotes for quoted identifiers.

**Final Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT p.ZIPCODE, p.POPULATION, z."state_name"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p.ZIPCODE = z."zipcode"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:** Execute the corrected query to retrieve your data.
- **Apply Consistency:** When writing future queries, ensure that you're matching the cases of column names and using quotes appropriately based on how the columns are defined.
- **Verify Other Queries:** If you have similar queries, adjust them accordingly to prevent similar errors.

---

By making these adjustments, your query should execute successfully, and you'll be able to retrieve the desired data without any errors.

2025-01-24 21:59:56 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
invalid identifier 'Z.STATE_NAME'
```

is due to **case sensitivity** and the use of **quoted identifiers** in Snowflake.

**Understanding the Issue:**

In Snowflake:

- **Unquoted identifiers** are **automatically uppercased** and are **case-insensitive**. For example, `zipcode` becomes `ZIPCODE`.
- **Quoted identifiers** (enclosed in double quotes) are **case-sensitive** and must match the exact case used when the column was created.

From the table definitions provided earlier, the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table likely has columns defined with **quoted lowercase identifiers** (e.g., `"state_name"`, `"zipcode"`). Similarly, the `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` table may have columns like `"population"` and `"zipcode"` defined in lowercase with quotes.

When you reference `z.STATE_NAME`, Snowflake looks for a column named `STATE_NAME` (uppercase) in the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table. Since the actual column name is `"state_name"` (lowercase and quoted), it cannot find it, leading to the `invalid identifier` error.

**Solution:**

To resolve the error, you need to:

1. **Use Quoted Identifiers with Exact Case:**

   - Enclose column names in double quotes.
   - Match the exact case as defined in the table schema.

2. **Modify Your Query Accordingly:**

   **Corrected SQL Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."population") AS "state_population"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
   JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
     ON p."zipcode" = z."zipcode"
   GROUP BY z."state_name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Why This Works:**

- By using `"state_name"` and `"zipcode"` in double quotes and matching the exact case, you correctly reference the columns as they exist in the tables.
- Snowflake will now recognize the columns in both tables during the SELECT and JOIN operations.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Consistency:** When dealing with tables that use quoted identifiers, always use double quotes and match the case exactly in your queries.
- **Column Names in JOIN Conditions:** Ensure that column names used in JOIN conditions are also correctly quoted and case-matched.

**Example Execution:**

Executing the corrected query should provide results similar to:

| state_name    | state_population |
|---------------|------------------|
| California    | 37,253,956       |
| Texas         | 25,145,561       |
| New York      | 19,378,102       |
| ...           | ...              |

*(Note: Population numbers are illustrative.)*

---

**Summary:**

- **Error Cause:** Snowflake couldn't find `STATE_NAME` in the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table because of case sensitivity and quoting.
- **Resolution:** Use double quotes around column names and match the exact case as defined in the table schema.
- **Key Takeaway:** In Snowflake, when columns are created with quoted identifiers, they are case-sensitive and must be referenced in queries exactly as they are defined.

---

**Final Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."population") AS "state_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p."zipcode" = z."zipcode"
GROUP BY z."state_name"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

By making these adjustments, your query should execute successfully, and you'll obtain the total population per state from the 2010 census data.

The error you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 27
invalid identifier 'P."population"'
```

is due to a mismatch between the way column names are referenced in your query and how they are defined in the tables, specifically regarding case sensitivity and the use of quoted identifiers in Snowflake.

---

**Understanding the Issue:**

In Snowflake:

- **Unquoted identifiers** are automatically **uppercased** and are **case-insensitive**.
- **Quoted identifiers** (enclosed in double quotes) are **case-sensitive** and must match the exact case used when the column was created.

In your query:

```sql
SELECT z.STATE_NAME, SUM(p.POPULATION) AS STATE_POPULATION
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p.ZIPCODE = z.ZIPCODE
GROUP BY z.STATE_NAME
LIMIT 100
```

- You're using unquoted column names like `p.POPULATION` and `z.STATE_NAME`.
- If the columns in the tables were created using **quoted lowercase identifiers** (e.g., `"population"`, `"state_name"`), referencing them without quotes and in uppercase will cause an `invalid identifier` error because Snowflake cannot find a column named `POPULATION` or `STATE_NAME`.

---

**Solution:**

To resolve the error, you need to:

1. **Use Quoted Identifiers with Exact Case:**
   - Enclose column names in double quotes.
   - Match the exact case as defined in the table schema.

2. **Modify Your Query Accordingly:**

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."population") AS "state_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p."zipcode" = z."zipcode"
GROUP BY z."state_name"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Column Names Enclosed in Double Quotes:**
  - `z."state_name"`: Matches the exact case used in the table definition.
  - `p."population"`: Matches the exact case used in the table definition.
  - `p."zipcode"` and `z."zipcode"`: Both columns are enclosed in double quotes to match their case-sensitive definitions.

- **GROUP BY Clause:**
  - `GROUP BY z."state_name"`: Ensures that the column used in the `SELECT` clause matches the one in the `GROUP BY` clause, both in terms of case and quoting.

---

**Additional Information:**

- **Why This Works:**
  - By using double quotes and matching the exact case, you ensure that Snowflake can correctly identify the columns in the tables.

- **Case Sensitivity in Snowflake:**
  - When tables and columns are created with quoted identifiers, they are stored with the exact case provided.
  - Referencing these identifiers requires using double quotes and the exact case.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:**
  - Execute the corrected query to retrieve the total population per state.
  - Verify that it executes successfully without errors.

- **Consistent Identifier Usage:**
  - When writing queries against tables with case-sensitive identifiers, always use double quotes and match the exact case.
  - This practice will help you avoid similar errors in the future.

- **Check Table Definitions:**
  - If unsure about the exact column names and their cases, you can query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` to inspect the column names:

    ```sql
    SELECT COLUMN_NAME
    FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010';
    ```

---

**Example Execution:**

After applying the corrections, running the query should yield results similar to:

| state_name    | state_population |
|---------------|------------------|
| California    | 37,253,956       |
| Texas         | 25,145,561       |
| New York      | 19,378,102       |
| ...           | ...              |

*(Note: The population numbers are illustrative and may not reflect actual data.)*

---

**Summary:**

- The error was caused by referencing column names without quotes and in uppercase, while the actual columns were defined with quotes and in lowercase.
- By adjusting your query to use double quotes and matching the exact case of the column names, you allow Snowflake to correctly identify and access the columns.
- Consistently using this approach when working with case-sensitive identifiers in Snowflake will help prevent similar errors.

The error message:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
invalid identifier 'Z.STATE_NAME'
```

indicates that Snowflake cannot find the column `STATE_NAME` in the table alias `z` (`ZIPCODE_AREA` table). This issue stems from **case sensitivity** and the use of **quoted identifiers** in Snowflake.

**Understanding the Issue:**

1. **Case Sensitivity in Snowflake:**

   - **Unquoted Identifiers:** Treated as uppercase. When you reference `STATE_NAME` without quotes, Snowflake looks for a column named `STATE_NAME` in uppercase.
   - **Quoted Identifiers:** Case-sensitive and must match exactly as defined. If the column was created as `"state_name"` (all lowercase), you must reference it with quotes and the exact case.

2. **Your Tables' Column Definitions:**

   - In the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table, columns are likely defined with **quoted identifiers** in **lowercase** (e.g., `"state_name"`, `"zipcode"`).
   - Similarly, in the `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` table, columns are defined as `"population"`, `"zipcode"` (quoted and lowercase).

**Solution:**

To resolve the error, you need to:

- Use double quotes around column names that were created with quoted identifiers.
- Match the exact case (uppercase or lowercase) as defined in the tables.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."population") AS "state_population"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
  ON p."zipcode" = z."zipcode"
GROUP BY z."state_name"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Quoted Column Names:**

   - Enclose `"state_name"`, `"population"`, and `"zipcode"` in double quotes.
   - Use the exact case as the column definitions (assumed to be lowercase).

2. **Consistent Referencing:**

   - In the `SELECT` clause: `z."state_name"` matches the column in the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table.
   - In the `SUM` function: `p."population"` references the column in the `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` table.
   - In the `JOIN` condition: `p."zipcode" = z."zipcode"` correctly matches the ZIP codes from both tables.
   - In the `GROUP BY` clause: `z."state_name"` corresponds to the `SELECT` clause.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Verify Column Names:** Ensure that the column names are indeed in lowercase and were created with quoted identifiers.
- **Check Table Schema:** You can confirm the exact column names and their cases by querying the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` view.

  ```sql
  SELECT COLUMN_NAME
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
  WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'UTILITY_US' AND TABLE_NAME = 'ZIPCODE_AREA';
  ```

- **Consistency:** Always use quotes and match cases when dealing with quoted identifiers.

**Example Execution:**

Running the corrected query should yield results like:

| state_name       | state_population |
|------------------|------------------|
| California       | 37,253,956       |
| Texas            | 25,145,561       |
| New York         | 19,378,102       |
| Florida          | 18,801,310       |
| Illinois         | 12,830,632       |
| ...              | ...              |

*(Note: Population numbers are illustrative.)*

**Summary:**

- **Cause of Error:** The column `STATE_NAME` was referenced without quotes and in uppercase, but the actual column is likely `"state_name"` in lowercase and requires quotes.
- **Resolution:** Use double-quoted identifiers matching the exact case of the column names.
- **Best Practice:** When working with tables that have case-sensitive column names (due to quoted identifiers), always reference columns using double quotes and the exact case.

**Final Note:**

By adjusting your query with the correct use of quoted identifiers and case sensitivity, you should be able to execute it successfully and retrieve the desired data.

2025-01-24 22:01:26 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error message:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 16
invalid identifier 'A.STATE_NAME'
```

indicates that Snowflake cannot find the column `STATE_NAME` in the table alias `a` (which refers to `ACCIDENT_2015`). This issue arises due to **case sensitivity** and the use of **quoted identifiers** in Snowflake.

---

**Understanding the Issue:**

1. **Case Sensitivity in Snowflake:**

   - **Unquoted Identifiers:**
     - Treated as **uppercase**.
     - When you reference `a.STATE_NAME` without quotes, Snowflake looks for a column named `STATE_NAME` (uppercase) in table `a`.
   - **Quoted Identifiers:**
     - Case-sensitive and must match the exact case used when the column was created.
     - If the column was created as `"state_name"` (all lowercase), you must reference it as `a."state_name"`.

2. **Column Definitions in Your Tables:**

   - **`ACCIDENT_2015` Table (alias `a`):**
     - Columns are defined with quoted identifiers in **lowercase**.
     - From the DDL:
       ```sql
       "state_number" NUMBER(38,0),
       "state_name" VARCHAR(16777216),
       "consecutive_number" NUMBER(38,0),
       ```
   - **`DISTRACT_2015` Table (alias `d`):**
     - Columns are also likely defined with quoted identifiers in **lowercase**.
       ```sql
       "state_number" NUMBER(38,0),
       "consecutive_number" NUMBER(38,0),
       ```

3. **Why the Error Occurs:**

   - You referenced `a.STATE_NAME` without quotes, so Snowflake looks for `STATE_NAME` (uppercase).
   - The actual column is `"state_name"` (lowercase), so Snowflake cannot find `STATE_NAME` and raises an `invalid identifier` error.
   - Similarly, in your `ON` clause, you referenced `STATE_NUMBER` and `CONSECUTIVE_NUMBER` without quotes.

---

**Solution:**

To resolve the error, you need to:

- **Use Quoted Identifiers with Exact Case:**
  - Enclose all column names in double quotes.
  - Match the exact case as defined in the table schema.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a."state_name"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.ACCIDENT_2015 a
  ON d."state_number" = a."state_number" AND d."consecutive_number" = a."consecutive_number"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **`a."state_name"`:**
  - References the `"state_name"` column exactly as it exists in `ACCIDENT_2015`.
- **`d."state_number"` and `a."state_number"`:**
  - Both sides of the join use quoted identifiers matching the column definitions.
- **`d."consecutive_number"` and `a."consecutive_number"`:**
  - Similarly adjusted to use quotes and exact case.

---

**Additional Information:**

- **Consistency:**
  - When working with tables that have quoted identifiers, always use double quotes and match the exact case.
- **Case Sensitivity Rules in Snowflake:**
  - **Unquoted Identifiers:**
    - Automatically uppercase and case-insensitive.
  - **Quoted Identifiers:**
    - Case-sensitive and must match exactly.

---

**Example Execution:**

Running the corrected query should return the distinct state names from the `ACCIDENT_2015` table that are associated with records in the `DISTRACT_2015` table.

---

**Final Note:**

By adjusting your query to use quoted identifiers and matching the exact case of the column names, you should be able to execute the query successfully and retrieve the desired data. This practice is essential when working with databases that have case-sensitive identifiers.

2025-01-24 22:02:19 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error message you're encountering:

```
001003 (42000): 01b9ef29-0004-7d15-0001-11c300f9c54a: SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected '"state_number"'.
```

indicates that the SQL parser encountered an unexpected `'"state_number"'` at the very **start** of your query (position 0). This suggests there might be an issue with how the query is structured, particularly with the use of double quotes and case sensitivity.

**Understanding the Issue:**

1. **Case Sensitivity in Snowflake:**

   - **Unquoted Identifiers:**
     - Treated as **uppercase** and are **case-insensitive**.
     - When you write `state_number`, Snowflake interprets it as `STATE_NUMBER`.

   - **Quoted Identifiers:**
     - Treated as **case-sensitive** and must match the exact case used when the object was created.
     - If your columns are defined as `"state_number"` (all lowercase), you must reference them exactly as such, including the double quotes.

2. **Error at Position 0:**
   
   - An error at position 0 indicates a problem at the very beginning of the query. Often, this is due to:

     - **Misplaced or Extra Quotation Marks:** An extra double quote at the start of the query.
     - **Copy-Paste Issues:** Hidden characters or formatting issues that introduce unexpected tokens.

3. **Possible Misuse of Quotation Marks:**

   - If you accidentally have an opening double quote before your query starts, it could cause the parser to expect a closing quote and misinterpret the rest of your query.

**Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Check for Extra Quotation Marks at the Start:**

   - Ensure your query starts with `SELECT`, not `"SELECT` or any other variation.
   - Remove any accidental double quotes at the very beginning.

2. **Use Correct Quoting and Case for Identifiers:**

   - **If your columns and tables were created with quoted identifiers in lowercase:**

     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT a."state_name"
     FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES."DISTRACT_2015" d
     JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES."ACCIDENT_2015" a
       ON d."state_number" = a."state_number" AND d."consecutive_number" = a."consecutive_number"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

   - **If your columns and tables were created without quotes (unquoted identifiers), they are uppercase:**

     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT a.STATE_NAME
     FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
     JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.ACCIDENT_2015 a
       ON d.STATE_NUMBER = a.STATE_NUMBER AND d.CONSECUTIVE_NUMBER = a.CONSECUTIVE_NUMBER
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

   - **Important:** Be consistent with your use of quotes and cases throughout the query.

3. **Ensure No Hidden Characters or Formatting Issues:**

   - Copy your query into a plain text editor to remove any hidden characters or formatting.
   - Re-type the query manually if necessary.

4. **Verify Table and Column Names:**

   - Use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to check the exact names and cases of your tables and columns:

     ```sql
     SELECT COLUMN_NAME
     FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
     WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'ACCIDENT_2015';
     ```

**Corrected Query:**

Assuming your columns and tables are defined with quoted identifiers in lowercase:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a."state_name"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES."DISTRACT_2015" d
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES."ACCIDENT_2015" a
  ON d."state_number" = a."state_number" AND d."consecutive_number" = a."consecutive_number"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Alternatively**, if your columns and tables are unquoted identifiers (uppercase):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.STATE_NAME
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015 d
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.ACCIDENT_2015 a
  ON d.STATE_NUMBER = a.STATE_NUMBER AND d.CONSECUTIVE_NUMBER = a.CONSECUTIVE_NUMBER
LIMIT 100;
```

**Double-Check the Following:**

- **Start of the Query:**
  - Ensure there's no extra quotation mark at the beginning of your query.

- **Table Names:**
  - If your table names are in lowercase and were created with quotes, you need to reference them with double quotes.

- **Column Names:**
  - Match the exact case and quoting of your column names.

**Example of Verifying Column Names:**

```sql
-- Check columns in ACCIDENT_2015
SELECT COLUMN_NAME
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'ACCIDENT_2015';

-- Check columns in DISTRACT_2015
SELECT COLUMN_NAME
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'DISTRACT_2015';
```

**Further Tips:**

- **Avoid Mixing Cases and Quotes:**
  - Don't mix uppercase unquoted identifiers with lowercase quoted identifiers unless they match the actual definitions.

- **Test Simplified Queries:**
  - Try running a simpler version of your query to test connectivity and access:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES."ACCIDENT_2015"
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

**Final Notes:**

- **Consistency is Key:**
  - Be consistent in using quotes and cases throughout your query.

- **Check for Hidden Characters:**
  - Hidden or non-printable characters can cause unexpected errors; retyping the query can help.

By carefully reviewing your query for extra quotation marks, ensuring correct use of quoted identifiers, and matching the exact case of your column and table names, you should be able to resolve the syntax error and execute your query successfully.

2025-01-24 22:04:42 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error message you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 4 at position 9
invalid identifier 'P."zipcode"'
```

indicates that Snowflake cannot find the column `"zipcode"` in the table alias `p` (`POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`). This issue is due to **case sensitivity** and the use of **quoted identifiers** in Snowflake.

---

**Understanding the Issue:**

1. **Case Sensitivity in Snowflake:**

   - **Unquoted Identifiers:**
     - Treated as **uppercase** and are **case-insensitive**.
     - When you reference `p.ZIPCODE`, Snowflake looks for a column named `ZIPCODE` in uppercase.
   - **Quoted Identifiers:**
     - Treated as **case-sensitive** and must match the exact case used when the column was created.
     - If a column is created as `"zipcode"` (all lowercase), you must reference it exactly as `"zipcode"`.

2. **Column Definitions in Your Tables:**

   - **`POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` Table (alias `p`):**
     - Columns are likely defined as **unquoted identifiers**, which are stored in uppercase. So the column is `ZIPCODE`, not `"zipcode"`.
   - **`ZIPCODE_AREA` Table (alias `z`):**
     - Columns are defined with **quoted identifiers** in **lowercase** (e.g., `"zipcode"`, `"state_name"`).

---

**Solution:**

To resolve the error, adjust your query to match the exact case and quoting of the column names:

1. **Use Unquoted Identifiers for the `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` Table (`p`):**

   - Replace `p."zipcode"` with `p.ZIPCODE` (unquoted and uppercase).

2. **Keep Quoted Identifiers for the `ZIPCODE_AREA` Table (`z`):**

   - Keep using `z."zipcode"` and `z."state_name"` since these columns are defined with quotes and are case-sensitive.

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT z."state_name"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA."POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010" p
JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US."ZIPCODE_AREA" z
  ON p.ZIPCODE = z."zipcode"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **`p.ZIPCODE`:**
  - References the `ZIPCODE` column in the `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` table.
  - Since `ZIPCODE` is likely an **unquoted identifier**, it is stored in uppercase. Use it without quotes.

- **`z."zipcode"`:**
  - References the `"zipcode"` column in the `ZIPCODE_AREA` table.
  - As a **quoted identifier**, it is case-sensitive and must match exactly.

---

**Additional Information:**

- **Why This Works:**
  - By correctly referencing the columns based on how they were defined, Snowflake can identify them without issues.
  - This addresses the error where Snowflake couldn't find `p."zipcode"` because it doesn't exist in `p`.

- **Case Sensitivity Rules in Snowflake:**
  - **Unquoted Identifiers:**
    - Automatically uppercased and case-insensitive.
    - `p.ZIPCODE`, `p.zipcode`, and `p.ZipCode` all refer to `ZIPCODE` in `p`.
  - **Quoted Identifiers:**
    - Case-sensitive and must match exactly.
    - `z."zipcode"` refers specifically to the lowercase `"zipcode"` in `z`.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:**
  - Execute the corrected SQL query to retrieve the state names.
  - It should execute without errors and return the desired results.

---

**Example Execution:**

Running the corrected query should yield results similar to:

```plaintext
state_name
------------
California
Texas
Florida
New York
Illinois
...
```

These are the state names corresponding to ZIP codes found in both the `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` and `ZIPCODE_AREA` tables.

---

**Final Note:**

- **Consistency is Key:**
  - When working with databases that have a mix of quoted and unquoted identifiers, always ensure that you reference columns and tables using the correct case sensitivity rules.
  - This practice will help you avoid similar errors in the future.

2025-01-24 22:06:16 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
invalid identifier 'DRIVER_DISTRACTED_BY_NAME'
```

indicates that Snowflake cannot find the column `DRIVER_DISTRACTED_BY_NAME` in the `DISTRACT_2015` table. This issue arises due to **case sensitivity** and the use of **quoted identifiers** in Snowflake.

---

**Understanding the Issue:**

1. **Case Sensitivity in Snowflake:**

   - **Unquoted Identifiers:**
     - Treated as **uppercase** by default.
     - When you use unquoted identifiers (without double quotes), Snowflake automatically converts them to uppercase.
     - For example, `DRIVER_DISTRACTED_BY_NAME` without quotes refers to a column named `DRIVER_DISTRACTED_BY_NAME` (all uppercase).

   - **Quoted Identifiers:**
     - Case-sensitive and must match the exact case used when the column was created.
     - If a column was created with lowercase letters and enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"driver_distracted_by_name"`), you must reference it exactly as such.

2. **Likely Cause of the Error:**

   - The columns in the `DISTRACT_2015` table are likely defined with **quoted identifiers** and in **lowercase**.
   - By referencing the column as `DRIVER_DISTRACTED_BY_NAME` without quotes, Snowflake looks for an uppercase column name, which does not exist in the table.

---

**Solution:**

To resolve the error, you need to:

- **Use double quotes around column names.**
- **Match the exact case** of the column names as they are defined in the table schema.

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "driver_distracted_by_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "incident_count"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES."DISTRACT_2015"
GROUP BY "driver_distracted_by_name"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Column Names:**
  - Enclosed `"driver_distracted_by_name"` and `"consecutive_number"` in double quotes.
  - Matched the exact case (lowercase) as defined in the table.

- **Table Name:**
  - Kept `"DISTRACT_2015"` in double quotes. If the table was created with quotes and uppercase letters, this is acceptable.
  - Ensure consistency in quoting and casing throughout the query.

---

**Additional Information:**

- **Verify Column Names and Cases:**
  - You can check the exact column names and their cases using the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` view:

    ```sql
    SELECT "column_name"
    FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    WHERE "table_schema" = 'NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES'
      AND "table_name" = 'DISTRACT_2015';
    ```

- **Consistency in Queries:**
  - Always use double quotes and the exact case when referencing columns and tables defined with quoted identifiers.
  - This practice ensures that Snowflake can accurately identify the objects you're referencing.

- **Understanding Identifiers:**

  - **Unquoted Identifiers:**
    - Use when columns and tables were created without quotes.
    - Snowflake treats them as uppercase.
    - Example: `COLUMN_NAME`

  - **Quoted Identifiers:**
    - Use when columns and tables were created with quotes and are case-sensitive.
    - Must match the exact case.
    - Example: `"column_name"`

---

**Final Note:**

By adjusting your query to use double quotes and the exact case for the column names, your query should execute successfully and return the desired results.

---

**Example Execution:**

Executing the corrected query should produce results similar to:

```plaintext

2025-01-24 22:07:39 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error occurs because Snowflake is case-sensitive when using quoted identifiers. In your query, you have enclosed the column names in double quotes and used uppercase letters:

```sql
"DRIVER_DISTRACTED_BY_NAME"
```

If the columns were created with lowercase names (as indicated by the DDL you provided earlier), you need to reference them using the exact case.

In the `DISTRACT_2015` table, the columns are defined in **lowercase** and enclosed in double quotes, like this:

```sql
"driver_distracted_by_name" VARCHAR(16777216),
"consecutive_number" NUMBER(38,0),
...
```

When you enclose identifiers in double quotes in Snowflake, they become case-sensitive and must match exactly how they were defined. Therefore, you should adjust your query to use the correct lowercase column names.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "driver_distracted_by_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "incident_count"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES."DISTRACT_2015"
GROUP BY "driver_distracted_by_name"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Why This Works:**

- **Column Names:**
  - `"driver_distracted_by_name"`: Matches the exact case as defined in the table.
  - `"consecutive_number"`: Also matches the exact case.

- **Case Sensitivity with Quoted Identifiers:**
  - Quoted identifiers are case-sensitive in Snowflake.
  - If you use uppercase letters inside quotes, Snowflake will look for columns defined with uppercase letters.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Mixing Cases:** Ensure that all your column references match the case used in the table definitions.

- **Using Unquoted Identifiers (Alternative):**
  - If you prefer not to worry about case sensitivity, you can use unquoted identifiers and write the column names in uppercase or lowercase without quotes.
  - However, this only works if the columns were created without quotes.

- **Example Using Unquoted Identifiers (If Columns Were Created Unquoted):**

  ```sql
  SELECT driver_distracted_by_name, COUNT(DISTINCT consecutive_number) AS incident_count
  FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015
  GROUP BY driver_distracted_by_name
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

  - **Note:** This will only work if the columns were created without quotes (as unquoted identifiers).

**Recommendation:**

- Since your columns are defined with quotes and in lowercase, always reference them exactly as they are defined.
- Use double quotes and match the case for both column names and table names when they were created with quotes.

**Example Execution:**

Running the corrected query should produce results like:

```plaintext
driver_distracted_by_name                            | incident_count
-----------------------------------------------------+----------------

```

*(Note: The incident counts are illustrative.)*

**Summary:**

- The error was caused by referencing column names with incorrect case inside double quotes.
- To fix the error, use double quotes and match the exact lowercase column names as defined in the table schema.
- Always ensure consistency in your use of quotes and cases when writing SQL queries in Snowflake.

2025-01-24 22:08:17 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error message you're encountering:

```
SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected '"DRIVER_DISTRACTED_BY_NAME"'.
```

indicates that the SQL parser encountered an unexpected quoted identifier at the very **beginning** of your query. This suggests there may be a syntax error right at the start, possibly due to an extra or misplaced quotation mark.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Extra Quotation Mark at the Start:**

   - If there's an unintended double quote (`"`) before the `SELECT` keyword, the parser will misinterpret the query.
   - For example, if your query starts with `"SELECT"` instead of `SELECT`, it can cause this error.

2. **Incorrect Use of Quoted Identifiers:**

   - In Snowflake, when you use double-quoted identifiers, they are **case-sensitive** and must match the exact case used when the table or column was created.
   - If your columns are defined in **lowercase** (as per the DDL), referencing them in **uppercase** within double quotes will cause an `invalid identifier` error.

**How to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Check for Extra Quotation Marks:**

   - Ensure that there is **no extra double quote** at the beginning of your query.
   - The query should start with the `SELECT` keyword without any preceding quotes.

2. **Match the Exact Case for Quoted Identifiers:**

   - Since your columns are defined in **lowercase** and within double quotes, you must reference them exactly as they are defined.
   - Replace `"DRIVER_DISTRACTED_BY_NAME"` with `"driver_distracted_by_name"`.
   - Replace `"CONSECUTIVE_NUMBER"` with `"consecutive_number"`.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "driver_distracted_by_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "incident_count"
FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES."DISTRACT_2015"
GROUP BY "driver_distracted_by_name"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Removed Extra Quotation Marks:**

  - Ensured there are no extra quotes at the beginning of the query.
  - The query starts with `SELECT`, not `"SELECT"`.

- **Matched Case for Column Names:**

  - Changed `"DRIVER_DISTRACTED_BY_NAME"` to `"driver_distracted_by_name"`.
  - Changed `"CONSECUTIVE_NUMBER"` to `"consecutive_number"`.
  - In Snowflake, quoted identifiers are case-sensitive.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Consistency with Quoted Identifiers:**

  - Always use the exact case for column and table names when using quoted identifiers.
  - If your table names are also in lowercase and quoted, ensure you're matching them exactly.

- **Check for Hidden Characters:**

  - Sometimes, copying and pasting can introduce invisible characters.
  - Retype the query manually to eliminate any hidden formatting issues.

- **Verify Column Names:**

  - Use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` view to confirm the exact column names and their cases.

    ```sql
    SELECT "column_name"
    FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    WHERE "table_schema" = 'NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES'
      AND "table_name" = 'DISTRACT_2015';
    ```

**Example Execution:**

After applying the corrections, running the query should provide results similar to:

```plaintext

*(Note: The incident counts are illustrative.)*

**Summary:**

- **Cause of Error:** The SQL parser encountered an unexpected quoted identifier at the start due to an extra quotation mark or incorrect casing in the quoted identifier.
- **Solution:** Ensure there's no extra quotation at the beginning and match the exact case for quoted identifiers.
- **Key Takeaway:** In Snowflake, when using quoted identifiers, they are case-sensitive and must match exactly as defined.

**Final Note:**

By adjusting your query as shown, you should be able to execute it successfully and retrieve the desired data. If you continue to experience issues, double-check the entire query for any unintentional characters or syntax errors.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to identify the relevant tables, columns, and conditions.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Tables:**
   - `DISTRACT_2015` and `DISTRACT_2016` in the `NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES` schema: Contain data on driver distraction incidents for the years 2015 and 2016.
   - `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010` in the `CENSUS_BUREAU_USA` schema: Contains population data by ZIP code from the 2010 census.
   - `ZIPCODE_AREA` in the `UTILITY_US` schema: Contains mapping of ZIP codes to state names.

2. **Columns and Potential Usage:**

   - **From `DISTRACT_2015` and `DISTRACT_2016`:**
     - `"state_number"`: Numeric code representing the state; used to group accidents by state.
     - `"state_name"`: Name of the state; used for reporting and grouping.
     - `"consecutive_number"`: Unique identifier for each accident; used to count distinct accidents.
     - `"driver_distracted_by_name"`: Describes the distraction status of the driver; used to filter out 'Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', and 'Not Reported'.

   - **From `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`:**
     - `"zipcode"`: ZIP code; used to join with `ZIPCODE_AREA` to get state information.
     - `"population"`: Population count for each ZIP code; used to calculate total population per state.

   - **From `ZIPCODE_AREA`:**
     - `"zipcode"`: ZIP code; used to join with `POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010`.
     - `"state_name"`: Name of the state; used to group population data by state.

**Conditions to be Used:**

- Filter out records where `"driver_distracted_by_name"` is 'Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', or 'Not Reported'.
- Group data by `"state_name"` to calculate accidents and populations per state.
- Focus on data for the years 2015 and 2016.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct distraction statuses recorded in 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "driver_distracted_by_name"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the number of accidents per state in 2015 due to driver distraction (excluding certain statuses):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "consecutive_number") AS "accident_count"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.DISTRACT_2015
   WHERE "driver_distracted_by_name" NOT IN ('Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', 'Not Reported')
   GROUP BY "state_name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List population data by ZIP code from the 2010 census:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "zipcode", "population"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010

   JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z
     ON p."zipcode" = z."zipcode"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate the total population per state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT z."state_name", SUM(p."population") AS "state_population"
   FROM NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.CENSUS_BUREAU_USA.POPULATION_BY_ZIP_2010 p
   JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES_PLUS.UTILITY_US.ZIPCODE_AREA z

Task: How many traffic accidents per 100,000 people, specifically due to driver distraction, were recorded in each state in the years 2015 and 2016? Identify the top five states each year with the highest rates. Exclude accidents where the distraction status of the driver was recorded as 'Not Distracted,' 'Unknown if Distracted,' or 'Not Reported.' Use state population data from the 2010 census for calculating the rate.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the data, the top five states each year with the highest number of traffic accidents due to driver distraction per 100,000 people are as follows:

```csv
Year,State,Accidents_per_100000_people
2015,state_name1:str,rate1:float
2015,state_name2:str,rate2:float
2015,state_name3:str,rate3:float
2015,state_name4:str,rate4:float
2015,state_name5:str,rate5:float
2016,state_name1:str,rate1:float
2016,state_name2:str,rate2:float
2016,state_name3:str,rate3:float
2016,state_name4:str,rate4:float
2016,state_name5:str,rate5:float
(Attention: answer in five rows for each year)
```

**Explanation:**
The table lists the top five states for each year, 2015 and 2016, ranked by the number of traffic accidents per 100,000 people that were specifically due to driver distraction. The rates are calculated using state population data from the 2010 census. Accidents where the driver's distraction status was 'Not Distracted', 'Unknown if Distracted', or 'Not Reported' have been excluded to focus on confirmed cases of driver distraction..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
