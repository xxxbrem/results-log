After comparing both SQL scripts and their results, I conclude that **`0result.sql`** is the correct script for accurately calculating the number of traffic accidents due to driver distraction per 100,000 people in each state for the years 2015 and 2016. Here are the reasons:

1. **Accurate Mapping Using State Numbers:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses `"state_number"` derived from the `"state_fips_code"` in the `US_STATES_AREA` table to map state populations accurately. This ensures a reliable join between accident data and population data.
   - **`1result.sql`** relies on `"state_name"` from different tables, which may have inconsistencies due to variations in naming conventions (e.g., abbreviations, casing). This can lead to incorrect or missing matches when joining data.

2. **Correct Grouping by Year:**
   - **`0result.sql`** groups accidents by `"state_number"`, `"state_name"`, and the actual `"year_of_crash"` from the data, ensuring that the accident counts are correctly attributed to each year.
   - **`1result.sql`** assigns the year as a hardcoded string ('2015' or '2016') in the `SELECT` clause, which may not accurately reflect the actual year of each accident in the data.

3. **Distinct Accident Counts:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses `COUNT(DISTINCT a."consecutive_number")` to count unique accidents, avoiding double-counting in cases where multiple records may exist for a single accident.
   - **`1result.sql`** uses `COUNT(*)`, which counts all rows and may include duplicate entries for the same accident, leading to inflated accident counts.

4. **Reliable Joins Between Tables:**
   - By using numeric state identifiers (`"state_number"`), **`0result.sql`** ensures consistent and reliable joins between the accident data and the population data.
   - **`1result.sql`** joins on `"state_name"`, which can introduce errors due to inconsistencies in state naming across different tables.

5. **Handling of NULL Values:**
   - **`0result.sql`** includes a condition to exclude NULL values in the accident rate calculation, ensuring that only valid rates are considered.
   - It's unclear whether **`1result.sql`** adequately addresses NULL values in the rate calculation.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above reasons, **`0result.sql`** provides a more accurate and reliable calculation of traffic accidents due to driver distraction per 100,000 people, correctly identifies the top five states each year, and aligns better with the task requirements.
