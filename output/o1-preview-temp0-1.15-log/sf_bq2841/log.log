These queries help in understanding the data related to the task:

- Queries 1-3 gather information about the categories and article counts.
- Queries 4-9 focus on articles that mention "education" in the `"body"` or `"title"`.
- Query 10 combines the counts per category for articles mentioning "education".

By analyzing the results of these queries, we can collect the necessary data to compute the breakdown of total articles per category and the percentage of articles mentioning "education" within each category.Query:

Task: Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from BBC News, we present the data in the following table:

```csv
category,total_articles,percentage_mentioning_education
category_name:str,num:int,num:float (0 <= value <= 100)
```

Potential values for `category` include: Business, Technology, Health, Sports, Politics.

**Table Explanation:**

- **category**: The name of each news category.
- **total_articles**: The total number of articles in each category (an integer).
- **percentage_mentioning_education**: The percentage of articles within each category that mention "education" (a float between 0 and 100, with up to four decimal places).

This table provides a concise breakdown of article counts by category and highlights the prevalence of the term "education" within each category..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
Please refrain from adding any conditions that are not explicitly specified in the task.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
Be careful one country may have different names in different columns in a database.
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
Be careful of information in nested JSON columns. e.g.1. When it comes to active users, it refers to has engagement_time_msec parameter rather than directly counting users. So the right query is: SELECT DISTINCT USER_PSEUDO_ID FROM all_user_activity, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => event_params) AS flattened_params WHERE flattened_params.value:key = 'engagement_time_msec'
e.g. When it comes to top-selling product, you should pay attention to hits2.value:"eCommerceAction":"action_type"::INTEGER = 6 where 6 means sold product.
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When counting for rows of a column, ensure they are distinct: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT col_name) FROM table;
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-16 04:21:42 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from BBC News, we present the data in the following table:

```csv
category,total_articles,percentage_mentioning_education
category_name:str,num:int,num:float (0 <= value <= 100)
```

Potential values for `category` include: Business, Technology, Health, Sports, Politics.

**Table Explanation:**

- **category**: The name of each news category.
- **total_articles**: The total number of articles in each category (an integer).
- **percentage_mentioning_education**: The percentage of articles within each category that mention "education" (a float between 0 and 100, with up to four decimal places).

This table provides a concise breakdown of article counts by category and highlights the prevalence of the term "education" within each category. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
