After carefully reviewing and comparing the three SQL scripts and their results, I conclude that **1result.sql** is the correct answer. Here's why:

**1. Alignment with Requirements:**

- **Session Filtering:** All three scripts correctly filter sessions between June 1, 2017, and July 31, 2017, and consider only sessions with non-null pageviews.
- **Session Classification:** In **1result.sql**, sessions are accurately classified as 'purchase' if they have at least one transaction (`totals.transactions >= 1`), and 'non_purchase' otherwise.
- **Aggregation per Visitor per Month:** The script sums each visitor's total pageviews under each classification for each month, as required.
- **Average Computation:** It then computes the average pageviews per visitor for both 'purchase' and 'non_purchase' groups in each month.
- **Result Presentation:** The results are presented side by side, showing the average pageviews for both groups in each month.

**2. Correctness of Data Processing:**

- **Accurate Use of Transactions:** **1result.sql** uses `SAFE_CAST(totals.transactions AS INT64) >= 1` to ensure that sessions with one or more transactions are classified correctly, handling any potential null values safely.
- **Proper Grouping and Aggregation:** It groups data by `fullVisitorId` and `Month` to calculate total pageviews per visitor under each classification, which is essential for accurate average calculations.
- **Handling of Null Values:** The script includes conditions to handle null or zero transactions effectively, ensuring sessions are classified appropriately.

**3. Clarity and Readability:**

- **Structured Approach:** The script uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the query into understandable parts (`session_data`, `visitor_data`, `purchase_stats`, `non_purchase_stats`), which aids in clarity and maintenance.
- **Consistent Date Handling:** It consistently extracts and formats the date to identify the correct month (`'June 2017'` or `'July 2017'`).

**4. Matching Output:**

- The output of **1result.sql** matches the expected results, showing the average pageviews per visitor for both 'purchase' and 'non_purchase' groups in June and July 2017:
  - **June 2017:** Purchase Average Pageviews = 25.7358, Non-Purchase Average Pageviews = 4.0746
  - **July 2017:** Purchase Average Pageviews = 27.7210, Non-Purchase Average Pageviews = 4.1918

**Conclusion:**

Based on the reasons above, **1result.sql** accurately implements the required task, correctly processes the data, and presents the results as specified.
