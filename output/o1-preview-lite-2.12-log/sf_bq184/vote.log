After reviewing and comparing the provided SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the most accurate and appropriate SQL query for computing and comparing the cumulative count of Ethereum smart contracts created by users versus those created by other contracts between 2017 and 2021.

### **Reasoning:**

1. **Correct Identification of Contracts Created by Users:**
   - The query in `0result.sql` accurately identifies contracts created by users (Externally Owned Accounts - EOAs) by selecting transactions from the `TRANSACTIONS` table where the `"to_address"` is `NULL` or empty.
   - It ensures that the `"from_address"` is not a contract by performing a left join with the `CONTRACTS` table on `"from_address"` and filtering out any matches (`c."address" IS NULL`). This excludes transactions initiated by contracts.

2. **Correct Identification of Contracts Created by Other Contracts:**
   - The query correctly identifies contracts created by other contracts by selecting traces from the `TRACES` table where the `"trace_type"` is `'create'`.
   - It joins the `CONTRACTS` table on `"from_address"` to ensure that only traces where the creator (`"from_address"`) is a contract are considered.

3. **Time Frame Filtering:**
   - Both subqueries filter data between `'2017-01-01'` and `'2021-12-31'` by converting the `"block_timestamp"` from microseconds to a date and applying the appropriate date range condition.

4. **Daily Cumulative Tallies:**
   - The query generates a date series covering each day in the specified range.
   - It computes the cumulative counts of contracts created by users and contracts over time using window functions with the `OVER (ORDER BY d."Date")` clause.

5. **Clarity and Efficiency:**
   - The query is structured clearly with common table expressions (CTEs) for better readability and maintenance.
   - It efficiently utilizes joins and window functions to compute the required metrics.

### **Conclusion:**

Considering the above points, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script that fulfills the task requirements by accurately computing and comparing the daily cumulative counts of Ethereum smart contracts created by users versus those created by contracts between 2017 and 2021.
