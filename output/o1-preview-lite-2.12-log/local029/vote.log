The correct SQL is **2result.sql** because it accurately identifies the top three customers with the highest number of delivered orders. It does this by:

1. **Calculating the number of delivered orders per customer**:
   - It joins `olist_orders` and `olist_customers` tables and filters for `order_status = 'delivered'`.
   - It groups by `customer_unique_id` and counts the number of orders to find the top customers.

2. **Retrieving customer information**:
   - It selects the city and state for each of the top customers from `olist_customers`.

3. **Calculating the average payment value for each customer**:
   - It joins `olist_orders`, `olist_customers`, and `olist_order_payments` tables.
   - It filters for the top customers and `order_status = 'delivered'`, then calculates the average `payment_value`.

By combining these steps using Common Table Expressions (CTEs), **2result.sql** ensures that the final result includes the top three customers based on delivered orders, along with their average payment value, city, and state.

In contrast, **0result.sql** does not correctly identify the top customers based on the highest number of delivered orders. It groups by additional fields (`customer_city`, `customer_state`), which may lead to incorrect aggregation and ordering.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

2result.sql
