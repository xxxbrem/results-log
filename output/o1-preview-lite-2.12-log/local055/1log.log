**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all artist names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Name"
   FROM "artists"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all album titles with corresponding artist names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT a."Title" AS "AlbumTitle", ar."Name" AS "ArtistName"
   FROM "albums" a
   JOIN "artists" ar ON a."ArtistId" = ar."ArtistId"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count the number of albums per artist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ar."Name" AS "ArtistName", COUNT(a."AlbumId") AS "AlbumCount"
   FROM "artists" ar
   LEFT JOIN "albums" a ON ar."ArtistId" = a."ArtistId"
   GROUP BY ar."Name"
   ORDER BY "AlbumCount" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List all tracks with album titles and artist names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT t."Name" AS "TrackName", al."Title" AS "AlbumTitle", ar."Name" AS "ArtistName"
   FROM "tracks" t
   JOIN "albums" al ON t."AlbumId" = al."AlbumId"
   JOIN "artists" ar ON al."ArtistId" = ar."ArtistId"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate total sales per track:**
   ```sql
   SELECT t."Name" AS "TrackName", SUM(ii."UnitPrice" * ii."Quantity") AS "TotalSales"
   FROM "tracks" t
   JOIN "invoice_items" ii ON t."TrackId" = ii."TrackId"
   GROUP BY t."TrackId", t."Name"
   ORDER BY "TotalSales" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate total sales per album:**
   ```sql
   SELECT al."Title" AS "AlbumTitle", SUM(ii."UnitPrice" * ii."Quantity") AS "AlbumSales"
   FROM "albums" al
   JOIN "tracks" t ON al."AlbumId" = t."AlbumId"
   JOIN "invoice_items" ii ON t."TrackId" = ii."TrackId"
   GROUP BY al."AlbumId", al."Title"
   ORDER BY "AlbumSales" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate total sales per artist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ar."Name" AS "ArtistName", SUM(ii."UnitPrice" * ii."Quantity") AS "ArtistSales"
   FROM "artists" ar
   JOIN "albums" al ON ar."ArtistId" = al."ArtistId"
   JOIN "tracks" t ON al."AlbumId" = t."AlbumId"
   JOIN "invoice_items" ii ON t."TrackId" = ii."TrackId"
   GROUP BY ar."ArtistId", ar."Name"
   ORDER BY "ArtistSales" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Identify the artist with the highest overall sales (tie broken by alphabetical order):**
   ```sql
   SELECT ar."Name" AS "TopArtist", SUM(ii."UnitPrice" * ii."Quantity") AS "TotalSales"
   FROM "artists" ar
   JOIN "albums" al ON ar."ArtistId" = al."ArtistId"
   JOIN "tracks" t ON al."AlbumId" = t."AlbumId"
   JOIN "invoice_items" ii ON t."TrackId" = ii."TrackId"
   GROUP BY ar."Name"
   ORDER BY "TotalSales" DESC, ar."Name" ASC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

9. **Identify the artist with the lowest overall sales (tie broken by alphabetical order):**
   ```sql
   SELECT ar."Name" AS "LowestArtist", COALESCE(SUM(ii."UnitPrice" * ii."Quantity"), 0) AS "TotalSales"
   FROM "artists" ar
   LEFT JOIN "albums" al ON ar."ArtistId" = al."ArtistId"
   LEFT JOIN "tracks" t ON al."AlbumId" = t."AlbumId"
   LEFT JOIN "invoice_items" ii ON t."TrackId" = ii."TrackId"
   GROUP BY ar."Name"
   ORDER BY "TotalSales" ASC, ar."Name" ASC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

10. **Calculate the amount each customer spent on the top-selling artist's albums:**
    (Assuming the top-selling artist's `ArtistId` is known from query 8.)

    ```sql
    SELECT c."CustomerId", c."FirstName", c."LastName", SUM(ii."UnitPrice" * ii."Quantity") AS "TotalSpent"
    FROM "customers" c
    JOIN "invoices" inv ON c."CustomerId" = inv."CustomerId"

    WHERE al."ArtistId" = (SELECT ar."ArtistId" FROM "artists" ar JOIN "albums" al ON ar."ArtistId" = al."ArtistId" JOIN "tracks" t ON al."AlbumId" = t."AlbumId" JOIN "invoice_items" ii ON t."TrackId" = ii."TrackId" GROUP BY ar."ArtistId" ORDER BY SUM(ii."UnitPrice" * ii."Quantity") DESC, ar."Name" ASC LIMIT 1)
    GROUP BY c."CustomerId", c."FirstName", c."LastName"
    ORDER BY "TotalSpent" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Calculate average spending for customers who purchased from the top-selling artist:**
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG("TotalSpent") AS "AverageSpending"
    FROM (
      SELECT c."CustomerId", SUM(ii."UnitPrice" * ii."Quantity") AS "TotalSpent"
      FROM "customers" c

      GROUP BY c."CustomerId"
    ) sub;
    ```

12. **Calculate average spending for customers who purchased from the lowest-selling artist:**
    ```sql

Task: Identify the artist with the highest overall sales of albums (tie broken by alphabetical order) and the artist with the lowest overall sales of albums (tie broken by alphabetical order), then calculate the amount each customer spent specifically on those two artists’ albums. Next, compute the average spending for the customers who purchased from the top-selling artist and the average spending for the customers who purchased from the lowest-selling artist, and finally return the absolute difference between these two averages.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
difference
5.88
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The absolute difference between the average spending of customers who purchased albums from the top-selling artist (Iron Maiden) and the lowest-selling artist (Aaron Copland & London Symphony Orchestra) is \$5.88..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['albums', 'sqlite_sequence', 'artists', 'customers', 'employees', 'genres', 'invoices', 'invoice_items', 'media_types', 'playlists', 'playlist_track', 'tracks', 'sqlite_stat1']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
