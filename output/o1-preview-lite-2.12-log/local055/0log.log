  - `"AlbumId"`: Unique identifier for each album. Used to link albums to tracks.
  - `"ArtistId"`: Identifies the artist who created the album. Used to link albums to their artists.

- **tracks**
  - `"TrackId"`: Unique identifier for each track. Used to link tracks to invoice items.
  - `"AlbumId"`: Identifies the album that the track belongs to. Used to link tracks to their albums.
  - `"UnitPrice"`: Price of the track. Used to calculate sales amounts.

- **invoice_items**
  - `"InvoiceLineId"`: Unique identifier for each invoice item.
  - `"InvoiceId"`: Identifies the invoice associated with the invoice item. Used to link invoice items to invoices.
  - `"TrackId"`: Identifies the track sold. Used to link invoice items to tracks.
  - `"UnitPrice"`: Price of the track at the time of purchase. Used to calculate sales amounts.
  - `"Quantity"`: Quantity purchased. Used to calculate total sales per item.

- **invoices**

  - `"CustomerId"`: Identifies the customer who made the purchase. Used to link invoices to customers.

- **customers**
  - `"CustomerId"`: Unique identifier for each customer.
  - `"FirstName"` and `"LastName"`: Used to identify customers.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Joining tables on common keys to relate artists to albums, albums to tracks, tracks to invoice items, and invoice items to invoices/customers.
- Filtering data to include only sales related to the top-selling and lowest-selling artists.
- Calculating total sales by summing up the `"UnitPrice"` multiplied by `"Quantity"`.
- Using `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses to aggregate and sort data.
- Applying `DISTINCT` to find unique customers or artists.
- Using tie-breakers by applying alphabetical order on artist names in case of equal sales.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List all artists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Name" FROM "artists" ORDER BY "Name" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the number of albums per artist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ArtistId", COUNT("AlbumId") AS AlbumCount FROM "albums" GROUP BY "ArtistId" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all albums with their artists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "a"."Title", "ar"."Name" FROM "albums" AS "a"
   JOIN "artists" AS "ar" ON "a"."ArtistId" = "ar"."ArtistId"
   ORDER BY "ar"."Name" LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List all tracks with their album and artist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "t"."Name" AS TrackName, "al"."Title" AS AlbumTitle, "ar"."Name" AS ArtistName
   FROM "tracks" AS "t"
   JOIN "albums" AS "al" ON "t"."AlbumId" = "al"."AlbumId"
   JOIN "artists" AS "ar" ON "al"."ArtistId" = "ar"."ArtistId"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate total sales per track:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ii"."TrackId", SUM("ii"."UnitPrice" * "ii"."Quantity") AS TotalSales
   FROM "invoice_items" AS "ii"
   GROUP BY "ii"."TrackId" LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate total sales per artist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ar"."ArtistId", "ar"."Name", SUM("ii"."UnitPrice" * "ii"."Quantity") AS TotalSales
   FROM "invoice_items" AS "ii"
   JOIN "tracks" AS "t" ON "ii"."TrackId" = "t"."TrackId"
   JOIN "albums" AS "al" ON "t"."AlbumId" = "al"."AlbumId"
   JOIN "artists" AS "ar" ON "al"."ArtistId" = "ar"."ArtistId"
   GROUP BY "ar"."ArtistId", "ar"."Name"
   ORDER BY TotalSales DESC LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Identify the artist with the highest total sales:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ar"."Name", SUM("ii"."UnitPrice" * "ii"."Quantity") AS TotalSales
   FROM "invoice_items" AS "ii"
   JOIN "tracks" AS "t" ON "ii"."TrackId" = "t"."TrackId"
   JOIN "albums" AS "al" ON "t"."AlbumId" = "al"."AlbumId"
   JOIN "artists" AS "ar" ON "al"."ArtistId" = "ar"."ArtistId"
   GROUP BY "ar"."Name"
   ORDER BY TotalSales DESC, "ar"."Name" ASC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

8. **Identify the artist with the lowest total sales:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ar"."Name", SUM("ii"."UnitPrice" * "ii"."Quantity") AS TotalSales
   FROM "invoice_items" AS "ii"
   JOIN "tracks" AS "t" ON "ii"."TrackId" = "t"."TrackId"
   JOIN "albums" AS "al" ON "t"."AlbumId" = "al"."AlbumId"
   JOIN "artists" AS "ar" ON "al"."ArtistId" = "ar"."ArtistId"
   GROUP BY "ar"."Name"
   ORDER BY TotalSales ASC, "ar"."Name" ASC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

9. **Calculate the amount each customer spent on the top-selling artist's albums:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "c"."CustomerId", SUM("ii"."UnitPrice" * "ii"."Quantity") AS TotalSpent
   FROM "customers" AS "c"
   JOIN "invoices" AS "i" ON "c"."CustomerId" = "i"."CustomerId"
   JOIN "invoice_items" AS "ii" ON "i"."InvoiceId" = "ii"."InvoiceId"

       ORDER BY TotalSales DESC, "ar"."Name" ASC
       LIMIT 1
   ))
   GROUP BY "c"."CustomerId" LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Compute the average spending for customers who purchased from the top-selling artist:**
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG("TotalSpent") AS AverageSpending
    FROM (
        SELECT "c"."CustomerId", SUM("ii"."UnitPrice" * "ii"."Quantity") AS TotalSpent
        FROM "customers" AS "c"
        JOIN "invoices" AS "i" ON "c"."CustomerId" = "i"."CustomerId"
        JOIN "invoice_items" AS "ii" ON "i"."InvoiceId" = "ii"."InvoiceId"
        JOIN "tracks" AS "t" ON "ii"."TrackId" = "t"."TrackId"
        JOIN "albums" AS "al" ON "t"."AlbumId" = "al"."AlbumId"
        JOIN "artists" AS "ar" ON "al"."ArtistId" = "ar"."ArtistId"
        WHERE "ar"."Name" = (SELECT "Name" FROM (
            SELECT "ar"."Name", SUM("ii"."UnitPrice" * "ii"."Quantity") AS TotalSales
            FROM "invoice_items" AS "ii"
            JOIN "tracks" AS "t" ON "ii"."TrackId" = "t"."TrackId"
            JOIN "albums" AS "al" ON "t"."AlbumId" = "al"."AlbumId"
            JOIN "artists" AS "ar" ON "al"."ArtistId" = "ar"."ArtistId"
            GROUP BY "ar"."Name"
            ORDER BY TotalSales DESC, "ar"."Name" ASC
            LIMIT 1
        ))
        GROUP BY "c"."CustomerId"
    );
    ```

**Explanation:**

- Queries 1-4 are used to explore the basic data in the `artists`, `albums`, `tracks`, and their relationships.
- Query 5 calculates the total sales for each track.
- Queries 6-8 calculate the total sales for each artist and identify the top-selling and lowest-selling artists, considering the tie-breaker of alphabetical order.
- Queries 9 and 10 calculate the amount spent by each customer on the top-selling artist's albums and compute the average spending.

By executing these queries, we can understand the data and obtain the necessary information to solve the task.Query:

Answer:

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Identify the artist with the highest overall sales of albums (tie broken by alphabetical order) and the artist with the lowest overall sales of albums (tie broken by alphabetical order), then calculate the amount each customer spent specifically on those two artists’ albums. Next, compute the average spending for the customers who purchased from the top-selling artist and the average spending for the customers who purchased from the lowest-selling artist, and finally return the absolute difference between these two averages.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
difference
5.88
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The absolute difference between the average spending of customers who purchased albums from the top-selling artist (Iron Maiden) and the lowest-selling artist (Aaron Copland & London Symphony Orchestra) is \$5.88..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['albums', 'sqlite_sequence', 'artists', 'customers', 'employees', 'genres', 'invoices', 'invoice_items', 'media_types', 'playlists', 'playlist_track', 'tracks', 'sqlite_stat1']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 11:20:31 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Identify the artist with the highest overall sales of albums (tie broken by alphabetical order) and the artist with the lowest overall sales of albums (tie broken by alphabetical order), then calculate the amount each customer spent specifically on those two artists’ albums. Next, compute the average spending for the customers who purchased from the top-selling artist and the average spending for the customers who purchased from the lowest-selling artist, and finally return the absolute difference between these two averages., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
difference
5.88
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The absolute difference between the average spending of customers who purchased albums from the top-selling artist (Iron Maiden) and the lowest-selling artist (Aaron Copland & London Symphony Orchestra) is \$5.88. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
