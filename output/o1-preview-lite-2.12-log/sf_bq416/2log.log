External knowledge that might be helpful: 
In this guide, you will learn how to work with blockchain data, specifically focusing on address transformations and how to represent TRON blockchain addresses. We will also introduce some key concepts related to JavaScript functions that you may need to apply when working with such data in your queries.

TRON Addresses and Base58 Encoding
TRON addresses use a specialized format that differs from Ethereum addresses, though they are closely related. The conversion of an Ethereum-like address (hexadecimal) to a TRON address (Base58 format) involves several key steps:

Hexadecimal to Byte Array Conversion:
Blockchain addresses are commonly represented in hexadecimal form (prefixed with 0x). These hex strings must be converted into byte arrays for further processing. In JavaScript, this can be done using libraries such as ethers.js.

Checksum Calculation Using SHA-256:
A checksum ensures the integrity of the address. For TRON, the address bytes undergo two rounds of SHA-256 hashing. Only the first 4 bytes of the second hash are retained as the checksum.

Base58 Encoding:
Once the checksum is generated, the byte array (composed of the address bytes followed by the checksum) is encoded using Base58. This encoding method is commonly used in blockchain systems to make the addresses shorter and more readable.

Final Address Format:
After the conversion process, you will get the final TRON address, which can be used in TRON blockchain queries.

JavaScript Functions for Address Conversion
When working with blockchain data in SQL, it's important to understand how JavaScript functions can be used within SQL queries to handle custom transformations like address conversions. In this case, the function hexToTron can be used to convert a standard Ethereum-like hex address into a TRON-compatible format.

Here’s an outline of how this function works:

encode58(buffer): This function converts a byte array into a Base58 string. It uses an alphabet of characters commonly used in TRON and Bitcoin addresses.
sha256(msgBytes): This function computes the SHA-256 hash of the input byte array. It uses the ethers.js library to perform the hashing operation and returns the resulting byte array.
Checksum and Final Address: The function then appends the checksum to the address bytes, and finally encodes everything using Base58 to produce the TRON address.
These steps are essential when querying TRON blockchain data, as addresses must be transformed into the correct format for the blockchain to recognize them.

Task: Could you retrieve the top three largest USDT transfers on the TRON blockchain by listing the block numbers, source addresses, destination addresses (in TronLink format), and transfer amounts, using the USDT contract address '0xa614f803b6fd780986a42c78ec9c7f77e6ded13c' and the transfer event signature '0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef', dividing the raw transfer value by 1,000,000 to convert it into the final USDT amount, and then ordering the results by the largest transferred amounts first?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Block_number,Source_address,Destination_address,Transfer_amount
block_number1:int,source_address1:str,destination_address1:str,transfer_amount1:float
block_number2:int,source_address2:str,destination_address2:str,transfer_amount2:float
block_number3:int,source_address3:str,destination_address3:str,transfer_amount3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

The table above lists the **top three largest USDT transfers on the TRON blockchain**. It includes the block numbers, source addresses, destination addresses (in TronLink format), and the transfer amounts (converted to the final USDT amount by dividing the raw value by 1,000,000). The results are ordered by the largest transferred amounts first..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'GOOG_BLOCKCHAIN': {'GOOG_BLOCKCHAIN_ARBITRUM_ONE_US': ['LOGS', 'DECODED_EVENTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-12 00:59:05 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you retrieve the top three largest USDT transfers on the TRON blockchain by listing the block numbers, source addresses, destination addresses (in TronLink format), and transfer amounts, using the USDT contract address '0xa614f803b6fd780986a42c78ec9c7f77e6ded13c' and the transfer event signature '0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef', dividing the raw transfer value by 1,000,000 to convert it into the final USDT amount, and then ordering the results by the largest transferred amounts first?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Block_number,Source_address,Destination_address,Transfer_amount
block_number1:int,source_address1:str,destination_address1:str,transfer_amount1:float
block_number2:int,source_address2:str,destination_address2:str,transfer_amount2:float
block_number3:int,source_address3:str,destination_address3:str,transfer_amount3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

The table above lists the **top three largest USDT transfers on the TRON blockchain**. It includes the block numbers, source addresses, destination addresses (in TronLink format), and the transfer amounts (converted to the final USDT amount by dividing the raw value by 1,000,000). The results are ordered by the largest transferred amounts first. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
