After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, we can conclude the following:

1. **Result Comparison:**
   - All three SQL queries (`0result.sql`, `1result.sql`, and `2result.sql`) produce the same result: the approved symbol **BCAP31**.
   - This indicates that all queries correctly identify the target whose association score with psoriasis is closest to the mean score.

2. **SQL Query Evaluation:**
   - **`0result.sql`:** This query is concise and straightforward. It directly computes the average score within the `ORDER BY` clause and selects the approved symbol with the minimal absolute difference from the mean.
   - **`1result.sql`:** This query employs multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to compute the average score, calculate score differences, find the minimum difference, and then retrieve the target(s) with that minimum difference. While thorough, it is more complex than necessary for this task.
   - **`2result.sql`:** This query uses a CTE to calculate the mean score and then performs a `CROSS JOIN` to use the mean score in the `ORDER BY` clause. It is a valid approach but introduces additional complexity.

3. **Reason for Selection:**
   - **Simplicity and Efficiency:** `0result.sql` achieves the desired result using a simple and efficient query without unnecessary complexity.
   - **Readability:** The query is easy to read and understand, making it preferable for maintenance and future reference.
   - **Performance:** By avoiding additional joins and CTEs, `0result.sql` may offer better performance, especially on larger datasets.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

0result.sql
