Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns and understand how they relate to each other. Here are the tables and columns involved, along with their potential usage and conditions:

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`packaging`**
   - **`id`**: Unique identifier for each packaging item.
     - *Usage*: Used to reference packaging items in relationships.
   - **`name`**: Name of the packaging item.
     - *Usage*: For understanding or displaying the packaging item names.

2. **`packaging_relations`**
   - **`packaging_id`**: The `id` of a packaging item that contains other items.
     - *Usage*: Indicates the parent packaging in the relationship.
   - **`contains_id`**: The `id` of a packaging item that is contained within another packaging.
     - *Usage*: Indicates the child packaging in the relationship.
   - **`qty`**: The quantity of the `contains_id` item within the `packaging_id` item.
     - *Usage*: Quantity of the contained items.
   - *Conditions*:
     - To find top-level packaging items: packaging items that are not contained within any other packaging (`packaging.id` not in `packaging_relations.contains_id`).
     - To find leaf-level items: packaging items that do not contain any other items (`packaging.id` not in `packaging_relations.packaging_id`).

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List all distinct packaging item IDs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "id"
   FROM "packaging"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all distinct packaging item names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name"
   FROM "packaging"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Show all packaging relationships (parent-child pairs with quantities):**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "packaging_id", "contains_id", "qty"
   FROM "packaging_relations"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Identify top-level packaging items (not contained in any other packaging):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name"
   FROM "packaging"
   WHERE "id" NOT IN (
     SELECT "contains_id" FROM "packaging_relations"
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Identify leaf-level packaging items (do not contain other items):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name"
   FROM "packaging"
   WHERE "id" NOT IN (
     SELECT "packaging_id" FROM "packaging_relations"
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List packaging items along with the number of times they are contained in other packagings:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "p"."id", "p"."name", COUNT("pr"."packaging_id") AS "times_contained_in"
   FROM "packaging" AS "p"
   LEFT JOIN "packaging_relations" AS "pr" ON "p"."id" = "pr"."contains_id"
   GROUP BY "p"."id", "p"."name"
   ORDER BY "times_contained_in" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List packaging items along with the number of items they contain:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "p"."id", "p"."name", COUNT("pr"."contains_id") AS "number_of_items_contained"
   FROM "packaging" AS "p"
   LEFT JOIN "packaging_relations" AS "pr" ON "p"."id" = "pr"."packaging_id"
   GROUP BY "p"."id", "p"."name"
   ORDER BY "number_of_items_contained" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Show packaging relationships where the quantity is greater than 1:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "packaging_id", "contains_id", "qty"
   FROM "packaging_relations"
   WHERE "qty" > 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List all parent packaging items with their immediate child items and quantities:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "p"."name" AS "Parent_Package", "c"."name" AS "Contained_Item", "pr"."qty"
   FROM "packaging" AS "p"
   JOIN "packaging_relations" AS "pr" ON "p"."id" = "pr"."packaging_id"
   JOIN "packaging" AS "c" ON "pr"."contains_id" = "c"."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List packaging items that directly contain leaf-level items:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "p"."name" AS "Parent_Package", "c"."name" AS "Leaf_Item", "pr"."qty"
    FROM "packaging" AS "p"
    JOIN "packaging_relations" AS "pr" ON "p"."id" = "pr"."packaging_id"
    JOIN "packaging" AS "c" ON "pr"."contains_id" = "c"."id"
    WHERE "c"."id" NOT IN (
      SELECT "packaging_id" FROM "packaging_relations"
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Find the total immediate quantity of items contained within each packaging:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "packaging_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty"
    FROM "packaging_relations"
    GROUP BY "packaging_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **List top-level packaging items with their immediate contents:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "p"."id", "p"."name", "c"."name" AS "Contained_Item", "pr"."qty"
    FROM "packaging" AS "p"
    JOIN "packaging_relations" AS "pr" ON "p"."id" = "pr"."packaging_id"
    JOIN "packaging" AS "c" ON "pr"."contains_id" = "c"."id"
    WHERE "p"."id" NOT IN (
      SELECT "contains_id" FROM "packaging_relations"
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Identify all leaf-level packaging items:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "name"
    FROM "packaging"
    WHERE "id" NOT IN (
      SELECT "packaging_id" FROM "packaging_relations"
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List packaging items that are both parents and children in packaging relationships:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "id", "name"
    FROM "packaging"
    WHERE "id" IN (SELECT "packaging_id" FROM "packaging_relations")
      AND "id" IN (SELECT "contains_id" FROM "packaging_relations")
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Show parent packaging items with their child items and indicate if the child is a leaf item:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "p"."name" AS "Parent_Package", "c"."name" AS "Contained_Item", "pr"."qty",
       CASE
         WHEN "c"."id" IN (SELECT "packaging_id" FROM "packaging_relations") THEN 'No'
         ELSE 'Yes'
       END AS "Is_Leaf"
    FROM "packaging" AS "p"
    JOIN "packaging_relations" AS "pr" ON "p"."id" = "pr"."packaging_id"
    JOIN "packaging" AS "c" ON "pr"."contains_id" = "c"."id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help us understand the structure of the packaging items and their relationships. They identify top-level packaging items, leaf-level items, and how packaging items are nested within each other along with their quantities.

You can use these queries to explore the data further and prepare for calculating the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations by fully expanding nested packaging relationships to the leaf-level items.Query:

Task: What is the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering only the leaf-level items within each combination after fully expanding any nested packaging relationships?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
average_total_quantity
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

We calculated the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations by fully expanding any nested packaging relationships to the leaf-level items. For each top-level package (those not contained within any other packages), we recursively summed the quantities of all the leaf-level items contained within. Finally, we computed the average of these total quantities across all top-level packages..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['customers', 'conway_gen_zero', 'web_devices', 'web_demographics', 'channels_dim', 'gender_dim', 'packaging', 'packaging_relations', 'product_groups', 'products', 'monthly_sales', 'breweries', 'purchases', 'product_alcohol', 'customer_favorites', 'customer_reviews', 'locations', 'inventory', 'orders', 'orderlines', 'monthly_budget', 'product_minimums', 'stock', 'ticker', 'web_apps', 'web_pages', 'web_counter_hist', 'server_heartbeat', 'web_page_visits', 'employees', 'emp_hire_periods', 'picking_list', 'picking_line', 'picking_log', 'id_name_type', 'id_name_coll_type', 'id_name_coll_entries', 'favorite_coll_type']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
