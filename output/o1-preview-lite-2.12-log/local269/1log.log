2025-02-11 06:24:22 - root - INFO - Based on the previous context and data, here is an SQL query that calculates the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering only the leaf-level items (products) within each combination after fully expanding any nested packaging relationships:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE packaging_tree(packaging_id, contains_id, total_qty) AS (
    -- Base case: Direct relationships from packaging_relations
    SELECT pr.packaging_id, pr.contains_id, pr.qty
    FROM packaging_relations pr

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive case: Expand nested packaging relationships
    SELECT pt.packaging_id, pr.contains_id, pt.total_qty * pr.qty
    FROM packaging_tree pt
    JOIN packaging_relations pr ON pt.contains_id = pr.packaging_id
)

SELECT AVG(total_quantity) AS average_total_quantity
FROM (
    -- Calculate total quantities of leaf-level items for each top-level packaging
    SELECT pt.packaging_id, SUM(pt.total_qty) AS total_quantity
    FROM packaging_tree pt
    -- Join with products to ensure we only sum quantities of leaf-level items
    JOIN products p ON p.id = pt.contains_id
    -- Exclude packaging contained within other packaging to get top-level packaging
    WHERE pt.packaging_id NOT IN (SELECT contains_id FROM packaging_relations)
    GROUP BY pt.packaging_id
)
```

This query works as follows:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `packaging_tree`:**
   - **Base Case:** Selects all direct relationships from `packaging_relations`.
   - **Recursive Case:** Joins the current level of packaging (`pt.contains_id`) with `packaging_relations` to find nested packaging, multiplying the quantities to account for the nested quantities.
   
2. **Main Query:**
   - Joins `packaging_tree` with `products` to filter out only leaf-level items (actual products).
   - Filters out packaging that is contained within other packaging to focus on top-level packaging combinations.
   - Groups by `packaging_id` to sum the total quantities of leaf-level items within each top-level packaging.
   - Calculates the average of these total quantities.

**Explanation:**

- **Recursive Expansion:** The recursive CTE `packaging_tree` traverses the packaging hierarchy, multiplying quantities at each level to account for nested packaging.
- **Leaf-Level Items:** By joining with the `products` table, we ensure that only quantities of actual products (leaf-level items) are summed.
- **Top-Level Packaging:** The `WHERE` clause filters out any packaging that is contained within other packaging combinations to focus on final packaging combinations.
- **Average Calculation:** Finally, we compute the average of the total quantities across all top-level packaging combinations.

**Note:** This query assumes that the IDs in `packaging_relations.contains_id` can reference both `packaging.id` (for nested packaging) and `products.id` (for leaf-level products).

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **packaging**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for a packaging item.
    - *Potential usage*: To uniquely identify each packaging item.
  - `name`: Name of the packaging item.
    - *Potential usage*: To understand and display the packaging items.

- **packaging_relations**
  - `packaging_id`: The parent packaging item ID.
    - *Potential usage*: Identifies the packaging that contains other items.
  - `contains_id`: ID of the item contained within the parent packaging.
    - *Potential usage*: Identifies the contained item, which could be another packaging item or a product.
  - `qty`: Quantity of the `contains_id` item within the `packaging_id`.
    - *Potential usage*: To calculate the total quantity of items within a packaging.

- **products**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for a product.
    - *Potential usage*: To identify products that are leaf-level items.
  - `name`: Name of the product.
    - *Potential usage*: To understand and display product names.

**Possible Conditions:**

- Identify top-level packaging items (those not contained within any other packaging).
- Identify leaf-level items (products that are not further broken down).
- Traverse the packaging hierarchy to calculate total quantities of leaf-level items within each top-level packaging.
- The `contains_id` in `packaging_relations` can reference either a `packaging.id` (nested packaging) or a `products.id` (leaf-level product).

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all packaging items:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "packaging" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all packaging relations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "packaging_relations" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "products" LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find packaging items that are also products (common IDs in both tables):**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.id, p.name AS packaging_name, pr.name AS product_name
   FROM "packaging" p
   JOIN "products" pr ON p.id = pr.id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find packaging items that are top-level (not contained in any other packaging):**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.*
   FROM "packaging" p
   WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT pr.contains_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find packaging items that are leaf-level (do not contain other items):**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.*
   FROM "packaging" p
   WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT pr.packaging_id FROM "packaging_relations" pr)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find packaging items that contain other packaging items (nested packaging):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p.*
   FROM "packaging" p
   JOIN "packaging_relations" pr ON p.id = pr.packaging_id
   JOIN "packaging" p2 ON pr.contains_id = p2.id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find packaging items that contain products directly:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p.*
   FROM "packaging" p
   JOIN "packaging_relations" pr ON p.id = pr.packaging_id
   JOIN "products" prd ON pr.contains_id = prd.id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List all products contained within top-level packaging items:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT prd.*
   FROM "packaging" p
   JOIN "packaging_relations" pr ON p.id = pr.packaging_id
   JOIN "products" prd ON pr.contains_id = prd.id
   WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT contains_id FROM "packaging_relations")
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find total quantity of products within top-level packaging items:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p.id AS top_packaging_id, p.name AS packaging_name,
           prd.id AS product_id, prd.name AS product_name,
           pr.qty AS quantity
    FROM "packaging" p
    JOIN "packaging_relations" pr ON p.id = pr.packaging_id
    JOIN "products" prd ON pr.contains_id = prd.id
    WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT contains_id FROM "packaging_relations")
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help explore the relationships between packaging and products, identify top-level packaging items, and understand how products are nested within packaging. By analyzing these relationships, we can calculate the total quantities of leaf-level items within each packaging combination.Query:

Task: What is the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering only the leaf-level items within each combination after fully expanding any nested packaging relationships?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
average_total_quantity
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

We calculated the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations by fully expanding any nested packaging relationships to the leaf-level items. For each top-level package (those not contained within any other packages), we recursively summed the quantities of all the leaf-level items contained within. Finally, we computed the average of these total quantities across all top-level packages..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['customers', 'conway_gen_zero', 'web_devices', 'web_demographics', 'channels_dim', 'gender_dim', 'packaging', 'packaging_relations', 'product_groups', 'products', 'monthly_sales', 'breweries', 'purchases', 'product_alcohol', 'customer_favorites', 'customer_reviews', 'locations', 'inventory', 'orders', 'orderlines', 'monthly_budget', 'product_minimums', 'stock', 'ticker', 'web_apps', 'web_pages', 'web_counter_hist', 'server_heartbeat', 'web_page_visits', 'employees', 'emp_hire_periods', 'picking_list', 'picking_line', 'picking_log', 'id_name_type', 'id_name_coll_type', 'id_name_coll_entries', 'favorite_coll_type']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
