After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have chosen `1result.sql` as the correct answer.

**Reason:**
- **Simplicity and Efficiency:** The SQL query in `1result.sql` succinctly and effectively finds the faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks without unnecessary complexity.
- **Clarity:** It uses a straightforward approach by joining the average salaries per rank and selecting faculty members whose salary difference equals the minimum difference within each rank.
- **Accurate Results:** The results produced match the expected faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average for their ranks.
