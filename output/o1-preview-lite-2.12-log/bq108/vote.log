The correct SQL is:

```plaintext
2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

`2result.sql` is the correct query because it accurately reflects the requirements of the task and ensures precise calculations by:

1. **Proper Joins Using Unique Identifiers:**
   - **Joins on both `state_number` and `consecutive_number`:**
     - In the `nhtsa_traffic_fatalities` dataset, accidents may be uniquely identified by both `state_number` and `consecutive_number` together.
     - By joining on both fields, the query ensures that data from the same accident is correctly matched between the `accident_2015` and `person_2015` tables.
   - This prevents any potential mismatches that could occur if only `consecutive_number` were used (as accident numbers may not be unique across different states).

2. **Correct Filtering of Data:**
   - **Accidents from January through August 2015:**
     - The query filters accidents where `month_of_crash BETWEEN 1 AND 8`.
     - It also includes `a.year_of_crash = 2015` to ensure data is from the correct year (though all data in the `accident_2015` table should be from 2015, this adds an extra layer of precision).
   - **Accidents involving more than one person:**
     - The `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p.person_number) > 1` clause ensures only accidents with more than one distinct person are considered.

3. **Accurate Calculation of the Required Percentage:**
   - **Counting Accidents with Multiple Severe Injuries:**
     - Within each accident, it calculates `severe_injuries` by summing cases where `p.injury_severity = 4`.
     - The `COUNTIF(severe_injuries > 1)` counts accidents where more than one person had severe injuries.
   - **Calculating the Percentage:**
     - The query computes the percentage of such accidents out of all accidents involving more than one person between January and August.
     - It uses `(COUNTIF(severe_injuries > 1) / COUNT(*)) * 100` to calculate this percentage.
   - **Rounding for Clarity:**
     - The `ROUND(..., 4)` function rounds the result to four decimal places for readability.

4. **Consistency with the Problem Statement:**
   - The query aligns precisely with the task: finding the percentage of accidents (from January to August 2015, involving more than one person) that had more than one individual with a severe injury (`injury_severity = 4`).

By accurately joining tables, filtering data, and calculating the percentage as per the requirements, `2result.sql` provides the correct and reliable answer.
