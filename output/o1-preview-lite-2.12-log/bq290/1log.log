2025-01-25 05:26:41 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to a data type mismatch in your SQL query.

In the `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2023` table, the `year`, `mo`, and `da` columns are of type **STRING**, not **INT64**.

Therefore, comparing them directly to integer values causes a type mismatch error.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that you're comparing strings to strings.

**Here is the corrected SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT
  gsod.da AS day,
  AVG(CASE WHEN stations.country = 'US' THEN NULLIF(gsod.temp, 9999.9) ELSE NULL END) AS avg_temp_US,
  AVG(CASE WHEN stations.country = 'GB' THEN NULLIF(gsod.temp, 9999.9) ELSE NULL END) AS avg_temp_UK,
  MAX(CASE WHEN stations.country = 'US' THEN NULLIF(gsod.max, 9999.9) ELSE NULL END) AS max_temp_US,
  MAX(CASE WHEN stations.country = 'GB' THEN NULLIF(gsod.max, 9999.9) ELSE NULL END) AS max_temp_UK,
  MIN(CASE WHEN stations.country = 'US' THEN NULLIF(gsod.min, 9999.9) ELSE NULL END) AS min_temp_US,
  MIN(CASE WHEN stations.country = 'GB' THEN NULLIF(gsod.min, 9999.9) ELSE NULL END) AS min_temp_UK,
  (AVG(CASE WHEN stations.country = 'US' THEN NULLIF(gsod.temp, 9999.9) ELSE NULL END) -
   AVG(CASE WHEN stations.country = 'GB' THEN NULLIF(gsod.temp, 9999.9) ELSE NULL END)) AS avg_temp_difference,
  (MAX(CASE WHEN stations.country = 'US' THEN NULLIF(gsod.max, 9999.9) ELSE NULL END) -
   MAX(CASE WHEN stations.country = 'GB' THEN NULLIF(gsod.max, 9999.9) ELSE NULL END)) AS max_temp_difference,
  (MIN(CASE WHEN stations.country = 'US' THEN NULLIF(gsod.min, 9999.9) ELSE NULL END) -
   MIN(CASE WHEN stations.country = 'GB' THEN NULLIF(gsod.min, 9999.9) ELSE NULL END)) AS min_temp_difference
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2023` AS gsod
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS stations
  ON gsod.stn = stations.usaf AND gsod.wban = stations.wban
WHERE gsod.year = '2023' AND gsod.mo = '10'
  AND stations.country IN ('US', 'GB')
  AND gsod.temp != 9999.9
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Data Type Correction:** Changed the comparison of `gsod.year` and `gsod.mo` to use strings `'2023'` and `'10'` instead of integers `2023` and `10`, because these columns are of type **STRING**.
  
- **Removed Unnecessary Casting:** If `gsod.max` and `gsod.min` are already of type **FLOAT64**, there's no need to cast them. Hence, `SAFE_CAST` functions were removed for these columns.
  
- **Handling Missing Values:** Used `NULLIF(gsod.temp, 9999.9)` to exclude records with missing temperature values (`9999.9` indicates missing data).

**Brief Explanation of the Query:**

- **Calculations:**
  - Calculates the average (`avg_temp_US`, `avg_temp_UK`), maximum (`max_temp_US`, `max_temp_UK`), and minimum (`min_temp_US`, `min_temp_UK`) temperatures for US and UK weather stations for each day in October 2023.
  - Computes the differences between US and UK temperatures for each of these metrics.
  
- **Filtering:**
  - Filters records to include only those from October 2023 (`gsod.year = '2023'` and `gsod.mo = '10'`).
  - Includes only stations from the US and UK (`stations.country IN ('US', 'GB')`).
  - Excludes records with missing temperature values (`gsod.temp != 9999.9`).
  
- **Grouping and Ordering:**
  - Groups the results by day (`gsod.da`) to get daily differences.
  - Orders the results by day for chronological output.

**Note:** Make sure that your dataset actually contains data for October 2023. If the data is not yet available, you may need to adjust the query to reflect the available dates.

**Sample Output Format:**

The query will produce a table with the following columns:

```csv
day,avg_temp_US,avg_temp_UK,max_temp_US,max_temp_UK,min_temp_US,min_temp_UK,avg_temp_difference,max_temp_difference,min_temp_difference
```

- **day:** Day of the month (from 1 to 31).
- **avg_temp_US / avg_temp_UK:** Average temperatures for the US and UK respectively.
- **max_temp_US / max_temp_UK:** Maximum temperatures for the US and UK respectively.
- **min_temp_US / min_temp_UK:** Minimum temperatures for the US and UK respectively.
- **avg_temp_difference:** Difference in average temperatures between US and UK for the day.
- **max_temp_difference:** Difference in maximum temperatures between US and UK for the day.
- **min_temp_difference:** Difference in minimum temperatures between US and UK for the day.

**Example Row:**

```csv
day,avg_temp_US,avg_temp_UK,max_temp_US,max_temp_UK,min_temp_US,min_temp_UK,avg_temp_difference,max_temp_difference,min_temp_difference
1,60.5,55.2,75.0,70.1,45.0,40.3,5.3,4.9,4.7
```

This indicates that on October 1st:

- The average temperature in the US was 60.5°F, and in the UK it was 55.2°F.
- The maximum temperature in the US was 75.0°F, and in the UK it was 70.1°F.
- The minimum temperature in the US was 45.0°F, and in the UK it was 40.3°F.
- The differences are calculated accordingly.

**Please run the corrected query, and it should resolve the data type mismatch error.**

Task: Can you calculate the difference in maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and average temperature between US and UK weather stations for each day in October 2023, excluding records with missing temperature values?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: As of now, records for October 2023 are not yet available. Therefore, we cannot calculate the difference in maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and average temperature between US and UK weather stations for that period. Please consider requesting data for a time frame with available records..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 05:29:41 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you calculate the difference in maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and average temperature between US and UK weather stations for each day in October 2023, excluding records with missing temperature values?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: As of now, records for October 2023 are not yet available. Therefore, we cannot calculate the difference in maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and average temperature between US and UK weather stations for that period. Please consider requesting data for a time frame with available records. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
