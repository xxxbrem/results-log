Begin Exploring Related Columns
To summarize the **total quantity of each ingredient** used in the pizzas we delivered, we need to consider the following tables and columns:

---

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **"pizza_clean_customer_orders"**
   - **"order_id"**: Unique identifier for each customer order.
   - **"pizza_id"**: Identifier of the pizza ordered.
   - **"exclusions"**: Toppings to exclude (possibly as a comma-separated list of topping IDs).
   - **"extras"**: Extra toppings added (possibly as a comma-separated list of topping IDs).
   - **Potential Usage**: Provides the base pizza ordered and any customizations made by the customer.

2. **"pizza_runner_orders"**
   - **"order_id"**: Corresponds to "order_id" in customer orders.
   - **"cancellation"**: Indicates if the order was canceled. Null means the order was delivered.
   - **Potential Usage**: To identify which orders were actually delivered.

3. **"pizza_recipes"**
   - **"pizza_id"**: Identifier of the pizza.
   - **"toppings"**: Base toppings for each pizza (possibly as a comma-separated list of topping IDs).
   - **Potential Usage**: Contains the default ingredients for each pizza type.

4. **"pizza_toppings"**
   - **"topping_id"**: Unique identifier for each topping.
   - **"topping_name"**: Name of each topping.
   - **Potential Usage**: Allows mapping from topping IDs to actual ingredient names.

---

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Only consider delivered pizzas**: Orders where "cancellation" in "pizza_runner_orders" is **NULL**.
- **Include customer modifications**: Adjust the toppings based on "exclusions" and "extras" from "pizza_clean_customer_orders".
- **Aggregate ingredient usage**: Sum the occurrences of each topping to get total quantities.

---

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List all unique pizza IDs ordered by customers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "pizza_id" FROM "pizza_clean_customer_orders" LIMIT 100;

   JOIN "pizza_runner_orders" r ON c."order_id" = r."order_id"
   WHERE r."cancellation" IS NULL AND c."extras" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count the number of each pizza type ordered (delivered orders only):**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."pizza_id", COUNT(*) AS "quantity"
   FROM "pizza_clean_customer_orders" c
   JOIN "pizza_runner_orders" r ON c."order_id" = r."order_id"
   WHERE r."cancellation" IS NULL
   GROUP BY c."pizza_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find the base toppings used in delivered pizzas:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pr."pizza_id", pr."toppings"
   FROM "pizza_recipes" pr
   WHERE pr."pizza_id" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT c."pizza_id"
     FROM "pizza_clean_customer_orders" c
     JOIN "pizza_runner_orders" r ON c."order_id" = r."order_id"
     WHERE r."cancellation" IS NULL
   ) LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Get the names of toppings excluded in delivered orders:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT pt."topping_name"
    FROM "pizza_toppings" pt
    WHERE pt."topping_id" IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT TRIM(value)
      FROM (
        SELECT c."exclusions"
        FROM "pizza_clean_customer_orders" c
        JOIN "pizza_runner_orders" r ON c."order_id" = r."order_id"
        WHERE r."cancellation" IS NULL AND c."exclusions" IS NOT NULL
      ), json_each('[' || "exclusions" || ']')
    ) LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Get the names of extra toppings added in delivered orders:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT pt."topping_name"
    FROM "pizza_toppings" pt
    WHERE pt."topping_id" IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT TRIM(value)
      FROM (
        SELECT c."extras"
        FROM "pizza_clean_customer_orders" c
        JOIN "pizza_runner_orders" r ON c."order_id" = r."order_id"
        WHERE r."cancellation" IS NULL AND c."extras" IS NOT NULL
      ), json_each('[' || "extras" || ']')
    ) LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **List all toppings (base, excluded, and extra) for each delivered order:**

    ```sql
    SELECT c."order_id", pr."toppings", c."exclusions", c."extras"
    FROM "pizza_clean_customer_orders" c
    JOIN "pizza_recipes" pr ON c."pizza_id" = pr."pizza_id"
    JOIN "pizza_runner_orders" r ON c."order_id" = r."order_id"
    WHERE r."cancellation" IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Count how many times each topping was used in delivered pizzas (excluding customer modifications):**

    ```sql
    SELECT pt."topping_name", COUNT(*) AS "usage_count"
    FROM "pizza_recipes" pr
    JOIN "pizza_toppings" pt ON pr."toppings" LIKE '%' || pt."topping_id" || '%'

      WHERE r."cancellation" IS NULL
    )
    GROUP BY pt."topping_name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

By examining the data using these queries, we can understand the ingredients used in each delivered pizza, considering both the base recipes and customer modifications. This exploration will help us calculate the total quantity of each ingredient used in the delivered pizzas.

Remember, the actual calculation of ingredient quantities would involve parsing the comma-separated lists in the "toppings", "exclusions", and "extras" columns, considering each customer's modifications, and then aggregating the totals for each ingredient.Query:

Task: Based on our customer pizza order information, summarize the total quantity of each ingredient used in the pizzas we delivered. Output the name and quantity for each ingredient.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Ingredient_Name,Total_Quantity
ingredient1:str,quantity1:int
ingredient2:str,quantity2:int
...
```

To summarize the total quantity of each ingredient used in the pizzas we delivered, we combined the base toppings from each pizza recipe with any modifications from customer orders, including exclusions and extras. This allowed us to aggregate the total usage of each ingredient across all delivered pizzas..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 08:10:36 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Based on our customer pizza order information, summarize the total quantity of each ingredient used in the pizzas we delivered. Output the name and quantity for each ingredient., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Ingredient_Name,Total_Quantity
ingredient1:str,quantity1:int
ingredient2:str,quantity2:int

```

To summarize the total quantity of each ingredient used in the pizzas we delivered, we combined the base toppings from each pizza recipe with any modifications from customer orders, including exclusions and extras. This allowed us to aggregate the total usage of each ingredient across all delivered pizzas. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
