2025-01-29 19:43:59 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering:

```
Syntax error: Unexpected identifier `market` at [1:3]
```

occurs because the SQL parser expects a complete SQL statement, but it's receiving only a condition without context. Additionally, in BigQuery Standard SQL, using backticks around column names inside expressions can sometimes cause parsing issues if not used properly.

**Why the Error Occurs:**

- **Incomplete Statement:** If you input just the condition `((`market` IS NOT NULL AND `market` != '') OR (`name` IS NOT NULL AND `name` != ''))` without embedding it within a full SQL statement (like a `WHERE` clause), the parser doesn't know how to interpret it.

- **Backticks Usage:** While backticks are used in BigQuery to enclose identifiers (like table or column names) that are reserved words or contain special characters, they can cause issues if not used correctly within expressions.

**How to Fix It:**

1. **Ensure the Condition is Part of a Complete SQL Statement:**

   The condition should be included within a `WHERE` clause in a valid SQL query.

2. **Remove Backticks from Column Names in Conditions:**

   Backticks are unnecessary when the column names are not reserved words and do not contain special characters. Removing them can prevent parsing errors.

---

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

Below are the corrected SQL queries with explanations:

---

1. **First Corrected SQL:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COALESCE(s.market, s.name) AS University, COUNT(*) AS Total_peak_seasons
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` s
   JOIN (
     SELECT season, MAX(wins) AS max_wins
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
     WHERE season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
       AND wins IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY season
   ) m ON s.season = m.season AND s.wins = m.max_wins
   WHERE ((s.market IS NOT NULL AND s.market != '') OR (s.name IS NOT NULL AND s.name != ''))
     AND s.wins IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY University
   ORDER BY Total_peak_seasons DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - Removed backticks around column names in expressions.
   - Ensured that the condition is within a complete SQL statement.
   - Used `COALESCE(s.market, s.name)` to get the university name from either `market` or `name` columns.
   - Added table alias `s` to all column references for clarity.

2. **Second Corrected SQL:**

   ```sql
   SELECT season, COALESCE(market, name) AS University, wins, losses
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
     AND ((market IS NOT NULL AND market != '') OR (name IS NOT NULL AND name != ''))
     AND wins IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY season, University
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - Removed backticks from column names.
   - Used `COALESCE(market, name)` to display the university name.
   - Added parentheses to ensure proper logical grouping in the `WHERE` clause.

3. **Third Corrected SQL:**

   ```sql
   SELECT season, MAX(wins) AS max_wins
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
     AND wins IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY season
   ORDER BY season
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - Removed backticks from column names.
   - Included `wins IS NOT NULL` to avoid null values affecting the `MAX` function.

4. **Fourth Corrected SQL:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s.season, COUNT(*) AS num_teams_with_max_wins
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` s
   JOIN (
     SELECT season, MAX(wins) AS max_wins
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
     WHERE season BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
       AND wins IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY season
   ) m ON s.season = m.season AND s.wins = m.max_wins
   WHERE ((s.market IS NOT NULL AND s.market != '') OR (s.name IS NOT NULL AND s.name != ''))
     AND s.wins IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY s.season
   ORDER BY s.season
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - Removed backticks from column names.
   - Ensured proper use of table aliases.
   - Corrected logical conditions in the `WHERE` clause.

---

**Key Points to Remember:**

- **Use Complete SQL Statements:** Conditions need to be part of full SQL queries. The database cannot execute standalone conditions.

- **Backticks Usage:** Use backticks for identifiers that are reserved words or contain special characters (like spaces). For standard column names, they are not necessary and can sometimes cause parser errors.

- **Null and Empty Checks:**

  - `IS NOT NULL` checks if the column has a value.
  - `!= ''` checks if the string column is not empty.

- **COALESCE Function:** `COALESCE` returns the first non-null value among its arguments. It's helpful when you have multiple columns that might contain the needed data.

---

**Example of Using the Condition Correctly:**

If you want to test just the condition to see which records satisfy it, you can use a simple query like:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
WHERE ((market IS NOT NULL AND market != '') OR (name IS NOT NULL AND name != ''))
LIMIT 10;
```

---

**Additional Tips:**

- **SQL Syntax:** Always ensure your SQL statements are syntactically correct with proper clauses (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc.).

- **Testing Conditions Separately:** If you're unsure about a condition, you can test it within the `WHERE` clause of a simple `SELECT` statement to see if it retrieves the expected records.

- **Review Documentation:** Refer to the [BigQuery Standard SQL documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/introduction) for syntax and usage guidelines.

---

**Final Answer Based on Your Last Query:**

The error you're experiencing is because you're trying to execute a condition outside of a full SQL statement, and possibly because of the backticks around column names. Here's how you can fix it:

- Remove backticks from column names in your condition.
- Ensure the condition is part of a complete SQL statement.

**Corrected Condition within a SQL Statement:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
WHERE ((market IS NOT NULL AND market != '') OR (name IS NOT NULL AND name != ''))
LIMIT 10;
```

By placing the condition within a `WHERE` clause in a full `SELECT` statement and removing the backticks, the SQL should execute without the syntax error.

**Relevant Table:**

- **`mbb_historical_teams_seasons`**: Contains season record information for men's basketball teams, including the number of wins per team per season starting from the 1894-95 season.

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **`season`**: Used to filter records between 1900 and 2000 and to group data by season.
- **`market`**: Team school name (using Sportradar names). Used to identify teams and exclude entries with missing team names.
- **`wins`**: Used to determine the maximum number of wins in each season and identify teams that achieved this maximum.
- **`team_id`**: Unique identifier for teams, useful for distinguishing teams with the same name.
- **`losses`**: Could be used for additional analysis if needed.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000: To include only seasons from 1900 to 2000.
- `market IS NOT NULL AND market != ''`: To exclude entries with missing team names.
- Grouping by `season` and `market` to aggregate data.
- Ordering results to identify top teams.

---

Below are **10 BigQuery SQL queries** to explore the data and understand the values in the relevant columns:

1. **List distinct seasons and team names between 1900 and 2000:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `season`, `market`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
     AND `market` IS NOT NULL AND `market` != ''
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve the number of wins for each team in each season between 1900 and 2000:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `season`, `market`, `wins`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
     AND `market` IS NOT NULL AND `market` != ''
   ORDER BY `season`, `wins` DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find the maximum number of wins in each season between 1900 and 2000:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `season`, MAX(`wins`) AS max_wins
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   GROUP BY `season`
   ORDER BY `season`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Identify teams that achieved the maximum number of wins in their respective seasons:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s.`season`, s.`market`, s.`wins`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` s
   JOIN (
     SELECT `season`, MAX(`wins`) AS max_wins
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
     WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
     GROUP BY `season`
   ) m ON s.`season` = m.`season` AND s.`wins` = m.`max_wins`
   WHERE s.`market` IS NOT NULL AND s.`market` != ''
   ORDER BY s.`season`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count the number of seasons each team achieved the maximum wins between 1900 and 2000:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s.`market`, COUNT(*) AS total_peak_seasons
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` s
   JOIN (
     SELECT `season`, MAX(`wins`) AS max_wins
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
     WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
     GROUP BY `season`
   ) m ON s.`season` = m.`season` AND s.`wins` = m.`max_wins`
   WHERE s.`market` IS NOT NULL AND s.`market` != ''
   GROUP BY s.`market`
   ORDER BY total_peak_seasons DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List the top 5 universities with the most seasons achieving maximum wins between 1900 and 2000:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s.`market` AS University, COUNT(*) AS Total_peak_seasons
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` s
   JOIN (
     SELECT `season`, MAX(`wins`) AS max_wins
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
     WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
     GROUP BY `season`
   ) m ON s.`season` = m.`season` AND s.`wins` = m.`max_wins`
   WHERE s.`market` IS NOT NULL AND s.`market` != ''
   GROUP BY s.`market`
   ORDER BY Total_peak_seasons DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

7. **Check for entries with missing team names between 1900 and 2000:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE (`market` IS NULL OR `market` = '')
     AND `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List all teams with their wins and losses between 1900 and 2000, excluding missing team names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `season`, `market`, `wins`, `losses`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
     AND `market` IS NOT NULL AND `market` != ''
   ORDER BY `season`, `market`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find the distribution of maximum wins across seasons between 1900 and 2000:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `season`, MAX(`wins`) AS max_wins
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
   WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
   GROUP BY `season`
   ORDER BY `season`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count the number of teams achieving the maximum wins in each season between 1900 and 2000:**

    ```sql
    SELECT s.`season`, COUNT(*) AS num_teams_with_max_wins
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons` s
    JOIN (
      SELECT `season`, MAX(`wins`) AS max_wins
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_teams_seasons`
      WHERE `season` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
      GROUP BY `season`
    ) m ON s.`season` = m.`season` AND s.`wins` = m.`max_wins`
    WHERE s.`market` IS NOT NULL AND s.`market` != ''
    GROUP BY s.`season`
    ORDER BY s.`season`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the data needed to answer the task by:

- Filtering relevant records between 1900 and 2000.
- Excluding entries with missing team names.
- Identifying seasons' maximum wins.
- Finding teams that achieved these maximum wins.
- Counting how many times each team achieved peak performance.

**Final Result Format:**

Based on the above analysis, the final result would be presented as:

```csv
University,Total_peak_seasons
Team A,number_of_seasons
Team B,number_of_seasons
Team C,number_of_seasons
Team D,number_of_seasons
Team E,number_of_seasons
```

Where each row represents one of the top 5 universities with the most seasons where they achieved the maximum wins in their respective NCAA basketball seasons between 1900 and 2000.

Task: List the top 5 universities with the most seasons where they achieved the maximum wins in their respective NCAA basketball seasons between 1900-2000, showing each team's total number of such peak-performance seasons, while excluding entries with missing team names.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
University,Total_peak_seasons
```

Unfortunately, without access to the specific data from the `mbb_historical_teams_seasons` table, I cannot provide the exact list of universities and their total number of peak-performance seasons. 

To answer this question, you would need to:

1. **Filter the data** to include only seasons between 1900 and 2000.
2. **Exclude entries with missing team names** to ensure accurate results.
3. **Identify the maximum number of wins** in each season.
4. **Find teams** that achieved this maximum number of wins in their respective seasons.
5. **Count the number of seasons** each team reached this peak performance.
6. **List the top 5 universities** based on these counts.

This process would yield the top 5 universities with the most seasons where they achieved the maximum wins between 1900 and 2000..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
