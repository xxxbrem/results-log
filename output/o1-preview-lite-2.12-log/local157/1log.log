**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"ticker"**: Identifies each cryptocurrency ticker symbol. Used to group and order the data by cryptocurrency.
  
- **"market_date"**: Represents the date of the market data. Used to filter records between August 1 and August 10, 2021, and to order data chronologically.
  
- **"volume"**: Contains the trading volume for each ticker on each date. Since the volume may include suffixes like "K" or "M" and may have "-" for zero, this column is critical for calculating the daily percentage change after cleaning and converting the values.

**Conditions to be Used:**

- Filter records where **"market_date"** is between '2021-08-01' and '2021-08-10'.
  
- Clean the **"volume"** column by converting values ending with "K" or "M" to numerical amounts and treating "-" as zero.
  
- Use only non-zero volumes to determine the previous day's volume for calculating percentage change.
  
- Order the final results by **"ticker"** and **"market_date"**.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List all distinct tickers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "ticker" FROM "bitcoin_prices" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get sample data for the specified date range:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "bitcoin_prices"
   WHERE "market_date" BETWEEN '2021-08-01' AND '2021-08-10'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List distinct volume values to understand the format:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "volume" FROM "bitcoin_prices" LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find records where volume is "-" (to identify how zeros are represented):**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "bitcoin_prices"
   WHERE "volume" = '-'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find records where volume ends with "K":**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "bitcoin_prices"
   WHERE "volume" LIKE '%K'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find records where volume ends with "M":**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "bitcoin_prices"
   WHERE "volume" LIKE '%M'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get volume values excluding zeros ("-") and order by date:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "ticker", "market_date", "volume" FROM "bitcoin_prices"
   WHERE "volume" <> '-'
   AND "market_date" BETWEEN '2021-08-01' AND '2021-08-10'
   ORDER BY "ticker", "market_date"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Check the format of the "market_date" column:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "market_date" FROM "bitcoin_prices" LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find the earliest and latest dates in the data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("market_date") AS earliest_date, MAX("market_date") AS latest_date
   FROM "bitcoin_prices";
   ```

10. **Get the previous day's volume for each ticker to understand data continuity:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "ticker", "market_date", "volume" FROM "bitcoin_prices"
    WHERE "ticker" = 'BTC'
    AND "market_date" BETWEEN '2021-07-31' AND '2021-08-10'
    ORDER BY "market_date"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Identify tickers with non-zero volumes for the date range:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "ticker" FROM "bitcoin_prices"
    WHERE "volume" <> '-'
    AND "volume" <> '0'
    AND "market_date" BETWEEN '2021-08-01' AND '2021-08-10'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Select tickers and volumes where volume contains numeric values only:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "ticker", "market_date", "volume" FROM "bitcoin_prices"
    WHERE "volume" GLOB '[0-9]*'
    AND "market_date" BETWEEN '2021-08-01' AND '2021-08-10'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List the price changes to see how they are formatted:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "change" FROM "bitcoin_prices" LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Find records where volume has decimal points (e.g., "1.5M"):**

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM "bitcoin_prices"
    WHERE "volume" LIKE '%.%'
    AND "volume" LIKE '%M'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Get the volume and price for a specific ticker to observe correlation:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "market_date", "volume", "price" FROM "bitcoin_prices"
    WHERE "ticker" = 'ETH'
    AND "market_date" BETWEEN '2021-08-01' AND '2021-08-10'
    ORDER BY "market_date"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries are designed to help understand the data in the **"bitcoin_prices"** table, specifically focusing on the **"ticker"**, **"market_date"**, and **"volume"** columns. By exploring the formats and values in the **"volume"** column, we can prepare to accurately calculate the daily percentage changes as per the task requirements.Query:

Task: Using the "bitcoin_prices" table, please calculate the daily percentage change in trading volume for each ticker from August 1 to August 10, 2021, ensuring that any volume ending in "K" or "M" is accurately converted to thousands or millions, any "-" volume is treated as zero, only non-zero volumes are used to determine the previous day's volume, and the results are ordered by ticker and date.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
ticker,market_date,percentage_change_in_volume
ticker1:str,date1:str,change1:float
ticker1:str,date2:str,change2:float
...
```

**Explanation:**

The table above displays the daily percentage change in trading volume for each ticker from August 1 to August 10, 2021. In calculating the percentage changes, volumes ending with "K" or "M" have been accurately converted to thousands or millions. Any volumes denoted as "-" have been treated as zero. Only non-zero volumes were used to determine the previous day's volume for the percentage change calculation. The results are ordered by ticker and date as requested..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['weekly_sales', 'shopping_cart_users', 'bitcoin_members', 'interest_metrics', 'customer_regions', 'customer_transactions', 'bitcoin_transactions', 'customer_nodes', 'cleaned_weekly_sales', 'veg_txn_df', 'shopping_cart_events', 'shopping_cart_page_hierarchy', 'bitcoin_prices', 'interest_map', 'veg_loss_rate_df', 'shopping_cart_campaign_identifier', 'veg_cat', 'veg_whsle_df', 'shopping_cart_event_identifier']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
