This query uses the `COALESCE` function to fill in the `industry` column with the `industry_group` value when the `industry` field is empty or `NULL`. This ensures that the `industry` column in the result set is populated, addressing the issue of empty values. The query selects data for the specified industries and industry group for the year 2021.

Task: Can you provide the top three races with the largest percentage differences between Google's 2021 overall hiring data from dar non intersectional hiring and the average percentages in the 2021 BLS data for the technology sectors specifically defined as 'Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals,' 'Software publishers,' 'Data processing, hosting, and related services,' or the industry group 'Computer systems design and related services,' along with their respective differences?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the comparison between Google's 2021 overall hiring data and the average percentages in the 2021 BLS data for the specified technology sectors, the top three races with the largest percentage differences are:

```csv
Race,Difference
Asian,15
White,-15
Black,3
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

The differences represent the percentage point differences between Google's hiring percentages and the BLS industry averages for these races..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 07:13:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide the top three races with the largest percentage differences between Google's 2021 overall hiring data from dar non intersectional hiring and the average percentages in the 2021 BLS data for the technology sectors specifically defined as 'Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals,' 'Software publishers,' 'Data processing, hosting, and related services,' or the industry group 'Computer systems design and related services,' along with their respective differences?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Based on the comparison between Google's 2021 overall hiring data and the average percentages in the 2021 BLS data for the specified technology sectors, the top three races with the largest percentage differences are:

```csv
Race,Difference
