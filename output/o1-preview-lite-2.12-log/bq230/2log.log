- `commodity_desc`: Used to filter for 'CORN' and 'MUSHROOMS'.
- `group_desc`: Used to confirm 'FIELD CROPS' for corn and 'HORTICULTURE' for mushrooms.
- `statisticcat_desc`: Used to filter for 'PRODUCTION' statistics.
- `agg_level_desc`: Used to select data aggregated at the 'STATE' level.
- `value`: Contains the production figures (ensure it is not null).
- `unit_desc`: For corn, ensure the unit is 'BU' (bushels).
- `year`: Used to filter data for the year 2022.
- `state_name`: Used to identify the U.S. states.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `statisticcat_desc = 'PRODUCTION'`
- `agg_level_desc = 'STATE'`
- `value IS NOT NULL`
- `year = 2022`
- For corn:
  - `commodity_desc = 'CORN'`
  - `group_desc = 'FIELD CROPS'`
  - `unit_desc = 'BU'`
- For mushrooms:
  - `commodity_desc = 'MUSHROOMS'`
  - `group_desc = 'HORTICULTURE'`

Task: Using the crops dataset, find the total 2022 production figures, measured in bushels, for corn from the 'FIELD CROPS' category and mushrooms from the 'HORTICULTURE' group for each U.S. state. Only include data rows where 'statisticcat_desc' is 'PRODUCTION', 'agg_level_desc' is 'STATE', 'value' is not null, and ensure that for corn the 'unit_desc' is 'BU'. Combine both results so that each state’s 2022 corn and mushroom totals are presented.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
state_name,corn_production_bu,mushroom_production,unit_desc
state1:str,corn_production1:float,mushroom_production1:float,unit1:str
state2:str,corn_production2:float,mushroom_production2:float,unit2:str
...
```

This table presents the total 2022 production figures for corn (measured in bushels) and mushrooms for each U.S. state. The data includes only the rows where `statisticcat_desc` is 'PRODUCTION', `agg_level_desc` is 'STATE', `value` is not null, and for corn, the `unit_desc` is 'BU'. The `unit_desc` column for mushrooms is included because the unit of measurement may vary across states..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'usda_nass_agriculture': ['census2012', 'census2012', 'census2002', 'census2007', 'crops', 'animals_products', 'census_2012', 'census_2012', 'census_2007', 'census_2002', 'environmental', 'economics', 'demographics']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 10:08:11 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Using the crops dataset, find the total 2022 production figures, measured in bushels, for corn from the 'FIELD CROPS' category and mushrooms from the 'HORTICULTURE' group for each U.S. state. Only include data rows where 'statisticcat_desc' is 'PRODUCTION', 'agg_level_desc' is 'STATE', 'value' is not null, and ensure that for corn the 'unit_desc' is 'BU'. Combine both results so that each state’s 2022 corn and mushroom totals are presented., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
state_name,corn_production_bu,mushroom_production,unit_desc
state1:str,corn_production1:float,mushroom_production1:float,unit1:str
state2:str,corn_production2:float,mushroom_production2:float,unit2:str
...
```

This table presents the total 2022 production figures for corn (measured in bushels) and mushrooms for each U.S. state. The data includes only the rows where `statisticcat_desc` is 'PRODUCTION', `agg_level_desc` is 'STATE', `value` is not null, and for corn, the `unit_desc` is 'BU'. The `unit_desc` column for mushrooms is included because the unit of measurement may vary across states. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
