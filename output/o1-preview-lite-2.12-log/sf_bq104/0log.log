Begin Exploring Related Columns
First, we identify the relevant tables and columns for the task:

**Relevant Table:** `TOP_RISING_TERMS`

**Columns and their potential usage:**

- `"refresh_date"`: Used to find the most recent refresh date in the dataset.
- `"week"`: Contains the week for each term; used to find the week exactly one year prior to the latest available week.
- `"term"`: The search term to identify.
- `"rank"`: Determines the ranking of the search terms; used to find the top-ranked term.
- `"percent_gain"`: Indicates the rise in search interest; relevant for "rising" terms.
- `"score"`: Represents the term's popularity score.
- `"dma_name"` and `"dma_id"`: Geographic identifiers (Designated Market Area); may be used if regional filtering is needed.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter by the most recent `"refresh_date"`.
- Calculate the week exactly one year prior using `"week"` and date functions.
- Select records where `"rank"` equals 1 to find the top-ranked term.
- Limit results to ensure queries return manageable data sets.

Here are 10 SQL queries to explore the data:

1. **Get the most recent refresh date:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MAX("refresh_date") AS "most_recent_refresh_date"
   FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS;
   ```

2. **Find the latest available week in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MAX("week") AS "latest_week"
   FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS;
   ```

3. **Calculate the week exactly one year prior to the latest week:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DATEADD(year, -1, MAX("week")) AS "week_one_year_ago"
   FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS;
   ```

4. **List all rising terms from the week one year prior to the latest week:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "term", "rank", "score", "percent_gain"
   FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS
   WHERE "week" = (
       SELECT DATEADD(year, -1, MAX("week"))
       FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve the top-ranked rising search term for that week:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "term", "rank", "score", "percent_gain"
   FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS
   WHERE "week" = (
       SELECT DATEADD(year, -1, MAX("week"))
       FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS
   ) AND "rank" = 1;
   ```

6. **Check for multiple top-ranked terms (if any ties exist):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "term"
   FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS
   WHERE "week" = (
       SELECT DATEADD(year, -1, MAX("week"))
       FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS
   ) AND "rank" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List the top 5 rising search terms for that week:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "term", "rank", "score", "percent_gain"
   FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS
   WHERE "week" = (
       SELECT DATEADD(year, -1, MAX("week"))
       FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS
   )
   ORDER BY "rank" ASC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

8. **Find terms with the highest percent gain for that week:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "term", "percent_gain", "rank"
   FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS
   WHERE "week" = (
       SELECT DATEADD(year, -1, MAX("week"))
       FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS
   )
   ORDER BY "percent_gain" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List distinct weeks available in the dataset (most recent 5 weeks):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "week"
   FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS
   ORDER BY "week" DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

10. **Verify the data by retrieving the refresh date and week for the top term:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "term", "rank", "week", "refresh_date"
    FROM GOOGLE_TRENDS.GOOGLE_TRENDS.TOP_RISING_TERMS
    WHERE "rank" = 1
    ORDER BY "week" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the dataset and extracting the necessary information to identify the top-ranked rising search term for the week exactly one year prior to the latest available week.Query:

Task: Based on the most recent refresh date, identify the top-ranked rising search term for the week that is exactly one year prior to the latest available week in the dataset.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the most recent refresh date, we identified the top-ranked rising search term for the week exactly one year prior to the latest available week in the dataset. This term represents the most significant increase in search interest during that specific week one year ago.

```csv
Term
term:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'GOOGLE_TRENDS': {'GOOGLE_TRENDS': ['TOP_TERMS', 'TOP_RISING_TERMS', 'INTERNATIONAL_TOP_RISING_TERMS', 'INTERNATIONAL_TOP_TERMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
