**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

**Table**: `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2019`
- `stn`: Station number (used to identify stations)
- `wban`: WBAN number (used along with `stn` to uniquely identify stations)
- `year`: Year of the observation
- `mo`: Month of the observation
- `da`: Day of the observation
- `temp`: Mean temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit to tenths). Missing value is `9999.9`
- `max`: Maximum temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit to tenths). Missing value is `9999.9`
- `min`: Minimum temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit to tenths). Missing value is `9999.9`

**Conditions:**
- `temp` != `9999.9` (to ensure valid mean temperature data)
- `max` != `9999.9` (to ensure valid maximum temperature data)
- `min` != `9999.9` (to ensure valid minimum temperature data)

---

**Table**: `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
- `usaf`: Station number (corresponds to `stn` in GSOD data)
- `wban`: WBAN number (used along with `usaf` to uniquely identify stations)
- `begin`: Date when the station's period of record began (format: YYYYMMDD)
- `end`: Date when the station's period of record ended (format: YYYYMMDD)

**Conditions:**
- `begin` <= `'20000101'` (stations that began on or before January 1, 2000)
- `end` >= `'20190630'` (stations that continued through at least June 30, 2019)

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct station identifiers from GSOD 2019 data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `stn`, `wban`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2019`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve station begin and end dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `usaf`, `wban`, `begin`, `end`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find stations with period of record starting on or before Jan 1, 2000, and ending on or after Jun 30, 2019:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `usaf`, `wban`, `begin`, `end`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
   WHERE `begin` <= '20000101' AND `end` >= '20190630'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count valid temperature records per station in 2019:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `stn`, `wban`, COUNT(*) AS valid_days
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2019`
   WHERE `temp` != 9999.9 AND `max` != 9999.9 AND `min` != 9999.9
   GROUP BY `stn`, `wban`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Join GSOD 2019 data with station metadata:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gsod.`stn`, gsod.`wban`, gsod.`temp`, stations.`begin`, stations.`end`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2019` AS gsod
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS stations
   ON gsod.`stn` = stations.`usaf` AND gsod.`wban` = stations.`wban`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve valid temperature data for stations meeting period criteria:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gsod.`stn`, gsod.`wban`, gsod.`year`, gsod.`mo`, gsod.`da`, gsod.`temp`, gsod.`max`, gsod.`min`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2019` AS gsod
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS stations
   ON gsod.`stn` = stations.`usaf` AND gsod.`wban` = stations.`wban`
   WHERE stations.`begin` <= '20000101' AND stations.`end` >= '20190630'
     AND gsod.`temp` != 9999.9 AND gsod.`max` != 9999.9 AND gsod.`min` != 9999.9
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count valid temperature days per station that meet period criteria:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gsod.`stn`, gsod.`wban`, COUNT(*) AS valid_days
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2019` AS gsod
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS stations
   ON gsod.`stn` = stations.`usaf` AND gsod.`wban` = stations.`wban`
   WHERE stations.`begin` <= '20000101' AND stations.`end` >= '20190630'
     AND gsod.`temp` != 9999.9 AND gsod.`max` != 9999.9 AND gsod.`min` != 9999.9
   GROUP BY gsod.`stn`, gsod.`wban`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Determine the total number of unique days with GSOD data in 2019:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(`year`, `mo`, `da`)) AS total_days
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2019`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List all unique dates in 2019 with available data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `year`, `mo`, `da`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2019`
   ORDER BY `year`, `mo`, `da`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count total number of stations in GSOD 2019 data:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_stations
    FROM (
      SELECT DISTINCT `stn`, `wban`
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2019`
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Among all NOAA GSOD weather stations that recorded valid daily temperature data (non-missing temp, max, min) in 2019 and whose period of record began on or before January 1, 2000, and continued through at least June 30, 2019, how many of these stations achieved 90% or more of the maximum possible number of valid temperature-record days in 2019?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
number_of_stations
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
