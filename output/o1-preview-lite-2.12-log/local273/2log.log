Begin Exploring Related Columns
The relevant tables and columns for this task are:

- **`products.name`**: Product name; used to group and display results by product name.
- **`orderlines.product_id`**: Links orders to products; used to find ordered quantities per product.
- **`orderlines.qty`**: Ordered quantity for each product in an order; represents the order's required quantity.
- **`picking_line.order_id`**: Links picked items to orders; used to associate picks with the corresponding orders.
- **`picking_line.product_id`**: Links picks to products; used to find picked quantities per product.
- **`picking_line.qty`**: Quantity picked for each product in a picking line; represents the picked quantity.
- **`inventory.product_id`**: Links inventory to products; used to find available quantities for products.
- **`inventory.purchase_id`**: Links inventory to purchases; used to obtain purchase dates for FIFO selection.
- **`inventory.qty`**: Available quantity in inventory; used to determine how much can be picked.
- **`purchases.id`**: Purchase ID; used to link with inventory.
- **`purchases.purchased`**: Purchase date; used to apply FIFO (first-in-first-out) logic based on earliest purchase date.
- **`inventory.location_id`**: Location of the inventory; used in picking to identify from where the product is picked.
- **`picking_line.location_id`**: Location from which the product was picked; used to connect picks to inventory.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Joining **`orderlines`** with **`picking_line`** on **`order_id`** and **`product_id`** to compare ordered and picked quantities.
- Calculating pick percentage by dividing picked quantity by ordered quantity for each orderline.
- Grouping data by **`product_id`** and aggregating to find average pick percentage per product.
- Joining **`inventory`** with **`purchases`** to get purchase dates for FIFO logic.
- Ordering picks based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity.

    FROM inventory
    GROUP BY product_id
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

19. **Get picking lines sorted by earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity.**

    ```sql
    SELECT
        pl.order_id,
        pl.product_id,
        pl.qty as picked_qty,
        pur.purchased as purchase_date,
        inv.qty as inventory_qty
    FROM picking_line pl
    JOIN inventory inv ON pl.location_id = inv.location_id AND pl.product_id = inv.product_id
    JOIN purchases pur ON inv.purchase_id = pur.id
    ORDER BY pur.purchased, inv.qty
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

20. **Get average pick percentage per product name, grouped and ordered by product name.**

    ```sql
    SELECT
        p.name as Product_Name,
        AVG((COALESCE(pl.total_picked_qty, 0) * 100.0 / ol.qty)) as Average_Pick_Percentage
    FROM orderlines ol
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT order_id, product_id, SUM(qty) as total_picked_qty
        FROM picking_line
        GROUP BY order_id, product_id
    ) pl ON ol.order_id = pl.order_id AND ol.product_id = pl.product_id
    JOIN products p ON ol.product_id = p.id
    GROUP BY p.name
    ORDER BY p.name
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the data necessary to calculate the average pick percentage per product name, considering the FIFO approach and ensuring that the picked quantities reflect the overlapping range between each order's required quantity and the inventory's available quantity.Query:

Task: Calculate the average pick percentage for each product name, using a first-in-first-out approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity, ensuring that the picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity, and then grouping and ordering the results by product name?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product_name1:str,average_pick_percentage1:float
product_name2:str,average_pick_percentage2:float
...
```

The table lists each product's name and its corresponding average pick percentage, calculated using a first-in-first-out (FIFO) approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity. The picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity. The results are grouped and ordered by product name..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['customers', 'conway_gen_zero', 'web_devices', 'web_demographics', 'channels_dim', 'gender_dim', 'packaging', 'packaging_relations', 'product_groups', 'products', 'monthly_sales', 'breweries', 'purchases', 'product_alcohol', 'customer_favorites', 'customer_reviews', 'locations', 'inventory', 'orders', 'orderlines', 'monthly_budget', 'product_minimums', 'stock', 'ticker', 'web_apps', 'web_pages', 'web_counter_hist', 'server_heartbeat', 'web_page_visits', 'employees', 'emp_hire_periods', 'picking_list', 'picking_line', 'picking_log', 'id_name_type', 'id_name_coll_type', 'id_name_coll_entries', 'favorite_coll_type']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product_name1:str,average_pick_percentage1:float
product_name2:str,average_pick_percentage2:float
...
```

The table lists each product's name and its corresponding average pick percentage, calculated using a first-in-first-out (FIFO) approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity. The picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity. The results are grouped and ordered by product name. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
