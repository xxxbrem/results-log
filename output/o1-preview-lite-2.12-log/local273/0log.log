  - `qty`: Quantity picked.

- **picking_list**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each picking list.
  - `created`: Date when the picking list was created.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Join tables on matching `product_id`, `order_id`, and `purchase_id`.
- Order inventory items by purchase date (`purchased`) to implement FIFO.
- Select inventory with the smallest available quantity.
- Calculate pick percentage as `(picked_qty / required_qty) * 100`.
- Group by `product name` to calculate averages per product.
- Ensure picked quantities reflect the overlapping range between required and available quantities.

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **List all product names.**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT name
   FROM products
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve the first 100 order lines with their product IDs and quantities ordered.**

   ```sql
   SELECT order_id, product_id, qty
   FROM orderlines
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get total quantity ordered for each product.**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.name, SUM(ol.qty) AS total_ordered_quantity
   FROM orderlines ol
   JOIN products p ON ol.product_id = p.id
   GROUP BY p.name
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List all inventory records with product names and quantities available.**

   ```sql
   SELECT i.id, p.name, i.qty
   FROM inventory i
   JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve purchases ordered by purchase date for FIFO implementation.**

   ```sql
   SELECT pu.id, p.name, pu.qty, pu.purchased
   FROM purchases pu
   JOIN products p ON pu.product_id = p.id
   ORDER BY pu.purchased ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List picking lines with order IDs, product names, and quantities picked.**

   ```sql
   SELECT pl.order_id, p.name, pl.qty AS picked_quantity
   FROM picking_line pl
   JOIN products p ON pl.product_id = p.id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find the total picked quantity for each product.**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.name, SUM(pl.qty) AS total_picked_quantity
   FROM picking_line pl
   JOIN products p ON pl.product_id = p.id
   GROUP BY p.name
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate pick percentage for each order line.**

   ```sql
   SELECT
       ol.order_id,
       p.name,
       ol.qty AS required_quantity,
       pl.qty AS picked_quantity,
       (pl.qty * 100.0 / ol.qty) AS pick_percentage
   FROM orderlines ol
   JOIN products p ON ol.product_id = p.id
   JOIN picking_line pl ON ol.order_id = pl.order_id AND ol.product_id = pl.product_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Identify inventory items with smallest quantities for each product.**

   ```sql
   SELECT i.id, p.name, i.qty
   FROM inventory i
   JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.id
   ORDER BY i.qty ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate the average pick percentage for each product name.**

    ```sql
    SELECT
        p.name,
        AVG((pl.qty * 100.0 / ol.qty)) AS average_pick_percentage
    FROM orderlines ol
    JOIN products p ON ol.product_id = p.id
    JOIN picking_line pl ON ol.order_id = pl.order_id AND ol.product_id = pl.product_id
    GROUP BY p.name
    ORDER BY p.name
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the data and relationships between the relevant tables. They progressively build up to calculating the average pick percentage per product, considering FIFO and inventory constraints as specified in the task.Query:

Task: Calculate the average pick percentage for each product name, using a first-in-first-out approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity, ensuring that the picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity, and then grouping and ordering the results by product name?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product_name1:str,average_pick_percentage1:float
product_name2:str,average_pick_percentage2:float
...
```

The table lists each product's name and its corresponding average pick percentage, calculated using a first-in-first-out (FIFO) approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity. The picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity. The results are grouped and ordered by product name..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['customers', 'conway_gen_zero', 'web_devices', 'web_demographics', 'channels_dim', 'gender_dim', 'packaging', 'packaging_relations', 'product_groups', 'products', 'monthly_sales', 'breweries', 'purchases', 'product_alcohol', 'customer_favorites', 'customer_reviews', 'locations', 'inventory', 'orders', 'orderlines', 'monthly_budget', 'product_minimums', 'stock', 'ticker', 'web_apps', 'web_pages', 'web_counter_hist', 'server_heartbeat', 'web_page_visits', 'employees', 'emp_hire_periods', 'picking_list', 'picking_line', 'picking_log', 'id_name_type', 'id_name_coll_type', 'id_name_coll_entries', 'favorite_coll_type']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

```

The table lists each product's name and its corresponding average pick percentage, calculated using a first-in-first-out (FIFO) approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity. The picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity. The results are grouped and ordered by product name. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-10 23:43:50 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Calculate the average pick percentage for each product name, using a first-in-first-out approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity, ensuring that the picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity, and then grouping and ordering the results by product name?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product_name1:str,average_pick_percentage1:float
product_name2:str,average_pick_percentage2:float
...
```

The table lists each product's name and its corresponding average pick percentage, calculated using a first-in-first-out (FIFO) approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity. The picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity. The results are grouped and ordered by product name. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
