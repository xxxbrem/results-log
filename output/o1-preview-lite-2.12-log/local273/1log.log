### Conditions That May Be Used:
- Join `orderlines` and `picking_line` on `order_id` and `product_id` to compare ordered quantities with picked quantities.
- Use `purchases` and `inventory` tables to determine the earliest purchase dates for FIFO.
- Join `products` to get product names.
- Ensure that picked quantities do not exceed available inventory quantities.
- Group by product names to calculate average pick percentages.
- Order results by product name.

### SQL Queries:

1. **List all products with their IDs and names:**

```sql
SELECT "id", "name"
FROM "products"
LIMIT 100;
```

2. **Get distinct product IDs from the `orderlines` table:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
FROM "orderlines"
LIMIT 100;
```

3. **Retrieve total quantities ordered for each product:**

```sql
SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS total_ordered_qty
FROM "orderlines"
GROUP BY "product_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

4. **Retrieve total quantities picked for each product:**

```sql
SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS total_picked_qty
FROM "picking_line"
GROUP BY "product_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

5. **List inventory quantities along with purchase dates for FIFO analysis:**

```sql
SELECT i."product_id", i."qty" AS inventory_qty, p."purchased" AS purchase_date
FROM "inventory" i
JOIN "purchases" p ON i."purchase_id" = p."id"
ORDER BY p."purchased" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

6. **Get order details with corresponding ordered quantities:**

```sql
SELECT ol."order_id", ol."product_id", ol."qty" AS order_qty
FROM "orderlines" ol
LIMIT 100;
```

7. **Join `orderlines` and `picking_line` to compare ordered and picked quantities:**

```sql
SELECT ol."order_id", ol."product_id", ol."qty" AS order_qty, pl."qty" AS picked_qty
FROM "orderlines" ol
JOIN "picking_line" pl ON ol."order_id" = pl."order_id" AND ol."product_id" = pl."product_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

8. **Calculate pick percentage for each order line:**

```sql
SELECT ol."order_id", ol."product_id", 
       (pl."qty" * 100.0) / ol."qty" AS pick_percentage
FROM "orderlines" ol
JOIN "picking_line" pl ON ol."order_id" = pl."order_id" AND ol."product_id" = pl."product_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

9. **Retrieve earliest purchase date for each product (FIFO approach):**

```sql
SELECT i."product_id", MIN(p."purchased") AS earliest_purchase_date
FROM "inventory" i
JOIN "purchases" p ON i."purchase_id" = p."id"
GROUP BY i."product_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

10. **Calculate the average pick percentage for each product name, grouped and ordered by product name:**

```sql
SELECT pr."name" AS product_name,
       AVG((pl."qty" * 100.0) / ol."qty") AS average_pick_percentage
FROM "orderlines" ol
JOIN "picking_line" pl ON ol."order_id" = pl."order_id" AND ol."product_id" = pl."product_id"
JOIN "products" pr ON ol."product_id" = pr."id"
GROUP BY pr."name"
ORDER BY pr."name"
LIMIT 100;
```

11. **List inventory entries sorted by smallest available quantity:**

```sql
SELECT "product_id", "qty", "location_id"
FROM "inventory"
ORDER BY "qty" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

12. **Identify orders that have not been fully picked (partial picks):**

```sql
SELECT ol."order_id", ol."product_id", ol."qty" AS order_qty, 
       COALESCE(pl."picked_qty", 0) AS total_picked_qty
FROM "orderlines" ol
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT "order_id", "product_id", SUM("qty") AS picked_qty
    FROM "picking_line"
    GROUP BY "order_id", "product_id"
) pl ON ol."order_id" = pl."order_id" AND ol."product_id" = pl."product_id"
WHERE COALESCE(pl."picked_qty", 0) < ol."qty"
LIMIT 100;
```

13. **Find products with their total available inventory quantities:**

```sql
SELECT p."name" AS product_name, SUM(i."qty") AS total_inventory_qty
FROM "inventory" i
JOIN "products" p ON i."product_id" = p."id"
GROUP BY p."name"
LIMIT 100;
```

14. **Compute the overlapping quantity between ordered quantity and available inventory for each order line:**

```sql
SELECT ol."order_id", ol."product_id", MIN(ol."qty", i."qty") AS overlapping_qty
FROM "orderlines" ol
JOIN "inventory" i ON ol."product_id" = i."product_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

15. **Determine the pick percentage considering the overlapping range between order quantity and inventory availability:**

```sql
SELECT pr."name" AS product_name, 
       AVG((MIN(ol."qty", i."qty") * 100.0) / ol."qty") AS adjusted_pick_percentage
FROM "orderlines" ol
JOIN "inventory" i ON ol."product_id" = i."product_id"
JOIN "products" pr ON ol."product_id" = pr."id"
GROUP BY pr."name"
ORDER BY pr."name"
LIMIT 100;
```

These queries progress from simple data retrieval to more complex calculations involving multiple tables and conditions. They help in understanding the relationships between orders, picks, inventory, and purchases to calculate the average pick percentage for each product, considering the FIFO approach and inventory constraints.Query:

Task: Calculate the average pick percentage for each product name, using a first-in-first-out approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity, ensuring that the picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity, and then grouping and ordering the results by product name?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product_name1:str,average_pick_percentage1:float
product_name2:str,average_pick_percentage2:float
...
```

The table lists each product's name and its corresponding average pick percentage, calculated using a first-in-first-out (FIFO) approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity. The picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity. The results are grouped and ordered by product name..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

The table lists each product's name and its corresponding average pick percentage, calculated using a first-in-first-out (FIFO) approach that selects from inventory locations based on the earliest purchase date and smallest available quantity. The picked quantity reflects only the overlapping range between each order’s required quantity and the inventory’s available quantity. The results are grouped and ordered by product name. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
