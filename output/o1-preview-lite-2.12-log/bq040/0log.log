## Tip Rate Calculation and Categorization

The `tip_rate` for each trip is calculated based on the total trip amount and the tip amount. The formula for calculating the tip rate is as follows:



After calculating the tip rate, the values are categorized into the following ranges:

- `no tip`: if `tip_rate = 0`
- `Less than 5%`: if `tip_rate <= 5`
- `5% to 10%`: if `tip_rate > 5` and `tip_rate <= 10`
- `10% to 15%`: if `tip_rate > 10` and `tip_rate <= 15`
- `15% to 20%`: if `tip_rate > 15` and `tip_rate <= 20`
- `20% to 25%`: if `tip_rate > 20` and `tip_rate <= 25`
- `More than 25%`: if `tip_rate > 25`

  - `dropoff_datetime`: To ensure dropoff time is after pickup time.
  - `passenger_count`: To include trips with passenger count greater than zero.
  - `trip_distance`: To filter trips with non-negative distances.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct boroughs from the taxi zone table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT borough
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.taxi_zone_geom`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List zone IDs with their corresponding boroughs and zone names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT zone_id, zone_name, borough
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.taxi_zone_geom`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Sample trips with fare amount, tip amount, and total amount:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime, passenger_count, trip_distance, fare_amount, tip_amount, total_amount
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Select trips from January 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pickup_datetime, passenger_count, trip_distance
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM pickup_datetime) = 2016
     AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM pickup_datetime) = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Select trips between January 1 and January 7, 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pickup_datetime, passenger_count, trip_distance
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
   WHERE DATE(pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2016-01-07'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find trips where dropoff time is before pickup time:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime, passenger_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
   WHERE dropoff_datetime < pickup_datetime

Task: For NYC yellow taxi trips between January 1 and January 7, 2016, excluding any trips picked up in ‘EWR’ or ‘Staten Island,’ determine the proportion of rides that fall into each tip category in each pickup borough. Only include trips where the dropoff time is after the pickup time, the passenger count is greater than zero, and trip_distance, tip_amount, tolls_amount, mta_tax, fare_amount, and total_amount are all non-negative. Classify the tip percentage as follows: 0% (no tip), up to 5%, 5% to 10%, 10% to 15%, 15% to 20%, 20% to 25%, and more than 25%.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Here is the CSV-formatted table showing the proportion of rides in each tip category for each pickup borough:

```csv
pickup_borough,tip_category,proportion
borough_name_1:str,0%,proportion_value_1:float
borough_name_1:str,up to 5%,proportion_value_2:float
borough_name_1:str,5% to 10%,proportion_value_3:float
borough_name_1:str,10% to 15%,proportion_value_4:float
borough_name_1:str,15% to 20%,proportion_value_5:float
borough_name_1:str,20% to 25%,proportion_value_6:float
borough_name_1:str,more than 25%,proportion_value_7:float
borough_name_2:str,0%,proportion_value_8:float
borough_name_2:str,up to 5%,proportion_value_9:float
borough_name_2:str,5% to 10%,proportion_value_10:float
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **pickup_borough**: The name of the pickup borough (excluding 'EWR' or 'Staten Island').
- **tip_category**: The tip percentage category for the trip.
- **proportion**: The proportion of rides in the specific tip category for that borough (a float between 0 and 1).

This table lists the proportion of rides falling into each specified tip category for each pickup borough during January 1 to January 7, 2016, after applying all the filtering conditions mentioned in the task..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 00:21:19 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For NYC yellow taxi trips between January 1 and January 7, 2016, excluding any trips picked up in ‘EWR’ or ‘Staten Island,’ determine the proportion of rides that fall into each tip category in each pickup borough. Only include trips where the dropoff time is after the pickup time, the passenger count is greater than zero, and trip_distance, tip_amount, tolls_amount, mta_tax, fare_amount, and total_amount are all non-negative. Classify the tip percentage as follows: 0% (no tip), up to 5%, 5% to 10%, 10% to 15%, 15% to 20%, 20% to 25%, and more than 25%., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Here is the CSV-formatted table showing the proportion of rides in each tip category for each pickup borough:

```csv
pickup_borough,tip_category,proportion
borough_name_1:str,0%,proportion_value_1:float
borough_name_1:str,up to 5%,proportion_value_2:float
borough_name_1:str,5% to 10%,proportion_value_3:float
borough_name_1:str,10% to 15%,proportion_value_4:float
borough_name_1:str,15% to 20%,proportion_value_5:float
borough_name_1:str,20% to 25%,proportion_value_6:float
borough_name_1:str,more than 25%,proportion_value_7:float
borough_name_2:str,0%,proportion_value_8:float
borough_name_2:str,up to 5%,proportion_value_9:float
borough_name_2:str,5% to 10%,proportion_value_10:float
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **pickup_borough**: The name of the pickup borough (excluding 'EWR' or 'Staten Island').
- **tip_category**: The tip percentage category for the trip.
- **proportion**: The proportion of rides in the specific tip category for that borough (a float between 0 and 1).

This table lists the proportion of rides falling into each specified tip category for each pickup borough during January 1 to January 7, 2016, after applying all the filtering conditions mentioned in the task. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
