After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL to answer the task for the following reasons:

1. **Precise Indicator Selection**:
   - **`1result.sql`** uses the `indicator_code` `'SH.XPD.CHEX.PP.CD'`, which specifically corresponds to **"Current health expenditure per capita, PPP (current international $)"**. This ensures that the data retrieved is accurate and relevant to the task.
   - In contrast, **`0result.sql`** filters by `indicator_name`, which might be less reliable due to possible variations or inconsistencies in the indicator names.

2. **Proper Handling of Data**:
   - **`1result.sql`** uses the `MAX(CASE WHEN ...)` construct to retrieve the expenditure values for 2017 and 2018, ensuring that the correct values are selected even if there are multiple records for a country and year.
   - It includes a `HAVING` clause that checks for `NOT NULL` values for both years, ensuring data integrity and preventing division by zero or null.

3. **Accurate Percentage Calculations**:
   - The query casts `year_2017` to `FLOAT64` when calculating the population growth percentage. This prevents integer division and ensures that fractional growth rates are calculated accurately.
   - Similarly, it accurately calculates the health expenditure growth percentage using the correct values.

4. **Data Integrity Checks**:
   - The query ensures that both the 2017 and 2018 values for health expenditure are available and not null before performing calculations.
   - It filters out any countries where the necessary data might be missing or invalid.

5. **Consistent and Clear Structure**:
   - The SQL is well-structured, with clear subqueries for population growth and health expenditure growth.
   - It uses aliases and proper naming conventions, making it easier to read and understand.

6. **Results Consistency**:
   - The query produces a result of **76 countries**, which aligns with the other queries but does so with more robust and reliable logic.

Given these points, **`1result.sql`** is the most accurate and reliable query to answer the task.
