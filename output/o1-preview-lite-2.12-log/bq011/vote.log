After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **Option 2 (2result.sql)** is the correct choice.

**Reasoning:**

- **Option 0 (0result.sql):**
  - Uses explicit table names for each date.
  - Less scalable and more error-prone when dealing with larger date ranges.
  - Requires manual updates to include additional dates.

- **Option 1 (1result.sql):**
  - Uses `_TABLE_SUFFIX` to filter tables based on the date range.
  - Relies on table names (_TABLE_SUFFIX), which may not always match the `event_date` field within the data.
  - If there's any discrepancy between the table suffix and the actual `event_date`, it could lead to incorrect results.

- **Option 2 (2result.sql):**
  - Uses the `event_date` field directly from the data to filter the date range.
  - More reliable as it is based on actual event dates recorded in the data.
  - Automatically includes all relevant tables without needing to specify them individually.
  - Handles any discrepancies between table names and data accurately.

**Conclusion:**

Option 2 accurately counts the number of distinct `user_pseudo_id`s who were active between `'20201231'` and `'20210105'` but not active between `'20210106'` and `'20210107'`.
