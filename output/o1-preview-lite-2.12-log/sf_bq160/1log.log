**Columns and their potential usage:**

- **FORUMTOPICS**

  - `"Id"`: Identifier of the forum topic.
  - `"Title"`: Title of the forum topic.
  - `"ForumId"`: Identifier of the forum to which the topic belongs.
  - `"CreationDate"`: Creation date of the topic.
  - `"TotalReplies"`: Reply count for the topic.
  - `"TotalViews"`: Total views for the topic.
  - `"Score"`: Upvotes for the topic (if applicable).

- **FORUMS**

  - `"Id"`: Identifier of the forum.
  - `"Title"`: Name of the forum (e.g., 'general').

- **FORUMMESSAGES**

  - `"ForumTopicId"`: Identifier of the topic to which the message belongs.
  - `"PostUserId"`: Identifier of the user who posted the message.

- **FORUMMESSAGEVOTES**

  - `"ForumMessageId"`: Identifier of the forum message that received a vote.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Filter by forum name**: `"Title" = 'general'` in the `FORUMS` table.
- **Join topics with forums**: Match `FORUMTOPICS."ForumId"` with `FORUMS."Id"`.
- **Order topics by creation date**: Use `ORDER BY "CreationDate" ASC` to get the earliest topics.
- **Limit results**: Use `LIMIT 100` to restrict the number of rows returned.

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Please tell me the creation date, title, parent forum, reply count, distinct user count, upvotes, and total views for the earliest five forum topics belonging to the parent forum named "general". Any value that is None should be regarded as 0.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Here is the requested information:

```csv
CreationDate,Title,ParentForum,ReplyCount,DistinctUserCount,Upvotes,TotalViews
creation_date1,title1,general,reply_count1:int,distinct_user_count1:int,upvotes1:int,total_views1:int

creation_date5,title5,general,reply_count5:int,distinct_user_count5:int,upvotes5:int,total_views5:int
```
(Attention: answer in five rows)

**Explanation:**

The table above provides the creation date, title, parent forum, reply count, distinct user count, upvotes, and total views for the earliest five forum topics belonging to the parent forum named "general". Any values that are `None` are regarded as `0`. Each row represents one of the five earliest topics, and numerical values are indicated with their data types..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'META_KAGGLE': {'META_KAGGLE': ['COMPETITIONS', 'COMPETITIONTAGS', 'DATASETS', 'DATASETTAGS', 'DATASETTASKS', 'DATASETTASKSUBMISSIONS', 'DATASETVOTES', 'DATASOURCES', 'EPISODEAGENTS', 'EPISODES', 'FORUMMESSAGES', 'FORUMMESSAGEVOTES', 'FORUMS', 'FORUMTOPICS', 'KERNELLANGUAGES', 'KERNELS', 'KERNELTAGS', 'KERNELVERSIONCOMPETITIONSOURCES', 'KERNELVERSIONDATASETSOURCES', 'KERNELVERSIONKERNELSOURCES', 'KERNELVERSIONS', 'KERNELVOTES', 'SUBMISSIONS', 'TAGS', 'TEAMMEMBERSHIPS', 'USERACHIEVEMENTS', 'USERFOLLOWERS', 'USERORGANIZATIONS', 'USERS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-21 05:49:52 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please tell me the creation date, title, parent forum, reply count, distinct user count, upvotes, and total views for the earliest five forum topics belonging to the parent forum named "general". Any value that is None should be regarded as 0., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Here is the requested information:

(Attention: answer in five rows)

**Explanation:**

The table above provides the creation date, title, parent forum, reply count, distinct user count, upvotes, and total views for the earliest five forum topics belonging to the parent forum named "general". Any values that are `None` are regarded as `0`. Each row represents one of the five earliest topics, and numerical values are indicated with their data types. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

(Attention: answer in five rows)

**Explanation:**

The table above provides the creation date, title, parent forum, reply count, distinct user count, upvotes, and total views for the earliest five forum topics belonging to the parent forum named "general". Any values that are `None` are regarded as `0`. Each row represents one of the five earliest topics, and numerical values are indicated with their data types. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-21 05:55:39 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please tell me the creation date, title, parent forum, reply count, distinct user count, upvotes, and total views for the earliest five forum topics belonging to the parent forum named "general". Any value that is None should be regarded as 0., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Here is the requested information:

```csv
CreationDate,Title,ParentForum,ReplyCount,DistinctUserCount,Upvotes,TotalViews
creation_date1,title1,general,reply_count1:int,distinct_user_count1:int,upvotes1:int,total_views1:int
creation_date2,title2,general,reply_count2:int,distinct_user_count2:int,upvotes2:int,total_views2:int
creation_date3,title3,general,reply_count3:int,distinct_user_count3:int,upvotes3:int,total_views3:int
creation_date4,title4,general,reply_count4:int,distinct_user_count4:int,upvotes4:int,total_views4:int
creation_date5,title5,general,reply_count5:int,distinct_user_count5:int,upvotes5:int,total_views5:int
```
(Attention: answer in five rows)

**Explanation:**

The table above provides the creation date, title, parent forum, reply count, distinct user count, upvotes, and total views for the earliest five forum topics belonging to the parent forum named "general". Any values that are `None` are regarded as `0`. Each row represents one of the five earliest topics, and numerical values are indicated with their data types. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
