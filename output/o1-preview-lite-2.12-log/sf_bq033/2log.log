2025-01-21 04:16:46 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering occurs because some records in the `"filing_date"` column contain a value of `0`, which cannot be parsed into a date using the format `'YYYYMMDD'`. The `TO_DATE` function fails when it encounters an invalid date format, resulting in the error:

```
100097 (22007): 01b9da20-0004-7e70-0001-11c300f31d0a: Can't parse '0' as date with format 'YYYYMMDD'
```

To resolve this issue, you have a couple of options:

1. **Filter out records where `"filing_date"` is `0` or invalid before parsing.**
2. **Use `TRY_TO_DATE` instead of `TO_DATE` to safely attempt parsing the date.**

### **Option 1: Filter Out Invalid Filing Dates**

You can modify your query to exclude records where `"filing_date"` is `0` or `NULL`. This ensures that only valid dates are passed to the `TO_DATE` function.

```sql
SELECT "filing_date",
       TO_DATE("filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "filing_date_parsed"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "filing_date" IS NOT NULL
  AND "filing_date" != 0
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Option 2: Use `TRY_TO_DATE` Function**

The `TRY_TO_DATE` function attempts to convert a string to a date and returns `NULL` if the conversion fails, instead of throwing an error. This allows the query to run without interruption due to parsing errors.

```sql
SELECT "filing_date",
       TRY_TO_DATE("filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "filing_date_parsed"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation and Next Steps**

Using `TRY_TO_DATE` is generally more robust, especially when dealing with large datasets that may contain unexpected or invalid values. Here's how you can proceed:

1. **Run the Query with `TRY_TO_DATE`**

   Execute the query using `TRY_TO_DATE` to see which dates are successfully parsed:

   ```sql
   SELECT "filing_date",
          TRY_TO_DATE("filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "filing_date_parsed"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Check Parsed Dates**

   Review the output to ensure that valid dates are parsed correctly, and invalid dates (like `0`) result in `NULL` values for `"filing_date_parsed"`.

3. **Apply Filters for Your Analysis**

   Since you're interested in filings between 2008 and 2022, you can add conditions to filter these dates:

   ```sql
   SELECT "filing_date",
          TRY_TO_DATE("filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "filing_date_parsed"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE TRY_TO_DATE("filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Update Your Main Query**

   Now, you can update your main query (`number 10` from the previous list) to include `TRY_TO_DATE` and avoid the error:

   ```sql
   SELECT TO_CHAR(TRY_TO_DATE("filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD'), 'YYYY-MM') AS "filing_month",
          COUNT(*) AS "num_filings"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US'
     AND "abstract_localized":'en'::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'
     AND TRY_TO_DATE("filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
   GROUP BY "filing_month"
   ORDER BY "filing_month"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - **Notes:**
     - Replaced `TO_DATE` with `TRY_TO_DATE` to handle invalid dates.
     - Applied date range filter on the parsed date.
     - Grouped by the month and year extracted from the parsed date.

### **Summary**

The error was caused by invalid date values (`0`) in the `"filing_date"` column. By using `TRY_TO_DATE` or filtering out invalid dates, you can safely parse the dates and proceed with your analysis.

2025-01-21 04:18:37 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect syntax used to access elements within the `VARIANT` (JSON) column `"abstract_localized"`. Specifically, the syntax:

```sql
t."abstract_localized":'en'::STRING
```

is causing a syntax error because the colon operator (`:`) should not be followed by a string literal enclosed in single quotes. Additionally, `"abstract_localized"` is an **array** of JSON objects rather than a simple JSON object, so we need to handle it accordingly.

### **Understanding the Structure of `"abstract_localized"`**

From the sample data you provided, `"abstract_localized"` looks like this:

```json
[
  {
    "language": "en",
    "text": "Abstract text in English.",
    "truncated": false
  },
  {
    "language": "es",
    "text": "Resumen en Español.",
    "truncated": false
  }
]
```

This means that `"abstract_localized"` is an **array of JSON objects**, each containing:

- `"language"`: The language code.
- `"text"`: The abstract text.
- `"truncated"`: A boolean indicating if the text is truncated.

### **Correcting the SQL Query**

To access elements within an array of JSON objects in Snowflake, you need to:

1. **Flatten the array** using `LATERAL FLATTEN` to convert it into a table-like structure.
2. **Filter** the array elements based on a condition (e.g., `"language" = 'en'`).
3. **Extract** the `"text"` field from the filtered JSON objects.

Here's how you can modify your query:

```sql
SELECT
    t."publication_number",
    f.value:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM
    PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
WHERE
    f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation**

- **`LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f`**:

  - This function explodes (unnests) the array in `"abstract_localized"` into multiple rows, each containing one JSON object from the array.
  - `f.value` represents each JSON object within the array.

- **`f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'`**:

  - This condition filters the flattened array elements to only those where the `"language"` field is `'en'`.

- **`f.value:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"`**:

  - This extracts the `"text"` field from the JSON object and aliases it as `"abstract_text"`.

### **Applying Corrections to Other SQL Queries**

Here are the corrected versions of the other SQL queries you listed:

---

**1. Extract English Abstracts:**

```sql
SELECT
    t."publication_number",

### **Key Points to Remember**

- **Accessing JSON Data:**

  - Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to unnest arrays within a `VARIANT` column.
  - Access JSON object fields using the syntax `field:"key"` or `field['key']`.
  - Cast the extracted value to `STRING` using `::STRING` if needed.

- **Quoting in SQL:**

  - String literals are enclosed in single quotes `' '`.
  - Identifiers (e.g., column names) are enclosed in double quotes `" "`.
  - JSON keys accessed within the `VARIANT` type do not require quotes unless they contain special characters.

- **Handling Dates:**

  - Use `TRY_TO_DATE` instead of `TO_DATE` to safely parse dates that might contain invalid values.
  - Filter out `NULL` dates if necessary.

- **Filtering Conditions:**

  - Apply conditions after flattening the array to ensure they're evaluated correctly on the unnested data.

### **Final Notes**

By adjusting your queries to correctly handle the `VARIANT` data type and array structures, you should be able to execute them without errors. The key is understanding the data structure you're working with and applying the appropriate functions to navigate it.

2025-01-21 04:19:21 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering:

```
001003 (42000): 01b9da22-0004-7e70-0001-11c300f31d9a: SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 't'.
```

indicates that there is an unexpected character `'t'` at position **0** of line **1** in your SQL query. This suggests that there may be an extra `'t'` character at the very beginning of your query.

### **Potential Cause of the Error**

Please check your query to see if it inadvertently starts with a `'t'`. For example:

```sql
tSELECT t."publication_number", t."abstract_localized":'en'::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
WHERE t."abstract_localized":'en' IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

In the above, the query starts with `'tSELECT'`, which would cause the error you're seeing.

### **Corrected Query**

First, ensure that your query starts with `SELECT`, not `tSELECT`. The corrected query should be:

```sql
SELECT t."publication_number", t."abstract_localized":'en'::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
WHERE t."abstract_localized":'en' IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

However, even with this correction, there's another issue in your query related to how you're accessing the JSON data in the `"abstract_localized"` column.

### **Accessing JSON Data Correctly**

The `"abstract_localized"` column is an **array of JSON objects**, and you're attempting to access it using syntax that doesn't correctly handle arrays or JSON structures. 

As mentioned earlier, to extract data from a JSON array in Snowflake, you need to:

1. **Use `LATERAL FLATTEN`** to unnest the array into individual elements.
2. **Reference the JSON fields** correctly within each element.

Here’s the correct way to write your query:

```sql
SELECT
    t."publication_number",
    f.value:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM
    PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
WHERE
    f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation**

- **`LATERAL FLATTEN`**:

  - The `LATERAL FLATTEN` function is used to expand the JSON array in `"abstract_localized"` into multiple rows.
  - `f.value` represents each JSON object within the array.

- **Extracting Fields**:

  - `f.value:"text"::STRING` extracts the `"text"` field from each JSON object.
  - `f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'` filters the records to only include abstracts in English.

- **Aliases and Column References**:

  - **`t`** is the table alias for `PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS`.
  - **`f`** is the alias for the flattened JSON array elements.

### **Steps to Resolve the Error**

1. **Check for Extra Characters**:

   - Ensure that your query does not start with any unintended characters like `'t'`.
   - The query should start with the `SELECT` keyword.

2. **Use the Correct Syntax for JSON Arrays**:

   - Since `"abstract_localized"` is an array, you need to unnest it using `LATERAL FLATTEN`.
   - Access the fields within the JSON objects using the correct syntax.

3. **Run the Corrected Query**:

   - Use the corrected query provided above.
   - This should execute without the syntax error and return the desired data.

### **Additional Corrected Queries**

Here are the corrected versions of the other queries that might have similar issues:

---

**1. Extract English Abstracts Containing 'internet of things':**

```sql
SELECT
    t."publication_number",
    f.value:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM
    PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
WHERE
    f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'
    AND f.value:"text"::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**2. Count U.S. Publications Related to IoT Filed Each Month from 2008 to 2022:**

```sql
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(TRY_TO_DATE(t."filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD'), 'YYYY-MM') AS "filing_month",
    COUNT(DISTINCT t."publication_number") AS "num_filings"
FROM
    PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
WHERE
    t."country_code" = 'US'
    AND TRY_TO_DATE(t."filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
    AND f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'
    AND f.value:"text"::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'
GROUP BY
    "filing_month"
ORDER BY
    "filing_month"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**3. Verify the Range of Filing Dates Between 2008 and 2022:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    t."filing_date",
    TRY_TO_DATE(t."filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "filing_date_parsed"
FROM
    PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
WHERE
    TRY_TO_DATE(t."filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
ORDER BY
    "filing_date_parsed" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Key Points to Remember**

- **Avoid Unintended Characters**:

  - Ensure your queries do not have extra characters at the beginning or within the query that could cause syntax errors.

- **Accessing JSON Arrays**:

  - Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to unnest arrays.
  - Access elements within the JSON using `f.value:"key"` syntax.

- **Casting and Data Types**:

  - Use `::STRING` to cast JSON values to strings when necessary.
  - Use `TRY_TO_DATE` instead of `TO_DATE` to safely parse dates that might have invalid formats.

- **Table Aliases**:

  - When using table aliases (e.g., `t` for the table), ensure they are correctly referenced throughout the query.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Run the Corrected Query**:

   - Copy the corrected query provided above into your SQL editor.
   - Ensure there are no extra characters at the beginning or within the query.

2. **Verify the Results**:

   - Check if the query runs without errors.
   - Verify that the results make sense and meet your requirements.

3. **Adjust as Necessary**:

   - If you need to extract additional information or apply more filters, adjust the query accordingly.
   - Remember to apply the correct syntax when dealing with JSON data and functions.

### **Example of a Successful Query Execution**

Here's an example of how the corrected query should look and execute:

```sql
SELECT
    t."publication_number",
    f.value:"language"::STRING AS "language",
    f.value:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM
    PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
WHERE
    f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'
LIMIT 100;
```

This query will:

- Return the publication number.
- Extract the language and text from the abstract.
- Only include abstracts that are in English.

### **Final Thoughts**

By ensuring your queries start correctly and using the appropriate syntax for accessing and filtering JSON data, you should be able to avoid these syntax errors.

If you continue to encounter issues, consider:

- **Checking for Hidden Characters**:

  - Sometimes, copying and pasting can introduce hidden characters or formatting issues.
  - Try typing out the query manually to avoid this.

- **Reviewing the Documentation**:

  - Refer to Snowflake's documentation on [JSON Functions and Operators](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions-json.html) for more details.

- **Seeking Further Assistance**:

  - If you have access to database logs or error codes with more detailed explanations, refer to them.
  - Consult with a database administrator or colleague who might provide additional insights.

2025-01-21 04:20:23 - root - INFO - It seems the error persists, and I'd like to help you resolve it. The error message:

```
001003 (42000): 01b9da23-0004-7ed2-0001-11c300f32c16: SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'tSELECT'.
```

indicates that there is an unexpected `'tSELECT'` at the very beginning of your SQL query. This suggests that your query might start with `'tSELECT'` instead of `'SELECT'`.

### **Possible Causes and Solutions**

#### **1. Extra Character at the Beginning**

Please check if there's an unintended `'t'` at the very start of your query. It might look something like:

```sql
tSELECT t."publication_number", ...
```

This would cause the SQL parser to see `'tSELECT'` as an invalid token.

**Solution:**

Ensure your query starts with `SELECT`, without any leading characters or whitespace:

```sql
SELECT t."publication_number", ...
```

#### **2. Incorrect Copy-Paste**

Sometimes, when copying code from certain sources (like emails or documents), hidden or unintended characters can be introduced.

**Solution:**

- **Type the Query Manually:** Try typing out the query manually in your SQL editor instead of copying and pasting it. This can eliminate any hidden characters.
  
- **Copy from Plain Text:** If you must copy, try pasting the query into a plain text editor (like Notepad) first, then copy it from there into your SQL editor.

### **Updated and Corrected Query**

Given that the `"abstract_localized"` column is an **array of JSON objects**, we need to use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to access its elements.

Here is the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT
    t."publication_number",
    f.value:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM
    PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
WHERE
    f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation**

- **`SELECT`**: Ensure there's no extra character before `SELECT`.
  
- **`t."publication_number"`**: Fetches the publication number from the alias `t`.

- **`f.value:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"`**: Extracts the `"text"` field from each JSON object where the `"language"` is `'en'`.

- **`FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t`**: Specifies the table with alias `t`.

- **`LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f`**: Expands the JSON array in `"abstract_localized"` into multiple rows, with alias `f`.

- **`WHERE f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'`**: Filters only the abstracts in English.

### **Steps to Execute the Query Successfully**

1. **Copy the Query Carefully**

   - Ensure you copy **only** the text within the code block, without any extra characters.
   - Alternatively, **type the query manually** to avoid any copy-paste issues.

2. **Verify the Start of the Query**

   - The query must start with `SELECT`.
   - There should be **no characters** or spaces before `SELECT`.

3. **Check for Hidden Characters**

   - In your SQL editor, place the cursor at the very beginning of the query and press the **Backspace** key to ensure there are no hidden characters.

4. **Execute the Query**

   - Run the query in your SQL editor.

    AND f.value:"text"::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'
GROUP BY
    "filing_month"
ORDER BY
    "filing_month"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**3. Verify the Range of Filing Dates Between 2008 and 2022:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    t."filing_date",
    TRY_TO_DATE(t."filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "filing_date_parsed"
FROM
    PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
WHERE
    TRY_TO_DATE(t."filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
ORDER BY
    "filing_date_parsed" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Key Tips**

- **Always Begin with `SELECT`:** Ensure your query starts properly without any unintended characters.

- **Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` for JSON Arrays:**

  - When dealing with arrays in a `VARIANT` column, `LATERAL FLATTEN` is necessary to expand the array into rows.

- **Access JSON Fields Correctly:**

  - Access fields within JSON objects using `f.value:"field_name"`.

- **Casting Types:**

  - Use `::STRING` to cast JSON values to strings when necessary.

- **Check for Syntax Errors:**

  - SQL compilation errors often provide the line and position where the error occurred. Use this information to pinpoint issues.

### **Final Recommendations**

- **Manually Type the Query:** This ensures that no hidden or extra characters are included.

- **Use a Reliable SQL Editor:**

  - Some editors highlight syntax errors in real-time, which can help identify issues before execution.

- **Test Incrementally:**

  - Begin with a simple query and incrementally add complexity, testing at each step.

- **Reach Out for Support:**

  - If issues persist, consider consulting with a colleague or a database administrator who can view your screen and help identify any problems.

### **Example of Successfully Executed Query**

Copy and run this query:

```sql
SELECT
    t."publication_number",
    f.value:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM
    PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
WHERE
    f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'
LIMIT 100;
```

This should execute without errors and return the publication numbers along with their English abstracts.

2025-01-21 04:21:11 - root - INFO - It looks like you're encountering a syntax error due to the way you're trying to access elements within the `"abstract_localized"` `VARIANT` column. Specifically, the issue arises because you're attempting to access a JSON key in an array of JSON objects without properly flattening the array.

### **Explanation of the Error**

- **Error Message:**

  ```
  SQL compilation error:
  syntax error line 1 at position 30 unexpected ''en''.
  syntax error line 3 at position 32 unexpected ''en''.
  ```

- **Cause:**

  - The syntax `t."abstract_localized":'en'::STRING` is invalid because:
    - `t."abstract_localized"` is an **array** of JSON objects, not a simple JSON object.
    - Using `:'en'` assumes that `'en'` is a key in a JSON object, but since `"abstract_localized"` is an array, this access method is incorrect.

### **Correct Approach**

To properly access the data within the `"abstract_localized"` array, you need to:

1. **Use `LATERAL FLATTEN`** to unnest the array, turning it into a set of rows where each row represents one JSON object within the array.

2. **Filter** the unnested data to select only the abstracts where the `"language"` is `'en'`.

3. **Extract** the `"text"` field from the JSON object to get the abstract text.

### **Corrected SQL Query**

Here's the corrected query that should resolve the syntax errors:

```sql
SELECT
    f.value:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM
    PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
WHERE
    f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'
    AND f.value:"text"::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'
LIMIT 100;
```

**If you want to include the publication number:**

```sql
SELECT
    t."publication_number",
    f.value:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM
    PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
WHERE
    f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'
    AND f.value:"text"::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation of the Corrected Query**

- **`LATERAL FLATTEN` Function:**

  - **Purpose:** Unnests the array in `"abstract_localized"` so that you can access each JSON object individually.
  - **Syntax:** `LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f`
    - `t` is the alias for the `PUBLICATIONS` table.
    - `f` is the alias for each flattened JSON object.

- **Accessing JSON Fields:**

  - **Abstract Text:** `f.value:"text"::STRING`
    - Retrieves the `"text"` field from the JSON object.
    - Casts it to `STRING` for text operations.
  - **Language Filter:** `f.value:"language"::STRING = 'en'`
    - Filters the JSON objects to only those where the `"language"` is `'en'`.

- **Filtering Abstracts Containing 'internet of things':**

  - **Condition:** `f.value:"text"::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'`
    - Performs a case-insensitive search for the phrase `'internet of things'` within the abstract text.

### **Why Your Original Query Didn't Work**

- **Incorrect Access Method:**

  - The syntax `t."abstract_localized":'en'` attempts to access a key `'en'` directly from a JSON array, which is invalid.
  - In Snowflake, when dealing with arrays, you cannot directly access an element by key without flattening the array first.

- **Proper Use of JSON Path Expressions:**

  - When accessing elements in a JSON object, the key should be enclosed in **double quotes**, not single quotes.
  - For example: `f.value:"key_name"`

### **Additional Notes**

- **Handling Nested JSON Arrays:**

  - Always use `LATERAL FLATTEN` when you need to work with arrays stored within `VARIANT` columns.
  - This allows you to treat each element of the array as a separate row, enabling you to use standard SQL operations on them.

- **Casting and Data Types:**

  - Use `::STRING` to cast `VARIANT` data to `STRING` when performing text operations like `ILIKE`.
  - Ensure keys in JSON path expressions are correctly quoted.

### **Next Steps**

- **Run the Corrected Query:**

  - Copy and paste the corrected query into your SQL editor.
  - Ensure there are no extra characters or syntax issues.

- **Verify the Results:**

  - The query should execute without errors.
  - You should receive up to 100 abstracts in English containing the phrase `'internet of things'`.

### **Final Thoughts**

By properly flattening the JSON array and accessing the fields within each JSON object, you can successfully extract and query the data you need. If you have any more questions or encounter further issues, feel free to ask!

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant tables and columns:**

- **Table**: `PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS`

  - **"country_code"**: Used to filter for U.S. publications (`"country_code" = 'US'`).
  - **"abstract_localized"**: Contains the abstract text; will be used to search for the phrase 'internet of things'.
  - **"filing_date"**: Used to extract the filing month and year between 2008 and 2022.
  - **"publication_number"**: Identifies the publications.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter publications where `"country_code" = 'US'`.
- Extract and search the abstract text for the phrase 'internet of things'.
- Filter `"filing_date"` between `20080101` and `20221231` (assuming dates are in `YYYYMMDD` format).
- Extract month and year from `"filing_date"` for grouping.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct country codes to verify U.S. publications:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **View sample filing dates to understand the date format:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "filing_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Convert filing dates from number to date format:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "filing_date", TO_DATE("filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "filing_date_parsed"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Extract abstracts to examine the structure of "abstract_localized":**

   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "abstract_localized"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Extract English abstracts from "abstract_localized":**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", t."abstract_localized":'en'::STRING AS "abstract_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
   WHERE t."abstract_localized":'en' IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Search abstracts containing 'internet of things':**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."abstract_localized":'en'::STRING AS "abstract_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
   WHERE t."abstract_localized":'en'::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count publications filed each month (overall, without filtering):**

   ```sql
   SELECT TO_CHAR(TO_DATE("filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD'), 'YYYY-MM') AS "filing_month", COUNT(*) AS "num_filings"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   GROUP BY "filing_month"
   ORDER BY "filing_month"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **View U.S. publications with abstracts containing 'internet of things':**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", t."abstract_localized":'en'::STRING AS "abstract_text", t."filing_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
   WHERE t."country_code" = 'US'
     AND t."abstract_localized":'en'::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Filter publications between 2008 and 2022 with abstracts containing 'internet of things':**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", t."abstract_localized":'en'::STRING AS "abstract_text", TO_DATE(t."filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD') AS "filing_date_parsed"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
   WHERE t."country_code" = 'US'
     AND t."abstract_localized":'en'::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'
     AND t."filing_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20221231
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count U.S. publications related to IoT filed each month from 2008 to 2022:**

    ```sql
    SELECT TO_CHAR(TO_DATE("filing_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD'), 'YYYY-MM') AS "filing_month", COUNT(*) AS "num_filings"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "country_code" = 'US'
      AND "abstract_localized":'en'::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'
      AND "filing_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20221231
    GROUP BY "filing_month"
    ORDER BY "filing_month"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Discover keys within "abstract_localized" to understand its structure:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT f.key
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Extract abstracts in all available languages:**

    ```sql
    SELECT t."publication_number", f.key AS "language", f.value::STRING AS "abstract_text"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Verify the range of filing dates between 2008 and 2022:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "filing_date"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "filing_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20221231
    ORDER BY "filing_date" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Check sample data for U.S. publications filed between 2008 and 2022:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "publication_number", "country_code", "abstract_localized", "filing_date"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "country_code" = 'US'
      AND "filing_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20221231
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Month,Year,Number_of_filings
month1:str,year1:int,num_filings1:int
month2:str,year2:int,num_filings2:int
...
```

This table represents the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-21 04:23:31 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Month,Year,Number_of_filings
month1:str,year1:int,num_filings1:int
month2:str,year2:int,num_filings2:int
...
```

This table represents the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
