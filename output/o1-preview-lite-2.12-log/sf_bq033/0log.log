Begin Exploring Related Columns
First, consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task.

**Relevant Table:**

- **`PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS`**

**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- `"abstract_localized"`: Contains the abstract text of the publication; used to search for the phrase 'internet of things'.
- `"country_code"`: Used to filter for U.S. publications (`'US'`).
- `"filing_date"`: Used to determine the filing date and extract the month and year from 2008 to 2022.
- `"publication_number"`: Identifier for the publication; may be useful for reference.
- `"application_number"`: May be used to identify unique applications.

---

Here are **15 SQL queries** to explore the data:

1. **List distinct country codes present in the publications:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve publication numbers and country codes for U.S. publications:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "country_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Display sample filing dates to understand their format:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "filing_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **View the earliest filing dates to check the date range:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "filing_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   ORDER BY "filing_date" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **View the latest filing dates to check the date range:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "filing_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   ORDER BY "filing_date" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Examine the structure of the `"abstract_localized"` column:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "abstract_localized"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Flatten the `"abstract_localized"` column to explore its contents:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.*
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Extract the abstract text from `"abstract_localized"`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", t."abstract_localized":"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve abstracts of U.S. publications:**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", t."abstract_localized":"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
   WHERE t."country_code" = 'US'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find publications where the abstract contains 'internet of things':**

    ```sql
    SELECT t."publication_number", t."abstract_localized":"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
    WHERE t."abstract_localized":"text"::STRING ILIKE '%internet%of%things%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **View filing dates for publications mentioning 'internet of things':**

    ```sql
    SELECT t."filing_date", t."abstract_localized":"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
    WHERE t."abstract_localized":"text"::STRING ILIKE '%internet%of%things%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **List distinct years from filing dates to check available years:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR("filing_date"::STRING, 1, 4)) AS "year"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    ORDER BY "year" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Count the number of filings per month and year (sample data):**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR("filing_date"::STRING, 1, 4)) AS "year",
      TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR("filing_date"::STRING, 5, 2)) AS "month",
      COUNT(*) AS "num_filings"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    GROUP BY "year", "month"
    ORDER BY "year", "month"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Identify the languages used in abstracts:**

    ```sql
    SELECT t."abstract_localized":"language"::STRING AS "language", COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
    GROUP BY "language"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Retrieve publication numbers and filing dates for U.S. publications filed between 2008 and 2022:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "publication_number", "filing_date"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "filing_date" >= 20080101 AND "filing_date" <= 20221231
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help explore the structure and contents of the relevant tables and columns, providing insight into how to extract and manipulate the necessary data for the task.Query:

The system then predicts each device&#39;s future energy usage as a function of the previous-usage patterns and further refines those predictions to account for environmental changes that will occur if the energy consumer moves to a new location. The system computes total energy costs for the devices for each candidate energy supplier or service plan at the consumer&#39;s final location, selects an optimal candidate that offers the lowest cost, and automatically switches the devices&#39; energy source to the optimal candidate."

20160913,"An 8.1 nJ/bit 2.4 GHz receiver with integrated digital baseband supporting Q-QPSK DSSS modulation compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard is presented that targets short-range, Internet of Things applications (IoTs). The sensitivity of a wireless communication receiver in general trades with power consumption. This receiver exploits this tradeoff to achieve a total power consumption of 2.02 mW including ADCs and digital baseband processing, at a sensitivity of −52.5 dBm at 250 Kbps. The energy-efficiency of the radio frequency (RF) front-end alone is nearly two times better than the prior art. The receiver was fabricated in 65 nm CMOS with an area of 0.86 mm 2 ."

Task: How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Month,Year,Number_of_filings
month1:str,year1:int,num_filings1:int
month2:str,year2:int,num_filings2:int
...
```

This table represents the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-21 04:23:42 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Month,Year,Number_of_filings
month1:str,year1:int,num_filings1:int
month2:str,year2:int,num_filings2:int
...
```

This table represents the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-21 04:24:07 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Month,Year,Number_of_filings
month1:str,year1:int,num_filings1:int
month2:str,year2:int,num_filings2:int
...
```

This table represents the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-21 04:26:17 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Month,Year,Number_of_filings
month1:str,year1:int,num_filings1:int
month2:str,year2:int,num_filings2:int
...
```

This table represents the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
