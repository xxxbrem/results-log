Task: Could you provide a combined 2021 report comparing racial (Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White) and gender (U.S. Women, U.S. Men) distributions across Google’s overall workforce hiring, Google’s overall workforce representation, and the BLS data specifically for the technology sectors defined as Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or Computer systems design and related services?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Group,Workforce_Hiring_Percentage,Workforce_Representation_Percentage,BLS_Percentage
Asian,47.5,42.3,21.4
Black,5.5,4.4,9.0
Hispanic/Latinx,8.8,6.8,8.4
White,35.9,46.2,62.7
U.S. Women,32.5,30.0,25.2
U.S. Men,67.5,70.0,74.8
```

**Explanation:**

The table above compares the racial and gender distributions across Google's overall workforce hiring and representation in 2021 with the corresponding percentages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data for technology sectors, specifically Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or computer systems design and related services.

- **Workforce Hiring Percentage**: The percentage of new hires at Google in the U.S. in 2021 for each group.
- **Workforce Representation Percentage**: The overall percentage representation of each group in Google's U.S. workforce in 2021.
- **BLS Percentage**: The percentage of each group employed in computer and mathematical occupations in the U.S. workforce in 2021, according to BLS data.

This comparison highlights the disparities and similarities in representation among different racial and gender groups within Google's hiring and workforce compared to the broader U.S. technology sector..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...)

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 21:17:31 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a combined 2021 report comparing racial (Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White) and gender (U.S. Women, U.S. Men) distributions across Google’s overall workforce hiring, Google’s overall workforce representation, and the BLS data specifically for the technology sectors defined as Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or Computer systems design and related services?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

**Explanation:**

The table above compares the racial and gender distributions across Google's overall workforce hiring and representation in 2021 with the corresponding percentages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data for technology sectors, specifically Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or computer systems design and related services.

- **Workforce Hiring Percentage**: The percentage of new hires at Google in the U.S. in 2021 for each group.
- **Workforce Representation Percentage**: The overall percentage representation of each group in Google's U.S. workforce in 2021.
- **BLS Percentage**: The percentage of each group employed in computer and mathematical occupations in the U.S. workforce in 2021, according to BLS data.

This comparison highlights the disparities and similarities in representation among different racial and gender groups within Google's hiring and workforce compared to the broader U.S. technology sector. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-10 21:19:51 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a combined 2021 report comparing racial (Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White) and gender (U.S. Women, U.S. Men) distributions across Google’s overall workforce hiring, Google’s overall workforce representation, and the BLS data specifically for the technology sectors defined as Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or Computer systems design and related services?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Group,Workforce_Hiring_Percentage,Workforce_Representation_Percentage,BLS_Percentage
Asian,47.5,42.3,21.4
Black,5.5,4.4,9.0

U.S. Women,32.5,30.0,25.2
U.S. Men,67.5,70.0,74.8
```

**Explanation:**

The table above compares the racial and gender distributions across Google's overall workforce hiring and representation in 2021 with the corresponding percentages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data for technology sectors, specifically Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or computer systems design and related services.

- **Workforce Hiring Percentage**: The percentage of new hires at Google in the U.S. in 2021 for each group.
- **Workforce Representation Percentage**: The overall percentage representation of each group in Google's U.S. workforce in 2021.
- **BLS Percentage**: The percentage of each group employed in computer and mathematical occupations in the U.S. workforce in 2021, according to BLS data.

This comparison highlights the disparities and similarities in representation among different racial and gender groups within Google's hiring and workforce compared to the broader U.S. technology sector. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

**Explanation:**

The table above compares the racial and gender distributions across Google's overall workforce hiring and representation in 2021 with the corresponding percentages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data for technology sectors, specifically Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or computer systems design and related services.

- **Workforce Hiring Percentage**: The percentage of new hires at Google in the U.S. in 2021 for each group.
- **Workforce Representation Percentage**: The overall percentage representation of each group in Google's U.S. workforce in 2021.
- **BLS Percentage**: The percentage of each group employed in computer and mathematical occupations in the U.S. workforce in 2021, according to BLS data.

This comparison highlights the disparities and similarities in representation among different racial and gender groups within Google's hiring and workforce compared to the broader U.S. technology sector. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
