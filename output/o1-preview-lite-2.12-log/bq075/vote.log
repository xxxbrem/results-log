After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Industry Selection for BLS Data:**
   - **`1result.sql`:** This query filters the BLS data using `industry = 'Computer and peripheral equipment manufacturing'`. This industry does not match the specified technology sectors in the question, which are:
     - **Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals**
     - **Computer systems design and related services**
   - **`2result.sql`:** This query correctly filters the BLS data using `industry_group IN ('Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals', 'Computer systems design and related services')`. This ensures that the data pertains specifically to the specified technology sectors.

2. **Comprehensive Data Aggregation:**
   - **`2result.sql`:** By using `AVG` on the BLS percentages across the specified industries, it accurately represents the combined demographic data for these sectors.
   - **`1result.sql`:** It only selects data from a single industry (`'Computer and peripheral equipment manufacturing'`), which is not one of the specified sectors, leading to inaccurate comparisons.

3. **Consistency with the Task Requirements:**
   - **`2result.sql`:** Aligns with the task by providing a combined report that compares the racial and gender distributions across Google's hiring, representation, and the BLS data for the specified sectors.
   - **`1result.sql`:** Does not fulfill the requirement of focusing on the specified technology sectors, thus not providing a correct comparison.

4. **Accuracy of Results:**
   - **`2result.csv` Results:**
     ```
     Group,Workforce_Hiring_Percentage,Workforce_Representation_Percentage,BLS_Percentage
     Asian,42.8,42.3,23.7
     Black,8.8,4.4,7.0
     Hispanic/Latinx,8.8,6.4,8.1
     White,44.5,50.4,66.4
     U.S. Women,33.1,32.2,29.1
     U.S. Men,66.9,67.8,70.9
     ```
     - These results are more accurate as they reflect the demographics of the specified technology sectors.
   - **`1result.csv` Results:**
     ```
     Group,Workforce_Hiring_Percentage,Workforce_Representation_Percentage,BLS_Percentage
     U.S. Women,33.1,32.2,31.6
     U.S. Men,66.9,67.8,68.4
     Hispanic/Latinx,8.8,6.4,7.0
     White,44.5,50.4,51.6
     Black,8.8,4.4,5.9
     Asian,42.8,42.3,37.4
     ```
     - The BLS percentages here may not accurately represent the specified sectors since they are derived from an incorrect industry.

**Conclusion:**

`2result.sql` is the correct SQL query because it accurately filters and aggregates the BLS data for the specified technology sectors, ensuring that the comparison with Google's workforce data is valid and meaningful.
