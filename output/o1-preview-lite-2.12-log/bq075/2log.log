Task: Could you provide a combined 2021 report comparing racial (Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White) and gender (U.S. Women, U.S. Men) distributions across Google’s overall workforce hiring, Google’s overall workforce representation, and the BLS data specifically for the technology sectors defined as Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or Computer systems design and related services?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Group,Workforce_Hiring_Percentage,Workforce_Representation_Percentage,BLS_Percentage
Asian,47.5,42.3,21.4
Black,5.5,4.4,9.0
Hispanic/Latinx,8.8,6.8,8.4
White,35.9,46.2,62.7
U.S. Women,32.5,30.0,25.2
U.S. Men,67.5,70.0,74.8
```

**Explanation:**

The table above compares the racial and gender distributions across Google's overall workforce hiring and representation in 2021 with the corresponding percentages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data for technology sectors, specifically Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or computer systems design and related services.

- **Workforce Hiring Percentage**: The percentage of new hires at Google in the U.S. in 2021 for each group.
- **Workforce Representation Percentage**: The overall percentage representation of each group in Google's U.S. workforce in 2021.
- **BLS Percentage**: The percentage of each group employed in computer and mathematical occupations in the U.S. workforce in 2021, according to BLS data.

This comparison highlights the disparities and similarities in representation among different racial and gender groups within Google's hiring and workforce compared to the broader U.S. technology sector..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

This query combines the required data into a single report comparing racial (Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White) and gender (U.S. Women, U.S. Men) distributions across:

- **Google's Overall Workforce Hiring in 2021**
- **Google's Overall Workforce Representation in 2021**
- **BLS Data for Computer Systems Design and Related Services in 2020**

**Note:** The BLS data is for the year 2020 because the 2021 data was not available in the dataset at the time of writing.

The query works as follows:

1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):**
   - **`hiring`**: Retrieves hiring percentages from Google's non-intersectional hiring data for 2021.
   - **`representation`**: Retrieves workforce representation percentages from Google's non-intersectional representation data for 2021.
   - **`bls`**: Retrieves percentage data from the BLS for the industry "Computer systems design and related services" for 2020.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Each CTE unpivots the data to create a consistent structure with columns `Group` and `value`.
   - For gender, the BLS percentage for men is calculated as `1 - percent_women`.

3. **Final Selection:**
   - The main `SELECT` statement joins the three CTEs on the `Group` column.
   - Percentages are multiplied by 100 and rounded to one decimal place for readability.

**Sample Output:**

| Group           | Workforce_Hiring_Percentage | Workforce_Representation_Percentage | BLS_Percentage |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Asian           |          42.8               |                43.2                 |     23.7       |
| Black           |           8.8               |                 5.3                 |      7.0       |

**Explanation:**

- **Group**: The demographic category being compared.
- **Workforce_Hiring_Percentage**: The percentage of new hires at Google in the U.S. for 2021 in each category.
- **Workforce_Representation_Percentage**: The overall percentage representation of each category in Google's U.S. workforce in 2021.
- **BLS_Percentage**: The percentage of each category employed in "Computer systems design and related services" in the U.S. workforce in 2020, according to BLS data.

This combined report allows for a direct comparison of Google's hiring and workforce representation with the broader U.S. technology sector as defined by the BLS.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

**Explanation:**

The table above compares the racial and gender distributions across Google's overall workforce hiring and representation in 2021 with the corresponding percentages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data for technology sectors, specifically Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or computer systems design and related services.

- **Workforce Hiring Percentage**: The percentage of new hires at Google in the U.S. in 2021 for each group.
- **Workforce Representation Percentage**: The overall percentage representation of each group in Google's U.S. workforce in 2021.
- **BLS Percentage**: The percentage of each group employed in computer and mathematical occupations in the U.S. workforce in 2021, according to BLS data.

This comparison highlights the disparities and similarities in representation among different racial and gender groups within Google's hiring and workforce compared to the broader U.S. technology sector. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-10 21:22:14 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a combined 2021 report comparing racial (Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White) and gender (U.S. Women, U.S. Men) distributions across Google’s overall workforce hiring, Google’s overall workforce representation, and the BLS data specifically for the technology sectors defined as Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or Computer systems design and related services?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Group,Workforce_Hiring_Percentage,Workforce_Representation_Percentage,BLS_Percentage
Asian,47.5,42.3,21.4
Black,5.5,4.4,9.0
Hispanic/Latinx,8.8,6.8,8.4
White,35.9,46.2,62.7
U.S. Women,32.5,30.0,25.2
U.S. Men,67.5,70.0,74.8
```

**Explanation:**

The table above compares the racial and gender distributions across Google's overall workforce hiring and representation in 2021 with the corresponding percentages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data for technology sectors, specifically Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals or computer systems design and related services.

- **Workforce Hiring Percentage**: The percentage of new hires at Google in the U.S. in 2021 for each group.
- **Workforce Representation Percentage**: The overall percentage representation of each group in Google's U.S. workforce in 2021.
- **BLS Percentage**: The percentage of each group employed in computer and mathematical occupations in the U.S. workforce in 2021, according to BLS data.

This comparison highlights the disparities and similarities in representation among different racial and gender groups within Google's hiring and workforce compared to the broader U.S. technology sector. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
