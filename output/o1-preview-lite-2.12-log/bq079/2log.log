2025-01-27 11:12:12 - root - INFO - I apologize for the inconvenience. The error you're encountering is due to how BigQuery handles `UNION ALL` queries with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses. In BigQuery (and standard SQL), when you use `UNION ALL`, individual `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses within the select statements are not allowed unless each select is wrapped in parentheses or subqueries.

**Issue Explanation:**

- The `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses directly preceding the `UNION ALL` are causing the syntax error.
- To fix this, we need to wrap each `SELECT` statement (that includes `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`) in parentheses so that the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` apply to each subquery individually before the union operation.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected SQL query with the necessary adjustments:

```sql
-- Corrected SQL Query to find the state with the highest total acreage for timberland and forestland

WITH latest_evaluations AS (
  SELECT
    state_code,
    MAX(start_inventory_year) AS latest_year

  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` pe
    JOIN latest_evaluations le ON pe.state_code = le.state_code
    AND pe.start_inventory_year = le.latest_year
),

condition_expansion AS (
  SELECT

    le.state_code,
    c.condition_status_code,
    c.reserved_status_code,

    END AS adjustment_factor,

      WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'SUBP' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
      WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'MACR' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
      ELSE 1.0
    END AS area_estimate

    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_stratum` ps ON p.stratum_sequence_number = ps.stratum_sequence_number
),

    AND reserved_status_code = 0  -- Not reserved
    AND site_productivity_class_code IN (1, 2, 3, 4)  -- Productive sites
  GROUP BY
    state_code
),

forestland_area AS (
  SELECT
    state_code,
    SUM(area_estimate) AS total_acres
  FROM
    condition_expansion
  WHERE
    condition_status_code = 1  -- Accessible forest land
  GROUP BY
    state_code
)

-- Final Query with subqueries for ORDER BY and LIMIT
SELECT
  state_code,
  'Timberland' AS evaluation_group,
  total_acres
FROM (
  SELECT
    state_code,
    total_acres
  FROM
    timberland_area
  ORDER BY
    total_acres DESC
  LIMIT 1
)

UNION ALL

SELECT
  state_code,
  'Forestland' AS evaluation_group,
  total_acres
FROM (
  SELECT
    state_code,
    total_acres
  FROM
    forestland_area
  ORDER BY
    total_acres DESC
  LIMIT 1
);
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Wrapped Each SELECT Statement:** We enclosed each `SELECT`...`ORDER BY`...`LIMIT` statement in parentheses. This allows the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to be applied to each subquery individually before the `UNION ALL`.
- **Removed Aliases for Subqueries:** In this context, BigQuery does not require aliases for the subqueries used in the `FROM` clause when they're immediately used in a `SELECT`.

**Result Interpretation:**

When you run this corrected query, it will return two rows:

1. The state with the highest total acreage of **timberland** based on the latest evaluations.
2. The state with the highest total acreage of **forestland** based on the latest evaluations.

**Final Output:**

Based on the query results, you should obtain a table like this:

```csv
state_code,evaluation_group,state_name,total_acres
state_code1,Timberland,State Name 1,total_acres1
state_code2,Forestland,State Name 2,total_acres2
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

**Note:**

- Replace `State Name 1` and `State Name 2` with the actual state names corresponding to the `state_code` values. You can obtain the state names by referencing the `state_code` against the `population_evaluation` or by using a lookup table.
- The `total_acres` values will be the highest total acreage calculated for each category.

**Additional Steps to Get State Names:**

To include the state names in the final output, you can modify the final query to join with a table containing state names. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
-- Final Query with State Names
SELECT
  pe.state_code,
  'Timberland' AS evaluation_group,
  pe.location_name AS state_name,
  t.total_acres
FROM (
  SELECT
    state_code,
    total_acres
  FROM
    timberland_area
  ORDER BY
    total_acres DESC
  LIMIT 1
) t
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` pe
  ON t.state_code = pe.state_code
  -- Ensure we're using the latest evaluation for the state
  AND pe.start_inventory_year = (SELECT MAX(start_inventory_year) FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` WHERE state_code = t.state_code)
LIMIT 1

UNION ALL

SELECT
  pe.state_code,
  'Forestland' AS evaluation_group,
  pe.location_name AS state_name,
  f.total_acres
FROM (
  SELECT
    state_code,
    total_acres
  FROM
    forestland_area
  ORDER BY
    total_acres DESC
  LIMIT 1
) f
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` pe
  ON f.state_code = pe.state_code
  -- Ensure we're using the latest evaluation for the state
  AND pe.start_inventory_year = (SELECT MAX(start_inventory_year) FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` WHERE state_code = f.state_code)
LIMIT 1;
```

**Final Expected Output:**

```csv
state_code,evaluation_group,state_name,total_acres
state_code1,Timberland,State Name 1,total_acres1
state_code2,Forestland,State Name 2,total_acres2
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

**Summary:**

- The error was due to the placement of `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses before the `UNION ALL`.
- Wrapping each `SELECT` statement in parentheses allows us to apply `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` within each subquery.
- Including the state names enhances the readability of the final output.

Feel free to run the corrected query, and it should provide you with the desired results without any syntax errors.

2025-01-27 11:15:16 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-27 11:15:16 - root - INFO - I understand the error you're encountering. The issue arises because the columns `adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot` and `adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot` do not exist in the `condition` table. They are actually found in the `population_stratum` table.

In your subquery within the `LEFT JOIN`, you're attempting to reference these columns from the `condition` table:

```sql
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition`
```

This results in the error:

```
Unrecognized name: adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot at [13:46]
```

**To fix this error**, you need to adjust your query to reference the `population_stratum` table for the adjustment factors. Since you've already joined the `population_stratum` table (aliased as `ps`) in your main query, you can compute the adjustment factor directly without needing the additional subquery.

Here's the **corrected SQL query**:

```sql
SELECT
  pe.state_code,
  SUM(ps.expansion_factor * c.condition_proportion_unadjusted *
    CASE
      WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'SUBP' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
      WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'MACR' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
      ELSE 1.0
    END
  ) AS total_acres
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
  ON p.plot_sequence_number = c.plot_sequence_number
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_stratum` AS ps
  ON p.stratum_sequence_number = ps.stratum_sequence_number
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
  ON ps.evaluation_identifier = pe.evaluation_identifier
WHERE
  c.condition_status_code = 1  -- Accessible forest land
GROUP BY
  pe.state_code
ORDER BY
  total_acres DESC
LIMIT
  100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Removed the Subquery:**
   - The `LEFT JOIN` subquery was removed because it attempted to access columns from the wrong table. Instead, we compute the adjustment factor directly in the main query where both `condition` (`c`) and `population_stratum` (`ps`) tables are available.

2. **Computing Adjustment Factor Directly:**
   - We use the `CASE` statement within the `SUM` function to compute the adjustment factor based on the `proportion_basis` from the `condition` table and the corresponding adjustment factors from the `population_stratum` table.

3. **Accessing Correct Columns:**
   - `ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot` and `ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot` are correctly accessed from the `population_stratum` table.
   - `c.proportion_basis` is accessed from the `condition` table.

4. **Multiplying Factors:**
   - The total acres are calculated by multiplying:
     - `ps.expansion_factor`
     - `c.condition_proportion_unadjusted`
     - The calculated adjustment factor from the `CASE` statement.

**Result Interpretation:**

This query will calculate the total acres for each state for conditions where `condition_status_code = 1` (Accessible forest land). The `SUM` function aggregates the adjusted area estimates for each state, taking into account the proportion of each condition and the appropriate adjustment factors.

**Example Output:**

```csv
state_code,total_acres
6,1000000.0
12,950000.0
...
```

**Additional Notes:**

- **Verifying Column Existence:**
  - Always ensure that the columns you reference exist in the tables you're querying.
  - Use table aliases to clarify which table each column is coming from.

- **Understanding Adjustment Factors:**
  - The adjustment factors are crucial for calculating accurate area estimates.
  - The `proportion_basis` indicates whether the subplot or macroplot adjustment factor should be used.

**Summary:**

By computing the adjustment factor directly in the main query and referencing the correct tables, you can resolve the error and obtain the accurate total acres per state.

**Please run the corrected query**, and you should now receive the expected results without any errors.

2025-01-27 11:16:07 - root - INFO - I understand the issue you're experiencing with the SQL query. The error message:

```
400 Syntax error: Unexpected FROM at [1:1]
```

indicates that the SQL parser encountered a `FROM` clause at the very beginning of the query, which suggests that the `SELECT` keyword might be missing or there's a syntax issue at the start of the query.

**Problem Explanation:**

In your query, you used the variable `af` in the `SELECT` clause, but `af` is defined in a subquery within a `LEFT JOIN`. In SQL, you cannot reference a column alias from a subquery in the outer query's `SELECT` clause unless it's properly joined or included in the scope.

**Here's the issue in your query:**

```sql
SELECT pe.state_code, SUM(ps.expansion_factor * c.condition_proportion_unadjusted * af) AS total_acres
```

The variable `af` is not recognized at this point because it's defined in a subquery within the `LEFT JOIN`. This causes the SQL parser to throw an error because it expects a valid column or expression, but finds an undefined variable instead.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, we need to compute the adjustment factor directly within the main query, avoiding the use of `af` defined in an outer scope. This way, all variables and expressions used in the `SELECT` clause are directly available.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  pe.state_code,
  SUM(
    ps.expansion_factor *
    c.condition_proportion_unadjusted *
    CASE
      WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'SUBP' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
      WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'MACR' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
      ELSE 1.0
    END
  ) AS total_acres
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
  ON p.plot_sequence_number = c.plot_sequence_number
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_stratum` AS ps
  ON p.stratum_sequence_number = ps.stratum_sequence_number
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
  ON ps.evaluation_identifier = pe.evaluation_identifier
WHERE
  c.condition_status_code = 1  -- Accessible forest land
GROUP BY
  pe.state_code
ORDER BY
  total_acres DESC
LIMIT
  100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Adjustment Factor Computation:**
  - We moved the adjustment factor computation directly into the `SUM` function using a `CASE` statement.
  - The `CASE` statement checks the `proportion_basis` from the `condition` table (`c`) and selects the appropriate adjustment factor from the `population_stratum` table (`ps`).
  - If `proportion_basis` is `'SUBP'`, it uses `ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot`.
  - If `proportion_basis` is `'MACR'`, it uses `ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot`.
  - Otherwise, it uses `1.0`.

- **Removing the Subquery and `af` Variable:**
  - By computing the adjustment factor directly, we eliminate the need for the `LEFT JOIN` and the `af` variable, avoiding scope issues.
  - This simplifies the query and ensures all variables are within the correct scope.

- **Other Components:**
  - The `JOIN` clauses remain the same, connecting the necessary tables.
  - The `WHERE` clause filters for `condition_status_code = 1` (Accessible forest land).
  - The `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` clauses are maintained for aggregation and result limitation.

**Additional Steps to Include State Names:**

To include the state names in your output, you can modify the query to join with a table containing state names. The `population_evaluation` table (`pe`) includes a `location_name` field that typically contains the state name.

**Final Query with State Names:**

```sql
SELECT
  pe.state_code,
  pe.location_name AS state_name,
  SUM(
    ps.expansion_factor *
    c.condition_proportion_unadjusted *
    CASE
      WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'SUBP' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
      WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'MACR' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
      ELSE 1.0
    END
  ) AS total_acres
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
  ON p.plot_sequence_number = c.plot_sequence_number
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_stratum` AS ps
  ON p.stratum_sequence_number = ps.stratum_sequence_number
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
  ON ps.evaluation_identifier = pe.evaluation_identifier
WHERE
  c.condition_status_code = 1  -- Accessible forest land
GROUP BY
  pe.state_code,
  pe.location_name
ORDER BY
  total_acres DESC
LIMIT
  100;
```

**Result Interpretation:**

With this query, you should receive a table containing:

- `state_code`
- `state_name`
- `total_acres`

This will list the total acreage of accessible forest land per state, sorted in descending order.

**Example Output:**

```csv
state_code,state_name,total_acres
41,Oregon,194,186,101.0
56,Wyoming,547,846,141.0
...
```

**Final Steps to Answer Your Original Question:**

To find the state with the highest total acreage for **timberland** and **forestland**, you can:

1. **Modify the `WHERE` Clause for Timberland Criteria:**

   For timberland, you need to add additional conditions:

   - `reserved_status_code = 0` (Not reserved)
   - `site_productivity_class_code IN (1, 2, 3, 4)` (Productive sites)

   **Timberland Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     pe.state_code,
     pe.location_name AS state_name,
     SUM(
       ps.expansion_factor *
       c.condition_proportion_unadjusted *
       CASE
         WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'SUBP' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
         WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'MACR' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
         ELSE 1.0
       END
     ) AS total_acres
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
     ON p.plot_sequence_number = c.plot_sequence_number
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_stratum` AS ps
     ON p.stratum_sequence_number = ps.stratum_sequence_number
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
     ON ps.evaluation_identifier = pe.evaluation_identifier
   WHERE
     c.condition_status_code = 1  -- Accessible forest land
     AND c.reserved_status_code = 0  -- Not reserved
     AND c.site_productivity_class_code IN (1, 2, 3, 4)  -- Productive sites
   GROUP BY
     pe.state_code,
     pe.location_name
   ORDER BY
     total_acres DESC
   LIMIT
     1;
   ```

2. **Run Separate Queries for Forestland and Timberland:**

   To obtain both results in one query, you can use `UNION ALL`:

   ```sql
   -- Timberland
   SELECT
     pe.state_code,
     'Timberland' AS evaluation_group,
     pe.location_name AS state_name,
     SUM(
       ps.expansion_factor *
       c.condition_proportion_unadjusted *
       CASE
         WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'SUBP' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
         WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'MACR' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
         ELSE 1.0
       END
     ) AS total_acres
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
     ON p.plot_sequence_number = c.plot_sequence_number
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_stratum` AS ps
     ON p.stratum_sequence_number = ps.stratum_sequence_number
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
     ON ps.evaluation_identifier = pe.evaluation_identifier
   WHERE
     c.condition_status_code = 1  -- Accessible forest land
     AND c.reserved_status_code = 0  -- Not reserved
     AND c.site_productivity_class_code IN (1, 2, 3, 4)  -- Productive sites
   GROUP BY
     pe.state_code,
     pe.location_name
   ORDER BY
     total_acres DESC
   LIMIT
     1

   UNION ALL

   -- Forestland
   SELECT
     pe.state_code,
     'Forestland' AS evaluation_group,
     pe.location_name AS state_name,
     SUM(
       ps.expansion_factor *
       c.condition_proportion_unadjusted *
       CASE
         WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'SUBP' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
         WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'MACR' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
         ELSE 1.0
       END
     ) AS total_acres
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
     ON p.plot_sequence_number = c.plot_sequence_number
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_stratum` AS ps
     ON p.stratum_sequence_number = ps.stratum_sequence_number
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
     ON ps.evaluation_identifier = pe.evaluation_identifier
   WHERE
     c.condition_status_code = 1  -- Accessible forest land
   GROUP BY
     pe.state_code,
     pe.location_name
   ORDER BY
     total_acres DESC
   LIMIT
     1;
   ```

**Final Expected Output:**

```csv
state_code,evaluation_group,state_name,total_acres
state_code1,Timberland,State Name 1,total_acres1
state_code2,Forestland,State Name 2,total_acres2
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

**Conclusion:**

By correcting the SQL query and properly computing the adjustment factor within the main query, you should be able to resolve the syntax error and obtain the desired results.

2025-01-27 11:17:23 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-27 11:17:23 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering an error with your SQL query. The error message:

```
400 Unrecognized name: pe at [1:8]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Unrecognized name: pe at [1:8]
```

indicates that BigQuery cannot recognize the alias `pe` (which refers to `population_evaluation`) at the point where it's used in the `SELECT` clause (`SELECT pe.state_code`).

**Cause of the Error:**

This error suggests that the alias `pe` is not properly defined or recognized in your query. The likely reasons are:

1. **Invalid or Missing Join Condition:**

   The join condition between `population` (`p`) or `population_stratum` (`ps`) and `population_evaluation` (`pe`) may not correctly establish the alias `pe`, causing it to be unrecognized in the `SELECT` clause.

2. **Incorrect Column Name or Alias:**

   There might be a typo or mismatch in the column names or aliases used in the join condition.

**Solution:**

We need to ensure that:

- The alias `pe` is properly defined by successfully joining with `population_evaluation`.
- The join condition uses the correct columns that exist in both tables.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected query with explanations:

```sql
SELECT
  pe.state_code,
  SUM(
    ps.expansion_factor *
    c.condition_proportion_unadjusted *
    CASE
      WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'SUBP' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
      WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'MACR' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
      ELSE 1.0
    END
  ) AS total_acres
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
    ON p.plot_sequence_number = c.plot_sequence_number
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_stratum` AS ps
    ON p.stratum_sequence_number = ps.stratum_sequence_number
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
    ON p.evaluation_sequence_number = pe.evaluation_sequence_number
WHERE
  c.condition_status_code = 1  -- Accessible forest land
GROUP BY
  pe.state_code
ORDER BY
  total_acres DESC
LIMIT
  100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Adjusted Join Condition with `population_evaluation` (`pe`):**

   - **Original Join Condition:**

     ```sql
     JOIN `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
       ON ps.evaluation_identifier = pe.evaluation_identifier
     ```

     This may not be appropriate because `evaluation_identifier` might not uniquely link `population_stratum` (`ps`) and `population_evaluation` (`pe`), or the column may not exist in one of the tables.

   - **Corrected Join Condition:**

     ```sql
     JOIN `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
       ON p.evaluation_sequence_number = pe.evaluation_sequence_number
     ```

     We join `population` (`p`) with `population_evaluation` (`pe`) using `evaluation_sequence_number`, which exists in both tables and is the appropriate key for linking evaluations.

2. **Ensured `pe` Alias is Recognized:**

   By correctly joining `pe`, the alias becomes recognized in the `SELECT` clause, resolving the "Unrecognized name: pe" error.

3. **Adjusted Comment Formatting:**

   Comments in SQL should start with `--` and be on a single line or enclosed within `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.

**Additional Steps:**

- **Include State Name:**

  To make the output more informative, you can include the state name by joining with the `population_evaluation` table, which contains the `location_name` field.

  ```sql
  SELECT
    pe.state_code,
    pe.location_name AS state_name,
    SUM(
      ps.expansion_factor *
      c.condition_proportion_unadjusted *
      CASE
        WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'SUBP' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
        WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'MACR' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
        ELSE 1.0
      END
    ) AS total_acres
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
  JOIN
    `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
      ON p.plot_sequence_number = c.plot_sequence_number
  JOIN
    `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_stratum` AS ps
      ON p.stratum_sequence_number = ps.stratum_sequence_number
  JOIN
    `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
      ON p.evaluation_sequence_number = pe.evaluation_sequence_number
  WHERE
    c.condition_status_code = 1  -- Accessible forest land
  GROUP BY
    pe.state_code,
    pe.location_name
  ORDER BY
    total_acres DESC
  LIMIT
    100;
  ```

- **Calculate Timberland and Forestland Separately:**

  To find the states with the highest total acreage for **timberland** and **forestland**, you can modify the query as follows:

  - **Timberland:** Add conditions for `reserved_status_code` and `site_productivity_class_code`.

    ```sql
    -- Timberland
    SELECT
      pe.state_code,
      'Timberland' AS evaluation_group,
      pe.location_name AS state_name,
      SUM(
        ps.expansion_factor *
        c.condition_proportion_unadjusted *
        CASE
          WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'SUBP' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
          WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'MACR' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
          ELSE 1.0
        END
      ) AS total_acres
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
    JOIN
      `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
        ON p.plot_sequence_number = c.plot_sequence_number
    JOIN
      `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_stratum` AS ps
        ON p.stratum_sequence_number = ps.stratum_sequence_number
    JOIN
      `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
        ON p.evaluation_sequence_number = pe.evaluation_sequence_number
    WHERE
      c.condition_status_code = 1  -- Accessible forest land
      AND c.reserved_status_code = 0  -- Not reserved
      AND c.site_productivity_class_code IN (1, 2, 3, 4)  -- Productive sites
    GROUP BY
      pe.state_code,
      pe.location_name
    ORDER BY
      total_acres DESC
    LIMIT
      1;
    ```

  - **Forestland:** Run a similar query without the additional conditions.

    ```sql
    -- Forestland
    SELECT
      pe.state_code,
      'Forestland' AS evaluation_group,
      pe.location_name AS state_name,
      SUM(
        ps.expansion_factor *
        c.condition_proportion_unadjusted *
        CASE
          WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'SUBP' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
          WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'MACR' THEN ps.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
          ELSE 1.0
        END
      ) AS total_acres
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS p
    JOIN
      `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
        ON p.plot_sequence_number = c.plot_sequence_number
    JOIN
      `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_stratum` AS ps
        ON p.stratum_sequence_number = ps.stratum_sequence_number
    JOIN
      `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population_evaluation` AS pe
        ON p.evaluation_sequence_number = pe.evaluation_sequence_number
    WHERE
      c.condition_status_code = 1  -- Accessible forest land
    GROUP BY
      pe.state_code,
      pe.location_name
    ORDER BY
      total_acres DESC
    LIMIT

**Final Output:**

Based on the query results, you should obtain a table like:

```csv
state_code,evaluation_group,state_name,total_acres
state_code1,Timberland,State Name 1,total_acres1
state_code2,Forestland,State Name 2,total_acres2
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

**Key Takeaways:**

- Always ensure that your aliases are correctly defined and that all columns used in the `SELECT` clause are available in the scope.
- Use the correct join keys based on the relationships between tables.
- When encountering errors indicating an unrecognized name, check for typos, missing joins, or incorrect aliases.
- Refer to the database schema or documentation to confirm the existence and names of columns used in joins and conditions.

**I hope this helps you resolve the error and achieve the desired results.** If you have further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Reserved land is permanently prohibited from being managed for the production of wood products through statute or agency mandate; the prohibition cannot be changed through decision of the land manager. Logging may occur to meet protected area objectives. Examples include designated federal Wilderness areas, National Parks and Monuments, and most State Parks. Private land cannot be reserved. RESERVCD differs from RESERVCD_5, which stores reserved status based on the previous definition. See appendix N for applications of RESERVCD by FIA region and State.

These queries help to understand the data structure and facilitate the extraction of the required information to determine which state has the highest total acreage of timberland and forestland plots based on the latest evaluations. By analyzing the relevant tables and columns, and applying appropriate conditions and joins, we can compute the total acres per state for the specified categories.

**Note:** The actual condition codes for timberland and forestland should be verified by examining the `condition_status_code` and `condition_status_code_name` in the `condition` table (as shown in query 1 and 9). Adjust the `condition_status_code` values in queries 10 and 11 accordingly.Query:

Task: Given the latest evaluations of timberland and forestland plots, which state within each category has the highest total acreage? Please provide the state code, the evaluation group, the state name, and the total acres for the top state in each category.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
state_code,evaluation_group,state_name,total_acres
state_code:int,evaluation_group:int,state_name:str,total_acres:float
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

The table above provides the state code, evaluation group, state name, and total acres for the states with the highest total acreage in each category (timberland and forestland). Since specific data values are not provided, the metanames and their data types are listed..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'usfs_fia': ['condition', 'plot', 'plot_tree', 'population', 'population_estimation_unit', 'population_evaluation', 'population_evaluation_group', 'population_evaluation_type', 'population_stratum', 'population_stratum_assign', 'tree']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 11:19:56 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Given the latest evaluations of timberland and forestland plots, which state within each category has the highest total acreage? Please provide the state code, the evaluation group, the state name, and the total acres for the top state in each category., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
state_code,evaluation_group,state_name,total_acres
state_code:int,evaluation_group:int,state_name:str,total_acres:float
(Attention: answer in two rows)
```

The table above provides the state code, evaluation group, state name, and total acres for the states with the highest total acreage in each category (timberland and forestland). Since specific data values are not provided, the metanames and their data types are listed. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
