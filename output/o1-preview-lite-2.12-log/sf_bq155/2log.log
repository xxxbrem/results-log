2025-02-11 14:04:08 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is because the `LOG10` function is not recognized in your SQL environment. In Snowflake SQL, to compute the logarithm base 10, you should use the `LOG` function with two arguments: the base and the value.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "r"."case_barcode", LOG(10, "r"."HTSeq__Counts" + 1) AS "log_expression"
FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION" AS "r"
WHERE "r"."gene_name" = 'SNORA31'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- In Snowflake SQL, the `LOG` function can take two arguments: `LOG(base, value)`.
  - `LOG(10, x)` computes the logarithm of `x` with base 10.
  - Alternatively, `LOG(e, x)` computes the natural logarithm of `x`, where `e` is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828.
- By replacing `LOG10(x)` with `LOG(10, x)`, you can compute the base-10 logarithm of `"HTSeq__Counts" + 1`.

**Additional Note:**

- Ensure that `"HTSeq__Counts"` is a numeric column and doesn't contain any NULL or negative values, as logarithms of zero or negative numbers are undefined. Adding `1` inside the logarithm helps avoid log of zero when `"HTSeq__Counts"` is zero.

**Usage:**

You can now run the corrected SQL query to retrieve the log-transformed expression values for the gene `SNORA31`:

```sql
SELECT "r"."case_barcode", LOG(10, "r"."HTSeq__Counts" + 1) AS "log_expression"
FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION" AS "r"
WHERE "r"."gene_name" = 'SNORA31'
LIMIT 100;
```

This should resolve the error and provide you with the desired log-transformed expression values.

2025-02-11 14:04:51 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is because the `LOG10` function is not recognized in your SQL environment (Snowflake SQL). To compute the base-10 logarithm in Snowflake, you should use the `LOG` function with two arguments: the base and the value.

**Correction:**

Replace `LOG10("r"."HTSeq__Counts" + 1)` with `LOG(10, "r"."HTSeq__Counts" + 1)`.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "c"."case_barcode", LOG(10, "r"."HTSeq__Counts" + 1) AS "log_SNORA31_expression", "m"."mirna_id", "m"."reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped"
FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0"."CLINICAL" AS "c"
JOIN "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION" AS "r"
  ON "c"."case_barcode" = "r"."case_barcode"
JOIN "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."MIRNASEQ_EXPRESSION" AS "m"
  ON "c"."case_barcode" = "m"."case_barcode"
WHERE "c"."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BRCA'
  AND "c"."age_at_diagnosis" <= 80
  AND "c"."pathologic_stage" IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA')
  AND "r"."gene_name" = 'SNORA31'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Function Replacement:** In Snowflake SQL, the function `LOG10(x)` is not available. Instead, use `LOG(10, x)` to calculate the logarithm base 10 of `x`.
- **Syntax:** The `LOG` function in Snowflake can take two arguments: `LOG(base, value)`.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Ensure Numeric Values:** Make sure that `"r"."HTSeq__Counts"` is numeric and does not contain negative values or NULLs, as calculating the logarithm of zero or negative numbers is undefined.
- **Adding 1 to Counts:** Adding `1` to `"HTSeq__Counts"` ensures that you avoid taking the logarithm of zero when counts are zero.

**Usage:**

You can now run the corrected SQL query without encountering the `Unknown function LOG10` error.

---

If there are any other SQL queries where you have used `LOG10`, please replace it with `LOG(10, x)` following the same pattern.

   WHERE "mirna_id" = 'hsa-mir-21';
   ```

10. Retrieve SNORA31 expression for patients meeting the clinical criteria:
    ```sql
    SELECT "c"."case_barcode", "c"."age_at_diagnosis", "c"."pathologic_stage", "r"."HTSeq__Counts"
    FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0"."CLINICAL" AS "c"
    JOIN "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION" AS "r"
      ON "c"."case_barcode" = "r"."case_barcode"
    WHERE "c"."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BRCA'
      AND "c"."age_at_diagnosis" <= 80
      AND "c"."pathologic_stage" IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA')
      AND "r"."gene_name" = 'SNORA31'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. Retrieve microRNA expression data for patients meeting the clinical criteria:
    ```sql
    SELECT "c"."case_barcode", "m"."mirna_id", "m"."reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped"
    FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0"."CLINICAL" AS "c"
    JOIN "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."MIRNASEQ_EXPRESSION" AS "m"
      ON "c"."case_barcode" = "m"."case_barcode"
    WHERE "c"."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BRCA'
      AND "c"."age_at_diagnosis" <= 80
      AND "c"."pathologic_stage" IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA')
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. Count patients meeting the clinical criteria:
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "case_barcode") AS "patient_count"
    FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0"."CLINICAL"
    WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BRCA'
      AND "age_at_diagnosis" <= 80
      AND "pathologic_stage" IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA');
    ```

13. Calculate average expression of each microRNA:
    ```sql
    SELECT "mirna_id", AVG("reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped") AS "average_expression"
    FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."MIRNASEQ_EXPRESSION"
    GROUP BY "mirna_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. Compute log-transformed expression of SNORA31:
    ```sql
    SELECT "r"."case_barcode", LOG10("r"."HTSeq__Counts" + 1) AS "log_expression"
    FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION" AS "r"
    WHERE "r"."gene_name" = 'SNORA31'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. Combine clinical data with SNORA31 and microRNA expression data:
    ```sql
    SELECT "c"."case_barcode", LOG10("r"."HTSeq__Counts" + 1) AS "log_SNORA31_expression", "m"."mirna_id", "m"."reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped"
    FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0"."CLINICAL" AS "c"
    JOIN "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION" AS "r"
      ON "c"."case_barcode" = "r"."case_barcode"
    JOIN "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."MIRNASEQ_EXPRESSION" AS "m"
      ON "c"."case_barcode" = "m"."case_barcode"
    WHERE "c"."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BRCA'
      AND "c"."age_at_diagnosis" <= 80
      AND "c"."pathologic_stage" IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA')
      AND "r"."gene_name" = 'SNORA31'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: In the TCGA-BRCA cohort of patients who are 80 years old or younger at diagnosis and have a pathological stage of Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIA, calculate the t-statistic derived from the Pearson correlation between the log10-transformed average RNA-Seq expression levels (using HTSeq__Counts + 1) of the gene SNORA31 and the average microRNA-Seq expression levels of all unique microRNAs, only considering pairs with more than 25 samples and where the absolute Pearson correlation coefficient is between 0.3 and 1.0

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
microRNA_ID,t_statistic
microRNA_ID1:str,t_statistic1:float
microRNA_ID2:str,t_statistic2:float
...
```

This table presents the t-statistics derived from the Pearson correlation between the log10-transformed average RNA-Seq expression levels of the gene SNORA31 and the average microRNA-Seq expression levels of all unique microRNAs. The analysis is limited to patients in the TCGA-BRCA cohort who are 80 years old or younger at diagnosis and have a pathological stage of Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIA. Only microRNAs with more than 25 samples and an absolute Pearson correlation coefficient between 0.3 and 1.0 are included..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0': {'QOTM': ['ORG_HS_EG_DB_V1', 'REACTOME_A1', 'PAAD_KIRP_RESULT_CHECK', 'RESULTS_1002', 'WIKIPATHWAYS_20170425_ANNOTATED', 'REACTOME', 'TSP_SIM_DATA', 'PAAD_KIRP_RANDOM_SAMPLE_1002', '_1000GENOMES'], 'TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0': ['ANNOTATIONS', 'BIOSPECIMEN', 'CLINICAL', 'CLINICAL_V1', 'CLINICAL_V1_1'], 'TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0': ['COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_MASKED', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR13', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR13', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR14', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR2', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR4', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR7', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR20', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR1', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR11', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR12', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR22', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR6', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR17', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR19', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR18', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR21', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR8', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR10', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR15', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR5', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR9', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR16', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHR3', 'TCGA_METADATA_DATA_HG38_R14', 'MIRNASEQ_EXPRESSION', 'SOMATIC_MUTATION', 'MIRNASEQ_ISOFORM_EXPRESSION', 'COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_MASKED_R14', 'DNA_METHYLATION', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHRX', 'RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION', 'SOMATIC_MUTATION_DR7', 'SOMATIC_MUTATION_DR7', 'SOMATIC_MUTATION_DR10', 'SOMATIC_MUTATION_DR6', 'DNA_METHYLATION_CHRY', 'PROTEIN_EXPRESSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
