2025-02-10 23:26:53 - root - INFO - Apologies for the mistake in the column name. The correct column name is `geo_id`, not `geoid`. Let me correct the SQL query accordingly.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

1. **Find the FIPS code (`area_fips`) and `geo_id` for Allegheny County:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT geo_id, state_fips_code, county_fips_code, county_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.geo_us_boundaries.counties`
WHERE LOWER(county_name) LIKE '%allegheny%'
LIMIT 100;
```

I have also reviewed the other queries to ensure they are accurate. Here are the updated SQL queries:

     - `item_code` or `item_name`: **Potential usage**: Filter to `'All items'` for overall CPI.
     - `area_code` or `area_name`: **Potential usage**: Filter to U.S. city average or specific regions if available.

   **Conditions:**
   - `item_name = 'All items'`.
   - `period = 'M13'` (annual average).
   - `year BETWEEN 1998 AND 2017`.

3. **`bigquery-public-data.geo_us_boundaries.counties`**: County information.

   - **Columns:**

These corrected queries should help in gathering the necessary data to determine whether the average annual wages in Allegheny County kept pace with the inflation of all consumer items between 1998 and 2017. By analyzing the wage data from the **`bls_qcew`** tables and the CPI data from the **`cpi_u`** table, you can calculate the respective percentage growth rates.

**Note:** When executing these queries, ensure that you adjust any placeholders (like continuing the `UNION ALL` clauses for additional years) as needed to cover the full range from 1998 to 2017.

Task: Between 1998 and 2017, for Allegheny County in the Pittsburgh area, did the average annual wages for all industries keep pace with the inflation of all consumer items, and what were the respective percentage growth rates (to two decimal places) for wages and the CPI over that period?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Wage_growth_rate,Inflation_rate
88.67,50.38
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

Between 1998 and 2017, the average annual wages for all industries in Allegheny County increased by approximately **88.67%**, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all consumer items increased by approximately **50.38%**. This indicates that wages outpaced inflation during this period, and therefore, the average annual wages did keep pace with the inflation of all consumer items..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

```

Between 1998 and 2017, the average annual wages for all industries in Allegheny County increased by approximately **88.67%**, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all consumer items increased by approximately **50.38%**. This indicates that wages outpaced inflation during this period, and therefore, the average annual wages did keep pace with the inflation of all consumer items. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
