Both Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`) and Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`) SQL queries aim to calculate the percentage growth rates of average annual wages and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) between 1998 and 2017 for Allegheny County.

---

**Comparison:**

- **Calculation of Average Weekly Wages:**
  - Both queries calculate the average weekly wages for 1998 and 2017 by averaging the `avg_wkly_wage_10_total_all_industries` across the four quarters of each year.
  - They filter data where `geoid = '42003'`, which corresponds to Allegheny County.

- **Calculation of CPI Values:**
  - Both queries retrieve CPI values from `bigquery-public-data.bls.cpi_u`, filtering for `item_name = 'All items'` and `period = 'M13'` (annual averages).
  - They compute the average CPI values for 1998 and 2017.

- **Growth Rate Computation:**
  - **Candidate 0:** Calculates growth rates and rounds them to four decimal places.
  - **Candidate 1:** Calculates growth rates and rounds them to two decimal places, as specified in the task.

**Results Comparison:**

- **Candidate 0 Output:**
  - Wage Growth Rate: 76.2963%
  - Inflation Rate: 51.8421%

- **Candidate 1 Output:**
  - Wage Growth Rate: 76.30%
  - Inflation Rate: 51.84%

**Choice:**

I choose **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`)** as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

  - The task requests the percentage growth rates to be calculated **to two decimal places**.
  - Candidate 1's SQL query rounds the growth rates to two decimal places, fulfilling the task's precision requirement.
  - Candidate 0 rounds the growth rates to four decimal places, which exceeds the specified precision.

- **Clarity and Precision:**
  - Candidate 1 provides results that are concise and directly aligned with the task's specifications.
