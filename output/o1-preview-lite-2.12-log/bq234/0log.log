Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine the most prescribed medication in each state in 2014, we need to consider the relevant tables and columns from the available datasets.

**Relevant Table:**
- `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `nppes_provider_state`: The state code where the provider is located. This will help us group the data by state.
- `drug_name`: The name of the prescribed drug. This is essential to identify the medications.
- `generic_name`: The generic name of the drug. Useful if we want to group medications by their generic equivalents.
- `total_claim_count`: The total number of Medicare Part D claims for each drug by each provider. We'll sum this to get the total prescriptions per drug per state.
- `total_drug_cost`: The aggregate cost paid for all claims. Useful if we want to analyze costs associated with prescriptions.

**Possible Conditions:**

- Since the data is from 2014, we don't need to filter by date.
- Ensure `nppes_provider_state` and `drug_name` are not null.
- Group data by state and drug to aggregate the total claims.

---

Below are 10 different BigQuery SQL queries to explore the data from simple to complex:

1. **Query 1: Retrieve all distinct state codes where providers are located.**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT nppes_provider_state
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Query 2: Retrieve all distinct drug names prescribed by providers.**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT drug_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Query 3: Get the total claim counts for each drug across all states.**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     drug_name,
     SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   GROUP BY drug_name
   ORDER BY total_claims DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Query 4: Get the total claim counts for each drug in each state.**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     nppes_provider_state AS state,
     drug_name,
     SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   GROUP BY state, drug_name
   ORDER BY state, total_claims DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Query 5: Identify the most prescribed drug in each state using RANK() function.**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     state,
     drug_name,
     total_claims
   FROM (
     SELECT
       nppes_provider_state AS state,
       drug_name,
       SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY nppes_provider_state ORDER BY SUM(total_claim_count) DESC) AS rank
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
     GROUP BY state, drug_name
   )
   WHERE rank = 1
   ORDER BY state
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Query 6: Find the most prescribed drug in each state without using CTEs.**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     per_state_drug_claims.state,
     per_state_drug_claims.drug_name,
     per_state_drug_claims.total_claims
   FROM (
     SELECT
       nppes_provider_state AS state,
       drug_name,
       SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
     GROUP BY state, drug_name
   ) AS per_state_drug_claims
   JOIN (
     SELECT
       state,
       MAX(total_claims) AS max_claims
     FROM (
       SELECT
         nppes_provider_state AS state,
         drug_name,
         SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
       FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
       GROUP BY state, drug_name
     )
     GROUP BY state
   ) AS per_state_max_claims
   ON per_state_drug_claims.state = per_state_max_claims.state
   AND per_state_drug_claims.total_claims = per_state_max_claims.max_claims
   ORDER BY per_state_drug_claims.state
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Query 7: Identify the most prescribed medication by generic name in each state.**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     state,
     generic_name,
     total_claims
   FROM (
     SELECT
       nppes_provider_state AS state,
       generic_name,
       SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY nppes_provider_state ORDER BY SUM(total_claim_count) DESC) AS rank
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
     GROUP BY state, generic_name
   )
   WHERE rank = 1
   ORDER BY state
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Query 8: List the top 3 most prescribed drugs in each state.**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     state,
     drug_name,
     total_claims
   FROM (
     SELECT
       nppes_provider_state AS state,
       drug_name,
       SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY nppes_provider_state ORDER BY SUM(total_claim_count) DESC) AS rank
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
     GROUP BY state, drug_name
   )
   WHERE rank <= 3
   ORDER BY state, rank
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Query 9: Calculate the total number of claims per state.**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     nppes_provider_state AS state,
     SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
   GROUP BY state
   ORDER BY total_claims DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Query 10: Identify the medication with the highest total drug cost in each state.**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      state,
      drug_name,
      total_cost
    FROM (
      SELECT
        nppes_provider_state AS state,
        drug_name,
        SUM(total_drug_cost) AS total_cost,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY nppes_provider_state ORDER BY SUM(total_drug_cost) DESC) AS rank
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
      GROUP BY state, drug_name
    )
    WHERE rank = 1
    ORDER BY state
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively build upon each other to explore the dataset and understand the prescribing patterns across different states. By aggregating the data and utilizing ranking functions, we can determine the most prescribed medications in each state based on the total number of claims or total drug cost.Query:

Task: What is the most prescribed medication in each state in 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
State,Drug_Name
state_code1:str,drug_name1:str
state_code2:str,drug_name2:str
...
```

This table lists the most prescribed medication in each state in 2014, showing the state code and the corresponding drug name..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['hcpcs', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd10_procedures_2019', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['home_health_agencies_2013', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'hospital_general_info', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['care_site', 'concept', 'concept_ancestor', 'concept_class', 'concept_relationship', 'condition_era', 'condition_occurrence', 'cost', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'domain', 'dose_era', 'drug_era', 'drug_exposure', 'drug_strength', 'location', 'observation', 'observation_period', 'payer_plan_period', 'person', 'procedure_occurrence', 'provider', 'relationship', 'vocabulary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
