After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here are the reasons:

1. **Filtering for Current Relationships:**

   - **`2result.sql`** includes a condition to filter for current relationships between POIs and addresses:

     ```sql
     AND (HD_REL."RELATIONSHIP_END_DATE" IS NULL OR HD_REL."RELATIONSHIP_END_DATE" > CURRENT_DATE())
     ```

     This ensures that only active 'The Home Depot' and 'Lowe's Home Improvement' store locations are considered in the distance calculations. In contrast, **`0result.sql`** lacks this condition, potentially including outdated or closed store locations.

2. **Data Validation and Integrity:**

   - While **`0result.sql`** includes latitude and longitude range checks to ensure valid coordinates:

     ```sql
     AND TRY_TO_DOUBLE(a."LATITUDE") BETWEEN -90 AND 90
     AND TRY_TO_DOUBLE(a."LONGITUDE") BETWEEN -180 AND 180
     ```

     **`2result.sql`** assumes that the stored latitude and longitude values are valid, which is acceptable if the data integrity is ensured at the database level or through previous data validation steps.

3. **Use of Well-Known Text (WKT) Format:**

   - **`2result.sql`** constructs the geographic points using the WKT format:

     ```sql
     TO_GEOGRAPHY(CONCAT('POINT (', HD."hd_longitude", ' ', HD."hd_latitude", ')'))
     ```

     This method is standard and can handle string concatenation of coordinates effectively, provided the latitude and longitude values are correctly formatted.

4. **Clarity and Readability:**

   - **`2result.sql`** uses clear aliases (e.g., `HD`, `LS`, `HD_REL`, `LS_REL`, `HD_ADDR`, `LS_ADDR`), enhancing readability and maintainability of the query.

5. **Consistent Naming Conventions:**

   - The variable names in **`2result.sql`** are consistently formatted, making it easier to follow the logic and understand the join relationships between tables.

6. **Comprehensive Selection of Stores:**

   - By including the active relationship check and ensuring that latitude and longitude values are not null, **`2result.sql`** accurately represents the current set of stores for both companies.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above points, **`2result.sql`** is better suited for calculating the shortest straight-line distances between each 'The Home Depot' store and its nearest 'Lowe's Home Improvement' store using valid and current data.
