Both SQL queries aim to determine the day of the week and hour of the day with the highest number of trips at the busiest Citibike station in 2018. They yield the same result:

- **Day of Week:** 5
- **Hour of Day:** 18

**Comparison:**

- **1result.sql:**
  - Uses `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC` directly in the outer query.
  - Does not explicitly assign an alias to the trip count.
  - The grouping and ordering are done without an intermediate subquery.

- **2result.sql:**
  - Introduces a subquery that calculates `trip_count` explicitly.
  - Uses `ORDER BY trip_count DESC` within the subquery.
  - The outer query selects the `day_of_week` and `hour_of_day` from the subquery.

**Reason for Choosing 2result.sql:**

The second SQL query is preferred because:

- **Clarity:** It explicitly calculates `trip_count`, making the purpose of the query clearer.
- **Maintainability:** By structuring the query with a subquery, it's easier to modify or extend in the future.
- **Best Practices:** Assigning aliases and using them in `ORDER BY` enhances readability and follows good SQL coding standards.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**
