2025-02-10 09:17:49 - root - INFO - Thank you for bringing this to my attention. The error you're encountering is due to the fact that both `t.hits` and `h.product` are arrays (repeated fields), and we need to properly unnest them to access the nested fields within them.

---

### **Understanding the Error:**

- **Error Message:**
  ```
  Cannot access field v2ProductName on a value with type ARRAY<STRUCT<productSKU STRING, v2ProductName STRING, v2ProductCategory STRING, ...>> at [2:16]
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - The field `h.product` is of type `ARRAY<STRUCT<...>>`, meaning it's an array of structs.
  - You cannot directly access a field within an array without first flattening (unnesting) the array.
  - The same applies to `t.hits`, which is also an array of structs.

---

### **Correcting the Query:**

To fix the error, we'll need to:

1. **Unnest `t.hits`** to access each hit record as `h`.
2. **Unnest `h.product`** to access each product within a hit as `hp`.
3. **Then**, we can access `hp.v2ProductName` and other product-level fields.

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT
  hp.v2ProductName,
  hp.productQuantity
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t,
  UNNEST(t.hits) AS h,
  UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
WHERE
  hp.v2ProductName IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation of the Corrected Query:**

- **UNNEST(t.hits) AS h:**
  - This expands the `hits` array so that each element (hit) becomes a separate row in the result set.
  - `h` represents each individual hit.

- **UNNEST(h.product) AS hp:**
  - This further expands the `product` array within each hit, so that each product becomes a separate row.
  - `hp` represents each individual product within a hit.

- **Accessing Fields:**
  - Now we can access `hp.v2ProductName` and `hp.productQuantity` directly since `hp` is a struct representing a single product.

---

### **Applying the Correction to Other Queries:**

Many of the previous queries need similar adjustments. I'll provide corrected versions of the queries that involve nested repeated fields.

---

### **Corrected Queries:**

1. **List all products purchased in July 2017 with their quantities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     hp.v2ProductName,
     hp.productQuantity
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t,
     UNNEST(t.hits) AS h,
     UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
   WHERE
     hp.v2ProductName IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find sessions where any product purchased contains 'YouTube' in the product name:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     t.fullVisitorId,
     t.visitId,
     hp.v2ProductName
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t,
     UNNEST(t.hits) AS h,
     UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
   WHERE
     LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List distinct products (excluding 'YouTube' products) purchased by visitors who bought 'YouTube'-related products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     hp.v2ProductName
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
   WHERE
     t.fullVisitorId IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT
         t.fullVisitorId
       FROM
         `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
       CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
       CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
       WHERE
         LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
     )
     AND LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) NOT LIKE '%youtube%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Aggregate total quantities of non-'YouTube' products purchased by visitors who bought 'YouTube'-related products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     hp.v2ProductName,
     SUM(hp.productQuantity) AS total_quantity
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
   WHERE
     t.fullVisitorId IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT
         t.fullVisitorId
       FROM
         `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
       CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
       CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
       WHERE
         LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
     )
     AND LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) NOT LIKE '%youtube%'
   GROUP BY
     hp.v2ProductName
   ORDER BY
     total_quantity DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List all 'YouTube'-related products purchased in July 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     hp.v2ProductName
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t,
     UNNEST(t.hits) AS h,
     UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
   WHERE
     LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find the number of visitors who bought 'YouTube'-related products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     COUNT(DISTINCT t.fullVisitorId) AS youtube_buyers_count
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
   WHERE
     LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Show total quantities of all products purchased in July 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     hp.v2ProductName,
     SUM(hp.productQuantity) AS total_quantity
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
   WHERE
     hp.v2ProductName IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY
     hp.v2ProductName
   ORDER BY
     total_quantity DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Identify visitors who purchased both 'YouTube' products and other products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     t.fullVisitorId
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
   GROUP BY
     t.fullVisitorId
   HAVING
     SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
     AND SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) NOT LIKE '%youtube%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve total revenue from non-'YouTube' products purchased by 'YouTube' product buyers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     SUM(hp.productRevenue)/1e6 AS total_revenue
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
   WHERE
     t.fullVisitorId IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT
         t.fullVisitorId
       FROM
         `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
       CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
       CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
       WHERE
         LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
     )
     AND LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) NOT LIKE '%youtube%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List the top 10 non-'YouTube' products by quantity purchased by 'YouTube' product buyers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      hp.v2ProductName,
      SUM(hp.productQuantity) AS total_quantity
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
    WHERE
      t.fullVisitorId IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT
          t.fullVisitorId
        FROM
          `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
        CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
        CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
        WHERE
          LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
      )
      AND LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) NOT LIKE '%youtube%'
    GROUP BY
      hp.v2ProductName
    ORDER BY
      total_quantity DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

---

### **Notes on the Corrections:**

- **UNNEST Keyword:**

  - The `UNNEST` function is used to flatten arrays so that each element becomes a separate row in the result set.
  - When we unnest multiple arrays, we use `CROSS JOIN` to combine them appropriately.

- **CROSS JOIN vs Comma Syntax:**

  - Using `CROSS JOIN UNNEST(...)` is recommended for clarity and to avoid ambiguity in queries involving repeated fields.
  - It ensures that the arrays are unnested in the correct order and associated properly.

- **Field References:**

  - After unnesting, we can reference the fields within the structs directly, such as `hp.v2ProductName` and `hp.productQuantity`.

---

### **Final Query to Answer the Task:**

Now, let's construct the final query to find the distinct product (excluding those containing 'YouTube' in the product name) with the highest total quantity purchased by visitors who bought any 'YouTube'-related product in July 2017.

```sql
SELECT
  hp.v2ProductName AS Product_Name,
  SUM(hp.productQuantity) AS Total_Quantity_Purchased
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
WHERE
  t.fullVisitorId IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT
      t.fullVisitorId
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.hits) AS h
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(h.product) AS hp
    WHERE
      LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
  )
  AND LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) NOT LIKE '%youtube%'
GROUP BY
  Product_Name
ORDER BY
  Total_Quantity_Purchased DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Filtering Visitors:**
  - We first identify all `fullVisitorId` values where the visitor purchased a product with 'YouTube' in the name.
  - We use a subquery for this purpose.

- **Excluding 'YouTube' Products:**
  - In the outer query, we select products where `v2ProductName` does not contain 'YouTube'.

- **Aggregating Quantities:**
  - We sum the `productQuantity` for each product to get the total quantity purchased.

- **Ordering and Limiting:**
  - We order the results by `Total_Quantity_Purchased` in descending order to get the highest quantity.
  - We limit the result to 1 to get the product with the highest total quantity purchased.

---

### **Expected Result Format:**

```csv
Product_Name,Total_Quantity_Purchased
product_name:str,quantity:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This will provide the desired answer in the specified format.

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Case Sensitivity:**

  - We use `LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'` to ensure that the string matching is case-insensitive.

- **Handling Nulls:**

  - Including `hp.v2ProductName IS NOT NULL` in the WHERE clause can help avoid any potential null values, although in this case, the LIKE operator already handles nulls.

- **Performance Considerations:**

  - Be cautious with large datasets. When using wildcards like `ga_sessions_201707*`, ensure that you have appropriate limits or filters to manage query costs.

---

### **Conclusion:**

By properly unnesting the arrays and adjusting the queries accordingly, we can effectively navigate the nested and repeated structures in the BigQuery dataset to extract the necessary information.

## Documents about Google Analytics Sample - ga_sessions

This article explains the format and schema of the data that is imported into BigQuery.

## Datasets

For each Analytics view that is enabled for BigQuery integration, a dataset is added using the view ID as the name.

## Tables

Within each dataset, a table is imported for each day of export. Daily tables have the format "ga\_sessions\_YYYYMMDD".

Intraday data is imported at least three times a day. Intraday tables have the format "ga\_sessions\_intraday\_YYYYMMDD". During the same day, each import of intraday data overwrites the previous import in the same table.

When the daily import is complete, the intraday table from the previous day is deleted. For the current day, until the first intraday import, there is no intraday table. If an intraday-table write fails, then the previous day's intraday table is preserved.

Data for the current day is not final until the daily import is complete. You may notice differences between intraday and daily data based on active user sessions that cross the time boundary of last intraday import.

## Rows

Each row within a table corresponds to a session in Analytics 360.

## Columns

The columns within the export are listed below. In BigQuery, some columns may have nested fields and messages within them.

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| clientId | STRING | Unhashed version of the Client ID for a given user associated with any given visit/session. |
| fullVisitorId | STRING | The unique visitor ID. |
| visitorId | NULL | This field is deprecated. Use "fullVisitorId" instead. |
| userId | STRING | Overridden User ID sent to Analytics. |
| visitNumber | INTEGER | The session number for this user. If this is the first session, then this is set to 1. |
| visitId | INTEGER | An identifier for this session. This is part of the value usually stored as the _utmb cookie. This is only unique to the user. For a completely unique ID, you should use a combination of fullVisitorId and visitId. |
| visitStartTime | INTEGER | The timestamp (expressed as POSIX time). |
| date | STRING | The date of the session in YYYYMMDD format. |
| totals | RECORD | This section contains aggregate values across the session. |
| totals.bounces | INTEGER | Total bounces (for convenience). For a bounced session, the value is 1, otherwise it is null. |
| totals.hits | INTEGER | Total number of hits within the session. |
| totals.newVisits | INTEGER | Total number of new users in session (for convenience). If this is the first visit, this value is 1, otherwise it is null. |

| totals.screenviews | INTEGER | Total number of screenviews within the session. |
| totals.sessionQualityDim | INTEGER | An estimate of how close a particular session was to transacting, ranging from 1 to 100, calculated for each session. A value closer to 1 indicates a low session quality, or far from transacting, while a value closer to 100 indicates a high session quality, or very close to transacting. A value of 0 indicates that Session Quality is not calculated for the selected time range. |
| totals.timeOnScreen | INTEGER | The total time on screen in seconds. |
| totals.timeOnSite | INTEGER | Total time of the session expressed in seconds. |
| totals.totalTransactionRevenue | INTEGER | Total transaction revenue, expressed as the value passed to Analytics multiplied by 10^6 (e.g., 2.40 would be given as 2400000). |
| totals.transactionRevenue | INTEGER | This field is deprecated. Use "totals.totalTransactionRevenue" instead (see above). |
| totals.transactions | INTEGER | Total number of ecommerce transactions within the session. |
| totals.UniqueScreenViews | INTEGER | Total number of unique screenviews within the session. |
| totals.visits | INTEGER | The number of sessions (for convenience). This value is 1 for sessions with interaction events. The value is null if there are no interaction events in the session. |

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we'll identify the relevant tables and columns, consider potential usages, and outline conditions that may be applied. Then, we'll provide SQL queries to explore the data and understand the values in the related columns.

---

**Relevant Tables:**

- **`bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170701`** to **`ga_sessions_20170731`**: Since we're focusing on July 2017, we'll query the daily tables for that month.

---

**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- **`date`** (STRING):
  - **Usage**: Filter sessions that occurred in July 2017.

- **`fullVisitorId`** (STRING):
  - **Usage**: Identify unique visitors.

- **`hits`** (RECORD):
  - **Usage**: Access hit-level data within sessions.
  
- **`hits.product`** (RECORD within hits):
  - **`hits.product.v2ProductName`** (STRING):
    - **Usage**: Retrieve the name of products associated with hits.
  - **`hits.product.productQuantity`** (INTEGER):
    - **Usage**: Determine the quantity of each product purchased.
  - **`hits.product.productRevenue`** (INTEGER):
    - **Usage**: Calculate revenue generated by each product.
    
- **Conditions That May Be Used:**
  - **Filter sessions where any product purchased contains 'YouTube' in the product name**:
    - Use `LOWER(hits.product.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'`.
  - **Exclude products containing 'YouTube' when aggregating quantities**:
    - Use `LOWER(hits.product.v2ProductName) NOT LIKE '%youtube%'`.
  - **Aggregate total quantities to find the product with the highest total quantity purchased**.
  - **Join conditions on `fullVisitorId` to link sessions and hits across tables if necessary**.

---

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

     )
     AND LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) NOT LIKE '%youtube%'
   GROUP BY
     hp.v2ProductName
   ORDER BY
     total_quantity DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List all 'YouTube'-related products purchased in July 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     hp.v2ProductName

   WHERE
     LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find the number of visitors who bought 'YouTube'-related products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     COUNT(DISTINCT t.fullVisitorId) AS youtube_buyers_count
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` AS t,
     t.hits AS h,
     h.product AS hp
   WHERE
     LOWER(hp.v2ProductName) LIKE '%youtube%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Show total quantities of all products purchased in July 2017:**

Task: In July 2017, among all visitors who bought any YouTube-related product, which distinct product—excluding those containing ‘YouTube’ in the product name—had the highest total quantity purchased?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: After analyzing the data, the distinct product (excluding those containing 'YouTube' in the product name) with the highest total quantity purchased in July 2017 among visitors who bought any YouTube-related product is:

```csv
Product_Name,Total_Quantity_Purchased
product_name:str,quantity:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This result shows the product name and the total quantity purchased by those visitors in the specified period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
