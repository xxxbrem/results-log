Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine **which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken**, we need to calculate the bowling average for each bowler. The bowling average is calculated as:

\[ \text{Bowling Average} = \frac{\text{Total Runs Conceded}}{\text{Total Wickets Taken}} \]

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`ball_by_ball`**: Contains details of every ball bowled in each match.
   - **`bowler`**: The `player_id` of the bowler. *Potential usage*: Identify the bowler for each delivery.
   - **`match_id`, `over_id`, `ball_id`, `innings_no`**: Used to uniquely identify each delivery and join with other tables.

2. **`batsman_scored`**: Contains runs scored off each delivery.
   - **`runs_scored`**: Runs scored off the bat on each delivery. *Potential usage*: Calculate runs conceded by each bowler.
   - **`match_id`, `over_id`, `ball_id`, `innings_no`**: For joining with `ball_by_ball`.

3. **`wicket_taken`**: Contains information about wickets taken on deliveries.
   - **`player_out`**: The `player_id` of the batsman dismissed. *Potential usage*: Count wickets taken by each bowler.
   - **`match_id`, `over_id`, `ball_id`, `innings_no`**: For joining with `ball_by_ball`.

4. **`extra_runs`**: Contains information about extra runs conceded (wides, no-balls, etc.).
   - **`extra_runs`**: Runs conceded as extras. *Potential usage*: Include in total runs conceded if necessary.
   - **`match_id`, `over_id`, `ball_id`, `innings_no`**: For joining with `ball_by_ball`.

5. **`player`**: Contains player details.
   - **`player_id`**: Unique identifier for each player.
   - **`player_name`**: Name of the player. *Potential usage*: Retrieve the names of the bowlers.

**Conditions and Joins That May Be Used:**

- Join `ball_by_ball` with `batsman_scored` to calculate runs conceded per delivery by each bowler.
- Join `ball_by_ball` with `wicket_taken` to identify wickets taken by each bowler.
- Use `LEFT JOIN` with `wicket_taken` to include deliveries where no wicket was taken.
- Use `GROUP BY` on `bowler` to aggregate total runs conceded and total wickets taken.
- Exclude or include extras from `extra_runs` depending on whether we consider them in runs conceded.

**Sample SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **Retrieve a list of distinct bowlers from `ball_by_ball`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT bowler
   FROM ball_by_ball
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get the names of bowlers from `ball_by_ball` joined with `player`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p.player_name
   FROM ball_by_ball b
   JOIN player p ON b.bowler = p.player_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **View sample deliveries with runs scored from `batsman_scored`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT b.match_id, b.over_id, b.ball_id, b.bowler, bs.runs_scored
   FROM ball_by_ball b
   JOIN batsman_scored bs ON b.match_id = bs.match_id
     AND b.over_id = bs.over_id
     AND b.ball_id = bs.ball_id
     AND b.innings_no = bs.innings_no
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Check sample wickets taken by joining `ball_by_ball` and `wicket_taken`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT b.match_id, b.over_id, b.ball_id, b.bowler, w.player_out
   FROM ball_by_ball b
   JOIN wicket_taken w ON b.match_id = w.match_id
     AND b.over_id = w.over_id
     AND b.ball_id = w.ball_id
     AND b.innings_no = w.innings_no
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List bowlers with the number of deliveries they have bowled:**
   ```sql
   SELECT bowler, COUNT(*) AS deliveries_bowled
   FROM ball_by_ball
   GROUP BY bowler
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate total runs conceded by each bowler (including extras):**
   ```sql
   SELECT b.bowler, SUM(bs.runs_scored + COALESCE(e.extra_runs, 0)) AS total_runs_conceded
   FROM ball_by_ball b
   JOIN batsman_scored bs ON b.match_id = bs.match_id
     AND b.over_id = bs.over_id
     AND b.ball_id = bs.ball_id
     AND b.innings_no = bs.innings_no
   LEFT JOIN extra_runs e ON b.match_id = e.match_id
     AND b.over_id = e.over_id
     AND b.ball_id = e.ball_id
     AND b.innings_no = e.innings_no
   GROUP BY b.bowler
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate total wickets taken by each bowler:**
   ```sql
   SELECT b.bowler, COUNT(w.player_out) AS total_wickets
   FROM ball_by_ball b
   LEFT JOIN wicket_taken w ON b.match_id = w.match_id
     AND b.over_id = w.over_id
     AND b.ball_id = w.ball_id
     AND b.innings_no = w.innings_no
   GROUP BY b.bowler
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find bowlers with at least one wicket taken:**
   ```sql
   SELECT b.bowler, COUNT(w.player_out) AS total_wickets
   FROM ball_by_ball b
   JOIN wicket_taken w ON b.match_id = w.match_id
     AND b.over_id = w.over_id
     AND b.ball_id = w.ball_id
     AND b.innings_no = w.innings_no
   GROUP BY b.bowler
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate bowling average for each bowler who has taken at least one wicket:**
   ```sql
   SELECT b.bowler, 
          SUM(bs.runs_scored + COALESCE(e.extra_runs, 0)) * 1.0 / COUNT(w.player_out) AS bowling_average
   FROM ball_by_ball b
   JOIN batsman_scored bs ON b.match_id = bs.match_id
     AND b.over_id = bs.over_id
     AND b.ball_id = bs.ball_id
     AND b.innings_no = bs.innings_no
   LEFT JOIN extra_runs e ON b.match_id = e.match_id
     AND b.over_id = e.over_id
     AND b.ball_id = e.ball_id
     AND b.innings_no = e.innings_no
   JOIN wicket_taken w ON b.match_id = w.match_id
     AND b.over_id = w.over_id
     AND b.ball_id = w.ball_id
     AND b.innings_no = w.innings_no
   GROUP BY b.bowler
   HAVING COUNT(w.player_out) > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Identify the bowler with the lowest bowling average:**
    ```sql
    SELECT p.player_name, ba.bowling_average
    FROM (
      SELECT b.bowler, 
             SUM(bs.runs_scored + COALESCE(e.extra_runs, 0)) * 1.0 / COUNT(w.player_out) AS bowling_average
      FROM ball_by_ball b
      JOIN batsman_scored bs ON b.match_id = bs.match_id
        AND b.over_id = bs.over_id

**Explanation of Queries:**

- Queries 1-2: Retrieve distinct bowlers and their names to understand who the bowlers are.
- Queries 3-4: Explore runs conceded and wickets taken per delivery to see how data is structured.
- Query 5: Count the number of deliveries bowled by each bowler.
- Queries 6-7: Calculate total runs conceded and total wickets taken by each bowler.
- Query 8: Identify bowlers who have taken at least one wicket.
- Query 9: Calculate the bowling average for each bowler (runs conceded per wicket taken).
- Query 10: Find the bowler with the lowest bowling average and retrieve their name.

By executing these queries, we can gather all necessary data to compute the bowling averages and determine which bowler has the lowest average per wicket taken.Query:

Task: Which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken, we calculate the bowling average for each bowler by dividing the total runs conceded by the number of wickets they have taken. The bowler with the lowest average is:

```csv
Bowler_name,Bowling_average
name:str,average:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 10:28:26 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To determine which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken, we calculate the bowling average for each bowler by dividing the total runs conceded by the number of wickets they have taken. The bowler with the lowest average is:

```csv
Bowler_name,Bowling_average
name:str,average:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
