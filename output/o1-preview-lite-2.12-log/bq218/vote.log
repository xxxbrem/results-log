After reviewing the SQL queries and their results, all three queries correctly calculate the year-over-year growth percentage in total sales revenue for each item between 2022 and 2023. They appropriately handle cases where sales in 2022 are zero to prevent division by zero errors and ensure that only items with sales in 2022 are considered.

However, `0result.sql` stands out because:

- It uses `SAFE_DIVIDE` to safely perform division and avoid errors if the denominator is zero.
- It includes a `HAVING` clause to ensure that only items with positive sales in 2022 are included.
- It rounds the growth percentage to four decimal places, making the output more precise and readable.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

0result.sql
