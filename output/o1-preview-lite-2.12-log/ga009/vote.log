After comparing the two SQL queries, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Accurate Extraction of Parameters:**
   - In `1result.sql`, the inner query properly extracts the `session_engaged` and `ga_session_id` values for each event by unnesting the `event_params` and using `MAX(IF(...))` to capture the relevant values.
   - It ensures that all occurrences of `session_engaged` and `ga_session_id` are considered for each event by grouping on `user_pseudo_id` and `event_timestamp`.

2. **Filtering and Counting Correctly:**
   - The query filters events where `session_engaged = '1'` and `ga_session_id` is not null, ensuring only engaged sessions are counted.
   - It accurately counts distinct sessions per user by counting `COUNT(DISTINCT ga_session_id)` after grouping by `user_pseudo_id`.

3. **Calculating the Average:**
   - The outer query calculates the average number of engaged sessions per user by taking the average of `total_engaged_sessions` across all users.
   - This method provides a precise computation of the average engaged sessions per user for December 2020.

4. **Robustness and Reliability:**
   - By using `MAX(IF(...))` and grouping appropriately, `1result.sql` ensures that even if there are multiple `session_engaged` or `ga_session_id` entries in `event_params`, the correct values are extracted.
   - It avoids potential issues that might arise from using `LIMIT 1` in subqueries (as seen in `0result.sql`), which might not reliably fetch the correct parameter if it doesn't appear first in the array.

Considering these points, **`1result.sql`** provides a more accurate and reliable calculation.
