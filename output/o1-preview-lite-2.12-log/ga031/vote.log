Upon comparing the two SQL queries and their results, here are the observations:

**Query 1 (`1result.sql`):**

- **Calculation Logic:**
  - Filters sessions that have visited the **'Home'** page (`HAVING 'Home' IN UNNEST(page_titles)`).
  - Calculates the conversion rate as the percentage of these sessions that also visited the **'Checkout Confirmation'** page (`COUNTIF('Checkout Confirmation' IN UNNEST(page_titles))`).
- **Potential Issue:**
  - The comparison for `page_title` is **case-sensitive**.
  - Any variations in the casing of 'Home' or 'Checkout Confirmation' (e.g., 'home', 'HOME') will not be considered, potentially missing some sessions.

**Query 2 (`2result.sql`):**

- **Calculation Logic:**
  - Extracts `page_title` in **lowercase** (`LOWER((SELECT ep.value.string_value ...)) AS page_title`).
  - Identifies sessions that have visited the **'home'** page and counts those that also visited the **'checkout confirmation'** page.
  - Calculates the conversion rate using these counts.
- **Advantage:**
  - By converting `page_title` to lowercase, it ensures that all variations in casing are included.
  - Provides a more **accurate** count of sessions, as it is not affected by case differences.

**Results Comparison:**

- Both queries produce the **same result** for the User Session Conversion Rate:

  ```
  User_Session_Conversion_Rate
  1.7391
  ```

**Reason for Choosing Query 2 (`2result.sql`):**

- **Case Insensitivity:** Query 2 accounts for any differences in the casing of `page_title`, ensuring all relevant sessions are captured.
- **Robustness:** It is more reliable in scenarios where data might not be consistently cased.
- **Accurate Results:** By handling case variations, it prevents undercounting or missing sessions, leading to a more accurate calculation.
