After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **1result.sql** is the correct SQL query for the task.

**Reason:**

- **Allele Frequency Calculation:**
  - In **1result.sql**, the allele frequency is calculated from the observed genotype counts using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Allele Frequency} = \frac{2 \times \text{Observed Hom Alt} + \text{Observed Het}}{2 \times \text{Total Samples}}
    \]
    This approach ensures that the allele frequency is directly derived from the observed data, which is appropriate for calculating expected genotype counts under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE).
  - In **0result.sql**, the allele frequency is taken directly from the `AF` field in the dataset. However, the `AF` field may represent allele frequencies from a different population or calculated differently, which might not align with the observed genotype counts in the sample. Using `AF` could introduce discrepancies in HWE calculations.

- **Consistency with HWE Calculations:**
  - **1result.sql** uses the allele frequencies calculated from the observed data to compute the expected genotype counts under HWE, leading to more accurate and consistent chi-squared scores.
  - **0result.sql** relies on external allele frequencies (`AF`), which may not reflect the sample's genotype distribution, potentially resulting in incorrect expected counts and chi-squared scores.

- **Query Structure:**
  - **1result.sql** carefully accounts for the observed genotype counts and provides a clear step-by-step calculation for the expected counts and chi-squared scores.
  - **0result.sql** skips the calculation of allele frequencies from observed data, which is a critical step for accurate HWE testing.

Therefore, **1result.sql** correctly fulfills the task's requirements by providing accurate calculations based on observed data.
