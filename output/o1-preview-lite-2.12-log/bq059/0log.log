2025-01-24 20:03:46 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to a type mismatch between the `start_station_id` column in the `bikeshare_trips` table and the `station_id` column in the `bikeshare_station_info` table. Specifically:

- **`bikeshare_trips.start_station_id`** is of type **`INT64`**.
- **`bikeshare_station_info.station_id`** is of type **`STRING`**.

When you attempt to use the `IN` clause to compare these columns, BigQuery throws an error because it cannot compare an `INT64` with a `STRING` directly.

### **Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the data types of the columns being compared are the same. You can do this by casting one of the columns to match the other's data type. In this case, you can cast `station_id` to `INT64` if all station IDs are numeric.

Here's how you can modify your query:

```sql
-- Corrected Query 4: List trips starting from Berkeley stations
SELECT DISTINCT `trip_id`, `start_station_id`, `end_station_id`, `duration_sec`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE `start_station_id` IN (
  SELECT CAST(`station_id` AS INT64)
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`
  WHERE `region_id` = (
    SELECT `region_id`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_regions`
    WHERE LOWER(`name`) = 'berkeley'
  )
)
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Casting `station_id` to `INT64`:** By using `CAST(`station_id` AS INT64)`, we align the data types, allowing for a valid comparison in the `IN` clause.
- **Ensuring Numeric Conversion is Safe:** Since `station_id` values represent station identifiers and appear to be numeric based on your earlier results, casting them to `INT64` should be safe.

### **Updated Subsequent Queries:**

You'll need to apply this casting in any subsequent queries where there's a comparison between `station_id` and `start_station_id` or `end_station_id`.

#### **Updated Query 5:**

```sql
-- Corrected Query 5: List trips ending at Berkeley stations
SELECT DISTINCT `trip_id`, `start_station_id`, `end_station_id`, `duration_sec`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE `end_station_id` IN (
  SELECT CAST(`station_id` AS INT64)
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`
  WHERE `region_id` = (
    SELECT `region_id`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_regions`
    WHERE LOWER(`name`) = 'berkeley'
  )
)
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **Updated Query 6:**

```sql
-- Corrected Query 6: Calculate distances for trips starting from Berkeley
SELECT
  `trip_id`,
  ST_DISTANCE(`start_station_geom`, `end_station_geom`) AS `distance_meters`,
  `duration_sec`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE `start_station_id` IN (
  SELECT CAST(`station_id` AS INT64)
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`
  WHERE `region_id` = (
    SELECT `region_id`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_regions`
    WHERE LOWER(`name`) = 'berkeley'
  )
)
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **Updated Query 7 and Onwards:**

Apply the same casting wherever necessary in your subsequent queries to ensure type compatibility.

### **Proceeding with Your Task:**

Now that we've addressed the data type mismatch, you can rerun Query 4 and proceed with the analysis to find the highest average speed for bike trips in Berkeley with trip distances greater than 1000 meters.

### **Final Query to Obtain the Highest Average Speed:**

Here's the final query adjusted with the necessary casting and calculations:

```sql
-- Final Query: Calculate the highest average speed (rounded to 1 decimal place)
SELECT
  ROUND(
    MAX(
      ST_DISTANCE(`start_station_geom`, `end_station_geom`) / `duration_sec`
    ),
    1
  ) AS `highest_average_speed_mps`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE
  (
    `start_station_id` IN (
      SELECT CAST(`station_id` AS INT64)
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`
      WHERE `region_id` = 14
    ) OR
    `end_station_id` IN (
      SELECT CAST(`station_id` AS INT64)
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`
      WHERE `region_id` = 14
    )
  ) AND
  ST_DISTANCE(`start_station_geom`, `end_station_geom`) > 1000 AND
  `duration_sec` > 0
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:**

- We've replaced the subquery for `region_id` with `14` directly, as we've already determined Berkeley's `region_id` is `14`.
- The `ROUND` function is used to round the result to one decimal place as per your requirement.
- Ensure that you handle any potential division by zero by filtering out trips where `duration_sec` is greater than zero.

### **Expected Output Format:**

Based on the above query, the output should be:

```csv
Highest_average_speed_meters_per_second
value:float > 0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

You can replace `value:float > 0` with the actual highest average speed obtained from the query.

### **Example (Hypothetical Result):**

```csv
Highest_average_speed_meters_per_second
6.5
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Please run the corrected queries to obtain the actual result.**

---

**Summary:**

The error was due to a data type mismatch between `INT64` and `STRING` when comparing `start_station_id` with `station_id`. By casting `station_id` to `INT64`, we align the data types, allowing for a successful comparison. Remember to apply this casting in all relevant queries to avoid similar errors.

**Relevant tables and columns:**

- **`bikeshare_trips`**:
  - `trip_id`: Unique identifier for each trip.
  - `duration_sec`: Duration of the trip in seconds, used to calculate average speed.
  - `start_station_id`: Starting station ID.
  - `end_station_id`: Ending station ID.
  - `start_station_geom`: Geographical location of the start station, to calculate distance.
  - `end_station_geom`: Geographical location of the end station, to calculate distance.

- **`bikeshare_station_info`**:
  - `station_id`: Unique identifier for each station.
  - `name`: Name of the station.
  - `region_id`: To determine if the station is located in Berkeley.

- **`bikeshare_regions`**:
  - `region_id`: Unique identifier for each region.
  - `name`: Name of the region (e.g., "Berkeley").

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Trips where either the start or end station is in Berkeley.
- Trips with a calculated distance greater than 1000 meters.
- Calculation of average speed using the formula: distance (in meters) divided by `duration_sec` (in seconds).
- Filtering out trips with `duration_sec` equal to zero to avoid division by zero errors.

Task: What is the highest average speed (rounded to 1 decimal, in metric m/s) for bike trips in Berkeley with trip distance greater than 1000 meters?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Highest_average_speed_meters_per_second
N/A
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine the highest average speed for bike trips in Berkeley with trip distances greater than 1000 meters, we would need detailed trip records including trip distances and locations. However, the provided dataset does not contain sufficient data to perform this calculation. Specifically, the `bikeshare_trips` table lacks direct distance measurements, and there's no explicit indication of trips occurring in Berkeley. Therefore, we cannot compute the highest average speed as requested..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'san_francisco_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'san_francisco_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_regions', 'bikeshare_station_info', 'bikeshare_station_status', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'san_francisco_film_locations': ['film_locations'], 'san_francisco_neighborhoods': ['boundaries'], 'san_francisco_sffd_service_calls': ['sffd_service_calls'], 'san_francisco_sfpd_incidents': ['sfpd_incidents'], 'san_francisco_transit_muni': ['calendar', 'fares', 'routes', 'shapes', 'stop_monitoring', 'stop_times', 'stops', 'trips', 'vehicle_monitoring'], 'san_francisco_trees': ['street_trees']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
