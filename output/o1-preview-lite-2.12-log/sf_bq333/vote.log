After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct one.

**Reason:**

In **`0result.sql`**, the calculation of the average session duration is performed with greater precision. The division by **1,000,000** (to convert microseconds to seconds) is applied **after** computing the average session duration in microseconds. This approach ensures that the aggregation function `AVG` operates on the full precision of the session durations before any conversion, minimizing potential rounding errors.

In contrast, **`2result.sql`** performs the division within the subquery, converting each individual session duration to seconds before averaging. This could lead to a loss of precision due to early division, especially if the database handles division as integer division or if there are significant decimal places involved.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** provides a more accurate calculation of the average session duration.
