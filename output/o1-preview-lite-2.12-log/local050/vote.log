After reviewing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer. This SQL script accurately follows the task requirements by:

- Correctly filtering sales data for France in 2019 and 2020 based on `promo_total_id = 1` and `channel_total_id = 1`.
- Calculating the monthly sales in USD using the exchange rates from the `currency` table.
- Computing the growth rates between 2019 and 2020 for each month.
- Projecting the 2021 monthly sales by applying these growth rates to the 2020 sales.
- Determining the median of the projected monthly sales for 2021.

Additionally, `2result.sql` provides a more precise result (`68384.7580476925`) compared to `0result.sql`, which rounds the median to `68384.758`. This precision aligns with the requirement to calculate the median of the average monthly projected sales in USD.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

2result.sql
