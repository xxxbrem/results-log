**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `alien_data`
  - **"state"**: Used to group aliens by state and count the alien population per state.
  - **"type"**: Indicates if an alien is 'Friendly' or 'Hostile'; used to calculate percentages of each type in each state.
  - **"age"**: Used to compute the average age of aliens in each state.
  - **"id"**: Unique identifier for each alien; used to count the number of aliens.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Calculating average age per state where the average exceeds 200.
- Determining the percentage of 'Friendly' versus 'Hostile' aliens in each state.
- Selecting the top 10 states by alien population.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all distinct states where aliens reside:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "state"
   FROM "alien_data"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find all distinct alien types:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "type"
   FROM "alien_data"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count the number of aliens in each state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state", COUNT(*) AS "alien_count"
   FROM "alien_data"
   GROUP BY "state"
   ORDER BY "alien_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get the top 10 states by alien population:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state", COUNT(*) AS "alien_count"
   FROM "alien_data"
   GROUP BY "state"
   ORDER BY "alien_count" DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

5. **Calculate the average age of aliens in each state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state", AVG("age") AS "average_age"
   FROM "alien_data"
   GROUP BY "state"
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find states where the average alien age exceeds 200:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state", AVG("age") AS "average_age"
   FROM "alien_data"
   GROUP BY "state"
   HAVING AVG("age") > 200
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count the number of 'Friendly' and 'Hostile' aliens in each state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state", "type", COUNT(*) AS "type_count"
   FROM "alien_data"
   GROUP BY "state", "type"
   ORDER BY "state"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate the percentage of 'Friendly' aliens in each state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "state",
     (CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN "type" = 'Friendly' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS "friendly_percentage"
   FROM "alien_data"
   GROUP BY "state"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List the ages of aliens over 200 years old:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "age"
   FROM "alien_data"
   WHERE "age" > 200
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find the minimum and maximum alien ages in each state:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "state", MIN("age") AS "min_age", MAX("age") AS "max_age"
    FROM "alien_data"
    GROUP BY "state"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **List all occupations of aliens and their counts:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "occupation", COUNT(*) AS "occupation_count"
    FROM "alien_data"
    GROUP BY "occupation"
    ORDER BY "occupation_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Find the average age of 'Friendly' and 'Hostile' aliens in each state:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "state", "type", AVG("age") AS "average_age"
    FROM "alien_data"
    GROUP BY "state", "type"
    ORDER BY "state"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Count the number of aliens by gender:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "gender", COUNT(*) AS "gender_count"
    FROM "alien_data"
    GROUP BY "gender"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List the favorite foods among aliens and their popularity:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "favorite_food", COUNT(*) AS "food_count"
    FROM "alien_data"
    GROUP BY "favorite_food"
    ORDER BY "food_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Show the distribution of aliens by 'us_region':**

    ```sql
    SELECT "us_region", COUNT(*) AS "region_count"
    FROM "alien_data"
    GROUP BY "us_region"
    ORDER BY "region_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: For alien data, how many of the top 10 states by alien population have a higher percentage of friendly aliens than hostile aliens, with an average alien age exceeding 200?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_states
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:** This represents the number of states among the top 10 states by alien population that have a higher percentage of friendly aliens than hostile aliens, with an average alien age exceeding 200..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 19:11:27 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For alien data, how many of the top 10 states by alien population have a higher percentage of friendly aliens than hostile aliens, with an average alien age exceeding 200?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Number_of_states
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:** This represents the number of states among the top 10 states by alien population that have a higher percentage of friendly aliens than hostile aliens, with an average alien age exceeding 200. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
