1result.sql
```

The first SQL query, `1result.sql`, is the correct answer because it directly aligns with the task's requirements and provides a clear, concise solution. Here's why:

**Alignment with the Task:**

- **Top 10 States by Alien Population:** The query first identifies the top 10 states with the highest alien populations using a common table expression (CTE) named `top_states`.
  
  ```sql
  WITH top_states AS (
    SELECT "state"
    FROM "alien_data"
    GROUP BY "state"
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 10
  ),
  ```

- **Calculating Friendly Percentage and Average Age:** The query calculates the friendly percentage and average age for each of these states in another CTE `state_stats`.
  
  ```sql
  state_stats AS (
    SELECT a."state",
      COUNT(*) AS "total_aliens",
      SUM(CASE WHEN a."aggressive" = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "friendly_count",
      SUM(CASE WHEN a."aggressive" = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "hostile_count",
      ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN a."aggressive" = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 4) AS "friendly_percentage",
      ROUND(AVG(a."age"), 4) AS "average_age"
    FROM "alien_data" AS a
    WHERE a."state" IN (SELECT "state" FROM top_states)
    GROUP BY a."state"
  )
  ```

- **Applying the Conditions:** The query then filters the states where the friendly percentage is greater than 50% and the average age is greater than 200.

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Number_of_states"
  FROM state_stats
  WHERE "friendly_percentage" > 50 AND "average_age" > 200;
  ```

**Reasons for Choosing `1result.sql`:**

- **Direct Use of Percentage:** The query uses the condition `"friendly_percentage" > 50`, which directly matches the task's requirement of having a higher percentage of friendly aliens than hostile aliens. It checks the actual percentage rather than just the counts, ensuring accuracy in cases where the total alien count might not be evenly divisible or when other categories might be present.

- **Clear Structure with CTEs:** By using CTEs (`WITH` clauses), the query is well-organized, making it easier to read and understand. This structure separates the different logical steps: identifying the top states, calculating statistics, and applying the conditions.

- **Matches Query Output with Task Requirement:** Both queries return the same result (`5` states), but `1result.sql` does so by explicitly calculating and using the friendly percentage, which aligns more closely with the task's wording.

In contrast, while the second query `2result.sql` also calculates the number of states satisfying the conditions, it uses `"friendly_count" > "hostile_count"` as the condition. Though functionally similar in this context, using direct counts may not accurately reflect percentages in all datasets, especially in cases with missing or additional data categories.

By choosing `1result.sql`, we select a solution that is both precise and directly reflective of the task's requirements, ensuring clarity and correctness in the result.
