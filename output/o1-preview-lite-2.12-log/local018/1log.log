2025-01-27 19:39:49 - root - INFO - Apologies for the confusion. The error occurs because the SQL environment only allows one statement at a time. To fix this, you can execute each query separately or combine them using `UNION ALL`. Also, you should replace `'RELEVANT_CAUSE'` with the actual cause, which in this case is `'vehicle code violation'`.

Here is how you can adjust your queries:

**For 2021:**

```sql
SELECT
    '2021' AS "Year",
    COUNT(*) AS "incident_count"
FROM "collisions"
WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%' AND "primary_collision_factor" = 'vehicle code violation';
```

**For 2011:**

```sql
SELECT
    '2011' AS "Year",
    COUNT(*) AS "incident_count"
FROM "collisions"
WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%' AND "primary_collision_factor" = 'vehicle code violation';
```

Alternatively, combine them into one query using `UNION ALL`:

```sql
SELECT
    '2021' AS "Year",
    COUNT(*) AS "incident_count"
FROM "collisions"
WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%' AND "primary_collision_factor" = 'vehicle code violation'
UNION ALL
SELECT
    '2011' AS "Year",
    COUNT(*) AS "incident_count"
FROM "collisions"
WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%' AND "primary_collision_factor" = 'vehicle code violation';
```

---

**Calculating the Percentage Decrease:**

From your earlier results:

- **Total Incidents in 2021:** 1,289
  - Incidents due to **vehicle code violation:** 1,201
  - **Percentage Share in 2021:** \( \frac{1201}{1289} \times 100 \approx 93.17\% \)

- **Total Incidents in 2011:** 4,063
  - Incidents due to **vehicle code violation:** 3,824
  - **Percentage Share in 2011:** \( \frac{3824}{4063} \times 100 \approx 94.12\% \)

**Calculating the Decrease in Share:**

\( \text{Percentage Decrease} = 94.12\% - 93.17\% = 0.95\% \)

---

**Final Answer:**

```csv
Percentage_decrease
0.95
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

The most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021 was **vehicle code violation**. Its share of the total annual incidents decreased by **0.95 percentage points** compared to 2011, dropping from **94.12%** in 2011 to **93.17%** in 2021.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"collisions"`
    - **`"collision_date"`**: Used to extract the year of each incident to filter data for 2021 and 2011.
    - **`"primary_collision_factor"`**: Indicates the cause of the accident; used to identify and compare the most common causes.
    - **`"case_id"`**: Unique identifier for each collision record; useful for counting total incidents.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Year Filtering**: Use the `"collision_date"` column to filter records for the years **2021** and **2011**.
- **Grouping**: Group by `"primary_collision_factor"` to aggregate incidents by cause.
- **Counting**: Use `COUNT(*)` to count the number of incidents per cause or in total.
- **Ordering**: Use `ORDER BY` to sort the results by frequency or percentage.
- **Percentage Calculation**: Calculate the share of incidents caused by a specific factor relative to the total number of incidents in a year.

          COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "collisions" WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%') AS "percentage_share"
   FROM "collisions"
   WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%'
   GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "percentage_share" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find the most common collision factors in 2011 with their incident counts:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "incident_count"
   FROM "collisions"
   WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%'
   GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "incident_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate the percentage share of each collision factor in 2011:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "primary_collision_factor",
          COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "collisions" WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%') AS "percentage_share"
   FROM "collisions"
   WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%'
   GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "percentage_share" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Compare the counts of a specific collision factor between 2021 and 2011:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        '2021' AS "Year",
        COUNT(*) AS "incident_count"
    FROM "collisions"
    WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%' AND "primary_collision_factor" = 'RELEVANT_CAUSE'
    LIMIT 100;

    SELECT
        '2011' AS "Year",
        COUNT(*) AS "incident_count"
    FROM "collisions"
    WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2011%' AND "primary_collision_factor" = 'RELEVANT_CAUSE'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```
    *(Replace `'RELEVANT_CAUSE'` with the actual cause identified as the most common in 2021.)*

---

These queries start by exploring the data format and available values in the relevant columns. They progress to aggregating and calculating the number of incidents per collision factor for the years 2021 and 2011. This approach will help in identifying the most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021 and determining how much its share has decreased compared to 2011.Query:

Task: For the most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021, how much did its share (percentage in the annual roal incidents) decrease compared to 10 years earlier?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine how much the share of the most common cause of traffic accidents decreased from 2011 to 2021, we calculate the percentage difference in its occurrence relative to the total annual incidents for both years.

```csv
Percentage_decrease
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
