To determine the correct SQL query and result, let's compare the two candidate SQL scripts and their outputs, and analyze which one accurately calculates the highest daily balances per customer within each month, treating negative balances as zero, and then sums these maximum daily balances across all customers to get the monthly total.

**Candidate 0 (0result.sql):**

- **Approach:**
  - Calculates the balance change per transaction by adjusting the `txn_amount` based on `txn_type`.
  - Computes the cumulative balance for each customer over time using a window function.
  - Adjusts the cumulative balance to zero whenever it becomes negative.
  - Determines the maximum adjusted daily balance per customer per month.
  - Sums up these maximum balances across all customers to get the monthly total.

- **Result (0result.csv):**

  ```
  Month,Total_Max_Daily_Balance
  2020-01,369041.0
  2020-02,354049.0
  2020-03,352451.0
  2020-04,187575.0
  ```

**Candidate 1 (1result.sql):**

- **Approach:**
  - Computes daily net amounts (sum of transactions) per customer per date.
  - Calculates cumulative balances per customer over time, ensuring that the balance does not drop below zero.
  - Uses a recursive common table expression (CTE) to adjust the cumulative balance whenever it would become negative.
  - Determines the maximum cumulative balance per customer within each month.
  - Sums up these maximum balances across all customers to get the monthly total.

- **Result (1result.csv):**

  ```
  month,Total_Max_Daily_Balance
  2020-01,371772.0
  2020-02,450217.0
  2020-03,543626.0
  2020-04,327644.0
  ```

**Comparison and Reasoning:**

1. **Cumulative Balance Calculation:**
   - **Candidate 0** directly sets the cumulative balance to zero whenever it becomes negative but continues accumulating future transactions without considering the previous negative impact.
   - **Candidate 1** adjusts the cumulative balance to zero when it would go negative and ensures that future balances start from zero, effectively not carrying over negative balances.

2. **Adjusting for Negative Balances:**
   - **Candidate 1** correctly handles negative balances by resetting to zero and only allowing positive balances to accumulate. This aligns with the requirement to treat negative daily balances as zero and ensures that negative balances do not affect future cumulative balances adversely.
   - **Candidate 0** may not correctly handle the reset of cumulative balances after they drop to zero, potentially understating the maximum balances.

3. **Result Analysis:**
   - **Candidate 1's** results show an increasing trend in the total maximum daily balances over the months, which is logical if customers' cumulative balances generally grow over time.
   - **Candidate 0's** results show a decreasing trend, which may not accurately reflect the transactions' impact over time.

4. **Methodology Alignment with Requirements:**
   - The problem requires calculating the highest daily cumulative balance per customer within each month, treating any negative balances as zero, and summing these maximum balances per month.
   - **Candidate 1** closely follows this requirement by ensuring cumulative balances do not become negative and accurately capturing the maximum balance per customer per month.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above analysis, **Candidate 1's SQL query (1result.sql)** correctly implements the required logic and produces results that align with the expected financial calculations.
