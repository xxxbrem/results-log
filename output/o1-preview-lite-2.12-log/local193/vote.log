After comparing the SQL queries and their results, `1result.sql` is the most appropriate choice for the following reasons:

- **Exact Time Calculation**: `1result.sql` uses `strftime('%s', ...)` to convert the payment dates into Unix timestamps (seconds since the epoch). By calculating the time difference in seconds and comparing it to `7 * 86400` and `30 * 86400` (where `86400` is the number of seconds in a day), it ensures that the periods are measured using exact hours, minutes, and seconds, as required.

- **Precision**: This method accounts for any partial days and provides a precise time difference, which is essential when exact time periods are specified.

- **Consistency with Requirements**: The query aligns perfectly with the task's condition to base the 7- and 30-day periods on the exact number of hours, minutes, and seconds, rather than just calendar days or whole days.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:
