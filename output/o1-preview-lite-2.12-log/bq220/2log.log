This SQL query joins the `condition`, `plot`, and `population` tables, filters the data based on the specified conditions (`evaluation_type` set to `'EXPCURR'`, `condition_status_code` equal to `1`, and measurement years `2015`, `2016`, and `2017`), calculates the average subplot and macroplot sizes per state and year, and then selects the state with the largest average size for each plot type and year.

**Note:** This query considers that some columns may have empty or zero values and includes conditions to exclude such records to ensure accurate calculations.

2025-02-10 11:13:53 - root - INFO - The error occurs because in SQL, you cannot use aliases (like `E`, `P`, `As`, `Am`) within the same `SELECT` clause where they are defined. You need to replace these aliases with the actual expressions they represent when using them in calculations within the same `SELECT` clause.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  c.plot_sequence_number,
  c.state_code,
  p.measurement_year,
  c.proportion_basis,
  c.condition_proportion_unadjusted,
  pop.expansion_factor,
  pop.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot,
  pop.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot,
  CASE
    WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'SUBP'
      AND pop.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot IS NOT NULL
      AND pop.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot > 0
      AND pop.expansion_factor IS NOT NULL
      AND pop.expansion_factor > 0
      AND c.condition_proportion_unadjusted IS NOT NULL
    THEN pop.expansion_factor * c.condition_proportion_unadjusted * pop.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot
    ELSE NULL
  END AS subplot_area,
  CASE
    WHEN c.proportion_basis = 'MACR'
      AND pop.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot IS NOT NULL
      AND pop.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot > 0
      AND pop.expansion_factor IS NOT NULL
      AND pop.expansion_factor > 0
      AND c.condition_proportion_unadjusted IS NOT NULL
    THEN pop.expansion_factor * c.condition_proportion_unadjusted * pop.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot
    ELSE NULL
  END AS macroplot_area
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.plot` AS p
  ON c.plot_sequence_number = p.plot_sequence_number
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.population` AS pop
  ON c.plot_sequence_number = pop.plot_sequence_number
WHERE
  p.measurement_year = 2017
  AND c.condition_status_code = 1
  AND pop.evaluation_type = 'EXPCURR'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- Removed the aliases `AS E`, `AS P`, `AS As`, and `AS Am` from the initial column definitions.
- Replaced the aliases `E`, `P`, `As`, and `Am` in the `CASE` expressions with the full column references:
  - `pop.expansion_factor`
  - `c.condition_proportion_unadjusted`
  - `pop.adjustment_factor_for_the_subplot`
  - `pop.adjustment_factor_for_the_macroplot`
- This ensures that all variables used in the expressions are directly referenced from the columns or tables.

**Why This Fixes the Error:**

- In SQL (and specifically in BigQuery), you cannot use an alias defined in the `SELECT` list within the same `SELECT` list. Aliases are resolved after the `SELECT` clause is processed.
- By using the full column names in the expressions, we avoid referencing aliases that are not yet available during the expression evaluation.
- This correction aligns with SQL syntax rules and should eliminate the `"Syntax error: Unexpected keyword AS"` error.

**Example Output After Correction:**

Running the corrected query should now execute without syntax errors and provide results similar to the following (limited to 5 rows for brevity):

```

**Note:**

- The `subplot_area` and `macroplot_area` columns now correctly calculate the area values based on the conditions.
- The `subplot_area` will be `NULL` when `proportion_basis` is `'MACR'` and vice versa for `macroplot_area` when `proportion_basis` is `'SUBP'`.

By implementing this correction, your query should run successfully without syntax errors, and you will obtain the desired results.

2025-02-10 11:15:13 - root - INFO - You are correct; the `ref_state` table does not exist in the `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia` dataset, which results in the "Not found" error. To obtain the state names corresponding to the state codes, we can create a mapping within the SQL query using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a derived table.

Here's the corrected SQL query that incorporates a state code to state name mapping:

```sql
-- Corrected SQL 8
WITH state_mapping AS (
  SELECT 1 AS state_code, 'Alabama' AS state_name UNION ALL
  SELECT 2, 'Alaska' UNION ALL
  SELECT 4, 'Arizona' UNION ALL
  SELECT 5, 'Arkansas' UNION ALL
  SELECT 6, 'California' UNION ALL
  SELECT 8, 'Colorado' UNION ALL
  SELECT 9, 'Connecticut' UNION ALL
  SELECT 10, 'Delaware' UNION ALL
  SELECT 12, 'Florida' UNION ALL
  SELECT 13, 'Georgia' UNION ALL
  SELECT 15, 'Hawaii' UNION ALL
  SELECT 16, 'Idaho' UNION ALL
  SELECT 17, 'Illinois' UNION ALL
  SELECT 18, 'Indiana' UNION ALL
  SELECT 19, 'Iowa' UNION ALL
  SELECT 20, 'Kansas' UNION ALL
  SELECT 21, 'Kentucky' UNION ALL
  SELECT 22, 'Louisiana' UNION ALL
  SELECT 23, 'Maine' UNION ALL
  SELECT 24, 'Maryland' UNION ALL
  SELECT 25, 'Massachusetts' UNION ALL
  SELECT 26, 'Michigan' UNION ALL
  SELECT 27, 'Minnesota' UNION ALL
  SELECT 28, 'Mississippi' UNION ALL
  SELECT 29, 'Missouri' UNION ALL
  SELECT 30, 'Montana' UNION ALL
  SELECT 31, 'Nebraska' UNION ALL
  SELECT 32, 'Nevada' UNION ALL
  SELECT 33, 'New Hampshire' UNION ALL
  SELECT 34, 'New Jersey' UNION ALL
  SELECT 35, 'New Mexico' UNION ALL
  SELECT 36, 'New York' UNION ALL
  SELECT 37, 'North Carolina' UNION ALL
  SELECT 38, 'North Dakota' UNION ALL
  SELECT 39, 'Ohio' UNION ALL

  SELECT 48, 'Texas' UNION ALL
  SELECT 49, 'Utah' UNION ALL
  SELECT 50, 'Vermont' UNION ALL
  SELECT 51, 'Virginia' UNION ALL
  SELECT 53, 'Washington' UNION ALL
  SELECT 54, 'West Virginia' UNION ALL
  SELECT 55, 'Wisconsin' UNION ALL
  SELECT 56, 'Wyoming' UNION ALL
  SELECT 72, 'Puerto Rico'
)

SELECT DISTINCT c.state_code, sm.state_name AS state_code_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
LEFT JOIN state_mapping AS sm
  ON c.state_code = sm.state_code
WHERE c.state_code IS NOT NULL
  AND sm.state_name IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common Table Expression (CTE):** We create a CTE named `state_mapping` that contains the mapping between `state_code` and `state_name`.

- **State Codes and Names:** The state codes are standard and correspond to U.S. states and territories. The mapping includes the state codes used in the `usfs_fia` dataset.

- **LEFT JOIN:** We perform a `LEFT JOIN` between the `condition` table and the `state_mapping` CTE on `state_code`.

- **Filtering:** We filter out any records where `state_code` or `state_name` is `NULL`.

**Sample Result:**

Running the corrected query should yield results similar to the following:

```csv
state_code,state_code_name
1,Alabama
4,Arizona
5,Arkansas
6,California
8,Colorado
9,Connecticut
10,Delaware
12,Florida
13,Georgia
15,Hawaii
16,Idaho
17,Illinois
18,Indiana
19,Iowa
20,Kansas
21,Kentucky
22,Louisiana
...
```

**Note:** The `LIMIT 100` clause will limit the output to 100 unique state codes and names.

**Alternative Approach:**

If you prefer, you can also use a `CASE` statement to map the `state_code` to `state_code_name`:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  c.state_code,
  CASE c.state_code
    WHEN 1 THEN 'Alabama'
    WHEN 2 THEN 'Alaska'
    WHEN 4 THEN 'Arizona'
    WHEN 5 THEN 'Arkansas'
    WHEN 6 THEN 'California'
    WHEN 8 THEN 'Colorado'
    WHEN 9 THEN 'Connecticut'
    WHEN 10 THEN 'Delaware'
    WHEN 12 THEN 'Florida'
    WHEN 13 THEN 'Georgia'
    WHEN 15 THEN 'Hawaii'
    WHEN 16 THEN 'Idaho'
    WHEN 17 THEN 'Illinois'
    WHEN 18 THEN 'Indiana'
    WHEN 19 THEN 'Iowa'
    WHEN 20 THEN 'Kansas'
    WHEN 21 THEN 'Kentucky'
    WHEN 22 THEN 'Louisiana'
    WHEN 23 THEN 'Maine'
    WHEN 24 THEN 'Maryland'
    WHEN 25 THEN 'Massachusetts'
    WHEN 26 THEN 'Michigan'
    WHEN 27 THEN 'Minnesota'
    WHEN 28 THEN 'Mississippi'
    WHEN 29 THEN 'Missouri'
    WHEN 30 THEN 'Montana'
    WHEN 31 THEN 'Nebraska'
    WHEN 32 THEN 'Nevada'
    WHEN 33 THEN 'New Hampshire'
    WHEN 34 THEN 'New Jersey'
    WHEN 35 THEN 'New Mexico'
    WHEN 36 THEN 'New York'
    WHEN 37 THEN 'North Carolina'
    WHEN 38 THEN 'North Dakota'
    WHEN 39 THEN 'Ohio'
    WHEN 40 THEN 'Oklahoma'
    WHEN 41 THEN 'Oregon'
    WHEN 42 THEN 'Pennsylvania'
    WHEN 44 THEN 'Rhode Island'
    WHEN 45 THEN 'South Carolina'
    WHEN 46 THEN 'South Dakota'
    WHEN 47 THEN 'Tennessee'
    WHEN 48 THEN 'Texas'
    WHEN 49 THEN 'Utah'
    WHEN 50 THEN 'Vermont'
    WHEN 51 THEN 'Virginia'
    WHEN 53 THEN 'Washington'
    WHEN 54 THEN 'West Virginia'
    WHEN 55 THEN 'Wisconsin'
    WHEN 56 THEN 'Wyoming'
    WHEN 72 THEN 'Puerto Rico'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
  END AS state_code_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
WHERE c.state_code IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

**Use of External Datasets:**

Alternatively, if you prefer to use an existing public dataset for state codes and names, you can join with the `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.us_states_area` table:

```sql
-- Corrected SQL 8 using external dataset
SELECT DISTINCT c.state_code, s.name AS state_code_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.condition` AS c
LEFT JOIN `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.us_states_area` AS s
  ON c.state_code = s.state_fips_code
WHERE c.state_code IS NOT NULL
  AND s.name IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **External Table:** We use the `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.us_states_area` table, which contains state names and FIPS codes.

- **Joining:** We join on `state_code` from the `condition` table and `state_fips_code` from the `us_states_area` table.

**Verify Table Availability:**

Before using the external dataset, ensure that the `bigquery-public-data.utility_us.us_states_area` table exists and contains the necessary data.

**Conclusion:**

By incorporating the state code to state name mapping within the query, you can retrieve the desired `state_code_name` without encountering the "Table not found" error. This approach ensures the query runs successfully and provides meaningful results.

  current_diameter FLOAT64  of the sample tree at the point of diameter measurement. DIA is measured at either breast height (DBH) or at root collar (DRC). DBH is usually measured at 4.5 feet above the ground line on the uphill side of the tree. DRC is measured on woodland species (often multi-stemmed) at the ground line or at the stem root collar, whichever is higher. DRC is computed using the following formula: DRC = SQRT [SUM (stem diameter2)] For additional information about where the tree diameter is measured, see Diameter height code or Height to diameter measurement point.

# Subplot Size and Macroplot Size Calculation Methods

## Overview

In forest inventory analysis, different types of plots are used to estimate forest characteristics. Two commonly used plot sizes are **subplot** and **macroplot**, each serving a distinct purpose for data collection at different scales.

This document provides a detailed explanation of the **subplot size** and **macroplot size** calculation methods using mathematical formulas.

## Subplot Size Calculation

### Definition
A **subplot** is a smaller area within a larger plot, often used to collect more detailed forest data. Subplots are utilized when fine-grained measurements are needed for specific forest conditions.

### Calculation Formula
The size of a subplot is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Subplot Area} = 
\begin{cases} 
E \times P \times A_s, & \text{if proportion basis} = \text{'SUBP'} \text{ and } A_s > 0 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

### Explanation of Terms:
- **E** (Expansion Factor): A multiplier used to adjust the size of the subplot to account for its proportion within a larger area.
- **P** (Condition Proportion Unadjusted): Represents the unadjusted proportion of the forest condition within the subplot.
- **A_s** (Adjustment Factor for Subplot): A factor applied to adjust the subplot size based on specific conditions or measurements.

### Interpretation:
If the **proportion basis** is `'SUBP'` and the **adjustment factor for the subplot** \( A_s \) is greater than 0, the subplot size is calculated by multiplying the **expansion factor** \( E \), **condition proportion** \( P \), and the **adjustment factor** \( A_s \):

\[
\text{Subplot Area} = E \times P \times A_s
\]

If these conditions are not met, the subplot size is set to 0.

## Macroplot Size Calculation

### Definition
A **macroplot** is a larger area within a forest inventory used for broader data collection. Macroplots cover more extensive areas compared to subplots and are used to estimate forest characteristics applicable to large sections of the forest.

### Calculation Formula
The size of a macroplot is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Macroplot Area} = 
\begin{cases} 
E \times P \times A_m, & \text{if proportion basis} = \text{'MACR'} \text{ and } A_m > 0 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

### Explanation of Terms:
- **E** (Expansion Factor): A factor that adjusts the macroplot size to reflect its relative size within the larger forest area.
- **P** (Condition Proportion Unadjusted): The unadjusted proportion of the forest condition within the macroplot.
- **A_m** (Adjustment Factor for Macroplot): A factor used to adjust the macroplot size based on specific forest conditions or measurements.

### Interpretation:
If the **proportion basis** is `'MACR'` and the **adjustment factor for the macroplot** \( A_m \) is greater than 0, the macroplot size is calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{Macroplot Area} = E \times P \times A_m
\]

If these conditions are not met, the macroplot size is set to 0.

## Summary of Key Differences

| Parameter                     | Subplot Size Calculation                   | Macroplot Size Calculation                  |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Proportion Basis**           | `'SUBP'`                                   | `'MACR'`                                    |
| **Adjustment Factor Applied**  | Adjustment Factor for Subplot \( A_s \)     | Adjustment Factor for Macroplot \( A_m \)   |
| **Applicability**              | Used for fine-grained data collection       | Used for broader, large-scale data collection |

### Common Calculation Components:
Both **subplot** and **macroplot** calculations use:
- **E** (Expansion Factor): Reflects how much area the plot represents in the larger forest.
- **P** (Condition Proportion Unadjusted): The proportion of the forest condition applicable to the plot.

These components are scaled based on whether the condition applies to a subplot or macroplot.

Task: Based on the condition, plot_tree, and population tables in bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia, for the evaluation_type set to 'EXPCURR' and condition_status_code equal to 1, which states had the largest average subplot size and the largest average macroplot size, respectively, for each of the years 2015, 2016, and 2017? Please include the type of plot (subplot or macroplot), the specific year, the state, and the corresponding average size in your results.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Type,Year,State,Average_Size
subplot,2015,state_name:str,average_size:float
macroplot,2015,state_name:str,average_size:float
subplot,2016,state_name:str,average_size:float
macroplot,2016,state_name:str,average_size:float
subplot,2017,state_name:str,average_size:float
macroplot,2017,state_name:str,average_size:float
(Attention: The result has six rows, listing the state with the largest average subplot and macroplot sizes for each year)
```

In this result, for each of the years 2015, 2016, and 2017, we have identified the state with the largest average subplot size and the state with the largest average macroplot size, based on the specified conditions and calculations..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'usfs_fia': ['population_stratum_assign', 'plot', 'plot_tree', 'tree', 'population_stratum', 'population_evaluation_group', 'condition', 'population_evaluation', 'population_estimation_unit', 'population_evaluation_type', 'population']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
