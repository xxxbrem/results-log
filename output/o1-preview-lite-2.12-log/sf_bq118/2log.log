Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant columns and potential usage:**

- **"DEATHRECORDS"."Icd10Code"**: To identify the ICD-10 codes associated with each death.
- **"DEATHRECORDS"."Race"**: To identify the race codes of individuals.
- **"RACE"."Code", "RACE"."Description"**: To map race codes to race descriptions; to find the code corresponding to 'White'.
- **"DEATHRECORDS"."AgeRecode12"**: To obtain age group codes of individuals.
- **"AGERECODE12"."Code", "AGERECODE12"."Description"**: To map age group codes to age group descriptions.
- **"ICD10CODE"."Code", "ICD10CODE"."Description"**: To map ICD-10 codes to descriptions; to find codes where descriptions contain 'discharge' or 'vehicle'.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter records where race description is 'White'.
- Filter ICD-10 codes where descriptions contain 'discharge', excluding 'Urethral discharge', 'Discharge of firework', and 'Legal intervention involving firearm discharge'.
- Filter ICD-10 codes where descriptions contain 'vehicle'.
- Aggregate data by age groups.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct race codes and their descriptions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description"
   FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."RACE";
   ```

2. **Find the race code corresponding to 'White':**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Code"
   FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."RACE"
   WHERE "Description" = 'White';
   ```

3. **List age group codes and their descriptions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Code", "Description"
   FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."AGERECODE12";
   ```

4. **Get ICD-10 codes where descriptions contain 'discharge':**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Code", "Description"
   FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE"
   WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%discharge%';
   ```

5. **Get ICD-10 codes where descriptions contain 'vehicle':**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Code", "Description"
   FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE"
   WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%';
   ```

6. **Get ICD-10 codes with 'discharge' in the description, excluding specific terms:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Code", "Description"
   FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE"
   WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%discharge%'
     AND "Description" NOT ILIKE '%Urethral discharge%'
     AND "Description" NOT ILIKE '%Discharge of firework%'
     AND "Description" NOT ILIKE '%Legal intervention involving firearm discharge%';
   ```

7. **Retrieve counts of deaths by race code:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Race", COUNT(*) AS "DeathCount"
   FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."DEATHRECORDS"
   GROUP BY "Race";
   ```

8. **Get total number of deaths among individuals identified as 'White':**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "DeathCount"
   FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."DEATHRECORDS"
   WHERE "Race" = (
     SELECT "Code"
     FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."RACE"
     WHERE "Description" = 'White'

Task: Among individuals identified as white, how much higher is the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word “discharge” (specifically excluding “Urethral discharge,” “Discharge of firework,” and “Legal intervention involving firearm discharge”) compared to the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word “vehicle,” when aggregated by age groups?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
AgeGroup,DifferenceInAverageDeathsPerCode
age_group1:str,difference1:float > 0
age_group2:str,difference2:float > 0
...
```

*Explanation:*

For each age group among individuals identified as white, this table shows how much higher the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word "discharge" (excluding "Urethral discharge," "Discharge of firework," and "Legal intervention involving firearm discharge") is compared to the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word "vehicle," when aggregated by age groups..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'DEATH': {'DEATH': ['ACTIVITYCODE', 'AGERECODE27', 'AGERECODE27', 'AGERECODE52', 'AGERECODE12', 'DEATHRECORDS', 'RESIDENTSTATUS', 'EDUCATION1989REVISION', 'EDUCATION1989REVISION', 'EDUCATION2003REVISION', 'EDUCATIONREPORTINGFLAG', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE5', 'RECORDAXISCONDITIONS', 'INFANTAGERECODE22', 'BRIDGEDRACEFLAG', 'AGETYPE', 'DAYOFWEEKOFDEATH', 'HISPANICORIGIN', 'METHODOFDISPOSITION', 'PLACEOFINJURY', 'RACEIMPUTATIONFLAG', 'MANNEROFDEATH', 'RACE', 'ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS', 'ICD10CODE', 'MARITALSTATUS', 'PLACEOFDEATHANDDECEDENTSSTATUS', 'TEMP_DEATHS', 'HISPANICORIGINRACERECODE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
