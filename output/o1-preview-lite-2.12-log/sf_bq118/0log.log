2025-01-24 13:13:09 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is because the placeholder `[code_for_white]` was not replaced with the actual code for 'White'. In SQL, placeholders like `[code_for_white]` are not recognized unless they are replaced with actual values.

From the previous query results, we found that the code for 'White' is **`1`**. Here's the relevant result:

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "Code" FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACE WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%White%';
```

**Result:**

```
Code
1
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS
WHERE "Race" = 1
LIMIT 100;
```

Please replace `[code_for_white]` with `1` in all your queries. This should resolve the error you're experiencing.

**Explanation:**

- The identifier `'CODE_FOR_WHITE'` is not valid because SQL does not interpret it as a variable or placeholder.
- By substituting the actual code value `1` for 'White', the query becomes valid, and the SQL engine can execute it without errors.

**Applying the Correction to Other Queries:**

Whenever you see `[code_for_white]` in the queries, replace it with `1`. For example:

**Original Query:**

```sql
SELECT dr.*
FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE ic ON dr."Icd10Code" = ic."Code"
WHERE dr."Race" = [code_for_white]
  AND ic."Description" ILIKE '%discharge%'
  AND ic."Description" NOT ILIKE '%urethral%'
  AND ic."Description" NOT ILIKE '%firework%'
  AND ic."Description" NOT ILIKE '%legal intervention involving firearm%'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT dr.*
FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE ic ON dr."Icd10Code" = ic."Code"
WHERE dr."Race" = 1
  AND ic."Description" ILIKE '%discharge%'
  AND ic."Description" NOT ILIKE '%urethral%'
  AND ic."Description" NOT ILIKE '%firework%'
  AND ic."Description" NOT ILIKE '%legal intervention involving firearm%'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Next Steps:**

1. **Run the Corrected Queries:** Execute the corrected queries to retrieve the necessary data.

2. **Compute the Averages:**

   - **Average Deaths from Discharges:**

     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(sub."Death_Count") AS "Average_Deaths_Discharge"
     FROM (
       SELECT dr."Age", COUNT(*) AS "Death_Count"
       FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
       JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE ic ON dr."Icd10Code" = ic."Code"
       WHERE dr."Race" = 1
         AND ic."Description" ILIKE '%discharge%'
         AND ic."Description" NOT ILIKE '%urethral%'
         AND ic."Description" NOT ILIKE '%firework%'
         AND ic."Description" NOT ILIKE '%legal intervention involving firearm%'
       GROUP BY dr."Age"
     ) sub;
     ```

   - **Average Deaths from Vehicle-Related Incidents:**

     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(sub."Death_Count") AS "Average_Deaths_Vehicle"
     FROM (
       SELECT dr."Age", COUNT(*) AS "Death_Count"
       FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
       JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE ic ON dr."Icd10Code" = ic."Code"
       WHERE dr."Race" = 1
         AND ic."Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
       GROUP BY dr."Age"
     ) sub;
     ```

3. **Calculate the Difference:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     (discharge_avg."Average_Deaths_Discharge" - vehicle_avg."Average_Deaths_Vehicle") AS "Difference_in_Average_Deaths"
   FROM
     (
       SELECT AVG(sub."Death_Count") AS "Average_Deaths_Discharge"
       FROM (
         SELECT dr."Age", COUNT(*) AS "Death_Count"
         FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
         JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE ic ON dr."Icd10Code" = ic."Code"
         WHERE dr."Race" = 1
           AND ic."Description" ILIKE '%discharge%'
           AND ic."Description" NOT ILIKE '%urethral%'
           AND ic."Description" NOT ILIKE '%firework%'
           AND ic."Description" NOT ILIKE '%legal intervention involving firearm%'
         GROUP BY dr."Age"
       ) sub
     ) discharge_avg,
     (
       SELECT AVG(sub."Death_Count") AS "Average_Deaths_Vehicle"
       FROM (
         SELECT dr."Age", COUNT(*) AS "Death_Count"
         FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
         JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE ic ON dr."Icd10Code" = ic."Code"
         WHERE dr."Race" = 1
           AND ic."Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
         GROUP BY dr."Age"
       ) sub
     ) vehicle_avg;
   ```

   This final query calculates how much higher the average number of deaths from discharges is compared to vehicle-related incidents for white people, averaged across different ages.

**Final Result Format:**

```csv
Difference_in_Average_Deaths
difference:float > 0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Note:** Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and that the tables contain the expected data before running these queries.

  - **"Race"**: Potential usage - To filter records of white people. Condition: "Race" code corresponds to 'White' in the `RACE` table.
  - **"Icd10Code"**: Potential usage - To identify the cause of death. Condition: Filter records where the cause of death is 'discharges' (excluding urethral discharge, firework discharge, and legal intervention involving firearm discharge) or 'vehicle-related incidents'.
  - **"Age"**: Potential usage - To compute averages across different ages.

- **Table:** `DEATH.DEATH.RACE`
  - **"Code"**: Potential usage - To map "Race" codes in `DEATHRECORDS` to race descriptions.
  - **"Description"**: Potential usage - To find the code corresponding to 'White'.

- **Table:** `DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE`
  - **"Code"**: Potential usage - To map "Icd10Code" in `DEATHRECORDS` to descriptions.
  - **"Description"**: Potential usage - To identify ICD-10 codes related to 'discharges' and 'vehicle-related incidents'.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter records where "Race" corresponds to 'White'.
- Filter records where "Icd10Code" corresponds to causes of death due to 'discharges' (excluding urethral discharge, firework discharge, and legal intervention involving firearm discharge) or 'vehicle-related incidents'.

Task: How much higher is the average number of white people dying from discharges (excluding urethral discharge, firework discharge, and legal intervention involving firearm discharge) compared to vehicle-related incidents averaged across different ages?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Difference_in_average_deaths
difference:float > 0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This value represents how much higher the average number of deaths among white people from discharges (excluding urethral discharge, firework discharge, and legal intervention involving firearm discharge) is compared to vehicle-related incidents, averaged across different ages..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'DEATH': {'DEATH': ['ACTIVITYCODE', 'AGERECODE12', 'AGERECODE27', 'AGERECODE52', 'AGETYPE', 'BRIDGEDRACEFLAG', 'DAYOFWEEKOFDEATH', 'DEATHRECORDS', 'EDUCATION1989REVISION', 'EDUCATION2003REVISION', 'EDUCATIONREPORTINGFLAG', 'ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS', 'HISPANICORIGIN', 'HISPANICORIGINRACERECODE', 'ICD10CODE', 'INFANTAGERECODE22', 'MANNEROFDEATH', 'MARITALSTATUS', 'METHODOFDISPOSITION', 'PLACEOFDEATHANDDECEDENTSSTATUS', 'PLACEOFINJURY', 'RACE', 'RACEIMPUTATIONFLAG', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE5', 'RECORDAXISCONDITIONS', 'RESIDENTSTATUS', 'TEMP_DEATHS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
