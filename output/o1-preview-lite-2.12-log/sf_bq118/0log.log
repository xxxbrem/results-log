**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **DEATHRECORDS."Race"**: Used to identify individuals by race, specifically to select individuals identified as white.
- **DEATHRECORDS."Icd10Code"**: Used to identify the ICD-10 codes associated with each death.
- **DEATHRECORDS."AgeRecode27"**: Used to group individuals into age groups for aggregation.
- **DEATHRECORDS."Age"**: Provides the age of individuals, potentially for more detailed age analysis.
- **ICD10CODE."Code"**: Used to join with DEATHRECORDS."Icd10Code" to access ICD-10 code descriptions.
- **ICD10CODE."Description"**: Contains descriptions of ICD-10 codes, used to filter codes containing specific words like "discharge" or "vehicle".
- **RACE."Code"**: Used to map to DEATHRECORDS."Race" to get race descriptions.
- **RACE."Description"**: Provides the race description (e.g., "White") corresponding to RACE."Code".
- **AGERECODE27."Code"**: Used to join with DEATHRECORDS."AgeRecode27" for age group descriptions.
- **AGERECODE27."Description"**: Contains age group descriptions for better readability.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct race codes from DEATHRECORDS:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Race"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve race codes and descriptions by joining DEATHRECORDS and RACE:**
   ```sql

   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
   JOIN DEATH.DEATH.RACE r ON dr."Race" = r."Code"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve distinct ICD-10 codes from DEATHRECORDS:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Icd10Code"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve ICD-10 codes and descriptions from ICD10CODE:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Code", "Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve ICD-10 codes and descriptions by joining DEATHRECORDS and ICD10CODE:**
   ```sql
   SELECT dr."Icd10Code", icd."Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
   JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE icd ON dr."Icd10Code" = icd."Code"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find ICD-10 codes with descriptions containing the word "discharge":**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Code", "Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
   WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%discharge%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find ICD-10 codes with descriptions containing the word "vehicle":**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Code", "Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
   WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find ICD-10 codes with descriptions containing "discharge" excluding specific phrases:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "Code", "Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
   WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%discharge%'
     AND "Description" NOT ILIKE '%Urethral discharge%'
     AND "Description" NOT ILIKE '%Discharge of firework%'
     AND "Description" NOT ILIKE '%Legal intervention involving firearm discharge%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve deaths among individuals identified as white:**
   ```sql
   SELECT dr.*
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
   WHERE dr."Race" = (
     SELECT "Code"
     FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACE
     WHERE "Description" = 'White'
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve age group codes and descriptions from AGERECODE27:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "Code", "Description"
    FROM DEATH.DEATH.AGERECODE27
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Aggregate death counts by age group for individuals identified as white:**
    ```sql
    SELECT ar."Description" AS "AgeGroup", COUNT(*) AS "DeathCount"
    FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
    JOIN DEATH.DEATH.AGERECODE27 ar ON dr."AgeRecode27" = ar."Code"

Task: Among individuals identified as white, how much higher is the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word “discharge” (specifically excluding “Urethral discharge,” “Discharge of firework,” and “Legal intervention involving firearm discharge”) compared to the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word “vehicle,” when aggregated by age groups?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
AgeGroup,DifferenceInAverageDeathsPerCode
age_group1:str,difference1:float > 0
age_group2:str,difference2:float > 0
...
```

*Explanation:*

For each age group among individuals identified as white, this table shows how much higher the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word "discharge" (excluding "Urethral discharge," "Discharge of firework," and "Legal intervention involving firearm discharge") is compared to the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word "vehicle," when aggregated by age groups..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'DEATH': {'DEATH': ['ACTIVITYCODE', 'AGERECODE27', 'AGERECODE27', 'AGERECODE52', 'AGERECODE12', 'DEATHRECORDS', 'RESIDENTSTATUS', 'EDUCATION1989REVISION', 'EDUCATION1989REVISION', 'EDUCATION2003REVISION', 'EDUCATIONREPORTINGFLAG', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE5', 'RECORDAXISCONDITIONS', 'INFANTAGERECODE22', 'BRIDGEDRACEFLAG', 'AGETYPE', 'DAYOFWEEKOFDEATH', 'HISPANICORIGIN', 'METHODOFDISPOSITION', 'PLACEOFINJURY', 'RACEIMPUTATIONFLAG', 'MANNEROFDEATH', 'RACE', 'ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS', 'ICD10CODE', 'MARITALSTATUS', 'PLACEOFDEATHANDDECEDENTSSTATUS', 'TEMP_DEATHS', 'HISPANICORIGINRACERECODE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 19:46:47 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Among individuals identified as white, how much higher is the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word “discharge” (specifically excluding “Urethral discharge,” “Discharge of firework,” and “Legal intervention involving firearm discharge”) compared to the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word “vehicle,” when aggregated by age groups?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
AgeGroup,DifferenceInAverageDeathsPerCode
age_group1:str,difference1:float > 0

```

*Explanation:*

For each age group among individuals identified as white, this table shows how much higher the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word "discharge" (excluding "Urethral discharge," "Discharge of firework," and "Legal intervention involving firearm discharge") is compared to the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word "vehicle," when aggregated by age groups. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
