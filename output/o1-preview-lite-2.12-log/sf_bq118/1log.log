2025-02-10 19:43:49 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of `[code_for_white]` in your SQL query. In SQL, `[code_for_white]` is not recognized as a valid identifier or value.

From your earlier query, you found that the code for "White" in the `RACE` table is **1**:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description"
FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACE
WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%white%'
LIMIT 100;

-- Results:
-- Code | Description
-- 1    | White
```

To fix the error, replace `[code_for_white]` with the actual code **1** in your query. Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS
WHERE "Race" = 1
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Replace Placeholder:** `[code_for_white]` is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual code value.
- **No Quotes for Numbers:** Since "Race" is a numeric field (based on how codes are usually stored), you should use **1** without quotes.

---

**Next Steps:**

If you run the corrected query, you should retrieve records of individuals identified as white. From here, you can proceed with further analysis, such as filtering records based on ICD-10 codes related to "discharge" and "vehicle", and aggregating by age groups.

Let me know if you need assistance with the subsequent queries or any further help!

**Relevant Tables, Columns, and Potential Usage:**

- **DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS**
  - `"Race"`: Used to filter individuals identified as white.
  - `"Icd10Code"`: Used to identify the cause of death.
  - `"AgeRecode27"`: Used to group deaths by age groups.
  - `"AgeRecode52"`: Alternative age grouping.
  - `"AgeRecode12"`: Alternative age grouping.
  - `"Age"`: Individual's age, could be used if needed.
  - `"Id"`: Unique identifier for death records.

- **DEATH.DEATH.RACE**
  - `"Code"`: Used to join with `DEATHRECORDS."Race"` to get race descriptions.
  - `"Description"`: Contains race descriptions (e.g., "White").

- **DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE**
  - `"Code"`: Used to join with `DEATHRECORDS."Icd10Code"`.
  - `"Description"`: Contains descriptions of ICD-10 codes. Used to find codes with "discharge" or "vehicle" in their descriptions, excluding specific terms.

- **DEATH.DEATH.AGERECODE27** (and similar tables `AGERECODE52`, `AGERECODE12`)
  - `"Code"`: Used to join with `DEATHRECORDS."AgeRecode27"` to get age group descriptions.
  - `"Description"`: Contains age group descriptions.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Filter for Individuals Identified as White:**
  - Use `DEATHRECORDS."Race"` matching the code corresponding to "White" in `RACE` table.
- **Filter for ICD-10 Codes Describing "Discharge":**
  - `ICD10CODE."Description" ILIKE '%discharge%'`
  - Exclude specific descriptions:
    - `ICD10CODE."Description" NOT IN ('Urethral discharge', 'Discharge of firework', 'Legal intervention involving firearm discharge')`
- **Filter for ICD-10 Codes Describing "Vehicle":**
  - `ICD10CODE."Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'`
- **Group By Age Groups:**
  - Use `DEATHRECORDS."AgeRecode27"` and join with `AGERECODE27` to get age group descriptions.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Find the Code for "White" Race:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACE
   WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%white%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List Age Groups from AGERECODE27:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.AGERECODE27
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List ICD-10 Codes with "Discharge" in Description:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
   WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%discharge%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List ICD-10 Codes with "Vehicle" in Description:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
   WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve Death Records of Individuals Identified as White:**
   *(Note: Replace `[code_for_white]` with the actual code found in query 1.)*
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS
   WHERE "Race" = [code_for_white]
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count Deaths by Age Group Among Whites:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "AgeRecode27", COUNT(*) AS "DeathCount"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS
   WHERE "Race" = [code_for_white]
   GROUP BY "AgeRecode27"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Join DEATHRECORDS with AGERECODE27 to Get Age Group Descriptions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT dr."Id", dr."AgeRecode27", ar."Description" AS "AgeGroup"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
   JOIN DEATH.DEATH.AGERECODE27 ar ON dr."AgeRecode27" = ar."Code"

Task: Among individuals identified as white, how much higher is the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word “discharge” (specifically excluding “Urethral discharge,” “Discharge of firework,” and “Legal intervention involving firearm discharge”) compared to the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word “vehicle,” when aggregated by age groups?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
AgeGroup,DifferenceInAverageDeathsPerCode
age_group1:str,difference1:float > 0
age_group2:str,difference2:float > 0
...
```

*Explanation:*

For each age group among individuals identified as white, this table shows how much higher the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word "discharge" (excluding "Urethral discharge," "Discharge of firework," and "Legal intervention involving firearm discharge") is compared to the average number of deaths from ICD-10 codes whose descriptions contain the word "vehicle," when aggregated by age groups..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'DEATH': {'DEATH': ['ACTIVITYCODE', 'AGERECODE27', 'AGERECODE27', 'AGERECODE52', 'AGERECODE12', 'DEATHRECORDS', 'RESIDENTSTATUS', 'EDUCATION1989REVISION', 'EDUCATION1989REVISION', 'EDUCATION2003REVISION', 'EDUCATIONREPORTINGFLAG', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE5', 'RECORDAXISCONDITIONS', 'INFANTAGERECODE22', 'BRIDGEDRACEFLAG', 'AGETYPE', 'DAYOFWEEKOFDEATH', 'HISPANICORIGIN', 'METHODOFDISPOSITION', 'PLACEOFINJURY', 'RACEIMPUTATIONFLAG', 'MANNEROFDEATH', 'RACE', 'ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS', 'ICD10CODE', 'MARITALSTATUS', 'PLACEOFDEATHANDDECEDENTSSTATUS', 'TEMP_DEATHS', 'HISPANICORIGINRACERECODE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
