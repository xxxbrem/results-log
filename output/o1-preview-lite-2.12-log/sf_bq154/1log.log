2025-02-11 13:23:35 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of an incorrect column name in your query. In the `CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED` table, there is no column named `"ParticipantBarcode"`. Instead, the patient barcode column in this table is named `"bcr_patient_barcode"`.

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT "bcr_patient_barcode", "icd_o_3_histology"
FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED
WHERE "icd_o_3_histology" IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE("icd_o_3_histology", '^\\[.*\\]$')
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Column Name Correction:** Replace `"ParticipantBarcode"` with `"bcr_patient_barcode"` in the `SELECT` clause, as that's the correct column name in the clinical data table.
  
- **Consistency in Column Names:** When joining data between tables, ensure that you are using the correct column names in each table. In the gene expression data (`EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED`), the patient barcode is stored as `"ParticipantBarcode"`, whereas in the clinical data (`CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED`), it is stored as `"bcr_patient_barcode"`.

With this correction, your query should run without errors and return the desired results.

---

**Updated Queries with Corrections:**

To ensure all the subsequent queries work correctly, here are the updated versions with the appropriate column names.

1. **Find LGG patients with their histology codes excluding codes in square brackets:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "bcr_patient_barcode", "icd_o_3_histology"
   FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED
   WHERE "icd_o_3_histology" IS NOT NULL
     AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE("icd_o_3_histology", '^\\[.*\\]$')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get the number of patients per histology code (including those with only one patient):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "icd_o_3_histology", COUNT(DISTINCT "bcr_patient_barcode") AS "Patient_Count"
   FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED
   WHERE "icd_o_3_histology" IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY "icd_o_3_histology"
   ORDER BY "Patient_Count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Identify histology codes with more than one patient (excluding codes in square brackets):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "icd_o_3_histology", COUNT(DISTINCT "bcr_patient_barcode") AS "Patient_Count"
   FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED
   WHERE "icd_o_3_histology" IS NOT NULL
     AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE("icd_o_3_histology", '^\\[.*\\]$')
   GROUP BY "icd_o_3_histology"
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "bcr_patient_barcode") > 1
   ORDER BY "Patient_Count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Join gene expression data with clinical data for LGG patients on IGF2 expression:**

   ```sql
   SELECT e."ParticipantBarcode", c."icd_o_3_histology", LOG10(e."normalized_count" + 1) AS "Expression"
   FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED e
   JOIN PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED c
     ON e."ParticipantBarcode" = c."bcr_patient_barcode"
   WHERE e."Study" = 'LGG' AND e."Symbol" = 'IGF2' AND e."normalized_count" IS NOT NULL
     AND c."icd_o_3_histology" IS NOT NULL AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE(c."icd_o_3_histology", '^\\[.*\\]$')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate the average IGF2 expression per patient:**

   ```sql
   SELECT e."ParticipantBarcode", AVG(LOG10(e."normalized_count" + 1)) AS "Avg_Expression"
   FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED e
   WHERE e."Study" = 'LGG' AND e."Symbol" = 'IGF2' AND e."normalized_count" IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY e."ParticipantBarcode"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate the average IGF2 expression per histology code (for codes with more than one patient):**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."icd_o_3_histology", COUNT(DISTINCT e."ParticipantBarcode") AS "Patient_Count",
          AVG(LOG10(e."normalized_count" + 1)) AS "Avg_Expression"
   FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED e
   JOIN PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED c
     ON e."ParticipantBarcode" = c."bcr_patient_barcode"
   WHERE e."Study" = 'LGG' AND e."Symbol" = 'IGF2' AND e."normalized_count" IS NOT NULL
     AND c."icd_o_3_histology" IS NOT NULL AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE(c."icd_o_3_histology", '^\\[.*\\]$')
   GROUP BY c."icd_o_3_histology"
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT e."ParticipantBarcode") > 1
   ORDER BY "Patient_Count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Note on Quoting Identifiers:**

- In Snowflake, double quotes (`"`) are used to delimit identifiers (such as column names) and make them case-sensitive.
- If your column names are all uppercase (as is often standard in Snowflake unless identifiers were quoted when the table was created), you can reference them without quotes or using uppercase letters.
- To avoid case-sensitivity issues, you might consider not using quotes if your identifiers are stored in uppercase.

**Example Without Quotes:**

```sql
SELECT BCR_PATIENT_BARCODE, ICD_O_3_HISTOLOGY
FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED
WHERE ICD_O_3_HISTOLOGY IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE(ICD_O_3_HISTOLOGY, '^\\[.*\\]$')
LIMIT 100;
```

Similarly, adjust other queries accordingly.

---

**Summary:**

- Replace `"ParticipantBarcode"` with `"bcr_patient_barcode"` in the clinical data queries.
- Ensure that when joining tables, you are matching the correct column names.
- Verify the exact column names and their cases in your tables, especially if identifiers are case-sensitive due to being quoted during table creation.
- By making these corrections, your queries should execute successfully without the `invalid identifier` error.

If you have any further issues or need additional assistance with the queries, please let me know!

**Explanation:**

In these corrected SQL queries, I replaced `"ParticipantBarcode"` with `"bcr_patient_barcode"` in any reference to the clinical data table (`CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED`).

- In the clinical data table, the patient barcode column is `"bcr_patient_barcode"`.
- In the gene expression data table (`EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED`), the patient barcode column is `"ParticipantBarcode"`.

By ensuring that the column names are correctly referenced according to the respective tables, these queries should now run without the `invalid identifier` errors.

If you encounter any further issues or need additional assistance, please let me know!

2025-02-11 13:28:44 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of an incorrect column name in your SQL query. In the table `CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED`, the column `"ParticipantBarcode"` does not exist. The correct column name for the patient barcode in this table is `"bcr_patient_barcode"`.

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT "icd_o_3_histology", COUNT(DISTINCT "bcr_patient_barcode") AS "Patient_Count"
   FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED
   WHERE "icd_o_3_histology" IS NOT NULL
     AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE("icd_o_3_histology", '^\\[.*\\]$')
   GROUP BY "icd_o_3_histology"
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "bcr_patient_barcode") > 1
   ORDER BY "Patient_Count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Corrected Column Name:** Replaced `"ParticipantBarcode"` with `"bcr_patient_barcode"` wherever it appears in the query when referencing the clinical data table.
  - In the `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` clause: `COUNT(DISTINCT "bcr_patient_barcode") AS "Patient_Count"`
  - In the `HAVING` clause: `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "bcr_patient_barcode") > 1`
  
- **Column Reference:** In the `CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED` table, patient barcodes are stored in the `"bcr_patient_barcode"` column.

By using the correct column name, this should resolve the `invalid identifier '"ParticipantBarcode"'` error.

---

**Additional Corrections to Your Other Queries:**

1. **Query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ParticipantBarcode", AVG(LOG10("normalized_count" + 1)) AS "Avg_Expression"
   FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED
   WHERE "Study" = 'LGG' AND "Symbol" = 'IGF2' AND "normalized_count" IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY "ParticipantBarcode"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   **No changes needed here, as `"ParticipantBarcode"` is a valid column in the gene expression table.**

2. **Query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT e."ParticipantBarcode", c."icd_o_3_histology", LOG10(e."normalized_count" + 1) AS "Expression"
   FROM ... (rest of the query)
   ```
   **Correction:** Ensure that when joining the tables, you match the correct patient barcode columns:
   - Replace `c."ParticipantBarcode"` with `c."bcr_patient_barcode"` in the `ON` clause.
   - Corrected `ON` clause:
     ```sql
     ON e."ParticipantBarcode" = c."bcr_patient_barcode"
     ```
   
3. **Query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c."icd_o_3_histology", COUNT(DISTINCT e."ParticipantBarcode") AS "Patient_Count",
          AVG(LOG10(e."normalized_count" + 1)) AS "Avg_Expression"
   FROM ... (rest of the query)
   ```
   **Correction:**
   - Replace `c."ParticipantBarcode"` with `c."bcr_patient_barcode"` in the `ON` clause.
   
4. **Query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ParticipantBarcode", COUNT(*) AS "Sample_Count"
   FROM ... (rest of the query)
   ```
   **No changes needed here, as `"ParticipantBarcode"` is a valid column in the gene expression table.**

5. **Query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c."ParticipantBarcode", c."icd_o_3_histology"
   FROM ... (rest of the query)
   ```
   **Correction:**
   - Replace `c."ParticipantBarcode"` with `c."bcr_patient_barcode"` in both the `SELECT` clause and the `ON` clause.
   - Adjusted `SELECT` clause:
     ```sql
     SELECT c."bcr_patient_barcode", c."icd_o_3_histology"
     ```
   - Adjusted `ON` clause:
     ```sql
     ON c."bcr_patient_barcode" = e."ParticipantBarcode" AND ...
     ```
   
6. **Query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT e."ParticipantBarcode", LOG10(e."normalized_count" + 1) AS "Expression", c."icd_o_3_histology"
   FROM ... (rest of the query)
   ```
   **Correction:**
   - Replace `c."ParticipantBarcode"` with `c."bcr_patient_barcode"` in the `ON` clause.

7. **Query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT LOG10(e."normalized_count" + 1) AS "Expression"
   FROM ... (rest of the query)
   ```
   **No changes needed here, as this query only references the gene expression table.**

8. **Query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c."icd_o_3_histology", e."ParticipantBarcode"
   FROM ... (rest of the query)
   ```
   **Correction:**
   - Replace `c."ParticipantBarcode"` with `c."bcr_patient_barcode"` in the `ON` clause.

---

**Summary:**

- **Clinical Data Table (`CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED`):**
  - Patient barcode column: `"bcr_patient_barcode"`

- **Gene Expression Data Table (`EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED`):**
  - Patient barcode column: `"ParticipantBarcode"`

When joining these two tables or referencing columns from the clinical data table, be sure to use `"bcr_patient_barcode"` for patient barcodes in the clinical table.

**General Tip:** If you encounter an `invalid identifier` error, double-check the column names in your tables to ensure they are correctly referenced in your query.

2025-02-11 13:30:41 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is because the function `LOG10()` is not recognized in Snowflake SQL. In Snowflake, logarithmic functions are defined differently. To compute the logarithm of a number with a specific base, you should use the `LOG()` function with two arguments:

- `LOG(base, numeric_expr)`: Returns the logarithm of `numeric_expr` with the specified `base`.

To compute the base 10 logarithm of a number, you should use `LOG(10, numeric_expr)`.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "ParticipantBarcode", AVG(LOG(10, "normalized_count" + 1)) AS "Avg_Expression"
FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED
WHERE "Study" = 'LGG' AND "Symbol" = 'IGF2' AND "normalized_count" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "ParticipantBarcode"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Replaced `LOG10()` Function:**
  - **Original:** `LOG10("normalized_count" + 1)`
  - **Corrected:** `LOG(10, "normalized_count" + 1)`
  
  In Snowflake SQL, `LOG10()` is not a valid function. Instead, you can use `LOG(10, x)` to calculate the base 10 logarithm of `x`.

**Additional Guidance:**

If you have other queries that use the `LOG10()` function, you should replace it with `LOG(10, x)`.

**Example Corrections for Other Queries:**

1. **Computing Expression in a SELECT Clause:**

   ```sql
   SELECT LOG(10, e."normalized_count" + 1) AS "Expression", ...
   ```

2. **Using LOG10 in WHERE or HAVING Clauses:**

   ```sql
   HAVING AVG(LOG(10, e."normalized_count" + 1)) > some_value
   ```

3. **Any Occurrence of LOG10(x):**

   Replace with:

   ```sql
   LOG(10, x)
   ```

**Reference:**

- [Snowflake Documentation for LOG Function](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/log.html)

**Summary:**

By adjusting your queries to use `LOG(10, x)` instead of `LOG10(x)`, you should resolve the `Unknown function LOG10` error and successfully execute your SQL statements in Snowflake.

ORDER BY "Patient_Count" DESC

```

---

**Explanation:**

The error you're encountering is due to two main issues in your SQL query:

1. **Invalid Identifier `'c."ParticipantBarcode"'`:**

   - In the `CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED` table (`c` alias), the patient barcode column is named `"bcr_patient_barcode"` and **not** `"ParticipantBarcode"`.
   - **Correction:** Replace `c."ParticipantBarcode"` with `c."bcr_patient_barcode"` in the `ON` clause of your `JOIN`.

2. **Unknown Function `LOG10`:**

   - Snowflake SQL does not support the `LOG10` function.
   - **Correction:** Use `LOG(10, x)` instead of `LOG10(x)` to compute the base 10 logarithm.
     - So, replace `LOG10(e."normalized_count" + 1)` with `LOG(10, e."normalized_count" + 1)`.

**Updated SQL Query with Corrections:**

- **JOIN Clause Correction:**
  ```sql
  ON e."ParticipantBarcode" = c."bcr_patient_barcode"
  ```
- **Logarithm Function Correction:**
  ```sql
  AVG(LOG(10, e."normalized_count" + 1)) AS "Avg_Expression"
  ```

**Final Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT c."icd_o_3_histology", COUNT(DISTINCT e."ParticipantBarcode") AS "Patient_Count",
       AVG(LOG(10, e."normalized_count" + 1)) AS "Avg_Expression"
FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED e
JOIN PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED c
  ON e."ParticipantBarcode" = c."bcr_patient_barcode"
WHERE e."Study" = 'LGG' AND e."Symbol" = 'IGF2' AND e."normalized_count" IS NOT NULL
  AND c."icd_o_3_histology" IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE(c."icd_o_3_histology", '^\\[.*\\]$')
GROUP BY c."icd_o_3_histology"
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT e."ParticipantBarcode") > 1
ORDER BY "Patient_Count" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Additional Guidance:**

- **Ensure Consistent Column References:**
  - When referencing columns, always use the correct column names as they appear in the table schema.
  - In your case, the clinical data table (`CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED`) uses `"bcr_patient_barcode"` as the patient identifier, whereas the gene expression data table (`EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED`) uses `"ParticipantBarcode"`.

- **Function Usage in Snowflake SQL:**
  - Snowflake SQL uses the `LOG` function for logarithms with a specified base.
    - `LOG(base, numeric_expr)`
  - The `LOG10` function is not available in Snowflake, so you need to use `LOG(10, x)` instead.

- **Consistent Use of Aliases:**
  - Ensure that you consistently use table aliases when referencing columns, especially in queries involving joins.
  - This helps prevent ambiguity and errors related to invalid identifiers.

**Summary of Corrections:**

1. **Replace `c."ParticipantBarcode"` with `c."bcr_patient_barcode"`** in the `ON` clause.

2. **Replace `LOG10` with `LOG(10, ...)`** wherever it appears in your query.

By applying these corrections, your query should run successfully without the `invalid identifier` or `unknown function` errors.

---

**Example of Result After Correction:**

Assuming the data exists and the query runs successfully, you might get results similar to:

| icd_o_3_histology | Patient_Count | Avg_Expression |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|
| 9450/3             |        6      |      2.65      |
| 9401/3             |        4      |      2.55      |
| 9382/3             |        3      |      2.75      |
| ...                |       ...     |      ...       |

(Note: The actual results depend on the data in your tables.)

**Explanation:**

- **Correction of Column Names:**
  - In the clinical data table (`CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED`), the patient barcode column is `"bcr_patient_barcode"`.
  - Replaced `c."ParticipantBarcode"` with `c."bcr_patient_barcode"` in the `SELECT` clause and the `ON` clause of the `JOIN`.
  
- **Function Correction:**
  - Replaced `LOG10(...)` with `LOG(10, ...)` because `LOG10` is not recognized in Snowflake SQL.
  
- **Consistency in Joins:**
  - Ensured that the `ON` clauses correctly match `e."ParticipantBarcode"` from the gene expression table (`e`) with `c."bcr_patient_barcode"` from the clinical data table (`c`).
  
By making these corrections, the SQL queries should now run without errors and produce the expected results.

```

---

**Explanation:**

The error you're encountering is due to two issues in your SQL query:

1. **Invalid Identifier `c."ParticipantBarcode"`:**

   - In the clinical data table `CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED` (aliased as `c`), the patient barcode column is named `"bcr_patient_barcode"`, not `"ParticipantBarcode"`.
   - **Correction:** Replace `c."ParticipantBarcode"` with `c."bcr_patient_barcode"` in the `ON` clause of the `JOIN`.

2. **Unknown Function `LOG10`:**

   - Snowflake SQL does not recognize the `LOG10` function.
   - **Correction:** Use `LOG(10, x)` instead of `LOG10(x)` to calculate the base 10 logarithm.
   - So, replace `LOG10(e."normalized_count" + 1)` with `LOG(10, e."normalized_count" + 1)`.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT e."ParticipantBarcode", LOG(10, e."normalized_count" + 1) AS "Expression", c."icd_o_3_histology"
FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED e
JOIN PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED c
  ON e."ParticipantBarcode" = c."bcr_patient_barcode"
WHERE e."Study" = 'LGG' AND e."Symbol" = 'IGF2' AND e."normalized_count" IS NOT NULL
  AND c."icd_o_3_histology" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

---

By making these corrections:

- **Column Reference Correction:** Changed `c."ParticipantBarcode"` to `c."bcr_patient_barcode"` in the `ON` clause of the `JOIN` because `"ParticipantBarcode"` does not exist in the clinical table, but `"bcr_patient_barcode"` does.

- **Function Correction:** Replaced `LOG10(e."normalized_count" + 1)` with `LOG(10, e."normalized_count" + 1)` because `LOG10` is not a recognized function in Snowflake SQL.

This corrected query should resolve the `invalid identifier` error and execute successfully.

**Note:** If you have similar errors in other queries, make sure to:

- Use the correct column names from each table.
  - For the clinical data table (`c`), use `"bcr_patient_barcode"` instead of `"ParticipantBarcode"`.
  - For the gene expression data table (`e`), `"ParticipantBarcode"` is correct.

- Replace any occurrences of `LOG10` with `LOG(10, ...)` in your queries.

2025-02-11 13:39:14 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is because the function `LOG10()` is not recognized in Snowflake SQL. In Snowflake, to compute logarithms with a specific base, you should use the `LOG()` function with two arguments:

- `LOG(base, numeric_expr)`: Returns the logarithm of `numeric_expr` with the specified `base`.

To compute the base 10 logarithm of a number, replace `LOG10(x)` with `LOG(10, x)`.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT LOG(10, e."normalized_count" + 1) AS "Expression"
FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED e
WHERE e."Study" = 'LGG' AND e."Symbol" = 'IGF2' AND e."normalized_count" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Replace `LOG10` with `LOG(10, ...)`:** In Snowflake SQL, the `LOG10()` function is not available. Instead, use the `LOG()` function with the base specified as the first argument. So, `LOG10(x)` becomes `LOG(10, x)`.

By applying this change, your query should run successfully without the `Unknown function LOG10` error.

---

**Additional Note:**

If you have other queries that use `LOG10()`, you'll need to make the same adjustment:

- Replace `LOG10(x)` with `LOG(10, x)`.

**Example Correction:**

Original:

```sql
SELECT LOG10(value) FROM my_table;
```

Corrected:

```sql
SELECT LOG(10, value) FROM my_table;
```

```

---

**Explanation:**

You're encountering the `invalid identifier 'C."ParticipantBarcode"'` error because the column `"ParticipantBarcode"` does not exist in the clinical data table (`CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED`), which is aliased as `c`. In that table, the patient barcode is stored in the column `"bcr_patient_barcode"`. 

Here's how to correct your query:

1. **Correct the Column Name in the JOIN Clause:**

   - **Original JOIN Clause:**
     ```sql
     ON c."ParticipantBarcode" = e."ParticipantBarcode"
     ```
   - **Corrected JOIN Clause:**
     ```sql
     ON c."bcr_patient_barcode" = e."ParticipantBarcode"
     ```

2. **Use the Correct Column for Patient Barcode in the Clinical Table:**

   - Use `c."bcr_patient_barcode"` wherever you need the patient barcode from the clinical table.

3. **No Changes Needed for the Gene Expression Table:**

   - The gene expression table (`EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED`), aliased as `e`, uses `"ParticipantBarcode"` as the patient identifier, which is correct.

By making this correction, your query now matches the patient barcodes correctly between the two tables, and the invalid identifier error should be resolved.

**Summary of Corrections:**

- **FROM Clause remains the same.**
- **JOIN Clause corrected:**
  - Replaced `c."ParticipantBarcode"` with `c."bcr_patient_barcode"`.
- **No other changes are needed in the rest of the query since the issue was specifically with the invalid identifier in the JOIN condition.**

**Additional Note:**

- Always ensure that you are using the correct column names from each table, especially when performing JOIN operations.
- If you encounter `invalid identifier` errors, it's often due to typos or incorrect column names that don't exist in the specified table or alias.

**Revised Query with Corrections:**

```sql
SELECT c."icd_o_3_histology", e."ParticipantBarcode"
FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED c
JOIN PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED e
  ON c."bcr_patient_barcode" = e."ParticipantBarcode"
WHERE e."Study" = 'LGG' AND e."Symbol" = 'IGF2' AND e."normalized_count" IS NOT NULL
  AND c."icd_o_3_histology" IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY c."icd_o_3_histology"
LIMIT 100;
```

# Regulome Explorer Kruskal-Wallis test for numerical and categorical data

CCheck out more notebooks at our ['Regulome Explorer Repository'](https://github.com/isb-cgc/Community-Notebooks/tree/master/RegulomeExplorer)!

In this notebook we describe how Regulome Explorer uses Kruskal-Wallis test to compute the significance of associations between a numerical feature (Gene expression, Somatic copy number, etc.) and a categorical feature. Details of the Kruskal-Wallist test can be found in the following link: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal–Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance)

To describe the implementation of the test using BigQuery, we will use Gene expresion data of a user defined gene and a user defined clinical feature. This data is read from a BigQuery table in the pancancer-atlas dataset.

## Authenticate with Google (IMPORTANT)

The first step is to authorize access to BigQuery and the Google Cloud. For more information see ['Quick Start Guide to ISB-CGC'](https://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/HowToGetStartedonISB-CGC.html) and alternative authentication methods can be found [here](https://googleapis.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/core/auth.html).

#### Import Python libraries

In [1]:

```
%matplotlib inline
from google.cloud import bigquery
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats
from scipy.stats import mstats
import seaborn as sns
import re_module.bq_functions as regulome
```

## User defined Parameters

The parameters for this experiment are the cancer type, the name of gene for which gene expression data will be obtained, and the clinical feature name. Categorical groups with number of samples smaller than 'MinSampleSize' will be ignored in the test.

In [2]:

```
cancer_type = 'LGG'
gene_name = 'IGF2'
clinical_feature = 'icd_o_3_histology'
MinSampleSize = 26

bqclient = bigquery.Client()
```

## Data from BigQuery tables

**Gene expression data from the BigQuery:** The following query string retrieves the gene expression data of the user specified gene ('gene_name') from the 'Filtered.EBpp_AdjustPANCAN_IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeqV2_genExp_filtered' table available in pancancer-atlas dataset.

In [3]:

```

```

**Clinical data from the BigQuery:** The following string query will retrieve clinical data fromthe 'pancancer-atlas.Filtered.clinical_PANCAN_patient_with_followup_filtered' table available in pancancer-atlas dataset. It is worth noting that some of the values of the clinical feature may be 'indetermined' or 'not-evaluated'; typically these values are inside square brackets. The 'REGEXP_CONTAINS' command is used to avoid using those values in the test.

In [4]:

```

```

The following query combines the two tables based on Participant barcodes. T

```

```

At this point we can take a look at output table

## BigQuery to Compute statistical association

The Kruskal-Wallis score (H) is computed by using the following equation:
$$
H = \frac{(N-1)\sum_{i=1}^{g} n_i (\bar{r_{i}} -\bar{r} )^2 }{ \sum_{i=1}^{g} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (r_{ij}-\bar{r})^2   }
$$
where

- $n_{i}$ is the number of observations in category $i$
- $r_{ij}$ is the rank (among all participants) of the gene expression of participant jj that belongs to category $i$
- $N$ is the total number of participants considered in the test
- $\bar{r_i}$ is the average rank of gene expression values for participants in category $i$
- $\bar{r}$ is the average of all $r_{ij}$

To avoid reading that table multiple times, we rearranged the equations above as :
$$
H = (N-1)\frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{g}S_i^2/n_i - (\sum_{i=1}^{g}S_i)^2 / N }{ \sum_{i=1}^{g}Q_i - (\sum_{i=1}^{g}S_i)^2 / N }
$$
Where $S_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n_i}r_{ij}$ and $Q_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n_i}r_{ij}^2$

The following query string computes $S_i$ and $Q_i$:

In [8]:

```

```

The query above ingnores the categories that have a number of participants smaller or equal than 'MinSampleSize'. Moreover, the gene expression is ranked, assigning **average** of ranks to the similar values( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.rankdata.html). Finally, The Kruskall-Wallis score ($H$) is computed by the following BigQuery string.

Task: Calculate the Kruskal-Wallis H-score among groups of LGG patients for IGF2 gene expression, where each patient’s IGF2 expression is determined by applying log10(normalized_count + 1) and then averaging across samples. Group the patients by ICD-O-3 histology codes, exclude any codes fully enclosed in square brackets, only include groups with more than one patient, and ensure that normalized count is not null. Finally, return the total number of groups, the total number of samples, and the Kruskal-Wallis H-score in descending order.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Total_Groups,Total_Samples,Kruskal_Wallis_H_score
3,30,2.7567
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

We calculated the Kruskal-Wallis H-score among three groups of LGG patients, grouped by their ICD-O-3 histology codes after excluding codes fully enclosed in square brackets and groups with only one patient. Each patient's IGF2 gene expression was determined by applying log10(normalized_count + 1) and then averaging across samples. The total number of samples (patients) included in the test is 30. The Kruskal-Wallis H-score is approximately 2.7567..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'PANCANCER_ATLAS_1': {'PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED': ['CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED', 'EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED', 'JHU_USC_EDU_PANCAN_HUMANMETHYLATION27_BETAVALUE_WHITELISTED_FILTERED', 'JHU_USC_EDU_PANCAN_HUMANMETHYLATION27_BETAVALUE_WHITELISTED_FILTERED', 'JHU_USC_EDU_PANCAN_HUMANMETHYLATION450_BETAVALUE_WHITELISTED_FILTERED', 'ALL_CNVR_DATA_BY_GENE_FILTERED', 'PURITY_PLOIDY_ALL_SAMPLES_FILTERED', 'PANCANMIRS_EBADJONPROTOCOLPLATFORMWITHOUTREPSWITHUNCORRECTMIRS_08_04_16_FILTERED', 'JHU_USC_EDU_PANCAN_MERGED_HUMANMETHYLATION27_HUMANMETHYLATION450_BETAVALUE_WHITELISTED_FILTERED', 'MC3_MAF_V5_ONE_PER_TUMOR_SAMPLE', 'TCGA_RPPA_PANCAN_CLEAN_FILTERED']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 13:43:29 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Calculate the Kruskal-Wallis H-score among groups of LGG patients for IGF2 gene expression, where each patient’s IGF2 expression is determined by applying log10(normalized_count + 1) and then averaging across samples. Group the patients by ICD-O-3 histology codes, exclude any codes fully enclosed in square brackets, only include groups with more than one patient, and ensure that normalized count is not null. Finally, return the total number of groups, the total number of samples, and the Kruskal-Wallis H-score in descending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Total_Groups,Total_Samples,Kruskal_Wallis_H_score
3,30,2.7567
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

We calculated the Kruskal-Wallis H-score among three groups of LGG patients, grouped by their ICD-O-3 histology codes after excluding codes fully enclosed in square brackets and groups with only one patient. Each patient's IGF2 gene expression was determined by applying log10(normalized_count + 1) and then averaging across samples. The total number of samples (patients) included in the test is 30. The Kruskal-Wallis H-score is approximately 2.7567. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
