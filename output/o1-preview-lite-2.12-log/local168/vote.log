1result.sql
```

I selected `1result.sql` because it comprehensively captures remote "Data Analyst" positions by considering both cases where `job_work_from_home = 1` and where `job_location` includes the term 'Remote'. This ensures that all relevant remote positions are included in the calculation. Additionally, it accurately identifies the top three most frequently demanded skills among these positions and calculates the overall average salary accordingly.
