After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Accurate Date Filtering:**
   - **`2result.sql`** correctly filters the data for April 2023 by specifying the timestamp range in microseconds:
     ```sql
     WHERE t."block_timestamp" >= 1680307200000000  -- April 1, 2023
       AND t."block_timestamp" < 1682899200000000   -- May 1, 2023
     ```
     This ensures that only transactions from April 2023 are considered.
   - **`0result.sql`** also filters the date accurately using `DATE_PART(EPOCH_MICROSECOND, TIMESTAMP '2023-04-01')`, but the method in **`2result.sql`** is more straightforward and readable.
   - **`1result.sql`** uses the same timestamp range but shows inconsistent results in the output.

2. **Handling NULL Values and Net Changes:**
   - **`2result.sql`** includes a condition to exclude NULL `NetChange` values:
     ```sql
     WHERE "NetChange" IS NOT NULL
     ```
     This ensures that only valid net changes are considered when determining the highest and lowest values.
   - **`0result.sql`** and **`1result.sql`** do not explicitly handle NULL net changes, which could lead to inaccurate results if NULL values are present.

3. **Robust Ranking Logic:**
   - **`2result.sql`** employs the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to rank net changes both in ascending and descending order:
     ```sql
     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY "NetChange" DESC NULLS LAST) AS rn_high,
     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY "NetChange" ASC NULLS FIRST) AS rn_low
     ```
     This approach accurately identifies the highest and lowest net changes, even if there are ties.
   - **`0result.sql`** uses `ORDER BY` with `LIMIT 1` but may not handle ties effectively.
   - **`1result.sql`** shows reversed results, indicating potential issues with the ordering logic.

4. **Consistency of Results:**
   - The results from **`2result.sql`** correctly identify:
     - The address with the **highest net change**:
       ```
       Address: bitcoincash:qpw92uykukle7c399zm7cgkc7xl5uxazzcparwutsu
       Type: pubkeyhash
       NetChange: 183,832,269,544.0000
       ```
     - The address with the **lowest net change**:
       ```
       Address: bitcoincash:qq2qjesqhy78k5xznl39tqkyjphegmn5hum4sckvhp
       Type: pubkeyhash
       NetChange: -214,112,051,252.0000
       ```
   - **`1result.sql`** provides inconsistent results, with the highest net change being negative, which does not make logical sense.

5. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - **`2result.sql`** includes comments explaining the timestamps, improving readability and maintainability.
   - The query structure in **`2result.sql`** is organized and follows best practices for SQL querying.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the accurate date filtering, robust handling of NULL values, correct ranking logic, and consistent results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL for determining the highest and lowest net changes among all addresses and types on Bitcoin Cash as of April 2023.
