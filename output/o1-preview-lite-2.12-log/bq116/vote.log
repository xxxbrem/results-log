After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query to answer the task.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Units Consistency:**
   - **`0result.sql`** includes the condition `n.units = 'USD'`, ensuring that only revenue values reported in U.S. dollars are included in the calculation.
   - This is crucial because including values in other currencies without proper conversion would skew the total revenue figures and make state comparisons inaccurate.
   - **`2result.sql`** lacks this condition, potentially including revenues reported in foreign currencies.

2. **Fiscal Period Focus:**
   - **`0result.sql`** filters for `s.fiscal_period_focus = 'FY'` to ensure only annual reports are considered.
   - This aligns with the task's requirement to consider companies that provided four quarters of data and reported annual revenues.
   - **`2result.sql`** does not include this filter, possibly including interim or quarterly reports, which could lead to double-counting or incomplete annual data.

3. **Country Filter:**
   - **`0result.sql`** includes `s.countryba = 'US'` to consider only U.S.-based companies.
   - This is important because the task focuses on U.S. states and wants to exclude revenues from companies based in other countries, even if they report revenues in U.S. states.
   - **`2result.sql`** does not have this filter and might include companies based outside the U.S.

4. **Compliance with Task Conditions:**
   - **`0result.sql`** fully adheres to all specified conditions in the task, including:
     - Companies that provided four quarters of data (`n.number_of_quarters = 4`).
     - Revenue measure tags (`n.measure_tag IN ('Revenues', 'SalesRevenueNet', 'SalesRevenueGoodsNet')`).
     - Excluding entries where the state field (`s.stprba`) is null or empty.
   - It also adds necessary conditions to ensure data accuracy and relevance, which are implied in the task description.

5. **Data Accuracy:**
   - The slight difference in total revenue for Texas between the two queries (approx. $141 billion) could be due to the inclusion of non-USD revenues or non-annual reports in **`2result.sql`**.
   - By enforcing stricter conditions, **`0result.sql`** provides a more accurate and reliable result.
