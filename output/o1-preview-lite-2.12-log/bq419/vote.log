To determine which SQL query correctly answers the question **"Which 5 states had the most storm events from 1980 to 1995, considering only the top 1000 events with the highest magnitudes each year?"**, we'll analyze each of the provided SQL scripts and their results.

---

### **Option 0: `0result.sql`**

**SQL Script:**

```sql
WITH per_year_top_events AS (
  SELECT
    `state`,
    `magnitude`
  FROM (
    SELECT
      `state`,
      `magnitude`,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY _TABLE_SUFFIX ORDER BY `magnitude` DESC) AS rn
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.noaa_historic_severe_storms.storms_*`
    WHERE
      _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '1980' AND '1995'
      AND `magnitude` IS NOT NULL
      AND `state` IS NOT NULL
  )
  WHERE
    rn <= 1000
)
SELECT
  `state`,
  COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Storm_Events
FROM
  per_year_top_events
GROUP BY
  `state`
ORDER BY
  Number_of_Storm_Events DESC
LIMIT
  5;
```

**Result (`0result.csv`):**

```
state,Number_of_Storm_Events
Te,1831
Ok,1768
Ka,1733
Mi,1671
Ne,1318
```

**Analysis:**

- **What it does:**
  - Selects the top 1000 events per year (from 1980 to 1995) based on `magnitude`.
  - Uses `_TABLE_SUFFIX` to efficiently partition data by year (since each year's data is in a separate table).
  - Filters out events where `magnitude` or `state` is NULL.
  - Aggregates the total number of events per state from the selected top events.
  - Outputs the top 5 states with the highest number of storm events.

- **Why it's correct:**
  - Correctly identifies the top 1000 events **per year** based on `magnitude`.
  - Considers only the specified period (1980 to 1995).
  - Uses state abbreviations.
  - The result aligns with the task requirements.

### **Option 1: `1result.sql`**

**SQL Script:**

```sql
SELECT
  UPPER(state) AS State,
  COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Storm_Events
FROM (
  SELECT state
  FROM (
    SELECT
      state,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM event_begin_time)
        ORDER BY magnitude DESC
      ) AS rn
    FROM (
      SELECT state, magnitude, event_begin_time
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_historic_severe_storms.storms_1980`
      UNION ALL
      -- (Continues UNION ALL for each year up to 1995)
      SELECT state, magnitude, event_begin_time
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_historic_severe_storms.storms_1995`
    )
    WHERE magnitude IS NOT NULL
  )
  WHERE rn <= 1000
)
GROUP BY State
ORDER BY Number_of_Storm_Events DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Result (`1result.csv`):**

```
State,Number_of_Storm_Events
TE,1831
OK,1768
KA,1733
MI,1671
NE,1318
```

**Analysis:**

- **What it does:**
  - Performs a **UNION ALL** of individual yearly tables from 1980 to 1995.
  - Selects the top 1000 events per year based on `magnitude` using `event_begin_time` to partition data by year.
  - Filters out events where `magnitude` is NULL.
  - Aggregates the total number of events per state from the selected top events.
  - Outputs the top 5 states with the highest number of storm events.
  - Converts state abbreviations to uppercase.

- **Why it's acceptable but less optimal:**
  - Achieves the same result as Option 0.
  - However, using `UNION ALL` across multiple tables can be less efficient compared to wildcard table selection with `_TABLE_SUFFIX`.
  - Relies on `event_begin_time` to extract the year, which may be less reliable if dates are incorrect or missing.

### **Option 2: `2result.sql`**

**SQL Script:**

```sql
SELECT state, COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Storm_Events
FROM (
  SELECT state
  FROM (
    SELECT state,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY _TABLE_SUFFIX ORDER BY COALESCE(damage_property, 0) DESC) AS rn
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_historic_severe_storms.storms_*`
    WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '1980' AND '1995' AND state IS NOT NULL
  )
  WHERE rn <= 1000
)
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY Number_of_Storm_Events DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Result (`2result.csv`):**

```
state,Number_of_Storm_Events
Te,1861
Mi,1764
Ne,1702
Al,1161
Ok,1076
```

**Analysis:**

- **What it does:**
  - Selects the top 1000 events per year (from 1980 to 1995) based on `damage_property` (property damage).
  - Uses `_TABLE_SUFFIX` to partition data by year.
  - Filters out events where `state` is NULL.
  - Aggregates the total number of events per state from the selected top events.
  - Outputs the top 5 states with the highest number of storm events.

- **Why it's incorrect:**
  - The task specifies selecting top events **based on `magnitude`**, not `damage_property`.
  - Using `damage_property` changes the criteria and the resulting states.
  - The result includes Alabama (Al) in the top 5, which differs from the expected output when using `magnitude`.

---

### **Conclusion:**

- **Option 0 (`0result.sql`)** is the correct SQL script because it directly addresses the task requirements:
  - It selects the top 1000 events **per year** based on **`magnitude`**.
  - It covers the years **1980 to 1995**.
  - It uses state abbreviations.
  - The method is efficient, utilizing `_TABLE_SUFFIX` for partitioning without the need for multiple `UNION ALL` statements.
  - The output aligns with the expected results.

- **Option 1** achieves the same result but is less efficient due to the extensive use of `UNION ALL` and potential reliability issues with using `event_begin_time`.

- **Option 2** does not meet the task requirements because it uses `damage_property` instead of `magnitude` to select the top events.

**Therefore, the correct SQL script is:**

```plaintext
0result.sql
