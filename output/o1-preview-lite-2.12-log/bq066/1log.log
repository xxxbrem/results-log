Columns and their potential usage:

1. **Census Data Tables** (`bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2015_5yr`, `county_2016_5yr`, `county_2017_5yr`):
   - `geo_id`: Geographic identifier (used to match with county FIPS codes).
   - `poverty`: Number of individuals living in poverty (used to calculate poverty rates).
   - `pop_determined_poverty_status`: Total population for whom poverty status is determined (used as denominator for poverty rate).

2. **Natality Data Table** (`bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality.county_natality_by_maternal_morbidity`):
   - `Year`: Year of the natality data (used to filter data for years 2016 to 2018).
   - `County_of_Residence_FIPS`: County FIPS code (used to join with `geo_id` from census data).
   - `Maternal_Morbidity_YN`: Indicator of reported maternal morbidity (0 = No morbidity, 1 = Morbidity reported).
   - `Births`: Number of births (used to calculate percentages).

Conditions that may be used:

- Filter natality data where `Maternal_Morbidity_YN` = 0 to select births without reported maternal morbidity.
- Use natality data for years 2016 to 2018.
- Use the 5-year census data from the previous year for each corresponding natality year:
  - For 2016 natality data, use 2015 census data (`county_2015_5yr`).
  - For 2017 natality data, use 2016 census data (`county_2016_5yr`).
  - For 2018 natality data, use 2017 census data (`county_2017_5yr`).
- Join census and natality data on county identifiers (`geo_id` and `County_of_Residence_FIPS`).

   WHERE `Year` = DATE('2016-01-01')
   LIMIT 100
   ```

2. **Retrieve the total number of births without maternal morbidity per county in 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `County_of_Residence_FIPS`, SUM(`Births`) AS births_without_morbidity
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality.county_natality_by_maternal_morbidity`

   ```sql
   SELECT
     `County_of_Residence_FIPS`,
     (SUM(CASE WHEN `Maternal_Morbidity_YN` = 0 THEN `Births` ELSE 0 END) / SUM(`Births`)) * 100 AS percentage_without_morbidity

   SELECT `geo_id`, `poverty`, `pop_determined_poverty_status`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2016_5yr`
   LIMIT 100
   ```

10. **List counties with the highest poverty rates from the 2015 census data:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `geo_id`, (`poverty` / `pop_determined_poverty_status`) * 100 AS poverty_rate
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2015_5yr`
    ORDER BY poverty_rate DESC
    LIMIT 100
    ```

These queries provide an understanding of the data required to assess the relationship between poverty rates and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity for the specified years.Query:

Task: Could you assess the relationship between the poverty rates from the previous year's census data and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity for the years 2016 to 2018? Use only data for births where no maternal morbidity was reported and for each year, use the 5-year census data from the year before to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Pearson_Correlation_Coefficient
2016,value1:float
2017,value2:float
2018,value3:float
```

For each year from 2016 to 2018, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the poverty rates from the previous year's 5-year census data and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity. The poverty rates were obtained from the census data of the preceding year, and the percentages were calculated using birth data where no maternal morbidity was reported. This analysis assesses the relationship between poverty levels and maternal health outcomes over the specified years..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Use only data for births where no maternal morbidity was reported and for each year, use the 5-year census data from the year before to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

```

For each year from 2016 to 2018, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the poverty rates from the previous year's 5-year census data and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity. The poverty rates were obtained from the census data of the preceding year, and the percentages were calculated using birth data where no maternal morbidity was reported. This analysis assesses the relationship between poverty levels and maternal health outcomes over the specified years. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
