After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the **correct SQL is `1result.sql`**.

**Reason:**

- **Poverty Rate Calculation:**
  - In `0result.sql`, the poverty rate is calculated using `(poverty / total_pop) * 100`. However, this may not be accurate because **`total_pop` includes individuals for whom poverty status is not determined**. The correct denominator should be **`pop_determined_poverty_status`**, which represents the population for whom poverty status is determined.
  - Both `1result.sql` and `2result.sql` correctly calculate the poverty rate using `(poverty / pop_determined_poverty_status) * 100`, ensuring that the rate reflects only the relevant population.

- **Consistency in Results:**
  - The results from `1result.sql` and `2result.sql` are identical, indicating that both queries are correctly structured and produce consistent Pearson correlation coefficients.
  - The slight differences in the Pearson correlation coefficients between `0result.sql` and the other two queries suggest potential inaccuracies in `0result.sql`.

- **Query Structure:**
  - `1result.sql` is more concise and straightforward, making it easier to understand and maintain. It efficiently joins the natality data with the appropriate poverty data for each year.
  - `2result.sql`, while correct, uses multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for each year, which makes the query longer and potentially less efficient.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the correct calculation of poverty rates, consistency in results, and efficient query structure, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query to use.
