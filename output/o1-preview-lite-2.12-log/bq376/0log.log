    SELECT s.station_id, s.name, b.neighborhood
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info` AS s
    LEFT JOIN `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries` AS b
    ON ST_WITHIN(ST_GEOGPOINT(s.lon, s.lat), b.neighborhood_geom)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

18. **Preview crime incidents with their assigned neighborhoods:**

    ```sql
    SELECT i.pdid, i.category, b.neighborhood
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents` AS i
    LEFT JOIN `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries` AS b
    ON ST_WITHIN(ST_GEOGPOINT(i.longitude, i.latitude), b.neighborhood_geom)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

These queries help in understanding the data and preparing to solve the task by:

- Identifying relevant data points and their locations.
- Associating bike share stations and crime incidents with neighborhoods based on geographical location.
- Counting occurrences to determine which neighborhoods meet the criteria.
- Ensuring data completeness by checking for null values in coordinates.
- Verifying that the spatial joins are correctly assigning data points to neighborhoods.Query:
SELECT neighborhood

Task: For each neighborhood in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, provide the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To find the neighborhoods in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, we need to match the locations of bike share stations and crime incidents to their respective neighborhoods. We use the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of bike share stations from the `bikeshare_station_info` table and crime incidents from the `sfpd_incidents` table. By spatially joining these points to the neighborhood boundaries in the `boundaries` table, we can determine which neighborhood each point belongs to. Then, we count the number of bike share stations and crime incidents in each neighborhood, only including neighborhoods that have at least one of each.

The resulting table provides the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood.

```csv
Neighborhood_Name,Bike_Share_Stations_Count,Crime_Incidents_Count
neighborhood1:str,bike_station_count1:int,crime_incident_count1:int
neighborhood2:str,bike_station_count2:int,crime_incident_count2:int
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'san_francisco_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'san_francisco_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_regions', 'bikeshare_station_info', 'bikeshare_station_status', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'san_francisco_film_locations': ['film_locations'], 'san_francisco_neighborhoods': ['boundaries'], 'san_francisco_sffd_service_calls': ['sffd_service_calls'], 'san_francisco_sfpd_incidents': ['sfpd_incidents'], 'san_francisco_transit_muni': ['calendar', 'stop_monitoring', 'shapes', 'stops', 'trips', 'vehicle_monitoring', 'fares', 'stop_times', 'routes'], 'san_francisco_trees': ['street_trees']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 13:50:56 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each neighborhood in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, provide the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To find the neighborhoods in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, we need to match the locations of bike share stations and crime incidents to their respective neighborhoods. We use the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of bike share stations from the `bikeshare_station_info` table and crime incidents from the `sfpd_incidents` table. By spatially joining these points to the neighborhood boundaries in the `boundaries` table, we can determine which neighborhood each point belongs to. Then, we count the number of bike share stations and crime incidents in each neighborhood, only including neighborhoods that have at least one of each.

The resulting table provides the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood.

```csv
Neighborhood_Name,Bike_Share_Stations_Count,Crime_Incidents_Count
neighborhood1:str,bike_station_count1:int,crime_incident_count1:int
neighborhood2:str,bike_station_count2:int,crime_incident_count2:int
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
