Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

To accomplish the task, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns:

1. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries`
   - **neighborhood**: Name of the neighborhood.
     - *Potential Usage:* Identify and group data by neighborhood.
   - **neighborhood_geom**: GEOGRAPHY polygon representing the neighborhood boundaries.
     - *Potential Usage:* Perform spatial operations to determine if a point (like a bike station or crime incident) is within a neighborhood.

2. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`
   - **station_id**: Unique identifier of a bike share station.
   - **name**: Public name of the bike share station.
   - **lat**: Latitude of the station.
   - **lon**: Longitude of the station.
     - *Potential Usage:* Determine the location of bike share stations to assign them to neighborhoods.
   - **station_geom**: GEOGRAPHY point representing the station's location.
     - *Potential Usage:* Spatial operations with neighborhood boundaries.

3. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents`
   - **unique_key**: Unique incident number.
   - **category**: Category of the crime incident.
   - **latitude**: Latitude of the crime incident location.
   - **longitude**: Longitude of the crime incident location.
     - *Potential Usage:* Determine the location of crime incidents to assign them to neighborhoods.
   - **timestamp**: Date and time of the incident.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- **Spatial Joins:** Use geographic coordinates to determine if bike share stations and crime incidents are located within a neighborhood.
- **Data Cleaning:** Filter out records where latitude or longitude is null to ensure accurate spatial analysis.
- **Grouping:** Group data by neighborhood to count bike share stations and crime incidents.

Task: For each neighborhood in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, provide the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To find the neighborhoods in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, we need to match the locations of bike share stations and crime incidents to their respective neighborhoods. We use the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of bike share stations from the `bikeshare_station_info` table and crime incidents from the `sfpd_incidents` table. By spatially joining these points to the neighborhood boundaries in the `boundaries` table, we can determine which neighborhood each point belongs to. Then, we count the number of bike share stations and crime incidents in each neighborhood, only including neighborhoods that have at least one of each.

The resulting table provides the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood.

```csv
Neighborhood_Name,Bike_Share_Stations_Count,Crime_Incidents_Count
neighborhood1:str,bike_station_count1:int,crime_incident_count1:int
neighborhood2:str,bike_station_count2:int,crime_incident_count2:int
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'san_francisco_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'san_francisco_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_regions', 'bikeshare_station_info', 'bikeshare_station_status', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'san_francisco_film_locations': ['film_locations'], 'san_francisco_neighborhoods': ['boundaries'], 'san_francisco_sffd_service_calls': ['sffd_service_calls'], 'san_francisco_sfpd_incidents': ['sfpd_incidents'], 'san_francisco_transit_muni': ['calendar', 'stop_monitoring', 'shapes', 'stops', 'trips', 'vehicle_monitoring', 'fares', 'stop_times', 'routes'], 'san_francisco_trees': ['street_trees']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 13:52:19 - root - INFO - To find the neighborhoods in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, we use spatial joins to match bike share stations and crime incidents to neighborhoods based on their geographic coordinates. We then count the number of bike share stations and crime incidents in each neighborhood.

The following SQL query performs these steps:

```sql

2025-02-11 13:52:22 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each neighborhood in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, provide the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To find the neighborhoods in San Francisco where at least one bike share station and at least one crime incident are located, we need to match the locations of bike share stations and crime incidents to their respective neighborhoods. We use the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of bike share stations from the `bikeshare_station_info` table and crime incidents from the `sfpd_incidents` table. By spatially joining these points to the neighborhood boundaries in the `boundaries` table, we can determine which neighborhood each point belongs to. Then, we count the number of bike share stations and crime incidents in each neighborhood, only including neighborhoods that have at least one of each.

The resulting table provides the neighborhood name along with the total count of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents in that neighborhood.

```csv
Neighborhood_Name,Bike_Share_Stations_Count,Crime_Incidents_Count
neighborhood1:str,bike_station_count1:int,crime_incident_count1:int
neighborhood2:str,bike_station_count2:int,crime_incident_count2:int
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
