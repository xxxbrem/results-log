After comparing the two SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct and more efficient query to accomplish the task. Here's why:

1. **Use of Existing Geometry Data:**
   - In `2result.sql`, the query utilizes the `station_geom` column from the `bikeshare_station_info` table directly. This column already contains the GEOGRAPHY point data of each bike station, eliminating the need to create new geography points using latitude and longitude.
   - In contrast, `1result.sql` constructs geography points on-the-fly using `ST_GEOGPOINT(bs.lon, bs.lat)`, which is unnecessary if the `station_geom` is available.

2. **Conciseness and Clarity:**
   - `2result.sql` is more concise, making it easier to read and understand. It avoids redundant calculations and potential sources of error by directly using existing geometry data.
   - The query structure in `2result.sql` aligns closely with standard practices when working with spatial data in BigQuery.

3. **Proper Handling of Null Values:**
   - Both queries include checks for null latitude and longitude values for crime incidents, ensuring that only valid geographic data is processed.
   - However, since `2result.sql` uses `station_geom`, which is likely to be non-null if the station exists, it simplifies the handling of bike station data.

4. **Identical Results:**
   - The results produced by both queries (`1result.csv` and `2result.csv`) are identical, indicating that both are functionally correct.
   - Given that `2result.sql` achieves the same outcome more efficiently, it is the preferable choice.

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query to use for the task.
