- **Title:** Correlations between Mitelman DB and TCGA datasets
- **Author:** Boris Aguilar
- **Created:** 04-23-2022
- **Purpose:** Compare Mitelman DB and TCGA datasets
- **URL:**

This notebook demonstrates how to compute correlations between Mitelman DB and TCGa datasets. The Mitelman DB is hosted by ISB-CGC and can be accessed at this URL: https://mitelmandatabase.isb-cgc.org/. This notebook replicates some of the analyses from the paper by Denomy et al: https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/79/20/5181. Note, however that results are not replicated exactly as some of the underlying data has changed since publication.



# Calculate Frequency of Gains and Losses of breast cancer samples in Mitelman DB

We can use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of samples, e.g., across all breast cancer samples.

In [ ]:

```
# Set parameters for this query
cancer_type = 'BRCA' # Cancer type for TCGA
bq_project = 'mitelman-db'  # project name of Mitelman-DB BigQuery table
bq_dataset = 'prod' # Name of the dataset containing Mitelman-DB BigQuery tables
morphology = '3111' # Breast cancer
topology = '0401' # Adenocarcinoma
```

First, we identify all Mitelman DB cases related to the morphology and topology of interest.

This query was copied from the new feature of the MitelmanDB interface: View Overall Gain/Loss in chromosome.

```
case_query = """
# sql here
"""

# Run the query and put results in a data frame
mysql = ( "WITH " + case_query + """
SELECT *
FROM mitelman
""" )
final_mitelman = client.query(mysql).result().to_dataframe()
```

# Calculate Frequency of TCGA Copy Number Gains and Losses in breast cancer samples.

As a comparison to Mitelman DB gain and loss frequency, we can calculate similar frequencies using TCGA Copy Number data.

```
cnv_query = """
# sql here
"""

# Execute query and put results into a data frame
mysql = ( "WITH " + cnv_query + """
SELECT *
FROM tcga
""" )
cnv = client.query(mysql).result().to_dataframe()
```

# Compute Pearson correlation and p-values

The following query compute Pearson correlation for each chromosome comparing Mitelman DB frequencies with those computed from TCGA. Moreover, for each correlation values, its respective p-values is computed by using the BigQuery function `isb-cgc-bq.functions.corr_pvalue_current`. The minimum number of cases for correlation computation was 5.

```
mysql = ( "WITH " + case_query + "," + cnv_query + """
# sql here
""")
```

The non a value results (NaN) represent cases in which the computed frequencies of TCGA are zero for all the cytobands.

# Conclusion

This notebook demonstrated usage of the Mitelman BigQuery dataset, which includes CytoConverter chromosomal coordinate data, in combination with TCGA BigQuery tables for a comparative analysis. Specifically, the notebook computes correlation (Pearson) coefficients between gains and losses obtained with Mitelam DB and TCGA datasets.

We observed that the mayority (but not all) of the significan correlation shown in Denomy et al. paper (Table 1, https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0585) are also significan in this analysis.

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Could you compute, by chromosome, the Pearson correlation between the frequency of copy number aberrations (including amplifications, gains, losses, and deletions) from the Mitelman database for cases with morph = 3111 and topo = 0401, and those computed from TCGA data, returning correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values for each aberration type, ensuring only results with at least five matching records are shown.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Here is the CSV format for the Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values between the frequency of copy number aberrations from the Mitelman database (for cases with `morph = 3111` and `topo = 0401`) and those computed from TCGA data, by chromosome and aberration type. Only results with at least five matching records are shown.

```csv
Chromosome,Aberration_Type,Correlation_Coefficient,P-value
chr1,Amplification,r_value1,p_value1
chr1,Gain,r_value2,p_value2
chr1,Loss,r_value3,p_value3
chr1,Deletion,r_value4,p_value4
chr2,Amplification,r_value5,p_value5
chr2,Gain,r_value6,p_value6
chr2,Loss,r_value7,p_value7
chr2,Deletion,r_value8,p_value8
...
chrX,Amplification,r_valueN,p_valueN
chrX,Gain,r_valueN,p_valueN
chrX,Loss,r_valueN,p_valueN
chrX,Deletion,r_valueN,p_valueN
```

**Explanation:**

- **Chromosome**: The chromosome number (e.g., chr1 to chr22, chrX, chrY).
- **Aberration_Type**: Type of copy number aberration (`Amplification`, `Gain`, `Loss`, `Deletion`).
- **Correlation_Coefficient**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the frequencies from the Mitelman database and TCGA data for the specified chromosome and aberration type.
- **P-value**: The p-value corresponding to the correlation coefficient, indicating statistical significance.

Please replace `r_valueX` and `p_valueX` with the actual computed values from your analysis..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'mitelman-db': {'prod': ['AuthorReference', 'CytoConvertedLog', 'KaryBreak', 'CytoConverted', 'KaryBit', 'Koder', 'RecurrentNumData', 'CytoBands_hg38', 'KaryClone', 'Cytogen', 'MolClinGene', 'RecurrentData', 'KaryAbnorm', 'MolClinBreak', 'Reference', 'MolClinAbnorm', 'CytogenInv', 'MolBiolClinAssoc', 'CytogenInvValid']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

**Explanation:**

The error in your previous query was due to an incorrect table name. The table `isb-cgc.TCGA_hg38_data_v0.CopyNumberSegment_Masked` does not exist because it is missing underscores in the table name.

I have corrected the table name to `isb-cgc.TCGA_hg38_data_v0.CopyNumber_Segment_Masked`, which is the correct table for TCGA copy number segments in hg38 coordinates.

Additionally, I've ensured that the sample barcodes are correctly matched by using the `SampleBarcode` field from the `Samples` table in the `tcga_brca_samples` CTE and joining it with the `SampleBarcode` field in the `CopyNumber_Segment_Masked` table.

This query calculates the Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values between the frequencies of copy number aberrations from the Mitelman database (for cases with `Morph = '3111'` and `Topo = '0401'`) and those computed from TCGA BRCA data, by chromosome and aberration type. Only results with at least five matching records are shown.

2025-02-11 06:18:38 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you compute, by chromosome, the Pearson correlation between the frequency of copy number aberrations (including amplifications, gains, losses, and deletions) from the Mitelman database for cases with morph = 3111 and topo = 0401, and those computed from TCGA data, returning correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values for each aberration type, ensuring only results with at least five matching records are shown., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Here is the CSV format for the Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values between the frequency of copy number aberrations from the Mitelman database (for cases with `morph = 3111` and `topo = 0401`) and those computed from TCGA data, by chromosome and aberration type. Only results with at least five matching records are shown.

```csv
Chromosome,Aberration_Type,Correlation_Coefficient,P-value
chr1,Amplification,r_value1,p_value1
chr1,Gain,r_value2,p_value2
chr1,Loss,r_value3,p_value3
chr1,Deletion,r_value4,p_value4
chr2,Amplification,r_value5,p_value5
chr2,Gain,r_value6,p_value6
chr2,Loss,r_value7,p_value7

chrX,Gain,r_valueN,p_valueN
chrX,Loss,r_valueN,p_valueN
chrX,Deletion,r_valueN,p_valueN
```

**Explanation:**

- **Chromosome**: The chromosome number (e.g., chr1 to chr22, chrX, chrY).
- **Aberration_Type**: Type of copy number aberration (`Amplification`, `Gain`, `Loss`, `Deletion`).
- **Correlation_Coefficient**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the frequencies from the Mitelman database and TCGA data for the specified chromosome and aberration type.
- **P-value**: The p-value corresponding to the correlation coefficient, indicating statistical significance.

Please replace `r_valueX` and `p_valueX` with the actual computed values from your analysis. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
