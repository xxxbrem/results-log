2025-02-11 06:06:06 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error occurs because BigQuery does not allow references to aliases defined in the `SELECT` list within the `GROUP BY` clause. In your query, you're attempting to group by `total_cases.Total_Cases`, which is an alias from the `SELECT` list derived from a subquery.

Since `total_cases.Total_Cases` is a constant value for all rows in your result (the total number of cases with `Morph = '3111'` and `Topo = '0401'`), you do not need to include it in the `GROUP BY` clause.

**To fix the error, remove `total_cases.Total_Cases` from the `GROUP BY` clause.**

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  cc.Chr AS Chromosome,
  cc.Type AS Aberration_Type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) AS Cases_With_Aberration,
  total_cases.Total_Cases,
  (COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) / total_cases.Total_Cases) AS Frequency
FROM `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
  ON cc.RefNo = cg.RefNo AND cc.CaseNo = cg.CaseNo
CROSS JOIN (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(RefNo AS STRING), '-', CaseNo)) AS Total_Cases
  FROM `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen`
  WHERE Morph = '3111' AND Topo = '0401'
) AS total_cases
WHERE cg.Morph = '3111' AND cg.Topo = '0401'
  AND cc.Type IN ('amp', 'gain', 'loss', 'del')
GROUP BY cc.Chr, cc.Type
HAVING Cases_With_Aberration >= 5
ORDER BY Chromosome, Aberration_Type
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Removed `total_cases.Total_Cases` from the `GROUP BY` clause**: Since `total_cases.Total_Cases` is a constant for all rows, it does not need to be included in the `GROUP BY` clause.
  
- **Adjusted the `GROUP BY` clause**: Now, the `GROUP BY` clause includes only `cc.Chr` and `cc.Type`, which are the groupings you need for your aggregation.

**Additional Notes:**

- BigQuery allows you to use columns in the `SELECT` clause that are not part of the `GROUP BY` clause as long as they are inside aggregate functions or are constants.
  
- Since `total_cases.Total_Cases` is derived from a subquery and is constant across all rows, it's permissible to include it in the `SELECT` clause without grouping by it.

- This corrected query should run without errors and produce the desired output.

**Proceeding with Your Task:**

Now that the query is corrected, you can execute it to obtain the frequencies of copy number aberrations by chromosome and aberration type from the Mitelman database.

To complete your task of computing the Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values between the frequencies from the Mitelman database and those computed from TCGA data:

1. **Run the corrected query** to obtain the frequency data from the Mitelman database.

2. **Retrieve the corresponding frequency data from the TCGA dataset** for the same chromosomes and aberration types.

3. **Combine the datasets** on chromosome and aberration type.

4. **Compute the Pearson correlation coefficients and p-values** for each aberration type across chromosomes, ensuring you only include cases with at least five matching records.

5. **Format your results in the requested CSV format:**

   ```csv
   Chromosome,Aberration_Type,Correlation_Coefficient,P-value
   chr1,Amplification,0.85,0.002
   chr1,Gain,0.78,0.01
   ...
   ```
   
   Replace the correlation values and p-values with your computed results.

**Remember to ensure that:**

- You have the same chromosomes and aberration types in both datasets.

- The frequencies are calculated consistently between the two datasets (e.g., percentage of cases with the aberration).

- You adhere to any data privacy and sharing policies applicable to the datasets you are using.
2025-02-11 06:06:34 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com//openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-02-11 06:06:34 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error you're encountering is because BigQuery requires that all expressions in the `SELECT` list that are not aggregated (i.e., not inside an aggregate function like `COUNT`, `MAX`, etc.) must be included in the `GROUP BY` clause.

In your query, `total_cases.Total_Cases` is being selected but is neither aggregated nor included in the `GROUP BY` clause, which causes the error:

```
SELECT list expression references total_cases.Total_Cases which is neither grouped nor aggregated
```

Even though `total_cases.Total_Cases` is a constant value (since it's derived from a subquery returning a single value), BigQuery's SQL dialect requires it to be either part of the `GROUP BY` clause or wrapped in an aggregate function.

**Solution Options:**

1. **Option 1: Include `total_cases.Total_Cases` in the `GROUP BY` clause.**

   Since `total_cases.Total_Cases` is constant, adding it to the `GROUP BY` clause doesn't affect the grouping.

   ```sql
   GROUP BY cc.Chr, cc.Type, total_cases.Total_Cases
   ```

2. **Option 2: Wrap `total_cases.Total_Cases` in an aggregate function like `MAX()` or `MIN()`.**

   Since it's the same value for all rows, using an aggregate function will return that constant value.

   ```sql
   SELECT
     cc.Chr AS Chromosome,
     cc.Type AS Aberration_Type,
     COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) AS Cases_With_Aberration,
     MAX(total_cases.Total_Cases) AS Total_Cases,
     (COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) / MAX(total_cases.Total_Cases)) AS Frequency
   ```

**Corrected Query Using Option 2:**

Here is the corrected query with `total_cases.Total_Cases` wrapped in `MAX()`:

```sql
SELECT
  cc.Chr AS Chromosome,
  cc.Type AS Aberration_Type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) AS Cases_With_Aberration,
  MAX(total_cases.Total_Cases) AS Total_Cases,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) / MAX(total_cases.Total_Cases) AS Frequency
FROM `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
  ON cc.RefNo = cg.RefNo AND cc.CaseNo = cg.CaseNo
CROSS JOIN (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(RefNo AS STRING), '-', CaseNo)) AS Total_Cases
  FROM `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen`
  WHERE Morph = '3111' AND Topo = '0401'
) AS total_cases
WHERE cg.Morph = '3111' AND cg.Topo = '0401'
  AND cc.Type IN ('amp', 'gain', 'loss', 'del')
GROUP BY cc.Chr, cc.Type
HAVING Cases_With_Aberration >= 5
ORDER BY Chromosome, Aberration_Type
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Wrapped `total_cases.Total_Cases` in `MAX()`:**

  ```sql
  MAX(total_cases.Total_Cases) AS Total_Cases
  ```

  By using `MAX()`, we satisfy BigQuery's requirement that all selected fields are either aggregated or present in the `GROUP BY` clause.

- **Adjusted the calculation of `Frequency`:**

  ```sql
  COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) / MAX(total_cases.Total_Cases) AS Frequency
  ```

  This ensures that both the numerator and the denominator are compatible in terms of aggregation.

**Alternatively, Using Option 1 (Add to GROUP BY):**

If you prefer to add `total_cases.Total_Cases` to the `GROUP BY` clause:

```sql
SELECT
  cc.Chr AS Chromosome,
  cc.Type AS Aberration_Type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) AS Cases_With_Aberration,
  total_cases.Total_Cases,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) / total_cases.Total_Cases AS Frequency
FROM `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
  ON cc.RefNo = cg.RefNo AND cc.CaseNo = cg.CaseNo
CROSS JOIN (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(RefNo AS STRING), '-', CaseNo)) AS Total_Cases
  FROM `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen`
  WHERE Morph = '3111' AND Topo = '0401'
) AS total_cases
WHERE cg.Morph = '3111' AND cg.Topo = '0401'
  AND cc.Type IN ('amp', 'gain', 'loss', 'del')
GROUP BY cc.Chr, cc.Type, total_cases.Total_Cases
HAVING Cases_With_Aberration >= 5
ORDER BY Chromosome, Aberration_Type
LIMIT 100;
```

**Proceeding with the Task:**

Now that the query is corrected, you can:

1. **Execute the corrected query** to obtain the frequency of aberrations per chromosome and type from the Mitelman database.

2. **Retrieve corresponding frequency data from the TCGA dataset**, ensuring that frequencies are computed similarly.

3. **Join the Mitelman and TCGA datasets** on `Chromosome` and `Aberration_Type` to have matching records.

4. For each `Aberration_Type` (Amplification, Gain, Loss, Deletion):

   - **Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value** across chromosomes between the frequencies from the Mitelman database and the TCGA data.
   
   - **Include only chromosomes with at least five matching records**, as per your requirement.

5. **Prepare the final CSV output** with the correlation coefficients and p-values.

**Final CSV Format:**

```csv
Chromosome,Aberration_Type,Correlation_Coefficient,P-value
chr1,Amplification,correlation_value,p_value
chr1,Gain,correlation_value,p_value
...
chrX,Loss,correlation_value,p_value
chrX,Deletion,correlation_value,p_value
```

**Note:**

- Replace `correlation_value` and `p_value` with your actual computed values.
- Ensure that for each chromosome and aberration type, you have at least five matching records before including it in the correlation analysis.
- You may need additional data processing steps (e.g., data normalization, handling missing values) before computing the correlations.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Data Consistency:** Ensure that the aberration types are categorized consistently between the Mitelman and TCGA datasets. For example, if TCGA uses 'Amplification' and 'Deletion', make sure to map Mitelman's 'gain' and 'loss' accordingly.

- **Statistical Significance:** Interpret the p-values cautiously, considering multiple testing corrections if necessary.

- **Data Privacy and Compliance:** Ensure compliance with any data usage policies associated with the datasets.
2025-02-11 06:07:20 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com//openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-02-11 06:07:20 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error you're encountering:

```
400 Syntax error: Unexpected keyword GROUP at [1:1]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unexpected keyword GROUP at [1:1]
```

indicates that BigQuery is not recognizing the start of your query correctly. The error suggests that at line 1, position 1 (i.e., the very beginning of your query), it unexpectedly encountered the keyword `GROUP`.

This usually happens if there's an issue with the way the query is formatted or if there are hidden or non-printable characters before the `SELECT` statement.

**Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Check for Hidden Characters:**
   
   - Ensure that there are no hidden characters, such as Byte Order Marks (BOM) or invisible control characters, at the very beginning of your query.
   - Sometimes, when copying and pasting code from certain editors or documents, these hidden characters can be included unintentionally.
   
2. **Re-copy and Paste the Query:**

   - Copy the query from a plain text editor to ensure no hidden characters are included.
   - Alternatively, delete any spaces or lines before the `SELECT` statement in your query editor.

3. **Use Raw Text Input:**

   - In your query editor, switch to a plain text mode if possible.
   - Remove any formatting that might introduce unexpected characters.

4. **Double-Check the Query Syntax:**

   - Ensure that the query starts with the `SELECT` keyword.
   - Verify that all clauses (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`) are correctly placed and properly formatted.

5. **Updated Query:**

   Based on previous corrections, here's the updated query with the necessary adjustments:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     cc.Chr AS Chromosome,
     cc.Type AS Aberration_Type,
     COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) AS Cases_With_Aberration,
     MAX(total_cases.Total_Cases) AS Total_Cases,
     COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) / MAX(total_cases.Total_Cases) AS Frequency
   FROM `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
   JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
     ON cc.RefNo = cg.RefNo AND cc.CaseNo = cg.CaseNo
   CROSS JOIN (
     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(RefNo AS STRING), '-', CaseNo)) AS Total_Cases
     FROM `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen`
     WHERE Morph = '3111' AND Topo = '0401'
   ) AS total_cases
   WHERE cg.Morph = '3111' AND cg.Topo = '0401'
     AND cc.Type IN ('amp', 'gain', 'loss', 'del')
   GROUP BY cc.Chr, cc.Type
   HAVING Cases_With_Aberration >= 5
   ORDER BY Chromosome, Aberration_Type
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Key Changes:**

   - **Removed Unintended Characters:** Ensured there are no hidden characters before the `SELECT` keyword.
   - **Wrapped `Total_Cases` in `MAX()`:** As previously corrected, this handles BigQuery's requirement for aggregation in `SELECT` when not included in `GROUP BY`.
   
   - **Adjusted the HAVING Clause:** Using the aggregate function instead of the alias to avoid potential issues (though BigQuery does allow aliases in `HAVING`).

6. **Test the Query:**

   - Before running the full query, test it with a smaller dataset or remove the `HAVING` clause temporarily to see if it executes.
   - If it runs without the `HAVING` clause, you can then add it back to filter out results with fewer than five cases.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Avoid Using Aliases in HAVING Clause:**

  While BigQuery allows the use of aliases in the `HAVING` clause, sometimes it can lead to unexpected errors. To be safe, replace `Cases_With_Aberration` in the `HAVING` clause with the actual expression:

  ```sql
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) >= 5
  ```

- **Final Adjusted Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT
    cc.Chr AS Chromosome,
    cc.Type AS Aberration_Type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) AS Cases_With_Aberration,
    MAX(total_cases.Total_Cases) AS Total_Cases,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) / MAX(total_cases.Total_Cases) AS Frequency
  FROM `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` cc
  JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` cg
    ON cc.RefNo = cg.RefNo AND cc.CaseNo = cg.CaseNo
  CROSS JOIN (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(RefNo AS STRING), '-', CaseNo)) AS Total_Cases
    FROM `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen`
    WHERE Morph = '3111' AND Topo = '0401'
  ) AS total_cases
  WHERE cg.Morph = '3111' AND cg.Topo = '0401'
    AND cc.Type IN ('amp', 'gain', 'loss', 'del')
  GROUP BY cc.Chr, cc.Type
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(CAST(cc.RefNo AS STRING), '-', cc.CaseNo)) >= 5
  ORDER BY Chromosome, Aberration_Type
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

**Action Items:**

- **Copy the Updated Query:**

  Ensure you copy the updated query directly from this response to avoid any hidden characters.

- **Run the Query in BigQuery:**

  Paste the query into your BigQuery editor and execute it.

- **Proceed with the Analysis:**

  After successfully running the query, you should obtain the frequencies of copy number aberrations from the Mitelman database for cases with `Morph = '3111'` and `Topo = '0401'`.

- **Compute the Pearson Correlation:**

  - Use this data along with the corresponding frequency data from the TCGA dataset.
  - Make sure the frequencies are matched by chromosome and aberration type.
  - Compute the Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values for each aberration type across chromosomes, including only those with at least five matching records.

**Final CSV Format:**

```csv
Chromosome,Aberration_Type,Correlation_Coefficient,P-value
chr1,Amplification,0.85,0.002
chr1,Gain,0.78,0.01
...
```

- Replace the placeholder values with your actual computed results.

**Summary:**

The error you encountered was likely due to unintended hidden characters before the `SELECT` statement. By ensuring the query starts precisely at the `SELECT` keyword without any hidden or non-printable characters and properly addressing any aggregation issues in the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` clauses, the query should run successfully.

Feel free to let me know if you encounter any further issues or if you need additional assistance with the analysis.

# Correlations between Mitelman and TCGA datasets

Check out other notebooks at our [Community Notebooks Repository](https://github.com/isb-cgc/Community-Notebooks)!

- **Title:** Correlations between Mitelman DB and TCGA datasets
- **Author:** Boris Aguilar
- **Created:** 04-23-2022
- **Purpose:** Compare Mitelman DB and TCGA datasets
- **URL:**

This notebook demonstrates how to compute correlations between Mitelman DB and TCGa datasets. The Mitelman DB is hosted by ISB-CGC and can be accessed at this URL: https://mitelmandatabase.isb-cgc.org/. This notebook replicates some of the analyses from the paper by Denomy et al: https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/79/20/5181. Note, however that results are not replicated exactly as some of the underlying data has changed since publication.



# Calculate Frequency of Gains and Losses of breast cancer samples in Mitelman DB

We can use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of samples, e.g., across all breast cancer samples.

In [ ]:

```
# Set parameters for this query
cancer_type = 'BRCA' # Cancer type for TCGA
bq_project = 'mitelman-db'  # project name of Mitelman-DB BigQuery table
bq_dataset = 'prod' # Name of the dataset containing Mitelman-DB BigQuery tables
morphology = '3111' # Breast cancer
topology = '0401' # Adenocarcinoma
```

First, we identify all Mitelman DB cases related to the morphology and topology of interest.

This query was copied from the new feature of the MitelmanDB interface: View Overall Gain/Loss in chromosome.

```
case_query = """
# sql here
"""

# Run the query and put results in a data frame
mysql = ( "WITH " + case_query + """
SELECT *
FROM mitelman
""" )
final_mitelman = client.query(mysql).result().to_dataframe()
```

# Calculate Frequency of TCGA Copy Number Gains and Losses in breast cancer samples.

As a comparison to Mitelman DB gain and loss frequency, we can calculate similar frequencies using TCGA Copy Number data.

```
cnv_query = """
# sql here
"""

# Execute query and put results into a data frame
mysql = ( "WITH " + cnv_query + """
SELECT *
FROM tcga
""" )

# Compute Pearson correlation and p-values

The following query compute Pearson correlation for each chromosome comparing Mitelman DB frequencies with those computed from TCGA. Moreover, for each correlation values, its respective p-values is computed by using the BigQuery function `isb-cgc-bq.functions.corr_pvalue_current`. The minimum number of cases for correlation computation was 5.

```
mysql = ( "WITH " + case_query + "," + cnv_query + """
# sql here
""")
```

The non a value results (NaN) represent cases in which the computed frequencies of TCGA are zero for all the cytobands.

# Conclusion

This notebook demonstrated usage of the Mitelman BigQuery dataset, which includes CytoConverter chromosomal coordinate data, in combination with TCGA BigQuery tables for a comparative analysis. Specifically, the notebook computes correlation (Pearson) coefficients between gains and losses obtained with Mitelam DB and TCGA datasets.

We observed that the mayority (but not all) of the significan correlation shown in Denomy et al. paper (Table 1, https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0585) are also significan in this analysis.

Task: Could you compute, by chromosome, the Pearson correlation between the frequency of copy number aberrations (including amplifications, gains, losses, and deletions) from the Mitelman database for cases with morph = 3111 and topo = 0401, and those computed from TCGA data, returning correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values for each aberration type, ensuring only results with at least five matching records are shown.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Here is the CSV format for the Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values between the frequency of copy number aberrations from the Mitelman database (for cases with `morph = 3111` and `topo = 0401`) and those computed from TCGA data, by chromosome and aberration type. Only results with at least five matching records are shown.

```csv
Chromosome,Aberration_Type,Correlation_Coefficient,P-value
chr1,Amplification,r_value1,p_value1
chr1,Gain,r_value2,p_value2
chr1,Loss,r_value3,p_value3
chr1,Deletion,r_value4,p_value4
chr2,Amplification,r_value5,p_value5
chr2,Gain,r_value6,p_value6
chr2,Loss,r_value7,p_value7
chr2,Deletion,r_value8,p_value8
...
chrX,Amplification,r_valueN,p_valueN
chrX,Gain,r_valueN,p_valueN
chrX,Loss,r_valueN,p_valueN
chrX,Deletion,r_valueN,p_valueN
```

**Explanation:**

- **Chromosome**: The chromosome number (e.g., chr1 to chr22, chrX, chrY).
- **Aberration_Type**: Type of copy number aberration (`Amplification`, `Gain`, `Loss`, `Deletion`).
- **Correlation_Coefficient**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the frequencies from the Mitelman database and TCGA data for the specified chromosome and aberration type.
- **P-value**: The p-value corresponding to the correlation coefficient, indicating statistical significance.

Please replace `r_valueX` and `p_valueX` with the actual computed values from your analysis..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'mitelman-db': {'prod': ['AuthorReference', 'CytoConvertedLog', 'KaryBreak', 'CytoConverted', 'KaryBit', 'Koder', 'RecurrentNumData', 'CytoBands_hg38', 'KaryClone', 'Cytogen', 'MolClinGene', 'RecurrentData', 'KaryAbnorm', 'MolClinBreak', 'Reference', 'MolClinAbnorm', 'CytogenInv', 'MolBiolClinAssoc', 'CytogenInvValid']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

This query calculates the frequency of copy number aberrations (gains and losses) by chromosome and cytoband from the Mitelman database for cases with `Morph = '3111'` and `Topo = '0401'` (breast adenocarcinoma).

To compute the Pearson correlation between the frequencies from the Mitelman database and those from TCGA data, you will need to have access to a TCGA copy number data table that you can query. Once you have access to such a table, you can join the Mitelman frequencies with the TCGA frequencies and perform the correlation analysis.

If you have the TCGA data available in BigQuery, you can extend this query by adding the TCGA data and computing the correlation coefficients accordingly.

**Explanation:**

The error occurred because you cannot reference an alias from the `SELECT` clause in the `GROUP BY` clause directly. Specifically, `total_cases.total_cases` in the `GROUP BY` clause causes the issue because it's an alias in the `SELECT` list.

To fix the problem, remove `total_cases.total_cases` from the `GROUP BY` clause in the `mitelman_frequencies` CTE. Since `total_cases.total_cases` is a constant value (it doesn't change per group), it does not need to be included in the `GROUP BY` clause.

**Changes Made:**

- Removed `total_cases.total_cases` from the `GROUP BY` clause in the `mitelman_frequencies` CTE.

**Note:**

This query calculates the frequencies of copy number aberrations (gains and losses) per chromosome and cytoband from the Mitelman database for cases with `Morph = '3111'` and `Topo = '0401'` (breast adenocarcinoma).

```

**Explanation:**

The error occurred because `total_cases.total_cases` in the `SELECT` clause is neither grouped nor aggregated when using `GROUP BY`. Since `total_cases.total_cases` is a constant value (the total number of cases), we need to aggregate it in the `SELECT` clause when grouping.

To fix the error, we wrap `total_cases.total_cases` with an aggregate function like `MAX()` in the `SELECT` clause. This is acceptable because the value is the same for all rows, so taking the maximum does not change its value.

**Changes Made:**

- Replaced `total_cases.total_cases` in the `SELECT` clause with `MAX(total_cases.total_cases)`.
- Replaced `total_cases.total_cases` in the calculation of `frequency` with `MAX(total_cases.total_cases)`.

By making these changes, the query now conforms to SQL requirements for aggregation when using `GROUP BY`.

**Note:**

This query calculates the frequencies of copy number aberrations (gains and losses) per chromosome and cytoband from the Mitelman database for cases with `Morph = '3111'` and `Topo = '0401'` (breast adenocarcinoma).

If you wish to compute the Pearson correlation with TCGA data, ensure you have access to a TCGA copy number data table. Once you have access to such a table, you can extend this query to include the TCGA frequencies and perform the correlation analysis accordingly.

2025-02-11 06:17:33 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you compute, by chromosome, the Pearson correlation between the frequency of copy number aberrations (including amplifications, gains, losses, and deletions) from the Mitelman database for cases with morph = 3111 and topo = 0401, and those computed from TCGA data, returning correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values for each aberration type, ensuring only results with at least five matching records are shown., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Here is the CSV format for the Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values between the frequency of copy number aberrations from the Mitelman database (for cases with `morph = 3111` and `topo = 0401`) and those computed from TCGA data, by chromosome and aberration type. Only results with at least five matching records are shown.

**Explanation:**

- **Chromosome**: The chromosome number (e.g., chr1 to chr22, chrX, chrY).
- **Aberration_Type**: Type of copy number aberration (`Amplification`, `Gain`, `Loss`, `Deletion`).
- **Correlation_Coefficient**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the frequencies from the Mitelman database and TCGA data for the specified chromosome and aberration type.
- **P-value**: The p-value corresponding to the correlation coefficient, indicating statistical significance.

Please replace `r_valueX` and `p_valueX` with the actual computed values from your analysis. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
