After comparing the SQL queries and their results, we can conclude that both `0result.sql` and `2result.sql` contain the same SQL code and produce identical results. The SQL query in both files accurately calculates the change in the number of homeless veterans in each CoC region of New York between 2012 and 2018.

The SQL query works by performing a conditional aggregation using `MAX(CASE WHEN ...)`. It subtracts the number of homeless veterans in 2012 from the number in 2018 for each CoC region. The `WHERE` clause filters the data to include only New York CoCs and the years 2012 and 2018.

Considering that `2result.sql` appears to be the preferred or updated version, the correct SQL is:

```plaintext
2result.sql
```
