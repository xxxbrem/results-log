Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Table and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_hud_pit_homelessness.hud_pit_by_coc`

- **Columns and Potential Usage:**
  - `CoC_Number`: Identifier for the Continuum of Care (CoC) region. Used to identify and distinguish CoC regions.
  - `CoC_Name`: Name of the CoC region. Used to identify CoC regions and filter for those in New York.
  - `Homeless_Veterans`: Number of homeless veterans in the CoC region for a given year. This is the key metric for the task.
  - `Count_Year`: The year of the count. Used to filter data for the years 2012 and 2018.
  - `CoC_Category`: Category of the CoC region. Potentially used for additional filtering or grouping.

- **Conditions that may be used:**
  - **Filtering CoCs in New York:** CoC regions in New York have `CoC_Number` starting with `'NY'`. We can use `WHERE CoC_Number LIKE 'NY%'` to filter.
  - **Filtering Years:** To focus on 2012 and 2018 data, use `WHERE Count_Year = 2012` or `WHERE Count_Year = 2018`.
  - **Ordering Data:** Use `ORDER BY CoC_Number`, `ORDER BY Count_Year` to organize results.
  - **Distinct Values:** Use `DISTINCT` to find unique CoC regions or years.

16. **Find the change in homeless veterans between consecutive years for New York CoCs:**

    (Note: Without using CTEs or subqueries, we can list data to observe changes.)

    ```sql
    SELECT `CoC_Number`, `CoC_Name`, `Count_Year`, `Homeless_Veterans`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_hud_pit_homelessness.hud_pit_by_coc`
    WHERE `CoC_Number` LIKE 'NY%'
    ORDER BY `CoC_Number`, `Count_Year`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

These queries help explore the dataset to understand the values related to the number of homeless veterans in each CoC region of New York between 2012 and 2018. By analyzing the output of these queries, we can gather insights required to calculate the changes over the specified years.Query:

Task: What has been the change in the number of homeless veterans in each CoC region of New York between 2012 and 2018?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the change in the number of homeless veterans in each Continuum of Care (CoC) region of New York between 2012 and 2018, we can use the `hud_pit_by_coc` table from the `sdoh_hud_pit_homelessness` dataset. The table contains annual counts of homeless veterans by CoC region.

Below is the format of the data:

```csv
CoC_Number,CoC_Name,Change_in_Homeless_Veterans
CoC_Number1:str,CoC_Name1:str,Change1:int
CoC_Number2:str,CoC_Name2:str,Change2:int
...
```

The `Change_in_Homeless_Veterans` is calculated as the difference in the number of homeless veterans between 2018 and 2012 for each CoC region in New York..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 17:21:26 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What has been the change in the number of homeless veterans in each CoC region of New York between 2012 and 2018?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the change in the number of homeless veterans in each Continuum of Care (CoC) region of New York between 2012 and 2018, we can use the `hud_pit_by_coc` table from the `sdoh_hud_pit_homelessness` dataset. The table contains annual counts of homeless veterans by CoC region.

Below is the format of the data:

```csv
CoC_Number,CoC_Name,Change_in_Homeless_Veterans
CoC_Number1:str,CoC_Name1:str,Change1:int
CoC_Number2:str,CoC_Name2:str,Change2:int
...
```

The `Change_in_Homeless_Veterans` is calculated as the difference in the number of homeless veterans between 2018 and 2012 for each CoC region in New York. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
