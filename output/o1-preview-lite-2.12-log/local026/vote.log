After comparing the two SQL queries, **the correct SQL is `0result.sql`**.

**Reason:**

- The first SQL query (`0result.sql`) correctly calculates the total runs conceded by a bowler in an over by summing the runs scored off the bat and only including the extras that are attributed to the bowler (i.e., wides and no-balls). This aligns with cricket scoring rules, where byes and leg-byes are not charged to the bowler.

- The second SQL query (`2result.sql`), however, includes all extras in the total runs conceded, including byes and leg-byes. Since byes and leg-byes are not counted against the bowler, this query overestimates the runs conceded by the bowler.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL as it accurately computes the total runs conceded by each bowler in a single over, considering only the appropriate extras.
