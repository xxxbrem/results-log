After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Correct Computation:** The query in `0result.sql` accurately computes all required metrics:
  - **First Trip Duration:** It uses `ARRAY_AGG` with `ORDER BY start_date ASC LIMIT 1` to find the first trip duration for each year-month.
  - **Last Trip Duration:** It uses `ARRAY_AGG` with `ORDER BY start_date DESC LIMIT 1` to find the last trip duration for each year-month.
  - **Highest and Lowest Trip Durations:** It calculates the maximum and minimum durations using `MAX` and `MIN` functions.
- **Efficiency:** The query is concise and efficient, avoiding unnecessary complexity. It performs the calculations directly within a single `SELECT` statement without additional Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
- **Results Alignment:** The results from `0result.sql` align correctly with the expected values based on the data provided.

**Comparison with Other Queries:**

- **`1result.sql`:** While this query also produces the correct results, it uses multiple CTEs and additional joins, making it more complex than necessary for this task.
- **`2result.sql`:** This query is similar to `0result.sql` but uses a slightly different approach. However, `0result.sql` is more straightforward and aligns better with standard BigQuery practices.
