After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **1result.sql** is the correct SQL query for generating the daily detailed sales report as per the task requirements.

**Reasoning:**

- **1result.sql** correctly joins the **sales**, **traffic**, **inventory**, and **net PPM** tables on the required fields: **date**, **ASIN**, **program**, **period**, and **distributor_view**.
- It includes all the necessary columns specified in the task, such as total ordered units, ordered revenue, average selling price, glance views, conversion rate, shipped units, shipped revenue, average net PPM, average procurable product out-of-stock, total on-hand units and value, net received units and value, open purchase order quantities, unfilled customer ordered units, and average vendor confirmation rate, receive fill rate, sell-through rate, and vendor lead time.
- The query also filters the data for the specified date range (from January 7, 2022, to February 6, 2022) and only includes records where the distributor view is `'Manufacturing'`.
- Additionally, **1result.sql** uses `LEFT JOIN`s to ensure that all records from the sales table are included, even if there is no matching record in the other tables, which is important for a comprehensive report.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

1result.sql
