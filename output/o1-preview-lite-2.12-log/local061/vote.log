The SQL in `0result.sql` correctly implements the task by:

- **Calculating growth rates**: It calculates the growth rate for each product and month, handling cases where sales in 2019 are zero by setting the growth rate to zero, ensuring all relevant data is included.
  
- **Projecting 2021 sales**: It projects the 2021 monthly sales for each product by applying the growth rate to the 2020 sales figures.
  
- **Converting to USD**: It converts the projected 2021 sales amounts to USD using the 2021 exchange rates from the `currency` table.
  
- **Averaging by month**: It computes the average projected sales in USD for each month across all products, listing them by month as required.

The query follows the task's requirements accurately and provides results consistent with the expected calculations.
