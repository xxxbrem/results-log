---

**Reason:**

Between the two SQL queries provided, `0result.sql` and `1result.sql`, both aim to solve the task of identifying the top 10 tags for user `1908967` based on answers posted before June 7, 2018, where each tag's score is calculated as \(10 \times \text{(number of upvotes)} + 15 \times \text{(number of accepted answers)}\).

**Comparison:**

- **`0result.sql`:**

  - Directly aggregates the votes (upvotes and accepted answers) per tag by joining the `votes` table with the `posts_answers` and `posts_questions` tables.
  - Uses `COUNTIF` to count the number of upvotes and accepted answers per tag.
  - Tags are extracted by splitting the `tags` string from the `posts_questions` table.

- **`1result.sql`:**

  - Follows a structured approach using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for clarity and step-by-step computation.
  - First, computes the total upvotes and accepts per answer in the `answer_votes` CTE.
  - Then, associates each answer with its tags in the `answer_tags` CTE.
  - Calculates the score per answer per tag in the `answer_tag_scores` CTE.
  - Finally, aggregates the scores per tag in the final SELECT statement.

**Reason for Choosing `1result.sql`:**

- **Precision in Calculations:**

  - `1result.sql` calculates the score **per answer** first, ensuring that the votes are accurately attributed to each answer before associating them with tags.
  - By summing up the scores per tag after calculating them per answer, it avoids any potential double-counting of votes that might occur if multiple answers share the same tag.

- **Clarity and Maintainability:**

  - The use of CTEs in `1result.sql` makes the query more readable and easier to understand.
  - Each step is well-defined, which makes debugging and future modifications more manageable.

- **Alignment with Task Requirement:**

  - The task specifies considering "only the upvotes and accepted answers for those answers" and deriving tags from the associated questions.
  - By calculating scores per answer and then attributing them to tags, `1result.sql` closely follows this requirement.

**Conclusion:**

While both queries produce the same final result, `1result.sql` is preferred due to its precise calculation method, clearer structure, and better alignment with the task specifications.
