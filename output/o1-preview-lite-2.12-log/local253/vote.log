**Reasoning:**

After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** stands out as the better solution for the following reasons:

1. **Efficient Use of Window Functions:**
   - `1result.sql` utilizes the `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ...)` window function to rank companies within each location based on their average salary. This approach efficiently assigns ranks and allows for easy selection of the top 5 companies per city.
   - Window functions are powerful and efficient for operations like ranking and partitioning data without the need for subqueries or multiple joins.

2. **Scalability and Maintainability:**
   - The use of window functions makes the query more scalable. If new locations are added to the dataset, the query can handle them without requiring additional code changes.
   - In contrast, `2result.sql` uses `UNION ALL` to combine separate queries for each city. This method requires explicit queries for each location, making it less maintainable and prone to errors if locations change or new ones are added.

3. **Conciseness and Readability:**
   - `1result.sql` is more concise. It defines common table expressions (CTEs) that logically separate each step: cleaning salaries, processing annual salaries, calculating averages, ranking, and final selection. This structure enhances readability and understanding of the query flow.
   - The query avoids repetition by handling all locations in a single set of operations, unlike `2result.sql`, which repeats similar code blocks for each city.

4. **Consistency in Results:**
   - Both queries produce the same results, which indicates that they are functionally correct. However, the method used in `1result.sql` is more elegant and efficient.
   - The output aligns with the task requirements, displaying the top 5 companies by average salary in each specified city and comparing them to the national average.

5. **Future-Proofing:**
   - Should there be any changes in the data or additional requirements (e.g., more cities, different ranking criteria), `1result.sql` can accommodate these changes with minimal adjustments.
   - The query is designed to be dynamic, relying on data-driven decisions rather than hardcoded values.

In summary, **`1result.sql`** is the preferred solution due to its efficient use of SQL features, scalability, maintainability, and concise structure, making it the correct choice for the task.
