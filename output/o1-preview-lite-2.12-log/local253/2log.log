This SQL query cleans and converts the salary values to a numeric type by removing non-numeric characters and adjusting for monthly salaries by multiplying by 12 to get an annual salary. It then identifies the top 5 companies by average salary in each of Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad. The query compares each company's average salary in those cities to their overall national average salary.

The final result displays four columns:

- **Location**
- **Company Name**
- **Average Salary in State**
- **Average Salary in Country**

Only the top 5 companies in each of the specified locations are listed.

**Explanation:**

- **Corrected `REPLACE()` Function Usage:**
  - Each `REPLACE()` function now has exactly three arguments: the string to search, the substring to find, and the replacement string.
  - The nesting of `REPLACE()` functions is properly structured with matching parentheses.

- **Salary Cleaning Logic:**
  - The `REPLACE()` functions remove non-numeric characters from the `"Salary"` column, such as currency symbols (`'₹'`, `'$'`), commas, letters (`'k'`, `'mo'`, `'yr'`, `'per'`, `'month'`, `'year'`), and slashes.
  - The spaces `' '` are also removed to ensure a clean numeric string.
  - Monthly salaries are multiplied by 12 to annualize them.

- **Identifying Top 5 Companies in Each Location:**
  - The subquery in the `WHERE` clause selects the top 5 companies by average salary in each specified location.
  - The `ORDER BY "AverageSalaryState" DESC LIMIT 5` ensures only the top 5 are considered.

- **Joining with National Averages:**
  - A join is performed between the state-level averages (`s1`) and the national-level averages (`s2`) on `CompanyName`.

- **Final Output:**
  - The query selects the `Location`, `CompanyName`, `Average Salary in State`, and `Average Salary in Country`, listing only the top 5 companies in each specified location.

**Note:** This query assumes that all salary values can be cleaned to a numeric format after removing non-numeric characters. It also assumes that any salaries expressed in terms of months are indicated with `'mo'` or `'/mo'`, and similar for years.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To accomplish the task, we first need to identify the relevant table and columns, and consider the conditions that will be used in our SQL queries.

**Relevant Table and Columns:**

- **Table**: `SalaryDataset`

  - `"CompanyName"`: Used to identify and group data by company.
  - `"Location"`: Used to filter data for the specified cities (Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, Hyderabad).
  - `"Salary"`: Contains salary values that need to be cleaned by removing non-numeric characters and converting to a numeric type for calculations.
  - `"SalariesReported"`: Could be used to understand the number of salaries reported per company (optional).

**Conditions:**

- Filter the dataset where `"Location"` is one of the specified cities: `'Mumbai'`, `'Pune'`, `'New Delhi'`, `'Hyderabad'`.
- Clean the `"Salary"` column by removing non-numeric characters to convert it into a numeric type.

**Sample SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List distinct locations available in the dataset:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "Location" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **List distinct company names:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "CompanyName" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **View raw salary entries to understand the format (first 100 rows):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Salary" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Select salaries reported in Mumbai:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Salary" FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Location" = 'Mumbai' LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **Select salaries reported in Pune:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Salary" FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Location" = 'Pune' LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Select salaries reported in New Delhi:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Salary" FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Location" = 'New Delhi' LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Select salaries reported in Hyderabad:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Salary" FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Location" = 'Hyderabad' LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. **List distinct job titles in the dataset:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "JobTitle" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **Count the number of salaries reported per company:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "CompanyName", COUNT(*) AS "SalariesCount" FROM "SalaryDataset" GROUP BY "CompanyName" LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **Select salaries that contain the currency symbol to understand formatting:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Salary" FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Salary" LIKE '%₹%' LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Attempt to clean and extract numeric salary values (simple approach):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Salary", REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE("Salary", '₹', ''), ',', ''), 'k', '') AS "CleanSalary" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Identify companies present in the specified cities:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "CompanyName", "Location" FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Location" IN ('Mumbai', 'Pune', 'New Delhi', 'Hyderabad') LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List companies and their corresponding job titles:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "CompanyName", "JobTitle" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Select salary entries where the salary is specified as a range:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Salary" FROM "SalaryDataset" WHERE "Salary" LIKE '%-%' LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **List distinct salary ranges to understand variations in the data:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "Salary" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
    ```

16. **Select companies along with the number of salaries reported in each specified city:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "CompanyName", "Location", COUNT(*) AS "SalariesCount"
    FROM "SalaryDataset"
    WHERE "Location" IN ('Mumbai', 'Pune', 'New Delhi', 'Hyderabad')
    GROUP BY "CompanyName", "Location"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

17. **View the first 100 entries of companies with their salary and location:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "CompanyName", "Salary", "Location" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
    ```

18. **Select salaries reported nationwide to compute the overall average later:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Salary" FROM "SalaryDataset" LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the data within the `SalaryDataset` table, which is essential for writing the detailed SQL query to identify the top 5 companies by average salary in each specified city and comparing them to the national average salary.

**Note:** Cleaning the `"Salary"` column and converting it to a numeric type is crucial before performing any aggregation functions like `AVG()`. The cleaning process would involve removing non-numeric characters and handling salary ranges appropriately.Query:

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Using a Salary Dataset where the salary values need to be cleaned by removing non-numeric characters and converting them to a numeric type, write a detailed SQL query that identifies the top 5 companies by average salary in each of Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad, then compares each company’s average salary in those cities to the overall national average salary. The final result should display four columns: Location, Company Name, Average Salary in State, and Average Salary in Country, listing only the top 5 companies in each of the specified locations.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the top 5 companies by average salary in each of Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad, we first clean the salary data by removing any non-numeric characters and converting the values to a numeric type. We then calculate the average salary for each company in each specified location and compare it to the overall national average salary.

The final result is structured as follows:

```csv
Location,Company Name,Average Salary in State,Average Salary in Country
Mumbai,Company1:str,AvgSalaryState1:float,AvgSalaryCountry1:float
Mumbai,Company2:str,AvgSalaryState2:float,AvgSalaryCountry2:float
...
(Attention: Listing top 5 companies by average salary in each specified location)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['hardware_dim_customer', 'hardware_fact_pre_invoice_deductions', 'web_sales_reps', 'hardware_dim_product', 'web_orders', 'StaffHours', 'university_enrollment', 'university_faculty', 'university_student', 'university_offering', 'web_accounts', 'web_events', 'SalaryDataset', 'web_region', 'hardware_fact_gross_price', 'hardware_fact_manufacturing_cost', 'university_course', 'hardware_fact_sales_monthly']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 11:20:08 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Using a Salary Dataset where the salary values need to be cleaned by removing non-numeric characters and converting them to a numeric type, write a detailed SQL query that identifies the top 5 companies by average salary in each of Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad, then compares each company’s average salary in those cities to the overall national average salary. The final result should display four columns: Location, Company Name, Average Salary in State, and Average Salary in Country, listing only the top 5 companies in each of the specified locations., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To identify the top 5 companies by average salary in each of Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad, we first clean the salary data by removing any non-numeric characters and converting the values to a numeric type. We then calculate the average salary for each company in each specified location and compare it to the overall national average salary.

The final result is structured as follows:

```csv
Location,Company Name,Average Salary in State,Average Salary in Country
Mumbai,Company1:str,AvgSalaryState1:float,AvgSalaryCountry1:float
Mumbai,Company2:str,AvgSalaryState2:float,AvgSalaryCountry2:float
...
(Attention: Listing top 5 companies by average salary in each specified location)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To identify the top 5 companies by average salary in each of Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad, we first clean the salary data by removing any non-numeric characters and converting the values to a numeric type. We then calculate the average salary for each company in each specified location and compare it to the overall national average salary.

The final result is structured as follows:

```csv
Location,Company Name,Average Salary in State,Average Salary in Country
Mumbai,Company1:str,AvgSalaryState1:float,AvgSalaryCountry1:float
Mumbai,Company2:str,AvgSalaryState2:float,AvgSalaryCountry2:float
...
(Attention: Listing top 5 companies by average salary in each specified location)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
