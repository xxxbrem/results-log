(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine which healthcare provider incurs the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014, we aggregated the total payments for each provider from the `inpatient_charges_2014` and `outpatient_charges_2014` tables in the `cms_medicare` dataset. BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL has the highest combined total payments, indicating it incurs the highest combined average costs.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   - `provider_id`: Used to identify each provider.
   - `provider_name`: Name of the provider.
   - `average_total_payments`: The average total payments for inpatient services per provider.
   - `total_discharges`: The number of discharges billed by the provider for inpatient services.

2. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`
   - `provider_id`: Used to identify each provider.
   - `provider_name`: Name of the provider.
   - `average_total_payments`: The average total payments for outpatient services per provider.
   - `outpatient_services`: The number of services billed by the provider for outpatient services.

**Possible Conditions:**
- Combine data from inpatient and outpatient tables based on `provider_id`.
- Calculate combined average costs for both inpatient and outpatient services.
- Use data specifically from the year 2014 (tables already represent 2014 data).

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Query 1:** Select distinct provider IDs and names from inpatient charges.
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     provider_id,
     provider_name
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   
2. **Query 2:** Retrieve average total payments for inpatient services.
   ```sql
   SELECT
     provider_id,
     provider_name,
     average_total_payments AS inpatient_average_total_payments
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Query 3:** Retrieve average total payments for outpatient services.
   ```sql
   SELECT
     provider_id,
     provider_name,
     average_total_payments AS outpatient_average_total_payments
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Query 4:** List distinct provider IDs present in both inpatient and outpatient datasets.
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     inpatient.provider_id
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014` AS inpatient
   INNER JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014` AS outpatient
   ON
     inpatient.provider_id = outpatient.provider_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Query 5:** Calculate total inpatient payments per provider.
   ```sql
   SELECT
     provider_id,
     SUM(average_total_payments) AS total_inpatient_payments
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   GROUP BY
     provider_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Query 6:** Calculate total outpatient payments per provider.
   ```sql
   SELECT
     provider_id,
     SUM(average_total_payments) AS total_outpatient_payments
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`
   GROUP BY
     provider_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Query 7:** Join inpatient and outpatient total payments.
   ```sql
   SELECT
     inpatient.provider_id,
     inpatient_total.total_inpatient_payments,
     outpatient_total.total_outpatient_payments
   FROM
     (SELECT

   ```

10. **Query 10:** Get provider details along with combined total payments, ordered by highest payments.
    ```sql
    SELECT
      inpatient_total.provider_id,
      inpatient.provider_name,
      (inpatient_total.total_inpatient_payments + outpatient_total.total_outpatient_payments) AS combined_total_payments

      inpatient.provider_name,
      combined_total_payments
    ORDER BY
      combined_total_payments DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Each of these queries progressively builds towards identifying the healthcare provider with the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014 by utilizing the relevant tables and columns.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT
     provider_id,
     provider_name
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`

Task: Can you tell me which healthcare provider incurs the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Provider_ID,Provider_Name,Combined_Total_Payments
id:str,name:str,value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine which healthcare provider incurs the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014, we aggregate the total payments for each provider from both the `inpatient_charges_2014` and `outpatient_charges_2014` tables in the `cms_medicare` schema. By summing the total payments for inpatient and outpatient services per provider, we identify the provider with the highest combined total payments..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['hcpcs', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd10_procedures_2019', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['home_health_agencies_2013', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'hospital_general_info', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['care_site', 'concept', 'concept_ancestor', 'concept_class', 'concept_relationship', 'condition_era', 'condition_occurrence', 'cost', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'domain', 'dose_era', 'drug_era', 'drug_exposure', 'drug_strength', 'location', 'observation', 'observation_period', 'payer_plan_period', 'person', 'procedure_occurrence', 'provider', 'relationship', 'vocabulary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
