**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- **DEATHRECORDS**
  - `"Id"`: Unique identifier for each death record; used to join with `ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS`.
  - `"Age"`: Age of the individual at death; used to filter ages between 12 and 18.
  - `"Race"`: Numerical code representing the race; used to join with `RACE` table.
  
- **RACE**
  - `"Code"`: Numerical race code; used to join with `DEATHRECORDS`."Race".
  - `"Description"`: Description of the race; used to identify records containing the word 'black'.

- **ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS**
  - `"DeathRecordId"`: References `DEATHRECORDS`."Id"; used to associate conditions with death records.
  - `"Icd10Code"`: ICD-10 code associated with the condition; used to join with `ICD10CODE`.

- **ICD10CODE**
  - `"Code"`: ICD-10 code; used to join with `ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS`."Icd10Code".
  - `"Description"`: Description of the ICD-10 code; used to identify codes containing 'vehicle' or 'firearm'.

**Potential Conditions:**

- Filter ages between 12 and 18 inclusive.
- Race descriptions containing the word 'black' (case-insensitive).
- ICD-10 code descriptions containing 'vehicle' or 'firearm' (case-insensitive).

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct ages in the DEATHRECORDS table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Age"
   FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."DEATHRECORDS"
   ORDER BY "Age"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count deaths by age between 12 and 18:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Age", COUNT(*) AS "DeathCount"
   FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."DEATHRECORDS"
   WHERE "Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
   GROUP BY "Age"
   ORDER BY "Age"

Task: Please provide, for each age from 12 through 18 (inclusive), the total number of deaths and the number of deaths among individuals identified as Black (based on race descriptions containing the word ‘black’), specifically for deaths associated with ICD-10 codes whose descriptions include the word ‘vehicle’ and for deaths associated with ICD-10 codes whose descriptions include the word ‘firearm.’ Use the EntityAxisConditions table to determine which ICD-10 codes were involved in each death, rather than joining ICD-10 code information directly on the death records.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Age,TotalDeaths_Vehicle,BlackDeaths_Vehicle,TotalDeaths_Firearm,BlackDeaths_Firearm
12,total_deaths_vehicle:int,black_deaths_vehicle:int,total_deaths_firearm:int,black_deaths_firearm:int

18,total_deaths_vehicle:int,black_deaths_vehicle:int,total_deaths_firearm:int,black_deaths_firearm:int
```

**Explanation:**

This table provides, for each age from 12 through 18, the total number of deaths and the number of deaths among individuals identified as Black (based on race descriptions containing the word 'black'). The deaths are categorized based on association with ICD-10 codes whose descriptions include the word 'vehicle' or 'firearm'. The counts are represented as integers..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'DEATH': {'DEATH': ['ACTIVITYCODE', 'AGERECODE27', 'AGERECODE27', 'AGERECODE52', 'AGERECODE12', 'DEATHRECORDS', 'RESIDENTSTATUS', 'EDUCATION1989REVISION', 'EDUCATION1989REVISION', 'EDUCATION2003REVISION', 'EDUCATIONREPORTINGFLAG', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE5', 'RECORDAXISCONDITIONS', 'INFANTAGERECODE22', 'BRIDGEDRACEFLAG', 'AGETYPE', 'DAYOFWEEKOFDEATH', 'HISPANICORIGIN', 'METHODOFDISPOSITION', 'PLACEOFINJURY', 'RACEIMPUTATIONFLAG', 'MANNEROFDEATH', 'RACE', 'ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS', 'ICD10CODE', 'MARITALSTATUS', 'PLACEOFDEATHANDDECEDENTSSTATUS', 'TEMP_DEATHS', 'HISPANICORIGINRACERECODE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
