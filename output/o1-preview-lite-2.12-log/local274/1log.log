Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **orders**
   - `id`: To identify the order. Condition: `id = 421`.

2. **orderlines**
   - `order_id`: To link order lines to orders. Condition: `order_id = 421`.
   - `product_id`: To identify products in the order.
   - `qty`: Quantity ordered.

3. **picking_line**
   - `order_id`: To filter picking lines for order 421. Condition: `order_id = 421`.
   - `product_id`: Products that were picked.
   - `qty`: Quantity of each product picked.
   - `picklist_id` and `line_no`: For identifying individual picking lines.
   - `location_id`: Location from which the product was picked.

4. **products**
   - `id`: Product ID to join with other tables.
   - `name`: Product name for reporting.

5. **inventory**
   - `product_id`: To find inventory entries for the products.
   - `purchase_id`: To identify when the inventory was added (used for FIFO).
   - `qty`: Quantity available or used.
   - `location_id`: To match with picking locations if needed.

6. **purchases**
   - `id`: Purchase ID to join with inventory.
   - `purchased`: Date when the product was purchased (used for FIFO sequencing).
   - `product_id`: To ensure correct linkage.

**Potential Conditions:**

- **Filter by Order ID:** `order_id = 421` in `picking_line` and `orderlines`.
- **Filter by Product IDs:** Use `product_id` to join between tables.
- **FIFO Ordering:** Use `purchased` date from `purchases` to order inventory batches.
- **Match Picked Quantities to Inventory Batches:** Allocate picked quantities to inventory batches based on FIFO.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Query the Order Details for Order 421**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "orders"
   WHERE id = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List All Order Lines for Order 421**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "orderlines"
   WHERE order_id = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get Distinct Product IDs Picked for Order 421**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM "picking_line"
   WHERE order_id = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve Product Names Picked for Order 421**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p.id AS product_id, p.name AS product_name
   FROM "picking_line" pl
   JOIN "products" p ON pl.product_id = p.id
   WHERE pl.order_id = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get Quantities Picked for Each Product in Order 421**

   ```sql
   SELECT pl.product_id, p.name AS product_name, pl.qty
   FROM "picking_line" pl
   JOIN "products" p ON pl.product_id = p.id
   WHERE pl.order_id = 421
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **View Inventory Entries for Picked Products**

   ```sql
   SELECT i.product_id, i.purchase_id, i.qty AS inventory_qty
   FROM "inventory" i
   WHERE i.product_id IN (
     SELECT product_id FROM "picking_line" WHERE order_id = 421
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get Purchase Dates for Inventory Batches (For FIFO)**

   ```sql
   SELECT i.product_id, i.purchase_id, pu.purchased AS purchase_date, i.qty AS inventory_qty
   FROM "inventory" i
   JOIN "purchases" pu ON i.purchase_id = pu.id
   WHERE i.product_id IN (
     SELECT product_id FROM "picking_line" WHERE order_id = 421
   )
   ORDER BY pu.purchased
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Sum Total Quantity Picked Per Product for Order 421**

   ```sql
   SELECT pl.product_id, p.name AS product_name, SUM(pl.qty) AS total_picked_qty
   FROM "picking_line" pl
   JOIN "products" p ON pl.product_id = p.id
   WHERE pl.order_id = 421
   GROUP BY pl.product_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count Number of Inventory Batches Used Per Product (Approximation)**

   ```sql
   SELECT i.product_id, COUNT(*) AS batches_used
   FROM "inventory" i
   WHERE i.product_id IN (
     SELECT product_id FROM "picking_line" WHERE order_id = 421
   )
   GROUP BY i.product_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate Average Units Picked Per Batch for Each Product**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      pl.product_id,
      p.name AS product_name,
      (SUM(pl.qty) * 1.0) / COUNT(DISTINCT i.purchase_id) AS average_units_picked_per_batch
    FROM "picking_line" pl
    JOIN "products" p ON pl.product_id = p.id
    JOIN "inventory" i ON pl.product_id = i.product_id
    JOIN "purchases" pu ON i.purchase_id = pu.id
    WHERE pl.order_id = 421
    GROUP BY pl.product_id
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    *Note: This query approximates the average units picked per batch by dividing the total quantity picked by the number of distinct inventory batches (purchases).*

---

These queries progressively build an understanding of:

- Which products were involved in order 421.
- How many units of each product were picked.
- The inventory batches associated with these products.
- An approximation of the average units picked per batch using FIFO.

**Explanation:**

- **Queries 1-2:** Fetch order and order line details for order 421.
- **Queries 3-5:** Identify the products picked and their quantities.
- **Queries 6-7:** Explore inventory and purchase data to understand batch information for FIFO.
- **Query 8:** Calculate total quantity picked per product.
- **Query 9:** Estimate the number of batches (purchases) used per product.
- **Query 10:** Compute the average units picked per batch for each product by applying FIFO principles.

---

**Note:** To accurately calculate the average number of units picked per batch using FIFO for each product, you would need to allocate the quantities picked in order 421 to the inventory batches in the order they were purchased (earliest first). This process may require more complex SQL queries involving subqueries or procedural logic not shown here due to the constraint of not using Common Table Expressions (CTEs).Query:

    pl.product_id,
    p.name AS product_name,

Task: Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
product_id,product_name,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,average_units2:float
...
```

To determine which products were picked for order **421** and calculate the average number of units picked per batch for each product using the FIFO method, we:

1. **Identified the products picked for order 421** by querying the `picking_line` table where `order_id` equals 421.
2. **Applied the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method** by allocating the picked quantities to inventory batches in the order they were received (earliest first), using data from the `inventory` and `purchases` tables.
3. **Calculated the average units picked per batch** for each product by dividing the total units picked by the number of batches from which the product was picked.

The result provides the **product IDs**, their corresponding **product names**, and the **average number of units picked per batch** for each product in order 421..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 19:36:28 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
