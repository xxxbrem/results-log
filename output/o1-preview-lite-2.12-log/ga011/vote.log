After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer to the task.

**Reason:**

- **Precise Domain Filtering:** `1result.sql` specifically extracts the hostname from the `page_location` parameter and filters events where the hostname equals `'shop.googlemerchandisestore.com'`. This ensures that only events from the exact domain are included.

  ```sql
  REGEXP_EXTRACT(
    (SELECT ep.value.string_value
     FROM UNNEST(event_params) AS ep
     WHERE ep.key = 'page_location' AND ep.value.string_value IS NOT NULL),
    r'https?://([^/]+)'
  ) = 'shop.googlemerchandisestore.com'
  ```

- **Accurate URL Extraction:** It uses `REGEXP_EXTRACT` and `REGEXP_REPLACE` functions to accurately extract and clean the `page_path` from the `page_location`, removing extra slashes and ensuring consistency.

  ```sql
  REGEXP_REPLACE(
    REGEXP_EXTRACT(
      (SELECT ep.value.string_value FROM UNNEST(event_params) AS ep
       WHERE ep.key = 'page_location' AND ep.value.string_value IS NOT NULL),
      r'https?://[^/]+(/.*|$)'
    ),
    r'/+','/'
  ) AS cleaned_page_path
  ```

- **Focused Date Range:** The query uses the table pattern `events_202012*`, which explicitly includes all event tables for December 2020. This matches the requirement to analyze data from December 2020.

  ```sql
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_202012*`
  ```

- **Accurate Ranking:** It calculates the total page views per cleaned page path and then assigns row numbers based on the descending order of page views to find the page with the second highest total page views.

  ```sql
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn
  ```

**In contrast**, `2result.sql`:

- Uses a `LIKE` condition with `%shop.googlemerchandisestore.com%`, which could potentially include unwanted subdomains or variations of the domain, thereby introducing inaccuracies.

  ```sql
  REGEXP_EXTRACT(
    (SELECT ep.value.string_value FROM UNNEST(event_params) AS ep
     WHERE ep.key = 'page_location' AND ep.value.string_value IS NOT NULL),
    r'https?://([^/]+)'
  ) LIKE '%shop.googlemerchandisestore.com%'
  ```

- Splits the `page_location` on `'shop.googlemerchandisestore.com'` and uses `SAFE_OFFSET(1)`, which may not handle URLs with variations or ensure that the domain exactly matches.

  ```sql
  SPLIT(
    (SELECT value.string_value FROM UNNEST(event_params) AS ep WHERE ep.key = 'page_location'),
    'shop.googlemerchandisestore.com'
  )[SAFE_OFFSET(1)]
  ```

- Includes all event tables using `events_*` and filters dates with `event_date BETWEEN '20201201' AND '20201231'`. While this includes December 2020, it's less precise than specifying `events_202012*`.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct and more precise SQL query that accurately answers the task.
