The correct SQL query is **`0result.sql`**, and here's why:

### Reasons for Choosing `0result.sql`:

1. **Correct Identification of Cities with ≥20% Sales Increase**:
   - Both queries aim to identify cities in the United States where total sales (excluding promotions) in Q4 2020 increased by at least 20% compared to Q4 2019.
   - Both queries correctly filter for non-promotional sales (`promo_id = 999`) and the specified quarters and years.
   - `0result.sql` uses `country_id = 52790`, which corresponds to 'United States of America', ensuring accurate country filtering.

2. **Accurate Selection of Top 20% Products**:
   - After identifying the qualifying cities, the queries rank products by their total sales in those cities and quarters (still excluding promotions).
   - Both queries calculate the top 20% products based on overall sales.
   - `0result.sql` correctly computes the top products, resulting in products like **'English Willow Cricket Bat'** and **'Pro Maple Youth Bat'**, which are significant in this context.

3. **Correct Calculation of Product Shares and Share Changes**:
   - The queries compute each top product’s share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020.
   - `0result.sql` accurately calculates the share change for each product.
   - Importantly, `0result.sql` identifies products with positive share changes, as expected when sales have increased.

4. **Results Align with Task Requirements**:
   - The task specifies returning the results in **descending order of share change**.
   - In `0result.sql`, products are correctly ordered by the **highest positive share change**, highlighting products that gained market share.
   - The result shows **'English Willow Cricket Bat'** with a positive share change of **+2.5503%**, indicating a significant increase, which fulfills the task's intent.

5. **`1result.sql` Shortcomings**:
   - In contrast, `1result.sql` lists products that all have **negative share changes**, which contradicts the expectation when selecting cities with increasing sales.
   - The absence of any products with positive share changes suggests a potential flaw in `1result.sql`'s logic or data handling.

### Conclusion:

`0result.sql` correctly implements the task by:

- Identifying the appropriate cities with a sales increase of at least 20%.
- Selecting the top 20% products in those cities based on overall sales.
- Calculating each product's share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020.
- Determining the difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020.
- Returning the results in descending order of share change, with products having positive share changes listed first.

Based on these points, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query.
