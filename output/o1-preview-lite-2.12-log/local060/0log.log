**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- **countries.country_id**: Used to join with `customers.country_id` to identify customers in specific countries.
- **countries.country_name**: Used to filter for 'United States' to limit data to U.S. sales.
- **customers.cust_id**: Used to join with `sales.cust_id` to link sales data to customers.
- **customers.cust_city**: Used to group sales by city.
- **customers.country_id**: Used to identify customers located in the United States.
- **sales.cust_id**: Used to join with `customers.cust_id` to get customer details for each sale.
- **sales.prod_id**: Used to join with `products.prod_id` to get product details.
- **sales.time_id**: Used to join with `times.time_id` to get time details of each sale.
- **sales.promo_id**: Used to filter out promotional sales (identify sales with no promotions).
- **sales.amount_sold**: Used to calculate total sales amounts.
- **times.time_id**: Used to join with `sales.time_id` to link sales to specific dates.
- **times.calendar_year**: Used to filter sales data for the years 2019 and 2020.
- **times.calendar_quarter_number**: Used to filter sales data for the 4th quarter (Q4).
- **products.prod_id**: Used to join with `sales.prod_id` to identify products sold.
- **products.prod_name**: Used to get the names of products for reporting.
- **promotions.promo_id**: May be used to identify promotions; needed to filter out promotional sales.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `countries.country_name = 'United States'` to filter for U.S. sales.
- `times.calendar_year IN (2019, 2020)` to select the relevant years.
- `times.calendar_quarter_number = 4` to select Q4.
- Identifying non-promotional sales by determining which `promo_id` corresponds to 'No Promotion' or filtering out certain `promo_id`s.
- Calculating sales growth by comparing total sales amounts between Q4 2019 and Q4 2020.
- Selecting cities where sales increased by at least 20%.

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **Get a list of country names to verify how 'United States' is recorded:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_name"
   FROM "countries"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find the country_id for 'United States':**
   ```sql
   SELECT "country_id"
   FROM "countries"
   WHERE "country_name" = 'United States'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get distinct customer cities in the United States:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "cust_city"
   FROM "customers"
   WHERE "country_id" = (
       SELECT "country_id"
       FROM "countries"
       WHERE "country_name" = 'United States'
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List sales data for Q4 2019 and Q4 2020:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "sales".*
   FROM "sales"
   JOIN "times" ON "sales"."time_id" = "times"."time_id"
   WHERE "times"."calendar_year" IN (2019, 2020)
     AND "times"."calendar_quarter_number" = 4
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Identify promo_ids associated with 'No Promotion' or similar:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "promo_id", "promo_name"
   FROM "promotions"
   WHERE "promo_name" LIKE '%No Promotion%' OR "promo_name" LIKE '%None%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List sales records with no promotion applied (assuming promo_id for 'No Promotion' is known, e.g., promo_id = 9999):**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "sales"
   WHERE "promo_id" = 9999
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get total sales amount per city for Q4 2019 without promotions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customers"."cust_city", SUM("sales"."amount_sold") AS "total_sales"
   FROM "sales"
   JOIN "customers" ON "sales"."cust_id" = "customers"."cust_id"
   JOIN "times" ON "sales"."time_id" = "times"."time_id"
   WHERE "customers"."country_id" = (
       SELECT "country_id" FROM "countries" WHERE "country_name" = 'United States'
   )
     AND "times"."calendar_year" = 2019
     AND "times"."calendar_quarter_number" = 4
     AND "sales"."promo_id" = 9999  -- Assuming 9999 is 'No Promotion'
   GROUP BY "customers"."cust_city"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get total sales amount per city for Q4 2020 without promotions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customers"."cust_city", SUM("sales"."amount_sold") AS "total_sales"
   FROM "sales"
   JOIN "customers" ON "sales"."cust_id" = "customers"."cust_id"
   JOIN "times" ON "sales"."time_id" = "times"."time_id"
   WHERE "customers"."country_id" = (
       SELECT "country_id" FROM "countries" WHERE "country_name" = 'United States'
   )
     AND "times"."calendar_year" = 2020
     AND "times"."calendar_quarter_number" = 4
     AND "sales"."promo_id" = 9999  -- Assuming 9999 is 'No Promotion'
   GROUP BY "customers"."cust_city"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate sales growth percentage per city from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       "city_sales_2020"."cust_city",
       "city_sales_2019"."total_sales_2019",
       "city_sales_2020"."total_sales_2020",
       (("city_sales_2020"."total_sales_2020" - "city_sales_2019"."total_sales_2019") / "city_sales_2019"."total_sales_2019") * 100 AS "sales_growth_percent"
   FROM (

    GROUP BY "products"."prod_name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Compute the difference in sales share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020 for each top product:**
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        "product_sales"."prod_name",
        ("product_sales"."sales_2019" / "total_sales_2019") AS "share_2019",

        (("product_sales"."sales_2020" / "total_sales_2020") - ("product_sales"."sales_2019" / "total_sales_2019")) AS "share_change"
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            "products"."prod_name",
            SUM(CASE WHEN "times"."calendar_year" = 2019 THEN "sales"."amount_sold" ELSE 0 END) AS "sales_2019",
            SUM(CASE WHEN "times"."calendar_year" = 2020 THEN "sales"."amount_sold" ELSE 0 END) AS "sales_2020"
        FROM "sales"

          AND "sales"."promo_id" = 9999
          AND "products"."prod_name" IN (/* list of top 20% products */)
        GROUP BY "products"."prod_name"
    ) AS "product_sales",
    (
        SELECT 
            SUM(CASE WHEN "times"."calendar_year" = 2019 THEN "sales"."amount_sold" ELSE 0 END) AS "total_sales_2019",
            SUM(CASE WHEN "times"."calendar_year" = 2020 THEN "sales"."amount_sold" ELSE 0 END) AS "total_sales_2020"

          AND "sales"."promo_id" = 9999
    ) AS "total_sales"
    ORDER BY "share_change" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Retrieve distinct product names to check for the list of products sold:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "prod_name"
    FROM "products"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List all promotion names to verify how 'No Promotion' is represented:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "promo_name"
    FROM "promotions"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Check if any sales records have a null promo_id (if possible):**
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "sales"
    WHERE "promo_id" IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Note:** In the above queries, we have assumed that the `promo_id` for non-promotional sales is known (e.g., 9999). If there's a specific `promo_id` representing 'No Promotion', it should be identified from the data using queries like Query 5 and Query 14.

These queries help in understanding the data and in building up to the final solution required by the task.Query:

Task: In the United States, for Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, first select only those cities where total sales (with no promotions) rose by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020. Among these cities, rank products by their overall sales (still excluding promotions) in those quarters and take the top 20%. Then compute each top product’s share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 and calculate the difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020, returning the results in descending order of that share change.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name,Share_2019,Share_2020,Share_Change
product1:str,share2019:float,share2020:float,share_change:float
product2:str,share2019:float,share2020:float,share_change:float
...
(Attention: answer includes top 20% of products, sorted in descending order of share change)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['countries', 'customers', 'promotions', 'products', 'times', 'channels', 'sales', 'costs', 'supplementary_demographics', 'currency']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 05:34:43 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing In the United States, for Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, first select only those cities where total sales (with no promotions) rose by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020. Among these cities, rank products by their overall sales (still excluding promotions) in those quarters and take the top 20%. Then compute each top product’s share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 and calculate the difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020, returning the results in descending order of that share change., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product_Name,Share_2019,Share_2020,Share_Change
product1:str,share2019:float,share2020:float,share_change:float
product2:str,share2019:float,share2020:float,share_change:float
...
(Attention: answer includes top 20% of products, sorted in descending order of share change)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
