**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **sales**
  - `"prod_id"`: Links sales to products.
  - `"cust_id"`: Links sales to customers.
  - `"time_id"`: Links sales to times.
  - `"promo_id"`: Used to filter out sales with promotions (we need sales with no promotions).
  - `"quantity_sold"`: Used to calculate total quantities sold.
  - `"amount_sold"`: Used to calculate total sales amount.

- **customers**
  - `"cust_id"`: Links customers to sales.
  - `"cust_city"`: Used to group sales by city.
  - `"country_id"`: Links customers to countries.

- **countries**
  - `"country_id"`: Links countries to customers.
  - `"country_name"`: Used to filter for 'United States'.

- **times**
  - `"time_id"`: Links times to sales.
  - `"calendar_year"`: Used to filter for years 2019 and 2020.
  - `"calendar_quarter_number"`: Used to filter for Q4 (quarter 4).

- **products**
  - `"prod_id"`: Links products to sales.
  - `"prod_name"`: Used to identify products by name.

- **promotions**
  - `"promo_id"`: Links promotions to sales.
  - `"promo_name"`: Used to identify promotions.
  - `"promo_category"`: Potentially used to distinguish promotions from non-promotions.

**Possible Conditions:**

- `"country_name" = 'United States'`: To filter sales in the United States.
- `"calendar_year" IN (2019, 2020)`: To select years 2019 and 2020.
- `"calendar_quarter_number" = 4`: To select Q4.
- Sales with no promotions: Need to determine how to identify these records, possibly where `"promo_id"` corresponds to a 'No Promotion' entry.

Task: In the United States, for Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, first select only those cities where total sales (with no promotions) rose by at least 20% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020. Among these cities, rank products by their overall sales (still excluding promotions) in those quarters and take the top 20%. Then compute each top product’s share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 and calculate the difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020, returning the results in descending order of that share change.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name,Share_2019,Share_2020,Share_Change
product1:str,share2019:float,share2020:float,share_change:float
product2:str,share2019:float,share2020:float,share_change:float
...
(Attention: answer includes top 20% of products, sorted in descending order of share change)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['countries', 'customers', 'promotions', 'products', 'times', 'channels', 'sales', 'costs', 'supplementary_demographics', 'currency']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
