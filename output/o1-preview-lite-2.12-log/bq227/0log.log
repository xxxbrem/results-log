Task: Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Theft From Motor Vehicle (%),Other Theft (%),Common Assault (%),Burglary in a Dwelling (%),Criminal Damage to Motor Vehicle (%)
2008,15.00,14.00,13.00,12.00,11.00
2009,14.74,14.21,13.16,12.11,10.53
2010,14.44,14.44,13.33,12.22,10.00
2011,13.04,13.59,12.50,11.41,9.24
2012,12.64,13.19,12.09,10.99,8.79
```

The table above displays the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes. Each percentage represents the proportion of a specific minor crime category relative to the total number of crimes recorded in that year. All percentages are rounded to two decimal places, and each year is presented in a separate row for clarity..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'london_crime': ['crime_by_lsoa'], 'london_fire_brigade': ['fire_brigade_service_calls']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 09:14:00 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Theft From Motor Vehicle (%),Other Theft (%),Common Assault (%),Burglary in a Dwelling (%),Criminal Damage to Motor Vehicle (%)
2008,15.00,14.00,13.00,12.00,11.00
2009,14.74,14.21,13.16,12.11,10.53
2010,14.44,14.44,13.33,12.22,10.00
2011,13.04,13.59,12.50,11.41,9.24
2012,12.64,13.19,12.09,10.99,8.79
```

The table above displays the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes. Each percentage represents the proportion of a specific minor crime category relative to the total number of crimes recorded in that year. All percentages are rounded to two decimal places, and each year is presented in a separate row for clarity. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-23 09:15:15 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Theft From Motor Vehicle (%),Other Theft (%),Common Assault (%),Burglary in a Dwelling (%),Criminal Damage to Motor Vehicle (%)
2008,15.00,14.00,13.00,12.00,11.00
2009,14.74,14.21,13.16,12.11,10.53
2010,14.44,14.44,13.33,12.22,10.00

2012,12.64,13.19,12.09,10.99,8.79
```

The table above displays the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes. Each percentage represents the proportion of a specific minor crime category relative to the total number of crimes recorded in that year. All percentages are rounded to two decimal places, and each year is presented in a separate row for clarity. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
