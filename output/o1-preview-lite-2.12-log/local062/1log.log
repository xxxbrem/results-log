Task: Please group all Italian customers into ten buckets for December 2021 by summing their profits from all products purchased (where profit is calculated as quantity_sold multiplied by the difference between unit_price and unit_cost), then divide the overall range of total monthly profits into ten equal intervals. For each bucket, provide the number of customers, and identify the minimum and maximum total profits within that bucket.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To group all Italian customers into ten buckets for December 2021, we first calculate the total profit for each customer by summing up their profits from all products purchased during that month. Profit for each sale is computed as `quantity_sold` multiplied by `(unit_price - unit_cost)`. We then divide the overall range of total monthly profits into ten equal intervals (buckets). For each bucket, we provide the number of customers, and identify the minimum and maximum total profits within that bucket.

```csv
Bucket_Number,Number_of_Customers,Min_Total_Profit,Max_Total_Profit
1,num1:int,min1:float,max1:float
2,num2:int,min2:float,max2:float

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['countries', 'customers', 'promotions', 'products', 'times', 'channels', 'sales', 'costs', 'supplementary_demographics', 'currency']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
