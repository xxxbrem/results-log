This query addresses the issue by:

- **Filtering out products** associated with `page_id` in (1, 2, 12, 13) using the `filtered_products` CTE.
- **Counting Views and Adds to Cart** only when the `page_id` is **not** in (1, 2, 12, 13), as specified.
- **Including all Purchase events** for the filtered products, without excluding any `page_id`s, ensuring that the "Actual_Purchases" column reflects the correct counts.
- **Calculating Left in Cart** by subtracting the number of purchases from the number of times the product was added to the cart (for the specified `page_id`s).

This approach ensures that you get non-zero counts in the "Actual_Purchases" column and that all counts accurately reflect the data, fulfilling the task requirements.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **shopping_cart_events**

   - **"event_type"**: Indicates the type of event (e.g., view, add to cart, purchase). This is crucial for categorizing the actions taken on products.
   - **"page_id"**: Identifies the page associated with the event. Used to link events to specific products via the page hierarchy and to filter out specified page IDs `(1, 2, 12, 13)`.
   - **"event_time"**: Timestamp when the event occurred. Useful for chronological analysis.
   - **"visit_id"** and **"cookie_id"**: Can be used to track user sessions and distinguish unique users.

2. **shopping_cart_page_hierarchy**

   - **"page_id"**: Links to the events in **shopping_cart_events**. Essential for identifying which events relate to which products.
   - **"product_id"**: Unique identifier for each product. Used to aggregate event data per product.
   - **"page_name"** and **"product_category"**: Provide descriptive information about the product, which can enhance the reporting.

3. **shopping_cart_event_identifier**

   - **"event_type"**: Used to map the numeric event type codes to meaningful event names.
   - **"event_name"**: Describes the event type (e.g., 'view', 'add_to_cart', 'purchase'). Critical for interpreting event actions.

**Conditions to be Used:**

- **Exclude products with `page_id` in (1, 2, 12, 13):** This filters out specific products from the analysis as per the task requirements.
- **Event Types Filtering:** Differentiate between 'view', 'add_to_cart', 'purchase', etc., based on the **"event_name"**.

**SQLite SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve all distinct event types and their corresponding names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "event_type", "event_name"
   FROM "shopping_cart_event_identifier"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all unique product IDs and their associated page IDs, excluding specified page IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id", "page_id"
   FROM "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy"
   WHERE "page_id" NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count the number of each event type in the events table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "event_type", COUNT(*) AS "count"
   FROM "shopping_cart_events"
   GROUP BY "event_type"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List events with their event types and timestamps:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "event_type", "event_time"
   FROM "shopping_cart_events"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get the number of events per page ID, excluding specified page IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "page_id", COUNT(*) AS "event_count"
   FROM "shopping_cart_events"
   WHERE "page_id" NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
   GROUP BY "page_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find event counts per product ID, linking events to products:**

   ```sql
   SELECT h."product_id", COUNT(*) AS "event_count"
   FROM "shopping_cart_events" e
   JOIN "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy" h ON e."page_id" = h."page_id"
   WHERE e."page_id" NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
   GROUP BY h."product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get counts of each event type per product, excluding specified page IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT h."product_id", e."event_type", COUNT(*) AS "event_count"
   FROM "shopping_cart_events" e
   JOIN "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy" h ON e."page_id" = h."page_id"
   WHERE e."page_id" NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
   GROUP BY h."product_id", e."event_type"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Associate event names with products and count occurrences:**

   ```sql
   SELECT h."product_id", ei."event_name", COUNT(*) AS "event_count"
   FROM "shopping_cart_events" e
   JOIN "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy" h ON e."page_id" = h."page_id"
   JOIN "shopping_cart_event_identifier" ei ON e."event_type" = ei."event_type"
   WHERE e."page_id" NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
   GROUP BY h."product_id", ei."event_name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List products that have been viewed, excluding specified page IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT h."product_id"
   FROM "shopping_cart_events" e
   JOIN "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy" h ON e."page_id" = h."page_id"
   JOIN "shopping_cart_event_identifier" ei ON e."event_type" = ei."event_type"
   WHERE ei."event_name" = 'view' AND e."page_id" NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate the number of purchases per product:**

    ```sql
    SELECT h."product_id", COUNT(*) AS "purchase_count"
    FROM "shopping_cart_events" e
    JOIN "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy" h ON e."page_id" = h."page_id"
    JOIN "shopping_cart_event_identifier" ei ON e."event_type" = ei."event_type"
    WHERE ei."event_name" = 'purchase' AND e."page_id" NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
    GROUP BY h."product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Identify products left in the cart without purchase by users:**

    ```sql
    SELECT h."product_id", COUNT(DISTINCT e."cookie_id") AS "left_in_cart_count"
    FROM "shopping_cart_events" e
    JOIN "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy" h ON e."page_id" = h."page_id"
    JOIN "shopping_cart_event_identifier" ei ON e."event_type" = ei."event_type"
    WHERE ei."event_name" = 'add_to_cart' AND e."page_id" NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
      AND e."cookie_id" NOT IN (
          SELECT DISTINCT e2."cookie_id"
          FROM "shopping_cart_events" e2
          JOIN "shopping_cart_event_identifier" ei2 ON e2."event_type" = ei2."event_type"
          WHERE ei2."event_name" = 'purchase' AND e2."cookie_id" = e."cookie_id" AND e2."page_id" = e."page_id"
      )
    GROUP BY h."product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Retrieve product details including names and categories:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT h."product_id", h."product_category", h."page_name"
    FROM "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy" h
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Count the total number of views for each product:**

    ```sql
    SELECT h."product_id", COUNT(*) AS "views"
    FROM "shopping_cart_events" e
    JOIN "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy" h ON e."page_id" = h."page_id"
    JOIN "shopping_cart_event_identifier" ei ON e."event_type" = ei."event_type"
    WHERE ei."event_name" = 'view' AND e."page_id" NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
    GROUP BY h."product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Count the number of times each product was added to the cart:**

    ```sql
    SELECT h."product_id", COUNT(*) AS "adds_to_cart"
    FROM "shopping_cart_events" e
    JOIN "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy" h ON e."page_id" = h."page_id"
    JOIN "shopping_cart_event_identifier" ei ON e."event_type" = ei."event_type"
    WHERE ei."event_name" = 'add_to_cart' AND e."page_id" NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
    GROUP BY h."product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Combine views, adds to cart, and purchases in one query per product:**

    ```sql
    SELECT h."product_id",
           SUM(CASE WHEN ei."event_name" = 'view' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "views",
           SUM(CASE WHEN ei."event_name" = 'add_to_cart' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "adds_to_cart",
           SUM(CASE WHEN ei."event_name" = 'purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "actual_purchases"
    FROM "shopping_cart_events" e
    JOIN "shopping_cart_page_hierarchy" h ON e."page_id" = h."page_id"
    JOIN "shopping_cart_event_identifier" ei ON e."event_type" = ei."event_type"
    WHERE e."page_id" NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
    GROUP BY h."product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the necessary data to address the task requirements. By examining event types and their associations with products (excluding specified page IDs), we can calculate the number of views, adds to cart, products left in the cart without purchase, and actual purchases for each product.Query:

Task: Can you provide a breakdown of how many times each product was viewed, how many times they were added to the shopping cart, and how many times they were left in the cart without being purchased? Also, give me the count of actual purchases for each product. Ensure that products with a page id in (1, 2, 12, 13) are filtered out.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_ID,Product_Name,Views,Adds_to_Cart,Left_in_Cart,Actual_Purchases
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,views1:int,adds_to_cart1:int,left_in_cart1:int,actual_purchases1:int
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,views2:int,adds_to_cart2:int,left_in_cart2:int,actual_purchases2:int
...
```

This table provides a breakdown for each product (excluding those with page_id in (1, 2, 12, 13)). It shows the number of times each product was viewed, how many times they were added to the shopping cart, how many times they were left in the cart without being purchased, and the count of actual purchases for each product..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 17:51:44 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide a breakdown of how many times each product was viewed, how many times they were added to the shopping cart, and how many times they were left in the cart without being purchased? Also, give me the count of actual purchases for each product. Ensure that products with a page id in (1, 2, 12, 13) are filtered out., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product_ID,Product_Name,Views,Adds_to_Cart,Left_in_Cart,Actual_Purchases
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,views1:int,adds_to_cart1:int,left_in_cart1:int,actual_purchases1:int
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,views2:int,adds_to_cart2:int,left_in_cart2:int,actual_purchases2:int

```

This table provides a breakdown for each product (excluding those with page_id in (1, 2, 12, 13)). It shows the number of times each product was viewed, how many times they were added to the shopping cart, how many times they were left in the cart without being purchased, and the count of actual purchases for each product. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-23 17:54:38 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide a breakdown of how many times each product was viewed, how many times they were added to the shopping cart, and how many times they were left in the cart without being purchased? Also, give me the count of actual purchases for each product. Ensure that products with a page id in (1, 2, 12, 13) are filtered out., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product_ID,Product_Name,Views,Adds_to_Cart,Left_in_Cart,Actual_Purchases
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,views1:int,adds_to_cart1:int,left_in_cart1:int,actual_purchases1:int
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,views2:int,adds_to_cart2:int,left_in_cart2:int,actual_purchases2:int
...
```

This table provides a breakdown for each product (excluding those with page_id in (1, 2, 12, 13)). It shows the number of times each product was viewed, how many times they were added to the shopping cart, how many times they were left in the cart without being purchased, and the count of actual purchases for each product. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
