2result.sql
```

The SQL query in `2result.sql` is the correct one for the task because it correctly identifies the top-performing traffic source based on the total product revenue during the first half of 2017 and accurately computes the maximum daily, weekly, and monthly product revenues (in millions) for that source.

Here's why `2result.sql` is the appropriate choice:

1. **Accurate Revenue Calculations:**
   - The query calculates the total product revenue per traffic source by summing the `product.productRevenue` divided by `1e6` to convert the micros to millions, which is appropriate since revenue is stored in micros.
   - It ensures that only non-null `product.productRevenue` values are considered by including `product.productRevenue IS NOT NULL` in the `WHERE` clause.

2. **Correct Identification of the Top Traffic Source:**
   - It identifies the traffic source with the highest total product revenue by ordering the results in descending order and limiting the output to the top one (`LIMIT 1`).

3. **Accurate Computation of Maximum Revenues:**
   - The query calculates daily, weekly, and monthly revenues for all traffic sources and then filters to find the maximum values specifically for the top-performing source.
   - It uses appropriate date formatting functions (`FORMAT_DATE` with `%Y-%m` for months and `%Y-%V` for weeks) to group data into correct timeframes.
   - The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) like `max_daily`, `max_weekly`, and `max_monthly` helps in isolating the maximum revenue computations for clarity.

4. **Consistent Results With Expected Values:**
   - The results show that the `(direct)` traffic source generated the highest total product revenue of approximately **581,583.0783 million**.
   - The maximum daily, weekly, and monthly revenues are consistent with the sums calculated for the top source during the specified period:
     - **Maximum Daily Revenue:** 21,148.43 million
     - **Maximum Weekly Revenue:** 36,474.2699 million
     - **Maximum Monthly Revenue:** 99,301.4398 million

5. **Avoidance of Calculation Errors:**
   - Unlike `1result.sql`, which divides by `1e12` and results in significantly lower and incorrect revenue figures (e.g., total revenue of approximately 0.5816 million), `2result.sql` correctly uses `1e6` for conversion.

6. **Methodical Approach:**
   - The query's structure is logical and methodical, making it easier to understand and verify each step of the computation.
   - It first gathers the necessary data, performs calculations, and finally presents the required maximum values.

In comparison, while `0result.sql` also provides similar results, `2result.sql` demonstrates a clearer and more precise approach, especially in handling date formats for weekly grouping (using `%Y-%V` for ISO weeks). This likely contributes to the slight differences in the maximum weekly revenue figures, with `2result.sql` providing a more accurate value.

Therefore, `2result.sql` is the correct SQL script that fulfills the requirements of the task effectively.
