Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure, to address your task, let's first consider which tables and columns are relevant and how they can be used:

**Tables and Columns:**

1. **player**
   - `"player"."player_id"`: Unique identifier for each player.
   - `"player"."player_name"`: Name of the player.
   - `"player"."batting_hand"`: Batting hand of the player.
   - `"player"."bowling_skill"`: Bowling skill of the player.

2. **player_match**
   - `"player_match"."player_id"`: Foreign key linking to `player`.
   - `"player_match"."match_id"`: Identifier for matches.
   - `"player_match"."role"`: Role of the player in each match.

3. **ball_by_ball**
   - `"ball_by_ball"."match_id"`: Identifier for matches.
   - `"ball_by_ball"."over_id"`, `"ball_by_ball"."ball_id"`, `"ball_by_ball"."innings_no"`: To uniquely identify each ball.
   - `"ball_by_ball"."striker"`: Player on strike (batsman).
   - `"ball_by_ball"."bowler"`: Player who bowled the ball.

4. **batsman_scored**
   - `"batsman_scored"."match_id"`, `"over_id"`, `"ball_id"`, `"innings_no"`: To join with `ball_by_ball`.
   - `"batsman_scored"."runs_scored"`: Runs scored on each ball.

5. **wicket_taken**
   - `"wicket_taken"."match_id"`, `"over_id"`, `"ball_id"`, `"innings_no"`: To join with `ball_by_ball`.
   - `"wicket_taken"."player_out"`: Player dismissed.
   - `"wicket_taken"."kind_out"`: Method of dismissal.

**Conditions and Usage:**

- **Joining Tables:** Use `match_id`, `over_id`, `ball_id`, and `innings_no` to join `ball_by_ball`, `batsman_scored`, and `wicket_taken`.
- **Filtering by Player:** Use `"player_id"` to filter statistics for each player.
- **Aggregations:**
  - **Total Runs Scored:** Sum `runs_scored` per player.
  - **Total Matches Played:** Count distinct `match_id` per player.
  - **Total Dismissals:** Count occurrences in `wicket_taken` where `player_out` matches the player.
- **Grouping Data:** Group by `"player_id"` and `"match_id"` to calculate per-match statistics.
- **Calculating Averages and Rates:** Use sums and counts to calculate batting averages, strike rates, and economy rates.

**Sample SQL Queries:**

Below are 10 different SQL queries to explore the data:

```sql
-- 1. Select the first 100 player IDs and names
SELECT "player_id", "player_name" FROM "player" LIMIT 100;

-- 2. Select distinct batting hands used by players
SELECT DISTINCT "batting_hand" FROM "player" LIMIT 100;

-- 3. Select distinct bowling skills of players
SELECT DISTINCT "bowling_skill" FROM "player" LIMIT 100;

-- 4. List all roles players have played across matches
SELECT DISTINCT "role" FROM "player_match" LIMIT 100;

-- 5. Count total matches played by each player (first 100 players)
SELECT "player_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "match_id") AS "matches_played"
FROM "player_match"
GROUP BY "player_id"
LIMIT 100;

-- 6. List runs scored on each ball (first 100 records)
SELECT "match_id", "over_id", "ball_id", "innings_no", "runs_scored"
FROM "batsman_scored"
LIMIT 100;

-- 7. Get the players who have been dismissed (first 100 players)
SELECT DISTINCT "player_out" FROM "wicket_taken" LIMIT 100;

-- 8. Find total runs scored by each batsman (first 100 batsmen)
SELECT b."striker", SUM(s."runs_scored") AS "total_runs"
FROM "ball_by_ball" AS b
JOIN "batsman_scored" AS s
  ON b."match_id" = s."match_id"
 AND b."over_id" = s."over_id"
 AND b."ball_id" = s."ball_id"
 AND b."innings_no" = s."innings_no"
GROUP BY b."striker"
LIMIT 100;

-- 9. Total wickets taken by each bowler (first 100 bowlers)
SELECT b."bowler", COUNT(*) AS "wickets_taken"
FROM "ball_by_ball" AS b
JOIN "wicket_taken" AS w
  ON b."match_id" = w."match_id"
 AND b."over_id" = w."over_id"
 AND b."ball_id" = w."ball_id"
 AND b."innings_no" = w."innings_no"
GROUP BY b."bowler"
LIMIT 100;

-- 10. List player roles and their frequencies (first 100 records)
SELECT "player_id", "role", COUNT(*) AS "role_frequency"
FROM "player_match"
GROUP BY "player_id", "role"
LIMIT 100;
```

These queries help in understanding the distribution and values in the relevant columns:

- **Query 1-3:** Basic information about players, their batting hands, and bowling skills.
- **Query 4:** Different roles players have played.
- **Query 5:** Number of matches played by each player.
- **Query 6:** Details of runs scored on each delivery.
- **Query 7:** List of players who have been dismissed.
- **Query 8:** Total runs scored by each batsman.
- **Query 9:** Total wickets taken by each bowler.
- **Query 10:** Frequency of roles played by players.

These queries lay the foundation for constructing more complex queries needed to fulfill the original task.Query:

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: For each player, list their ID, name, most frequent role across all matches, batting hand, bowling skill, total runs scored, total matches played, total dismissals, batting average, highest score in a single match, number of matches where their score exceeded 30, 50, and 100, total balls faced in their career, strike rate, total wickets taken, economy rate, and their best performance in a single match (most wickets taken, in the format "wickets taken-runs given"). Ignore the extra runs data.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
player_id,player_name,most_frequent_role,batting_hand,bowling_skill,total_runs_scored,total_matches_played,total_dismissals,batting_average,highest_score_in_single_match,number_of_matches_scored_over_30,number_of_matches_scored_over_50,number_of_matches_scored_over_100,total_balls_faced,strike_rate,total_wickets_taken,economy_rate,best_bowling_performance

In this table, each row represents a player with their statistical performance across all matches. The columns include identifiers, personal attributes, batting and bowling statistics, and career highlights, formatted according to the specified data types..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
