After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer for the following reasons:

- **Year Alignment with the Task:** The task requires comparing EPA PM2.5 measurements from **1990** with OpenAQ measurements from **2020**. Among the three queries, only `1result.sql` uses the EPA data from **1990** by querying the `air_quality_annual_summary` table with `year = 1990`.

- **Correct EPA Table Selection:** The `pm25_frm_daily_summary` table used in `0result.sql` and `2result.sql` does not contain data for the year 1990 (it starts from 1997). `1result.sql` correctly uses the `air_quality_annual_summary` table, which includes data from 1990.

- **Matching Parameters:** `1result.sql` filters the EPA data using `parameter_name = 'Acceptable PM2.5 AQI & Speciation Mass'` and `units_of_measure = 'Micrograms/cubic meter (LC)'`, as specified in the task.

- **Matching Methodology:** The query matches the EPA and OpenAQ datasets by rounding their latitude and longitude to two decimals, as required.

- **Calculating Difference in the Correct Direction:** The query calculates the difference as `epa_data.avg_pm25_1990 - openaq_data.avg_pm25_2020`, which aligns with finding locations where PM2.5 levels have decreased from 1990 to 2020.

- **Results Interpretation:** The results show the top three cities with the largest decrease in PM2.5 levels between 1990 and 2020, which matches the task's requirement for ordering differences from greatest to least.
