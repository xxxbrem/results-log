Task: Which three cities have the largest difference between their 1990 EPA PM2.5 measurements (using units_of_measure = 'Micrograms/cubic meter (LC)' and parameter_name = 'Acceptable PM2.5 AQI & Speciation Mass') and their 2020 OpenAQ PM2.5 measurements (where pollutant = 'pm25' based on the year extracted from the timestamp), with both datasets matched by latitude and longitude rounded to two decimals, and the difference ordered from greatest to least?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
City,PM2.5_Difference
city1:str,difference1:float > 0
city2:str,difference2:float > 0
city3:str,difference3:float > 0
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

**Explanation:**

We identified the three cities with the largest differences between their average PM2.5 measurements from 1990 (EPA data) and 2020 (OpenAQ data). In the EPA dataset, we considered records where `units_of_measure` is 'Micrograms/cubic meter (LC)' and `parameter_name` is 'Acceptable PM2.5 AQI & Speciation Mass'. For the OpenAQ dataset, we used records where `pollutant` is 'pm25' and extracted the data for the year 2020 based on the `timestamp`. We matched the datasets by rounding the latitude and longitude to two decimals to align measurements from the same locations. The PM2.5 differences were calculated by subtracting the 1990 measurements from the 2020 measurements, and we ordered the results from greatest to least to determine the top three cities with the largest increases in PM2.5 levels..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'epa_historical_air_quality': ['pressure_daily_summary', 'no2_hourly_summary', 'lead_daily_summary', 'pressure_hourly_summary', 'pm10_daily_summary', 'pm25_frm_hourly_summary', 'voc_daily_summary', 'co_hourly_summary', 'nonoxnoy_hourly_summary', 'temperature_daily_summary', 'o3_hourly_summary', 'no2_daily_summary', 'air_quality_annual_summary', 'so2_daily_summary', 'o3_daily_summary', 'so2_hourly_summary', 'pm25_speciation_daily_summary', 'wind_daily_summary', 'pm25_nonfrm_hourly_summary', 'rh_and_dp_daily_summary', 'pm10_hourly_summary', 'voc_hourly_summary', 'hap_daily_summary', 'pm25_speciation_hourly_summary', 'co_daily_summary', 'pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary', 'temperature_hourly_summary', 'wind_hourly_summary', 'nonoxnoy_daily_summary', 'hap_hourly_summary', 'rh_and_dp_hourly_summary', 'pm25_frm_daily_summary'], 'openaq': ['global_air_quality']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
