**Explanation:**

This SQL query calculates the three years where the sum of:

- The highest total points earned by any driver in that year.
- The highest total points earned by any constructor in that year.

is the smallest.

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate Total Points for Each Driver per Year:**
   - Join the `"results"` and `"races"` tables on `"race_id"`.
   - Group by `"year"` and `"driver_id"`.
   - Sum the `"points"` for each driver per year.

2. **Identify the Maximum Driver Points per Year:**
   - From the driver totals, select the maximum `"total_points"` per `"year"`.

3. **Calculate Total Points for Each Constructor per Year:**
   - Similar to drivers, but group by `"year"` and `"constructor_id"`.

4. **Identify the Maximum Constructor Points per Year:**
   - From the constructor totals, select the maximum `"total_points"` per `"year"`.

5. **Combine the Maximum Driver and Constructor Points per Year:**
   - Join the maximum driver points and maximum constructor points on `"year"`.
   - Sum the maximum driver points and maximum constructor points to get `"total_points"` for each year.

6. **Order the Years by Total Points Ascending and Limit to 3:**
   - Order the results by `"total_points"` in ascending order.
   - Limit the output to the top three years with the smallest total points.

**Result:**

This query will output:

- The three years with the smallest combined total of the highest driver and constructor points.
- The years will be ordered by ascending `"total_points"`.

```

**Explanation:**

The error occurred because the placeholder `:specific_year` was not supplied with a value when executing the query. To fix this error, replace `:specific_year` with the actual year you want to query. For example, to get the drivers' total points for the year **1966**, you replace `:specific_year` with `1966`.

**Note:** If you want to query a different year, simply replace `1966` with the desired year in the SQL statement.

-- Corrected SQL Queries with Similar Errors:

-- Query 9: Verify the total points for drivers and constructors in a specific year (previously had placeholder [YEAR_FOUND] leading to errors):

SELECT "r"."year", "res"."driver_id", "res"."constructor_id", SUM("res"."points") AS "total_points"
FROM "results" AS "res"
JOIN "races" AS "r" ON "res"."race_id" = "r"."race_id"
WHERE "r"."year" = 1966  -- Replace 1966 with the desired year
GROUP BY "res"."driver_id", "res"."constructor_id"
ORDER BY "total_points" DESC

-- Query 10: List all drivers and their total points in a specific year (previously had placeholder [SPECIFIC_YEAR] leading to errors):

SELECT "r"."year", "res"."driver_id", SUM("res"."points") AS "total_points"
FROM "results" AS "res"
JOIN "races" AS "r" ON "res"."race_id" = "r"."race_id"
WHERE "r"."year" = 1966  -- Replace 1966 with the desired year
GROUP BY "res"."driver_id"
ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

I have identified SQL queries from earlier that used placeholders like `[YEAR_FOUND]` and `[SPECIFIC_YEAR]` which can cause errors if not replaced or properly supplied when executing the queries. To correct these and prevent errors like `'NoneType' object is not iterable` or `no such column`, I have:

- Replaced the placeholders with actual values or comments indicating where to insert the desired year.
- Ensured that the corrected queries are syntactically valid and can be executed without errors.

**Notes:**

- **For Query 9 and Query 10:** Replace `1966` with the specific year you wish to analyze. Ensure that you provide an integer value corresponding to a year present in your data.

- **Avoiding Placeholders in SQL Statements:** When writing SQL queries, using placeholders like `[YEAR_FOUND]` without proper parameter binding can lead to errors. It's best to replace them with actual values or use parametrized queries if your database API supports it.

---

**Additional Correction:**

- **In earlier SQL queries, ensure that all placeholders are replaced or properly handled.**

For example, if you have any other queries such as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "table_name" WHERE "column_name" = [VALUE];
```

Correct it by specifying the actual value or indicating where to replace:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "table_name" WHERE "column_name" = 'desired_value';  -- Replace 'desired_value' with actual value
```

---

By making these corrections, the SQL queries should execute without the errors you encountered.

WHERE "r"."year" = 1966  -- Replace 1966 with the desired year
GROUP BY "res"."driver_id"
ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

The error message "You can only execute one statement at a time" occurs because multiple SQL statements were included in a single code block, which some SQL execution environments (like SQLite) do not support.

To correct this, I've separated each SQL query into its own code block and ensured that each block contains only one SQL statement. This should allow you to execute each query individually without encountering the error.

**Notes:**

- **Replace `1966` with the desired year** you wish to analyze in both queries.
- Ensure that when executing the queries, you run one code block (one query) at a time.
- Comments starting with `--` are acceptable and do not count as statements.

2025-02-10 16:32:45 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering an error because you're attempting to execute a SQL statement that contains only a comment:

```sql
-- There are no additional SQL queries to correct.
```

**Error Explanation:**

- **Error Message:** `'NoneType' object is not iterable`
- **Cause:** When you execute a SQL script that contains only comments or is empty, the SQL engine receives no executable statements. This can lead to errors like `'NoneType' object is not iterable` because it expects a valid SQL statement to parse and execute.

**Solution:**

- **Do Not Execute Comments Alone:** Comments starting with `--` are for human readability and are ignored by the SQL engine during execution.
- **Ensure Valid SQL Statements:** Only execute SQL queries that contain valid SQL commands.

**Next Steps:**

Since there are no additional SQL queries to correct, there's no action needed at this time. If you have any other SQL queries that are causing errors or need assistance with, please provide them, and I'll be happy to help correct them.

**Example of Proper SQL Execution:**

If you want to execute a valid SQL statement, ensure it's not just a comment. For instance:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "results" LIMIT 10;
```

**Summary:**

- **Avoid Executing Comments Alone:** Do not attempt to execute code blocks that contain only comments.
- **Provide SQL Queries for Correction:** If you have other SQL queries that need correction, please share them.
- **Assistance Offered:** I'm here to help with any SQL-related questions or issues you might have.

-- No additional SQL queries to correct.
-- Including a harmless SQL statement to prevent execution errors.
SELECT 'No additional SQL queries to correct.' AS message;
```

**Explanation:**

The error message `'NoneType' object is not iterable` occurs because executing a SQL code block that contains **only comments** can cause issues in some SQL environments or tools. These environments may expect at least one valid SQL statement to execute, and when none is provided, they encounter a `NoneType` where they expect an iterable result set, leading to the error.

To prevent this error and adhere to your request to "answer in ```sql``` format," I've included a harmless SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT 'No additional SQL queries to correct.' AS message;
```

This statement does the following:

- **Selects a constant string:** It returns the message `'No additional SQL queries to correct.'` as a result set.
- **Prevents execution errors:** By providing a valid SQL statement, we ensure that the SQL executor has something to execute, thus avoiding the `'NoneType' object is not iterable` error.
- **Communicates the necessary information:** The result set clearly indicates that there are no additional SQL queries to correct.

**Usage:**

- **Execute the provided SQL statement:** Running this statement in your SQL environment should display a single-row result with the message.
- **No impact on data:** Since it's a simple `SELECT` statement without any data modification, it won't affect your database.

**Example Output:**

When you execute the statement, you should see:

| message                                |
|----------------------------------------|
| No additional SQL queries to correct.  |

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"results"`
  - **Column:** `"race_id"`: Used to join with the `"races"` table to get the year of the race.
  - **Column:** `"driver_id"`: Used to identify drivers and sum their points per year.
  - **Column:** `"constructor_id"`: Used to identify constructors and sum their points per year.
  - **Column:** `"points"`: The points earned by a driver and constructor in a particular race.
  
- **Table:** `"races"`
  - **Column:** `"race_id"`: Used to join with the `"results"` table.
  - **Column:** `"year"`: Used to group the results by year.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Join `"results"` and `"races"` tables on `"race_id"` to associate each result with a year.
- Group data by `"year"` to calculate annual totals.
- Sum `"points"` for each `"driver_id"` and `"constructor_id"` per year.
- Identify the driver and constructor with the highest total points in each year.
- Calculate the sum of these highest totals per year.
- Order the years by the combined total points in ascending order.

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **List distinct years available in the `"races"` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM "races"
   ORDER BY "year" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Show sample data from the `"results"` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "results"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List the total points for each driver per year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "r"."year", "res"."driver_id", SUM("res"."points") AS "total_points"
   FROM "results" AS "res"
   JOIN "races" AS "r" ON "res"."race_id" = "r"."race_id"

Task: Using only the data from the ‘results’ table, find the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor in that year (both calculated by summing up points from the ‘results’ table) is smallest, and list those three years in order of ascending total.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Total_Points
year1:int,total_points1:float
year2:int,total_points2:float
year3:int,total_points3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor (both calculated by summing up points from the `results` table) is smallest. The years are ordered in ascending order based on the combined total points..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['circuits', 'constructor_results', 'constructor_standings', 'constructors', 'driver_standings', 'drivers', 'lap_times', 'pit_stops', 'qualifying', 'races', 'results', 'seasons', 'status', 'sprint_results', 'short_grand_prix_names', 'short_constructor_names', 'liveries', 'tdr_overrides', 'circuits_ext', 'constructors_ext', 'drivers_ext', 'driver_standings_ext', 'lap_times_ext', 'lap_time_stats', 'races_ext', 'team_driver_ranks', 'drives', 'retirements', 'lap_positions']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
