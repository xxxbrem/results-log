Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table**: `results`
  - `"race_id"`: Used to join with the `races` table to get the year of each race.
  - `"driver_id"`: Identifier for each driver; used to calculate total points per driver per year.
  - `"constructor_id"`: Identifier for each constructor; used to calculate total points per constructor per year.
  - `"points"`: Points earned by a driver in a race; used to sum points for drivers and constructors.

- **Table**: `races`
  - `"race_id"`: Key to join with the `results` table.
  - `"year"`: The year in which each race took place; used to group points by year.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Joining Tables**: Join `results` and `races` on `"race_id"` to associate each result with its corresponding year.
- **Grouping Data**: Group data by `"year"` and `"driver_id"` or `"constructor_id"` to calculate total points per driver or constructor per year.
- **Calculating Maximums**: Use aggregate functions like `SUM` and `MAX` to find total and highest points.
- **Ordering Results**: Order the combined totals in ascending order to find the years with the smallest sums.
- **Limiting Output**: Use `LIMIT` to retrieve only the top three years with the smallest combined totals.

Task: Using only the data from the ‘results’ table, find the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor in that year (both calculated by summing up points from the ‘results’ table) is smallest, and list those three years in order of ascending total.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Total_Points
year1:int,total_points1:float
year2:int,total_points2:float
year3:int,total_points3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor (both calculated by summing up points from the `results` table) is smallest. The years are ordered in ascending order based on the combined total points..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['circuits', 'constructor_results', 'constructor_standings', 'constructors', 'driver_standings', 'drivers', 'lap_times', 'pit_stops', 'qualifying', 'races', 'results', 'seasons', 'status', 'sprint_results', 'short_grand_prix_names', 'short_constructor_names', 'liveries', 'tdr_overrides', 'circuits_ext', 'constructors_ext', 'drivers_ext', 'driver_standings_ext', 'lap_times_ext', 'lap_time_stats', 'races_ext', 'team_driver_ranks', 'drives', 'retirements', 'lap_positions']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
