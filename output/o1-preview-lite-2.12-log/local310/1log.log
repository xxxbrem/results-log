Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant columns and their potential usage:**

- **race_id**: Used to identify each race. Potentially could be mapped to a year if such mapping exists within the data.
- **driver_id**: Identifies each driver. Used to sum up points per driver.
- **constructor_id**: Identifies each constructor. Used to sum up points per constructor.
- **points**: The number of points earned by a driver or constructor in a race. Used to calculate total points.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Grouping by **driver_id** and **race_id** to get points per driver per race.
- Grouping by **constructor_id** and **race_id** to get points per constructor per race.
- Summing **points** across races to get total points per driver or constructor.
- Attempting to infer **year** from **race_id** if possible (though not directly available).

**SQL Queries:**

```sql
-- 1. List distinct race_ids to see the range of races
SELECT DISTINCT race_id FROM results LIMIT 100;

-- 2. Find the minimum and maximum race_id to understand the spread
SELECT MIN(race_id) AS min_race_id, MAX(race_id) AS max_race_id FROM results;

-- 3. Count the number of results per race to see if they line up with seasons/years
SELECT race_id, COUNT(*) AS result_count FROM results GROUP BY race_id LIMIT 100;

-- 4. Total points earned by each driver
SELECT driver_id, SUM(points) AS total_points FROM results GROUP BY driver_id ORDER BY total_points DESC LIMIT 100;

-- 5. Total points earned by each constructor
SELECT constructor_id, SUM(points) AS total_points FROM results GROUP BY constructor_id ORDER BY total_points DESC LIMIT 100;

-- 6. Total points per driver per race
SELECT race_id, driver_id, SUM(points) AS points_per_race FROM results GROUP BY race_id, driver_id ORDER BY race_id LIMIT 100;

-- 7. Total points per constructor per race
SELECT race_id, constructor_id, SUM(points) AS points_per_race FROM results GROUP BY race_id, constructor_id ORDER BY race_id LIMIT 100;

-- 8. Find the number of races each driver has participated in
SELECT driver_id, COUNT(DISTINCT race_id) AS races_participated FROM results GROUP BY driver_id ORDER BY races_participated DESC LIMIT 100;

-- 9. Sum of points per driver within a specific range of race_ids
SELECT driver_id, SUM(points) AS total_points 
FROM results 
WHERE race_id BETWEEN 1 AND 50 
GROUP BY driver_id 
ORDER BY total_points DESC 
LIMIT 100;

-- 10. Sum of points per constructor within a specific range of race_ids
SELECT constructor_id, SUM(points) AS total_points 
FROM results 
WHERE race_id BETWEEN 1 AND 50 
GROUP BY constructor_id 
ORDER BY total_points DESC 
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

These queries are intended to explore the data within the `results` table to understand how we might approach the task. 

However, **since the `results` table does not contain any information about the year**, we cannot directly associate each `race_id` with a specific year using only this table. The `year` information is necessary to sum points per year for drivers and constructors. Without a way to determine the year for each `race_id`, we can't calculate the total points per driver or constructor per year.

Therefore, **using only the data from the `results` table**, it's **not possible** to perform the task as specified because of the missing `year` information.Query:
-- 1. List distinct race_ids to see the range of races
SELECT DISTINCT race_id FROM results LIMIT 100

Task: Using only the data from the ‘results’ table, find the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor in that year (both calculated by summing up points from the ‘results’ table) is smallest, and list those three years in order of ascending total.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Total_Points
year1:int,total_points1:float
year2:int,total_points2:float
year3:int,total_points3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor (both calculated by summing up points from the `results` table) is smallest. The years are ordered in ascending order based on the combined total points..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['circuits', 'constructor_results', 'constructor_standings', 'constructors', 'driver_standings', 'drivers', 'lap_times', 'pit_stops', 'qualifying', 'races', 'results', 'seasons', 'status', 'sprint_results', 'short_grand_prix_names', 'short_constructor_names', 'liveries', 'tdr_overrides', 'circuits_ext', 'constructors_ext', 'drivers_ext', 'driver_standings_ext', 'lap_times_ext', 'lap_time_stats', 'races_ext', 'team_driver_ranks', 'drives', 'retirements', 'lap_positions']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the three years in which the sum of the highest total points earned by any driver and the highest total points earned by any constructor (both calculated by summing up points from the `results` table) is smallest. The years are ordered in ascending order based on the combined total points.
