## ST_DWITHIN

Returns TRUE if the minimum geodesic distance between two points (two GEOGRAPHY objects) is within the specified distance. Otherwise, returns FALSE.
If the parameters are GEOGRAPHY values that are not points (e.g. lines or polygons), this returns TRUE or FALSE based on the minimum geodesic distance between the two closest points of the two values.

Tip You can use the search optimization service to improve the performance of queries that call this function.
For details, see Search Optimization Service.

## Syntax

ST_DWITHIN( <geography_expression_1> , <geography_expression_2> , <distance_in_meters> )


## Arguments


geography_expression_1The argument must be an expression of type GEOGRAPHY.

geography_expression_2The argument must be an expression of type GEOGRAPHY.

distance_in_metersThe argument must be an expression of type REAL. The distance is in meters.


## Returns

Returns a BOOLEAN.

## Usage notes


Returns NULL if any input is NULL.


## Examples

This returns TRUE because the distance in meters between two points 1 degree apart along the equator is less than 150,000 meters:

SELECT ST_DWITHIN (ST_MAKEPOINT(0, 0), ST_MAKEPOINT(1, 0), 150000);

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine the number of bus stops for the bus network with the most stops within the multipolygon boundary of Denmark (as defined by Wikidata ID 'Q35'), we need to consider the relevant tables, columns, and conditions from the provided database `GEO_OPENSTREETMAP.GEO_OPENSTREETMAP`. Here's the analysis:

**Relevant Table:**
- **`PLANET_FEATURES`**

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**
- **`"feature_type"`**: Identifies the type of the feature (e.g., 'point', 'line', 'polygon').
- **`"all_tags"`**: Contains detailed tags in a VARIANT format (key-value pairs), which can be used to filter features related to bus stops and bus networks.
- **`"geometry"`**: Contains the spatial data of the feature, used for spatial queries to ensure the feature is within Denmark's boundary.
- **`"osm_id"`**: The unique identifier for the OpenStreetMap feature.
- **`"osm_version"`**, **`"osm_timestamp"`**: Metadata that might be useful for additional filtering or analysis.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**
- **Filter by bus stops**: Using `"all_tags"` to find features where `"amenity"` = `'bus_stop'`.
- **Filter by bus network**: Using `"all_tags"` to extract the `"network"` information.
- **Spatial filter to Denmark**: Using `"geometry"` to ensure features are within the Denmark boundary (requires Denmark's geometry).
- **Grouping and counting stops per bus network**: To find the bus network with the most stops.

---

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **Retrieve distinct feature types:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "feature_type"
   FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find features labeled as bus stops:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
   WHERE "all_tags":"amenity"::STRING = 'bus_stop'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List bus stops with their network names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "osm_id", "all_tags":"network"::STRING AS "network", "geometry"
   FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
   WHERE "all_tags":"amenity"::STRING = 'bus_stop'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count bus stops per network:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "all_tags":"network"::STRING AS "network", COUNT(*) AS "num_stops"
   FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
   WHERE "all_tags":"amenity"::STRING = 'bus_stop'
   GROUP BY "network"
   ORDER BY "num_stops" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve geometry of Denmark's boundary (assuming we have a table with Denmark's geometry):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "geometry"
   FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
   WHERE "all_tags":"wikidata"::STRING = 'Q35'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find bus stops within Denmark using spatial join (assuming Denmark's geometry is stored in a variable or subquery):**

   ```sql
   SELECT bs.*
   FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES" bs,
        (SELECT "geometry" AS "denmark_geom"
         FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
         WHERE "all_tags":"wikidata"::STRING = 'Q35'
         LIMIT 1) d
   WHERE bs."all_tags":"amenity"::STRING = 'bus_stop'
     AND ST_WITHIN(bs."geometry"::GEOGRAPHY, d."denmark_geom"::GEOGRAPHY)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count bus stops per network within Denmark:**

   ```sql
   SELECT bs."all_tags":"network"::STRING AS "network", COUNT(*) AS "num_stops"
   FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES" bs,
        (SELECT "geometry" AS "denmark_geom"
         FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
         WHERE "all_tags":"wikidata"::STRING = 'Q35'
         LIMIT 1) d
   WHERE bs."all_tags":"amenity"::STRING = 'bus_stop'
     AND ST_WITHIN(bs."geometry"::GEOGRAPHY, d."denmark_geom"::GEOGRAPHY)
   GROUP BY "network"
   ORDER BY "num_stops" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List bus stops without network information:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "osm_id", "geometry"
   FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
   WHERE "all_tags":"amenity"::STRING = 'bus_stop'
     AND "all_tags":"network" IS NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find unique bus networks within Denmark:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT bs."all_tags":"network"::STRING AS "network"
   FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES" bs,
        (SELECT "geometry" AS "denmark_geom"
         FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
         WHERE "all_tags":"wikidata"::STRING = 'Q35'
         LIMIT 1) d
   WHERE bs."all_tags":"amenity"::STRING = 'bus_stop'
     AND ST_WITHIN(bs."geometry"::GEOGRAPHY, d."denmark_geom"::GEOGRAPHY)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve bus stops with specific network name pattern (e.g., containing 'Movia'):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "osm_id", "all_tags":"network"::STRING AS "network", "geometry"
    FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
    WHERE "all_tags":"amenity"::STRING = 'bus_stop'
      AND "all_tags":"network"::STRING ILIKE '%Movia%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

These queries help in exploring the data related to bus stops and bus networks within Denmark. They start by identifying bus stops, extracting network information, and then incorporating spatial conditions to focus on features within Denmark's boundaries.

**Note:**
- The `ST_WITHIN` function is used to check if a geometry is within another geometry.
- The `all_tags` column is of VARIANT type; hence, we use JSON querying syntax like `"all_tags":"key"` to extract values.
- The geometry of Denmark (Wikidata ID 'Q35') is assumed to be present in the `PLANET_FEATURES` table.
- Adjustments may be needed based on actual data availability and structure.Query:

Task: What is the number of bus stops for the bus network with the most stops within the multipolygon boundary of Denmark (as defined by Wikidata ID 'Q35'), analyzed through planet features?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of bus stops for the bus network with the most stops within the boundary of Denmark (as defined by Wikidata ID 'Q35'), we analyze the planet features data. The result is:

```csv
Number_of_bus_stops
number:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'GEO_OPENSTREETMAP': {'GEO_OPENSTREETMAP': ['HISTORY_RELATIONS', 'HISTORY_CHANGESETS', 'PLANET_FEATURES', 'PLANET_FEATURES_POINTS', 'HISTORY_LAYERS', 'PLANET_WAYS', 'HISTORY_NODES', 'PLANET_NODES', 'PLANET_RELATIONS', 'PLANET_LAYERS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-12 16:11:11 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the number of bus stops for the bus network with the most stops within the multipolygon boundary of Denmark (as defined by Wikidata ID 'Q35'), analyzed through planet features?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of bus stops for the bus network with the most stops within the boundary of Denmark (as defined by Wikidata ID 'Q35'), we analyze the planet features data. The result is:

```csv
Number_of_bus_stops
number:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
Current snswer: 
Number_of_bus_stops
