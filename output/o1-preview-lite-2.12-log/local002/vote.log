After comparing both SQL scripts, **1result.sql** is the correct choice. It uses standard variable naming conventions for the linear regression coefficients, with `m` representing the slope and `b` representing the intercept in the equation \( y = m \cdot x + b \). Additionally, **1result.sql** provides a more precise result without rounding, ensuring greater accuracy in the calculation of the 5-day symmetric moving averages.
