After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Appropriate Use of Standard Deviation Function:**
  - **`1result.sql`** uses `STDDEV_SAMP`, which calculates the sample standard deviation, appropriate for a dataset that represents a sample of a larger population (daily counts in a year).
  - **`2result.sql`** uses `STDDEV_POP`, which calculates the population standard deviation. Since we're working with a sample, `STDDEV_SAMP` is more suitable.

- **Efficient Calculation with Window Functions:**
  - **`1result.sql`** utilizes window functions (`AVG(...) OVER()`, `STDDEV_SAMP(...) OVER()`) to compute the mean and standard deviation over the entire dataset without the need for additional subqueries.
  - This approach is more efficient and concise compared to **`2result.sql`**, which uses multiple subqueries and common table expressions (CTEs).

- **Accurate Z-score Computation:**
  - Both queries aim to compute Z-scores to identify anomalies in daily incident counts.
  - **`1result.sql`** provides a more streamlined and statistically appropriate method for this computation.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

1result.sql
