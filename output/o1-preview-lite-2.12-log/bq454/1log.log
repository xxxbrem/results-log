2025-01-27 14:40:45 - root - INFO - It appears that the error message indicates you may not have access to the table `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`, or it does not exist in that project. 

The **1000 Genomes** dataset is commonly available in the `bigquery-public-data` project, not `spider2-public-data`. Let's adjust the query to use the correct project:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT reference_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
LIMIT 100;
```

Please try running this query. If it executes successfully, you can modify the rest of your queries by replacing `spider2-public-data` with `bigquery-public-data`. Here's how you can adjust the initial queries:

1. **Retrieve distinct chromosome names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT reference_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select variants with allele frequency ≥ 0.05:**

   ```sql
   SELECT reference_name, AF
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   WHERE AF >= 0.05
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Exclude sex chromosomes and check variant types:**

   ```sql
   SELECT reference_name, AF, VT
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   WHERE AF >= 0.05 AND reference_name NOT IN ('X', 'Y', 'MT')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List samples with their super populations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT Sample, Super_Population
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.1000_genomes.sample_info`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count total population size per super population:**

   ```sql
   SELECT Super_Population, COUNT(DISTINCT Sample) AS total_population_size
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.1000_genomes.sample_info`
   GROUP BY Super_Population
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

Make sure you have access to the `bigquery-public-data` project in your Google Cloud Platform account. The `bigquery-public-data` project hosts a variety of publicly available datasets, including the **1000 Genomes Project** data.

If you still encounter access issues, please check:

- **Permissions:** Ensure that your account has the necessary permissions to access public datasets in BigQuery.
- **Project and Dataset Names:** Confirm that the project and dataset names are correct.
- **Region Settings:** Verify that your BigQuery project is set to the same region (`US`) as the public dataset.

Let me know if you need further assistance or if any other errors occur.
2025-01-27 14:41:09 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-27 14:41:09 - root - INFO - It looks like you're still encountering an access denied error when trying to query the `1000_genomes` dataset. Let's work through this issue step by step to help you gain access.

### **Understanding the Error**

The error message indicates:

```
Access Denied: Table bigquery-public-data:1000_genomes.variants: User does not have permission to query table bigquery-public-data:1000_genomes.variants, or perhaps it does not exist.
```

This suggests that either:

1. **You don't have the necessary permissions to access the dataset**, or
2. **The dataset does not exist in the specified location or under the specified project**.

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue**

#### **1. Verify the Correct Project and Dataset Names**

The **1000 Genomes Project** dataset is publicly available and commonly hosted under the `bigquery-public-data` project. Let's ensure we're using the correct project and dataset names.

- **Project:** `bigquery-public-data`
- **Dataset:** `human_genome_variants` (Note: The dataset might not be named `1000_genomes` in `bigquery-public-data`)

**Updated Query Using the Correct Dataset:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT reference_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_genome_variants.1000_genomes_variants`
LIMIT 100;
```

**Action:**

- Try adjusting your query to use `human_genome_variants.1000_genomes_variants` instead of `1000_genomes.variants`.

#### **2. Check Your Permissions**

Ensure that your Google Cloud account has the necessary permissions to access the `bigquery-public-data` datasets.

**Action:**

- **Access Roles:** Verify that your account has at least the following roles:
  - **BigQuery Data Viewer** (`roles/bigquery.dataViewer`)
  - **BigQuery User** (`roles/bigquery.user`) for your project.
- **Public Datasets Access:** Access to public datasets should be available by default, but in some cases, you might need to explicitly add permissions.

#### **3. Enable Billing on Your Project**

Some public datasets require that billing be enabled on your Google Cloud project, even if querying them doesn't incur costs.

**Action:**

- **Enable Billing:** Check that billing is enabled for your project in the Google Cloud Console under **Billing**.
- **Set a Budget Alert:** If you're concerned about costs, you can set budget alerts to monitor usage.

#### **4. Verify Dataset Availability in Your Region**

The `bigquery-public-data` datasets are typically stored in the `US` multi-region location. Your project should be in the same location to query these datasets.

**Action:**

- **Check Your Project's Location:** Ensure that your project's default location is set to `US`.
- **Location Matching:** If your project is in a different location, you may need to set up a new project in the `US` region.

#### **5. Explore the Dataset in the BigQuery Console**

Use the BigQuery web UI to explore available datasets and verify access.

**Action:**

1. **Open BigQuery in the Google Cloud Console.**
2. **Add the Public Data Project:**
   - Click on **Add Data**.
   - Select **Pin a Project**.
   - Enter `bigquery-public-data` and pin it.
3. **Navigate to the Dataset:**
   - Expand the `bigquery-public-data` project.
   - Look for datasets like `human_genome_variants` or similar.
4. **Verify Tables and Schemas:**
   - Click on the dataset and explore the tables to confirm their availability.

#### **6. Test Access with a Different Public Dataset**

Determine if the issue is specific to the `1000_genomes` dataset or affects all public datasets.

**Action:**

- **Try Querying Another Public Dataset:**

  ```sql
  SELECT name, SUM(number) as total_people
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
  GROUP BY name
  ORDER BY total_people DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

- **If this query works**, it indicates general access to `bigquery-public-data` is functioning, and the issue might be specific to the `1000_genomes` dataset.

#### **7. Alternative Datasets**

If the `1000_genomes` dataset is not available in `bigquery-public-data`, consider using alternative datasets that contain similar genomic information.

**Example Dataset:**

- **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.human_genome_variants`
- **Table:** `1000_genomes_variants`

**Action:**

- **Adjust Your Query Accordingly:**

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT reference_name
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_genome_variants.1000_genomes_variants`
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

#### **8. Contact Support**

If you've tried the above steps and still cannot access the dataset, it might be necessary to contact Google Cloud support.

### **Summary**

- **Verify the correct dataset and table names** in `bigquery-public-data`.
- **Check and adjust your permissions** to ensure you have access to public datasets.
- **Enable billing** for your project if it's not already enabled.
- **Ensure your project location matches** the dataset's location (`US`).
- **Test with other public datasets** to isolate the issue.

### **Next Steps**

Try running the adjusted query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT reference_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_genome_variants.1000_genomes_variants`
LIMIT 100;
```

If the query runs successfully, you can proceed with your analysis using this dataset.

super_population2:str,total_size2:int,variant_type2:str,sample_count2:int,num_variants2:int
...
```

**Explanation:**

The table presents the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared among different combinations of super populations. For each super population, it includes the total population size, the types of variants analyzed, the sample counts, and the number of common variants identified. Sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) are excluded from this analysis to focus solely on autosomal variants.

- **Super_Populations**: The super populations being compared (e.g., African, European).
- **Total_Population_Size**: The total number of individuals in each super population.
- **Variant_Type**: The type of genetic variants considered (e.g., SNPs, insertions, deletions).
- **Sample_Count**: The number of samples analyzed from each super population.
- **Number_of_Common_Autosomal_Variants**: The count of common autosomal variants with an allele frequency of at least 0.05 shared among the specified super populations.

This format allows for a clear presentation of the requested information, even without specific data values. It outlines the relevant categories and metrics needed to understand the distribution of common autosomal variants across different super populations, variant types, and sample counts.

---

**Notes:**

- **Dataset Adjustment:** The dataset `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes` is replaced with `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes` to ensure access to the publicly available data.

- **Field Names:** In the `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` table, some field names might differ slightly, such as `start_position` instead of `start`. Adjust the field names according to the actual schema of the table.

- **Permissions:** Ensure you have access to the `genomics-public-data` project. Public datasets are accessible to all users, but you may need to add the project to your BigQuery console.

**Adding the Public Dataset to Your Project:**

1. **Open BigQuery in the Google Cloud Console.**

2. **Pin the Project:**

   - Click on **Add Data**.
   - Select **Pin a Project**.
   - Enter `genomics-public-data` and click **PIN**.

3. **Explore Datasets:**

   - Expand the `genomics-public-data` project.
   - Navigate to the `1000_genomes` dataset.
   - View the tables (`variants`, `sample_info`, etc.) and their schemas.

**Example of Checking Table Schema:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.sample_info`
LIMIT 10;
```

**Verifying Table Fields:**

Before running the queries, you can verify the field names using:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM `genomics-public-data`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE table_name = 'variants';
```

**Adjustments Based on Schema Differences:**

- If certain fields do not exist or have different names, adjust the queries accordingly.
- For example, if `AF` is not available, you might need to calculate allele frequency or use an alternative field.

**Ensure Location Compatibility:**

- The public dataset is located in the `US` multi-region.
- Your BigQuery dataset should be in the `US` region to query data without issues.

**Final Reminders:**

- **Permissions and Billing:** Make sure billing is enabled on your project, even if querying public datasets is free up to certain limits.
- **Quota Limits:** Be aware of BigQuery's free tier quotas to avoid unexpected charges.

2025-01-27 14:44:47 - root - INFO - The error message indicates that the column `start_position` does not exist in the table `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`. The correct column name for the variant's start position is likely `start`.

**Correction:**

Replace `v.start_position` with `v.start` in your SQL query.

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT s.Super_Population, COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(v.reference_name, v.start, v.reference_bases, v.alternate_bases)) AS num_variants
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` AS v,
UNNEST(v.call) AS c
JOIN `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.sample_info` AS s
ON c.call_set_name = s.Sample
WHERE v.AF >= 0.05 AND v.reference_name NOT IN ('X', 'Y', 'MT')
GROUP BY s.Super_Population
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Column Correction:** The `variants` table does not have a column named `start_position`. The correct column that represents the start position of a variant is `start`.
- **Why the Error Occurred:** The SQL engine could not find `start_position` in the table schema, resulting in the error.
- **Distinct Variant Identification:** By concatenating `v.reference_name`, `v.start`, `v.reference_bases`, and `v.alternate_bases`, you create a unique identifier for each variant to count distinct variants accurately.
- **Joining Tables:** The query joins the `variants` table with the `sample_info` table to associate each variant with the super population of the sample.
- **Filtering Criteria:**
  - **Allele Frequency (`AF`):** Variants with an allele frequency greater than or equal to 0.05 are considered common.
  - **Excluding Sex Chromosomes:** Variants located on chromosomes `X`, `Y`, and `MT` are excluded to focus on autosomal variants.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Verify Column Names:** If you encounter similar errors, check the table schema to ensure all column names are correct.
- **Check Table Schema:** You can view the columns in the `variants` table using:

  ```sql
  SELECT column_name
  FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
  WHERE table_name = 'variants';
  ```

- **Understanding Limits:** The `LIMIT 100` clause restricts the results to 100 rows. Since you're grouping by `s.Super_Population`, this will show up to 100 super populations, but in practice, there are fewer super populations.

**Expected Results:**

Running the corrected query should provide you with a table displaying the number of common autosomal variants for each super population:

```csv
Super_Population,num_variants
AFR,<number_of_variants>
AMR,<number_of_variants>
EAS,<number_of_variants>
EUR,<number_of_variants>
SAS,<number_of_variants>
```

2025-01-27 14:45:39 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-27 14:45:39 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to attempting to use the `CONCAT` function with an argument of type `ARRAY<STRING>`, which is not supported. Specifically, `v.alternate_bases` is of type `ARRAY<STRING>` in the `variants` table, and the `CONCAT` function expects arguments of type `STRING`.

Here's the error message explained:

- **Error Message:**

  ```
  No matching signature for function CONCAT
    Argument types: STRING, INT64, STRING, ARRAY<STRING>
    Signature: CONCAT(STRING, [STRING, ...])
      Argument 4: Unable to coerce type ARRAY<STRING> to expected type STRING
  ```

- **Cause:**

  - The `CONCAT` function is receiving arguments of types `STRING`, `INT64`, `STRING`, and `ARRAY<STRING>`.
  - The fourth argument (`v.alternate_bases`) is of type `ARRAY<STRING>`, which cannot be coerced to `STRING` automatically.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to convert the `ARRAY<STRING>` (`v.alternate_bases`) into a `STRING` before using it in the `CONCAT` function. This can be done using the `ARRAY_TO_STRING` function.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT s.Super_Population, COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(v.reference_name, v.start, v.reference_bases, ARRAY_TO_STRING(v.alternate_bases, ''))) AS num_variants
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` AS v,
UNNEST(v.call) AS c
JOIN `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.sample_info` AS s
ON c.call_set_name = s.Sample
WHERE v.AF >= 0.05 AND v.reference_name NOT IN ('X', 'Y', 'MT')
GROUP BY s.Super_Population
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Conversion of `ARRAY<STRING>` to `STRING`:**

  - Use `ARRAY_TO_STRING(v.alternate_bases, '')` to convert the `ARRAY<STRING>` to a single `STRING`.
  - The second argument `''` is the separator between elements. Since you want all elements concatenated without any separator, an empty string is used.

- **Modified `CONCAT` Function:**

  - Now, all arguments to the `CONCAT` function are of type `STRING` or can be implicitly cast to `STRING`. The `INT64` (`v.start`) will be converted to a `STRING` automatically.

**Why This Works:**

- **`CONCAT` Function Requirements:**

  - `CONCAT` accepts any number of `STRING` arguments and concatenates them together.
  - All arguments must be of type `STRING` or be implicitly convertible to `STRING`.

- **Handling `INT64`:**

  - The `INT64` (`v.start`) is automatically cast to `STRING` in the `CONCAT` function.

- **Ensuring Unique Variant Identification:**

  - By concatenating `reference_name`, `start`, `reference_bases`, and `alternate_bases` (now a `STRING`), you create a unique identifier for each variant.
  - This allows `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` to accurately count unique variants.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Alternative Methods:**

  - If the `variants` table has a unique identifier for each variant, such as a variant ID, you could use that instead of concatenating fields.
  - For example, if there's a `variant_id` field, you could use:

    ```sql
    SELECT s.Super_Population, COUNT(DISTINCT v.variant_id) AS num_variants
    FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` AS v
    ...
    ```

- **Performance:**

  - While concatenating fields works, using a unique identifier (if available) is more efficient and reduces the risk of errors due to field concatenation.

- **Accurate Counting of Variants:**

  - Ensure that the combination of fields used in `CONCAT` truly represents a unique variant.
  - Variants may have multiple alternate bases; concatenating them as a string may still result in unique identification.

**Updated Query in Full:**

```sql
SELECT s.Super_Population, COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(v.reference_name, v.start, v.reference_bases, ARRAY_TO_STRING(v.alternate_bases, ''))) AS num_variants
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` AS v
JOIN `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.sample_info` AS s
ON s.Sample IN (SELECT c.call_set_name FROM UNNEST(v.call) AS c)
WHERE v.AF >= 0.05 AND v.reference_name NOT IN ('X', 'Y', 'MT')
GROUP BY s.Super_Population
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:**

- **Simplifying the Query:**

  - Since you only need to join the samples related to each variant, you can adjust the join condition to avoid unnecessary duplication.
  - Using `s.Sample IN (SELECT c.call_set_name FROM UNNEST(v.call) AS c)` ensures you match samples associated with each variant.

- **Potential Limitations:**

  - This query assumes that variants are associated with samples in a way that allows counting variants per super population accurately.
  - If you need to calculate allele frequency per super population, further calculations are necessary.

**Alternative Approach for Per Super Population Allele Frequency:**

To accurately identify the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) per super population, you need to compute the allele frequency within each super population.

Here's how you can do it:

```sql
WITH variant_calls AS (
  SELECT
    v.reference_name,
    v.start,
    v.reference_bases,
    ARRAY_TO_STRING(v.alternate_bases, '') AS alternate_bases_str,
    s.Super_Population,
    IFNULL(c.genotype[SAFE_OFFSET(0)], -1) AS allele1,
    IFNULL(c.genotype[SAFE_OFFSET(1)], -1) AS allele2
  FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` AS v
  CROSS JOIN UNNEST(v.call) AS c
  JOIN `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.sample_info` AS s
    ON c.call_set_name = s.Sample
  WHERE v.reference_name NOT IN ('X', 'Y', 'MT')
)

SELECT
  Super_Population,
  COUNT(*) AS num_variants
FROM (
  SELECT
    reference_name,

**Explanation of Alternative Approach:**

- **`variant_calls` CTE:**

  - Extracts necessary information, including genotypes and super populations.
  - Handles missing genotype data by using `IFNULL` and `SAFE_OFFSET`.

- **Computing Allele Frequencies:**

  - For each variant and super population, calculates the allele frequency based on the genotypes.
  - Counts the number of alternate alleles (`allele1 > 0` or `allele2 > 0`) over the total alleles.

- **Filtering Variants:**

  - Only includes variants where the allele frequency within the super population is ≥ 0.05.

- **Counting Variants:**

  - Counts the number of such variants per super population.

**Final Notes:**

- **Complexity:**

  - Computing allele frequencies per super population is more complex and resource-intensive.
  - Ensure you have adequate resources and permissions to run such queries.

- **Data Privacy and Compliance:**

  - When working with genomic data, be mindful of data privacy and compliance regulations.
  - Aggregate data to prevent disclosing individual-level information.

- **Permissions and Access:**

  - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to query the `genomics-public-data` datasets.

**Summary:**

- The original error was due to type mismatch in the `CONCAT` function.
- Converting `v.alternate_bases` from `ARRAY<STRING>` to `STRING` using `ARRAY_TO_STRING` resolves the issue.
- For accurate analysis, consider calculating allele frequencies within each super population.
- Adjust your queries as needed based on the data schema and your analysis requirements.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
  - `reference_name`: To identify autosomes (chromosomes 1-22); exclude 'X', 'Y', 'MT'.
  - `AF`: Allele Frequency; to find variants with AF ≥ 0.05.
  - `VT`: Variant Type; to categorize variants.
  - `call`: Contains genotype information for samples.
    - `call_set_name`: Sample identifier; used to join with `sample_info`.

- **Table:** `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.sample_info`
  - `Sample`: Sample identifier; to join with `variants.call_set_name`.
  - `Super_Population`: To identify the super population of each sample.
  - `Gender`: May be used for demographic breakdowns.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `AF` ≥ 0.05: To select common variants.
- `reference_name` NOT IN ('X', 'Y', 'MT'): To exclude sex chromosomes.
- Join condition between `variants` and `sample_info` on sample identifiers.

20. **List structural variant lengths for common variants:**

    ```sql
    SELECT v.SVLEN, v.VT, v.AF
    FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` AS v
    WHERE v.AF >= 0.05 AND v.reference_name NOT IN ('X', 'Y', 'MT') AND v.SVLEN IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help explore the data to understand how to identify the number of common autosomal variants shared by different combinations of super populations, the total population sizes, variant types, and sample counts, while excluding sex chromosomes from the analysis.Query:
SELECT reference_name, AF
   FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   WHERE AF >= 0.05
   LIMIT 100;

Task: Identify the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared by different combinations of super populations, total population size for each super population, variant types, and sample counts. Exclude sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) from the analysis.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Super_Populations,Total_Population_Size,Variant_Type,Sample_Count,Number_of_Common_Autosomal_Variants
populations:str,total_size:int,variant_type:str,sample_count:int,num_variants:int
...
```

**Explanation:**

The table provides the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared by different combinations of super populations. It includes the total population size for each super population, the types of variants analyzed, and the corresponding sample counts. Sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) are excluded from this analysis to focus solely on autosomal variants..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'spider2-public-data': {'1000_genomes': ['pedigree', 'sample_info', 'variants']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

This query performs the following steps:

1. **Sample Information (SampleInfo):** Retrieves the `Sample` and `Super_Population` from the `sample_info` table.

2. **Variants with Genotypes (VariantsWithGenotypes):** Selects variants from the `variants` table, focusing on autosomal chromosomes and biallelic variants for simplicity. It unpacks the calls to get genotype information per sample.

3. **Variant Genotypes by Super Population (VariantSuperPopGenotypes):** Joins the variants with the sample information to associate each genotype with its super population.

4. **Allele Frequencies (AlleleFrequencies):** Calculates the allele counts and total alleles for each variant within each super population.

5. **Common Variants (CommonVariants):** Filters for common variants with an allele frequency (AF) ≥ 0.05 in each super population.

6. **List of Super Populations per Variant (VariantSuperPopList):** Aggregates the super populations where each variant is common.

7. **Counts of Common Variants per Super Population Combination (VariantCombinationCounts):** Counts the number of common variants shared by different combinations of super populations and separates them by variant type.

8. **Population Sizes (PopulationSizes):** Computes the total population size and sample count for each super population.

9. **Final Results (FinalResults):** Merges the variant counts with the population sizes, summing up the total population sizes and sample counts for each combination of super populations.

10. **Final SELECT Statement:** Outputs the desired columns, ordering the results by the number of common autosomal variants in descending order.

**Note:** This query excludes sex chromosomes (`X`, `Y`, `MT`) and focuses on autosomal chromosomes. It calculates allele frequencies within each super population to identify common variants and determines how many such variants are shared among combinations of super populations.

**Output Format:**

```csv
Super_Populations,Total_Population_Size,Variant_Type,Sample_Count,Number_of_Common_Autosomal_Variants
populations:str,total_size:int,variant_type:str,sample_count:int,num_variants:int
...
```

This output will list combinations of super populations, their total population sizes, variant types (e.g., SNP, INDEL, SV), sample counts, and the number of common autosomal variants shared among them.

2025-01-27 14:50:16 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Identify the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared by different combinations of super populations, total population size for each super population, variant types, and sample counts. Exclude sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) from the analysis., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Super_Populations,Total_Population_Size,Variant_Type,Sample_Count,Number_of_Common_Autosomal_Variants
populations:str,total_size:int,variant_type:str,sample_count:int,num_variants:int
...
```

**Explanation:**

The table provides the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared by different combinations of super populations. It includes the total population size for each super population, the types of variants analyzed, and the corresponding sample counts. Sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) are excluded from this analysis to focus solely on autosomal variants. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
