After analyzing both SQL queries, **`2result.sql`** is the correct one for the following reasons:

1. **Calculation Method**:
   - **`0result.sql`** calculates the percentage change based on the **sum of sales**, which may not accurately reflect the average performance impact per period.
   - **`2result.sql`** calculates the percentage change based on the **average sales** before and after June 15, 2020, which aligns with the task of analyzing the **average sales performance impact**.

2. **Alignment with Task Requirements**:
   - The task specifically asks for analyzing the **average sales performance impact** across various attributes.
   - **`2result.sql`** correctly computes the **average sales** for each attribute during the specified periods and calculates the percentage change accordingly.

3. **Accurate Comparison**:
   - Using average sales provides a more accurate comparison by accounting for any fluctuations in the number of data points or sales volume variations.
   - **`2result.sql`** ensures that each attribute's performance is evaluated on a consistent basis.

Therefore, the correct SQL query that satisfies the task requirements is:

```plaintext
2result.sql
