## ST_WITHIN

Returns true if the first geospatial object is fully contained by the second geospatial object. In other words:

The first GEOGRAPHY object g1 is fully contained by the second GEOGRAPHY object g2.
The first GEOMETRY object g1 is fully contained by the second GEOMETRY object g2.

Calling ST_WITHIN(g1, g2) is equivalent to calling ST_CONTAINS(g2, g1).
Although ST_COVEREDBY and ST_WITHIN might seem similar, the two functions have subtle differences. For details on the differences between “covered by” and “within”, see the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM).

Note This function does not support using a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection as input values.

Tip You can use the search optimization service to improve the performance of queries that call this function.
For details, see Search Optimization Service.

See also:ST_CONTAINS , ST_COVEREDBY


## Syntax

ST_WITHIN( <geography_expression_1> , <geography_expression_2> )

ST_WITHIN( <geometry_expression_1> , <geometry_expression_2> )

BOOLEAN.

## Examples


## GEOGRAPHY examples

This shows a simple use of the ST_WITHIN function:

create table geospatial_table_01 (g1 GEOGRAPHY, g2 GEOGRAPHY);
insert into geospatial_table_01 (g1, g2) values 
    ('POLYGON((0 0, 3 0, 3 3, 0 3, 0 0))', 'POLYGON((1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2, 1 1))');

Copy SELECT ST_WITHIN(g1, g2) 
    FROM geospatial_table_01;

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Considering the available tables and columns, here's how they relate to your task:**

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

**Table:** `"NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS"`
- **`"usaf"`**: Station identifier (potential usage: to match with station '94728').
- **`"wban"`**: Station identifier (used alongside `"usaf"` to uniquely identify a station).
- **`"name"`**: Name of the station (to find 'Central Park' station).
- **`"state"`**: State abbreviation (to confirm the station is in New York).
- **`"lat"`**: Latitude (to get location of the station).
- **`"lon"`**: Longitude (to get location of the station).

**Table:** `"NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2015"` *(Assuming this table exists based on the pattern of other GSOD tables)*
- **`"stn"`**: Station identifier (matches with `"usaf"` in `STATIONS` table).
- **`"wban"`**: Station identifier (matches with `"wban"` in `STATIONS` table).
- **`"year"`**: Year of the observation (to filter for 2015).
- **`"mo"`**: Month of the observation (to filter for July).
- **`"da"`**: Day of the observation (to filter for the 15th).
- **`"temp"`**: Temperature (to obtain temperature readings).
- **`"count_temp"`**: Number of temperature observations (used to calculate averages).

### Conditions That May Be Used:

- **Identify Central Park Station:**
  - `WHERE "name" ILIKE '%CENTRAL PARK%'` (to find stations with 'Central Park' in their name).
  - `WHERE "usaf" = '94728'` (if '94728' is the `"usaf"` code for Central Park station).
- **Filter by Date:**
  - `WHERE "year" = '2015' AND "mo" = '07' AND "da" = '15'` (to get data for July 15, 2015).
- **Join Conditions:**
  - Joining `"stn"` (from `GSOD2015`) with `"usaf"` (from `STATIONS`) and `"wban"` with `"wban"` for accurate station matching.

---

**Sample SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List all stations with 'Central Park' in their name:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "usaf", "wban", "name", "state", "lat", "lon"
   FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS"
   WHERE "name" ILIKE '%CENTRAL PARK%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get the station ID for '94728' to confirm it's Central Park:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "usaf", "wban", "name", "state"
   FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS"
   WHERE "usaf" = '94728'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve temperature data for Central Park on July 15, 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "stn", "wban", "year", "mo", "da", "temp", "count_temp"
   FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2015"
   WHERE "stn" = '94728' AND "year" = '2015' AND "mo" = '07' AND "da" = '15'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find all stations in New York state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "usaf", "wban", "name", "lat", "lon"
   FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS"

   FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2015" AS gs
   JOIN "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS" AS st
     ON gs."stn" = st."usaf" AND gs."wban" = st."wban"
   WHERE st."state" = 'NY' AND gs."year" = '2015' AND gs."mo" = '07' AND gs."da" = '15'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate average temperature for each station in New York on July 15, 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."stn", st."name", AVG(gs."temp") AS "avg_temp"
   FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2015" AS gs
   JOIN "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS" AS st
     ON gs."stn" = st."usaf" AND gs."wban" = st."wban"
   WHERE st."state" = 'NY' AND gs."year" = '2015' AND gs."mo" = '07' AND gs."da" = '15'
   GROUP BY gs."stn", st."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Identify the station(s) with the highest average temperature in New York on that day:**

   ```sql
   SELECT sub."stn", sub."name", sub."avg_temp"
   FROM (
     SELECT gs."stn", st."name", AVG(gs."temp") AS "avg_temp"
     FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2015" AS gs
     JOIN "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS" AS st
       ON gs."stn" = st."usaf" AND gs."wban" = st."wban"
     WHERE st."state" = 'NY' AND gs."year" = '2015' AND gs."mo" = '07' AND gs."da" = '15'
     GROUP BY gs."stn", st."name"
   ) AS sub
   WHERE sub."avg_temp" = (
     SELECT MAX(avg_temp) FROM (
       SELECT AVG(gs."temp") AS avg_temp
       FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2015" AS gs
       JOIN "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS" AS st
         ON gs."stn" = st."usaf" AND gs."wban" = st."wban"
       WHERE st."state" = 'NY' AND gs."year" = '2015' AND gs."mo" = '07' AND gs."da" = '15'
       GROUP BY gs."stn"
     ) AS temp_avgs
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Check if ZIP Codes are available in the `"STATIONS"` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "usaf", "wban", "name", "state", "call" AS "zip_code"
   FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS"
   WHERE "state" = 'NY' AND "call" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List temperature readings and corresponding station locations on July 15, 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT gs."temp", st."name", st."lat", st."lon"
   FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2015" AS gs
   JOIN "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS" AS st
     ON gs."stn" = st."usaf" AND gs."wban" = st."wban"
   WHERE gs."year" = '2015' AND gs."mo" = '07' AND gs."da" = '15'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Obtain all available temperature data for Central Park station in July 2015:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "year", "mo", "da", "temp", "count_temp"
    FROM "NOAA_DATA"."NOAA_GSOD"."GSOD2015"
    WHERE "stn" = '94728' AND "year" = '2015' AND "mo" = '07'
    ORDER BY "da"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

**Notes:**

- **ZIP Code Data:** The `"call"` column in the `STATIONS` table might contain ZIP Code or other location identifiers. Query 8 checks for the presence of ZIP Codes.
- **Station Identification:** It's important to confirm that '94728' corresponds to the Central Park station by verifying with the station name in `STATIONS`.
- **Temperature Analysis:** Queries 5-7 help in understanding temperature distributions across New York stations on July 15, 2015, which is relevant for identifying the highest temperatures.
- **Data Limitations:** Since the provided schemas do not include bike trip data or direct ZIP Code associations beyond potential data in the `"call"` column, we cannot retrieve bike trip information or match temperatures to specific ZIP Code areas based on the available data.

**Understanding the Data:**

- **Exploring Stations:** By listing stations and their details, we can identify the relevant station IDs and confirm their locations.
- **Temperature Records:** Fetching temperature data helps in analyzing weather patterns on the specified date.
- **Data Relationships:** Joining the `GSOD2015` and `STATIONS` tables allows us to correlate temperature data with station metadata.

---

**Conclusion:**

While the provided data allows us to analyze temperature information from the Central Park weather station and other stations in New York on July 15, 2015, it does not include bike trip data or detailed ZIP Code mappings needed to fully address the original task. The SQL queries above aim to explore the existing data within the constraints specified.Query:

Task: Can you tell me which bike trip in New York City on July 15, 2015, started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature for that day, as recorded by the Central Park weather station '94728'? If there's more than one trip that meets these criteria, I'd like to know about the one that starts in the smallest ZIP Code and ends in the largest ZIP Code.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the database schemas provided, the available data includes weather information from NOAA, specifically from the `NOAA_GSOD` schema. This schema contains tables like `GSOD2015`, which might include temperature data from weather stations, including '94728' (Central Park). However, there is no data about bike trips or ZIP Code areas in the provided tables.

**To answer your question, we would need two key datasets:**

1. **Bike Trip Data**: Information on bike trips in New York City on July 15, 2015, including the start and end ZIP Codes for each trip.
2. **Temperature Data**: Average temperature data for July 15, 2015, recorded by the Central Park weather station '94728', ideally mapped to ZIP Code areas.

**Since the bike trip data and ZIP Code-specific temperature data are not present in the provided schemas, I'm unable to provide the specific bike trip you are requesting.**

**To proceed, you would need to:**

- **Obtain the bike trip data** for NYC on July 15, 2015, from a source such as the Citi Bike dataset, which includes trip details and ZIP Codes.
- **Map the temperature data** from station '94728' to ZIP Code areas. Since the weather station records data at a specific location, you might assume the same temperature applies to nearby ZIP Codes.

Once you have these datasets, you can:

1. **Identify the ZIP Code(s)** with the highest average temperature on July 15, 2015.
2. **Find all bike trips** that started and ended in those ZIP Code(s) on that day.
3. **Select the trip** that starts in the smallest ZIP Code and ends in the largest ZIP Code, if multiple trips meet the criteria.

**Without access to the necessary data, I'm unable to generate the specific answer. If you can provide the required datasets, I'd be happy to assist further.**.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
