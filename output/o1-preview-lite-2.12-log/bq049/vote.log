After analyzing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query that accurately fulfills the task is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Comprehensive Filtering of Bourbon Sales:**
  - The query in `1result.sql` filters sales data where either the `category_name` **or** the `item_description` contains the term 'bourbon' (case-insensitive). This ensures that all Bourbon Whiskey sales are included, even if some items are not strictly categorized under 'Bourbon Whiskey' but have 'bourbon' in their description.
  - This approach captures a more complete set of Bourbon Whiskey sales compared to queries that filter only on `category_name`.

- **Accurate Zip Code Standardization:**
  - The query standardizes zip codes by removing any decimal fractions using the regular expression `r'\.\d*$'`. This ensures consistency when matching zip codes between the sales data and the population data.
  - By properly handling zip codes like '52001.0' and converting them to '52001', the query avoids mismatches that could lead to incomplete or incorrect data aggregation.

- **Precise Population Data for Age 21 and Over:**
  - The population aggregation in `1result.sql` accurately sums the population where `minimum_age >= 21`, aligning with the requirement to use only the population aged 21 and older.
  - This ensures that per capita calculations are based on the correct segment of the population.

- **Correct Matching Between Sales and Population Data:**
  - The query correctly joins the sales data with the population data using the standardized zip codes. This accurate matching is crucial for calculating per capita sales.
  - By ensuring that the population data corresponds precisely to the zip code in question, the per capita figures are valid and reliable.

- **Consistent and Reasonable Results:**
  - The per capita sales figures produced by `1result.sql` are consistent across months and appear reasonable given the context and data.
  - The results are slightly higher than those from `2result.sql`, which is expected due to the more inclusive filtering of Bourbon Whiskey sales in `1result.sql`.

In conclusion, `1result.sql` provides a comprehensive and accurate solution for calculating the monthly per capita Bourbon Whiskey sales during 2022 in Dubuque County for the zip code that ranks third in total Bourbon Whiskey sales, using only the population aged 21 and older.
