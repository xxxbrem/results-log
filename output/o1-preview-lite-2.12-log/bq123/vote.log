After comparing both SQL queries, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Calculation:**
  - `1result.sql` accurately calculates the percentage of questions answered within an hour for each day of the week by directly counting the number of questions and the number of questions with a fast answer (within one hour). It ensures that all questions are considered, including those without any answers.
  - It uses a subquery to find the earliest answer for each question and applies the time difference condition efficiently.

- **Proper Handling of Data:**
  - The query carefully handles cases where questions may not have any answers by using a `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` to default counts to zero when necessary.
  - By aggregating counts separately for total questions and fast-answered questions, it avoids potential inaccuracies that might arise from joining and grouping data improperly.

- **Efficiency:**
  - `1result.sql` is likely more efficient because it minimizes the amount of data processed by aggregating counts early and only joining on necessary fields.
  - It avoids unnecessary computation on every row by filtering data in the subqueries.

- **Clarity and Simplicity:**
  - The query is structured in a clear and logical manner, making it easier to read and understand.
  - It directly addresses the task by calculating and ordering the percentages to find the day with the third highest percentage.

**Output:**
