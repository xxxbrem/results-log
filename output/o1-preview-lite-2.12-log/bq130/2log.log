2025-01-24 22:07:55 - root - INFO - The error you encountered occurs because BigQuery does not allow the use of analytic functions (also known as window functions) directly in the `HAVING` clause. In your query, `daily_new_cases` is calculated using the `LAG` window function, and you're attempting to filter on it using `HAVING`.

**Explanation of the Error:**

- **Analytic Functions and WHERE/HAVING Clause:**
  - Analytic functions are evaluated after the `WHERE` clause but before the `HAVING` clause.
  - The `HAVING` clause is meant to filter results after aggregation (with functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, etc.) and when used with `GROUP BY`.
  - Since `daily_new_cases` is computed using an analytic function, you cannot reference it in the `HAVING` clause.

**Solution:**

To filter based on a column derived from an analytic function, you need to wrap your query in a subquery or use a Common Table Expression (CTE) and then apply the `WHERE` clause in the outer query.

**Corrected Query Using a Subquery:**

```sql
SELECT
  `state_name`,
  `date`,
  `daily_new_cases`
FROM (
  SELECT
    `state_name`,
    `date`,
    `confirmed_cases` - LAG(`confirmed_cases`) OVER (
      PARTITION BY `state_name` ORDER BY `date`
    ) AS `daily_new_cases`
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_states`
  WHERE
    `date` BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2020-05-31'
)
WHERE
  `daily_new_cases` > 5000
ORDER BY
  `daily_new_cases` DESC
LIMIT 100
```

**Alternative Using a Common Table Expression (CTE):**

```sql
WITH daily_cases AS (
  SELECT
    `state_name`,
    `date`,
    `confirmed_cases` - LAG(`confirmed_cases`) OVER (
      PARTITION BY `state_name` ORDER BY `date`
    ) AS `daily_new_cases`
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_states`
  WHERE
    `date` BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2020-05-31'
)
SELECT
  `state_name`,
  `date`,
  `daily_new_cases`
FROM
  daily_cases
WHERE
  `daily_new_cases` > 5000
ORDER BY
  `daily_new_cases` DESC
LIMIT 100
```

**Why This Works:**

- The inner query (or CTE) calculates `daily_new_cases` for each state and date.
- The outer query applies the `WHERE` clause to filter rows where `daily_new_cases` is greater than 5,000.
- By structuring the query this way, you avoid the limitation of not being able to use analytic functions in the `HAVING` clause.

**Next Steps for Your Task:**

Now that you've resolved the error, you can proceed with your analysis. Here's how you can accomplish the task step by step:

---

### **1. Identify the Top Five States by Daily Increases**

**Calculate Daily New Cases for Each State:**

```sql
WITH daily_state_cases AS (
  SELECT
    `state_name`,
    `date`,
    SAFE_CAST(
      `confirmed_cases` - LAG(`confirmed_cases`) OVER (
        PARTITION BY `state_name` ORDER BY `date`
      ) AS INT64
    ) AS `daily_new_cases`
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_states`
  WHERE
    `date` BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2020-05-31'
)
```

**Identify the Top Five States for Each Day:**

```sql
, daily_top_states AS (
  SELECT
    `state_name`,
    `date`,
    `daily_new_cases`,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY `date` ORDER BY `daily_new_cases` DESC
    ) AS `state_rank`
  FROM
    daily_state_cases
  WHERE
    `daily_new_cases` IS NOT NULL
)
```

**Compile Ranking Based on Frequency of Appearance in Top Fives:**

```sql
SELECT
  `state_name`,
  COUNT(*) AS `appearance_count`
FROM
  daily_top_states
WHERE
  `state_rank` <= 5
GROUP BY
  `state_name`
ORDER BY
  `appearance_count` DESC
LIMIT 5
```

**Full Query:**

```sql
WITH daily_state_cases AS (
  SELECT
    `state_name`,
    `date`,
    SAFE_CAST(
      `confirmed_cases` - LAG(`confirmed_cases`) OVER (
        PARTITION BY `state_name` ORDER BY `date`
      ) AS INT64
    ) AS `daily_new_cases`
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_states`
  WHERE
    `date` BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2020-05-31'
),
daily_top_states AS (
  SELECT
    `state_name`,
    `date`,
    `daily_new_cases`,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY `date` ORDER BY `daily_new_cases` DESC
    ) AS `state_rank`
  FROM
    daily_state_cases
  WHERE
    `daily_new_cases` IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
  `state_name`,
  COUNT(*) AS `appearance_count`
FROM
  daily_top_states
WHERE
  `state_rank` <= 5
GROUP BY
  `state_name`
ORDER BY
  `appearance_count` DESC
LIMIT 5
```

---

**Assuming the Results Are:**

```csv
state_name,appearance_count
New York,92
New Jersey,75
California,40
Illinois,35
Massachusetts,30
```

*Note: Replace the numbers with actual counts obtained from running the query.*

### **2. Examine the State That Ranks Fourth Overall (Illinois)**

**Calculate Daily New Cases for Each County in Illinois:**

```sql
WITH daily_county_cases AS (
  SELECT
    `county`,
    `date`,
    SAFE_CAST(
      `confirmed_cases` - LAG(`confirmed_cases`) OVER (
        PARTITION BY `county` ORDER BY `date`
      ) AS INT64
    ) AS `daily_new_cases`
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_counties`
  WHERE
    `state_name` = 'Illinois'
    AND `date` BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2020-05-31'
)
```

**Identify the Top Five Counties for Each Day:**

```sql
, daily_top_counties AS (
  SELECT
    `county`,
    `date`,
    `daily_new_cases`,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY `date` ORDER BY `daily_new_cases` DESC
    ) AS `county_rank`
  FROM
    daily_county_cases
  WHERE
    `daily_new_cases` IS NOT NULL
)
```

**Compile Ranking Based on Frequency of Appearance in Top Fives:**

```sql
SELECT
  `county`,
  COUNT(*) AS `appearance_count`
FROM
  daily_top_counties
WHERE
  `county_rank` <= 5
GROUP BY
  `county`
ORDER BY
  `appearance_count` DESC

    - `state_name`: To identify states.
    - `confirmed_cases`: To calculate daily new cases.
  - **`us_counties` Table:**
    - `date`: To filter the date range.
    - `state_name`: To select counties within the fourth-ranked state.
    - `county`: To identify counties.
    - `confirmed_cases`: To calculate daily new cases.

- **Conditions Applied:**
  - Date range from `'2020-03-01'` to `'2020-05-31'`.
  - Calculated `daily_new_cases` using the `LAG` window function.
  - Filtered to include only the top five states or counties per day based on `daily_new_cases`.

**Note on Handling NULL Values:**

- Used `SAFE_CAST` to handle any potential `NULL` values resulting from the `LAG` function, especially for the first record of each state or county.

---

**Conclusion:**

By adjusting your query to calculate `daily_new_cases` in a subquery or CTE and then applying the `WHERE` clause, you can successfully run the query and proceed with your analysis. The steps outlined above should help you compile the rankings required for your task.

**Remember:**

- Analytic functions cannot be directly used in the `HAVING` clause in BigQuery.
- Use subqueries or CTEs to calculate and then filter based on analytic functions.
- Always verify your results by running the queries and examining the output.

Feel free to ask if you need further assistance or clarification on any of the steps.

We have updated data through the end of 2020 or as far as available.\n\nThe New York Times is releasing data that documents the number of deaths from all causes that have occurred during the coronavirus pandemic for 32 countries. We are compiling this time series data from national and municipal health departments, vital statistics offices and other official sources in order to better understand the true toll of the pandemic and provide a record for researchers and the public.\n\nOfficial Covid-19 death tolls offer a limited view of the impact of the outbreak because they often exclude people who have not been tested and those who died at home. All-cause mortality is widely used by demographers and other researchers to understand the full impact of deadly events, including epidemics, wars and natural disasters. The totals in this data include deaths from Covid-19 as well as those from other causes, likely including people who could not be treated or did not seek treatment for other conditions.\n\nWe have used this data to produce graphics tracking the oubreak's toll and stories about the United States, Ecuador, Russia, Turkey, Sweden and other countries. We would like to thank a number of demographers and other researchers, listed at the end, who have provided data or helped interpret it.\n\nSourced from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/excess-deaths.""

Consider the following tables and columns that are relevant to the task:

- **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_states`
  - **Columns**:
    - `date`: To filter records within the date range of March to May 2020.
    - `state_name`: To identify each state.
    - `confirmed_cases`: To calculate daily new cases by finding the difference from the previous day.

- **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_counties`
  - **Columns**:
    - `date`: To filter records within the date range of March to May 2020.
    - `state_name`: To identify the state to which each county belongs.
    - `county`: To identify each county.
    - `confirmed_cases`: To calculate daily new cases by finding the difference from the previous day.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `date` BETWEEN '2020-03-01' AND '2020-05-31': To select data from March to May 2020.
- Calculating daily new cases using window functions like `LAG` to find the difference in confirmed cases between consecutive days.
- Filtering and ordering data to identify top states and counties based on daily increases.

Below are 10 BigQuery SQL queries ranging from simple to complex:

1. **List all states with their total confirmed cases on March 1, 2020:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     `state_name`,
     `confirmed_cases`
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_states`
   WHERE
     `date` = '2020-03-01'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

2. **Retrieve distinct dates from March to May 2020:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     `date`

    ```

These queries will help in understanding the data and performing the analysis required to identify:

- The top five states by daily increases in COVID-19 cases from March to May 2020.
- The frequency each state appears in the daily top fives.
- For the state that ranks fourth overall, the top five counties based on their frequency of appearing in the daily top five new case counts.

By analyzing the results of these queries, we can compile the rankings and identify the required states and counties for the task.Query:

Task: Analyze daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020, identifying the top five states by daily increases. Please compile a ranking based on how often each state appears in these daily top fives. Then, examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties based on their frequency of appearing in the daily top five new case counts.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
top_five_counties,count
county1:str,count1:int
county2:str,count2:int
county3:str,count3:int
county4:str,count4:int
county5:str,count5:int
```

To identify the top five counties, we first analyzed the daily new COVID-19 case counts from March to May 2020. We determined the state that ranked fourth overall based on how often it appeared in the daily top five states with the highest increases. Then, we examined this state's counties and ranked them by the frequency with which they appeared in the daily top five counties with the most new cases..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'covid19_nyt': ['excess_deaths', 'mask_use_by_county', 'us_counties', 'us_states']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
