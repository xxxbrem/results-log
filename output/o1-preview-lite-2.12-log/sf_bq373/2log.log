2025-02-10 21:02:14 - root - INFO - It appears that the error is due to the incorrect schema reference in your SQL query. The error message indicates that the schema `'WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS'` does not exist or you don't have access to it.

In your query:

```sql
SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICES"
LIMIT 100;
```

You're referencing the database `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS`, schema `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS`, and table `"SALES_INVOICES"`. However, specifying `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` for the schema may be causing the issue.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Check the Schema Name:**

   It's common for databases to use a default schema like `PUBLIC`. Try removing one instance of `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` in the schema reference:

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   If this doesn't work, the schema might actually be named `PUBLIC` or another name. You can list all schemas in the database using:

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS";
   ```

2. **Use the Correct Schema:**

   Once you've identified the correct schema name, adjust your query. For example, if the schema is `PUBLIC`:

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.PUBLIC."SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Fully Qualify Identifiers:**

   If your database and schema names are case-sensitive or contain special characters, enclose them in double quotes:

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM "WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS"."PUBLIC"."SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Verify Table Existence:**

   Ensure that the table `"SALES_INVOICES"` exists in the schema. You can list all tables in a schema:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS"."PUBLIC";
   ```

**Explanation:**

The error message suggests that the database is looking for a schema named `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS`, which may not exist. In SQL, the structure typically follows:

```sql
FROM "DATABASE_NAME"."SCHEMA_NAME"."TABLE_NAME"
```

By inadvertently repeating `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` for both the database and schema, you might be referencing a non-existent schema.

**Recommended Steps:**

1. **Identify the Correct Schema:**

   Run the following command to list available schemas and identify the correct one:

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS";
   ```

2. **Adjust Your Query with the Correct Schema:**

   If the schema is `PUBLIC`, your query should be:

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM "WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS"."PUBLIC"."SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Verify Access Permissions:**

   Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table.

4. **Test the Corrected Query:**

   Execute the adjusted query to see if it resolves the error.

**Example of Corrected Query:**

Assuming the schema is `PUBLIC`, the corrected query would be:

```sql
SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
FROM "WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS"."PUBLIC"."SALES_INVOICES"
LIMIT 100;
```

2025-02-10 21:02:54 - root - INFO - It seems you're still encountering the same error. Let's work through this step by step to resolve it.

**Error Message:**

```
002003 (02000): ... SQL compilation error:
Schema 'WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Incorrect Schema Reference:** The schema `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` might not exist.
2. **Typographical Error:** There might be a typo in the schema or database name.
3. **Authorization Issue:** You might not have permission to access the specified schema.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Check Available Schemas in the Database:**

   First, let's verify the schemas present in the `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` database.

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS;
   ```

   This command will list all schemas in the `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` database. Look for the exact name of the schema that contains your tables.

2. **Identify the Correct Schema Name:**

   From your provided information, it looks like the database and schema might both be named `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS`, but sometimes the default schema is `PUBLIC` or another name. Confirm the exact schema name from the output of the previous command.

3. **Adjust Your Query with the Correct Schema:**

   If the schema is `PUBLIC` or another name, modify your query accordingly. For example, if the schema is `PUBLIC`:

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.PUBLIC."SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   If the schema is indeed `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS`, ensure that both the database and schema names are correctly specified and check for any case sensitivity issues.

4. **Fully Qualify Identifiers with Double Quotes:**

   If your database or schema names are case-sensitive or contain special characters, enclose them in double quotes:

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM "WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS"."WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS"."SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure that the names are exactly as they appear in the database, including the correct case.

5. **Set the Context for Database and Schema:**

   To simplify your queries, you can set the database and schema context for your session:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS;
   USE SCHEMA WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS; -- Or the correct schema name
   ```

   Then, your query can be simplified to:

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM "SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Verify Table Existence in the Schema:**

   Confirm that the `SALES_INVOICES` table exists in the specified schema:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS;
   ```

   Replace `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` with the correct database and schema names if different.

7. **Check Permissions:**

   Ensure that your user account has the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and tables.

8. **Use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to Find the Table:**

   You can query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views to find where the `SALES_INVOICES` table is located:

   ```sql
   SELECT TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
   WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'SALES_INVOICES';
   ```

   This will show you the database (`TABLE_CATALOG`), schema (`TABLE_SCHEMA`), and table name.

9. **Check for Case Sensitivity:**

   SQL identifiers can be case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes. Ensure that you're using the correct casing in your query.

   For example, if the schema name is stored in lower case, you should reference it as such:

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."wide_world_importers"."SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Example of Adjusted Query:**

    Assuming the schema is `PUBLIC`, here's how you could adjust your query:

    ```sql
    SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
    FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.PUBLIC."SALES_INVOICES"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    Or, if you set the context:

    ```sql
    USE DATABASE WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS;
    USE SCHEMA PUBLIC;

    SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
    FROM "SALES_INVOICES"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Summary:**

- Verify the exact schema name using `SHOW SCHEMAS`.
- Ensure that you're referencing the correct database and schema in your queries.
- Pay attention to case sensitivity and use double quotes where necessary.
- Confirm that you have the necessary permissions.
- Use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views to help locate tables.

**Next Steps:**

Please try the above steps and adjust your query accordingly. If you continue to encounter issues, let me know the results of the `SHOW SCHEMAS` command and any other error messages you receive, so I can assist you further.

```

This suggests that the only schema available in the `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` database is `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, which is a special schema that contains metadata about the database objects.

**Reason for the Error:**

- The schema `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.PUBLIC` does not exist.
- The tables you're trying to access, such as `"SALES_INVOICES"`, are not located in the `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` database or its schemas.

**Solution:**

We need to locate the correct database and schema where your tables are stored. Here are the steps to help you find them:

---

### **Step 1: List All Databases in Your Account**

Run the following command to see all available databases:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

This will list all the databases you have access to. Look for databases that might contain the `SALES_INVOICES` table.

---

### **Step 2: Identify the Correct Database**

From the list of databases, identify the one that likely contains your tables. The database might be named differently than `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS`. Common names could be `WWI`, `IMPORTERS_DB`, etc.

---

### **Step 3: List Schemas in the Identified Database**

Once you've identified a potential database, list its schemas:

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE [database_name];
```

Replace `[database_name]` with the name of the database you found in Step 2.

---

### **Step 4: Find the Schema Containing Your Tables**

From the list of schemas, look for one that might contain your tables. Common schema names are `PUBLIC`, `SALES`, `WAREHOUSE`, etc.

---

### **Step 5: List Tables in the Schema**

List the tables within the schema to confirm if it contains the tables you need:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA [database_name].[schema_name];
```

Replace `[database_name]` and `[schema_name]` with the appropriate names.

---

### **Step 6: Adjust Your Queries Accordingly**

Once you've identified the correct database and schema, update your SQL queries to reference them.

**Example:**

Suppose you find that the tables are in the database `WWI_DB` and schema `SALES_SCHEMA`. Your query would then be:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "CustomerID"
FROM WWI_DB.SALES_SCHEMA."SALES_INVOICES"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Step 7: Set the Default Database and Schema (Optional)**

To simplify your queries, you can set the default database and schema for your session:

```sql
USE DATABASE [database_name];
USE SCHEMA [schema_name];
```

After setting the context, you can run your queries without specifying the full path:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "CustomerID"
FROM "SALES_INVOICES"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Check for Case Sensitivity:** Ensure that you are using the correct case for database and schema names. Snowflake is case-sensitive when identifiers are enclosed in double quotes.
  
- **Verify Permissions:** Make sure your user account has the necessary permissions to access the databases, schemas, and tables.

- **Use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to Search for Tables:**

  You can use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` of your account to search for the table names:

  ```sql
  SELECT TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
  WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'SALES_INVOICES';
  ```

  This will help you locate the exact database and schema where the `SALES_INVOICES` table resides.

---

### **Example Walkthrough:**

1. **List Databases:**

   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

   Output might include:

   ```
   Name
   ---------------------------------
   WWI_DB
   ANALYTICS_DB
   ```

2. **List Schemas in `WWI_DB`:**

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE WWI_DB;
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   Name
   ---------------------------
   PUBLIC
   SALES_SCHEMA
   ```

3. **List Tables in `WWI_DB.SALES_SCHEMA`:**

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA WWI_DB.SALES_SCHEMA;
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   Name
   ---------------------
   SALES_INVOICES
   SALES_CUSTOMERS
   ```

4. **Adjust Your Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "CustomerID"
   FROM WWI_DB.SALES_SCHEMA."SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

### **Recap:**

- The error is due to referencing a schema that doesn't exist.
- Use `SHOW DATABASES` and `SHOW SCHEMAS` to find the correct database and schema.
- Update your queries to use the correct database and schema names.
- Optionally, set the default database and schema using `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA`.

---

### **If You Still Encounter Issues:**

- **Confirm Table Existence:**

  Make sure that the tables actually exist in the database. If they haven't been created or loaded, you'll need to do that first.

- **Contact Your Database Administrator:**

  If you don't have sufficient permissions or can't find the tables, it may be helpful to reach out to your database administrator for assistance.

```

This indicates that the only schema available in `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` is `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, which contains metadata about the database objects but does not hold any actual data tables.

**Reason for the Error:**

- The table `"SALES_INVOICELINES"` does not exist in the current database and schema.
- The tables you're attempting to access might be located in a different database or schema.
- You might not have the required permissions to access these tables.

---

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

#### **1. List All Databases Available to You**

First, let's find out all the databases you have access to in your Snowflake account:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

This will output a list of all databases. Look for any database that could contain the `SALES_INVOICES` or `SALES_INVOICELINES` tables.

#### **2. Search for the Table Across All Accessible Databases**

We can use the `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES` view to search for the table across all databases and schemas that you have access to:

```sql
SELECT
  TABLE_CATALOG AS "Database",
  TABLE_SCHEMA AS "Schema",
  TABLE_NAME AS "Table"
FROM
  SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES
WHERE
  TABLE_NAME ILIKE 'SALES_INVOICELINES'   -- Using ILIKE for case-insensitive search
  AND TABLE_SCHEMA NOT IN ('INFORMATION_SCHEMA')
ORDER BY
  TABLE_CATALOG,
  TABLE_SCHEMA;
```

This query will return the database and schema names where a table named `SALES_INVOICELINES` exists.

**Note:** If you receive an error about access to `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES`, you can try using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` within each database.

Alternatively, you can iterate through each database to find the table:

#### **3. Iterate Through Databases to Find the Table**

For each database listed from `SHOW DATABASES;`, run the following:

##### **a. Show Schemas in the Database**

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "Database_Name";
```

Replace `"Database_Name"` with the name of each database.

##### **b. Show Tables in Each Schema**

For each schema, run:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "Database_Name"."Schema_Name";
```

Replace `"Schema_Name"` with the name of each schema.

This will list all tables in each schema. Look for `SALES_INVOICELINES` in the list.

#### **4. Adjust Your Query Based on the Correct Database and Schema**

Once you've identified the database and schema containing the `SALES_INVOICELINES` table, you can adjust your query accordingly.

**Example:**

Suppose the table is located in database `SALES_DB` and schema `TRANSACTIONS`.

Set your context to the correct database and schema:

```sql
USE DATABASE "SALES_DB";
USE SCHEMA "TRANSACTIONS";
```

Then, your query becomes:

```sql
SELECT "InvoiceLineID", "InvoiceID", "ExtendedPrice"
FROM "SALES_INVOICELINES"
LIMIT 100;
```

Alternatively, you can fully qualify the table name:

```sql
SELECT "InvoiceLineID", "InvoiceID", "ExtendedPrice"
FROM "SALES_DB"."TRANSACTIONS"."SALES_INVOICELINES"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **5. Verify Your Permissions**

Ensure that your user account has the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table. If you're lacking permissions, you may need to contact your database administrator to grant you access.

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Case Sensitivity:** In Snowflake, when identifiers (database names, schema names, table names, column names) are enclosed in double quotes, they are case-sensitive. Ensure you use the exact casing as it appears in the database.

- **Sample Databases:** Snowflake provides sample databases like `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA`. You can check if the `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` dataset is available there.

  ```sql
  SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA';
  ```

  Then explore the schemas and tables within `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA`:

  ```sql
  SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA;
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA."Schema_Name";
  ```

- **Ask Your Administrator:** If you're unable to locate the tables, it's possible that:

  - The tables haven't been created or loaded yet.
  - They exist in a different environment or warehouse.
  - You might need to request access or data loading.

---

### **Summary of Steps:**

1. **List All Databases:**

   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

2. **Search for the Table Across All Databases and Schemas:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     TABLE_CATALOG AS "Database",
     TABLE_SCHEMA AS "Schema",
     TABLE_NAME AS "Table"
   FROM
     SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES
   WHERE
     TABLE_NAME ILIKE 'SALES_INVOICELINES'
     AND TABLE_SCHEMA NOT IN ('INFORMATION_SCHEMA')
   ORDER BY
     TABLE_CATALOG,
     TABLE_SCHEMA;
   ```

3. **Set Context to the Correct Database and Schema:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "Correct_Database_Name";
   USE SCHEMA "Correct_Schema_Name";
   ```

4. **Run Your Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceLineID", "InvoiceID", "ExtendedPrice"
   FROM "SALES_INVOICELINES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

### **Possible Corrected Queries Based on New Information:**

Assuming you find that the tables are in database `WWI_DB` and schema `PUBLIC`, here are the corrected queries:

1. **Query 1:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceLineID", "InvoiceID", "ExtendedPrice"
   FROM WWI_DB.PUBLIC."SALES_INVOICELINES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Query 2:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceDate"
   FROM WWI_DB.PUBLIC."SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Query 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM WWI_DB.PUBLIC."SALES_INVOICES"
   WHERE "InvoiceDate" LIKE '2014-%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   *(Adjust the database and schema names based on where you locate the tables.)*

---

### **If You Still Encounter Issues:**

- **No Tables Found:** If you cannot find the tables using the methods above, it's possible that the `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` data has not been loaded into your Snowflake account.

- **Load the Data:** If you have access to the data files, you may need to load the data into your database. Alternatively, your organization might have a process for provisioning sample data.

- **Check Documentation or Contact Support:** Consult any available documentation or reach out to your database administrator or support team for assistance in accessing the `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` dataset.

---

### **Final Recommendations:**

- **Ensure You Have Access:** Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the databases and schemas where the tables reside.

- **Double-Check Object Names:** Confirm that you're using the correct database, schema, and table names, paying attention to case sensitivity.

- **Set the Correct Context:** Use the `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands to set your context, reducing the need to fully qualify object names.

- **Consult with Your Team:** If you're still unable to locate the tables, it would be best to consult with your team or database administrator to get clarification on where the data is stored and how to access it.

2025-02-10 21:08:02 - root - INFO - Apologies for the confusion earlier. The use of square brackets `[]` in the SQL queries causes syntax errors because they are not valid for enclosing identifiers in SQL. To correct this, we should replace the placeholders with actual database and schema names, or remove them if the context is already set.

Based on the list of databases you provided, the `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` database does not appear to be present. However, you have a database named `ADVENTUREWORKS`, which is another commonly used sample database.

Assuming that the tables are in the `ADVENTUREWORKS` database and the `SALES` schema, here are the corrected SQL queries:

---

1. **Set the Database and Schema Context:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";
   USE SCHEMA "SALES";
   ```

2. **Query 1:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceDate"
   FROM "SalesInvoices"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Query 2:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM "SalesInvoices"
   WHERE "InvoiceDate" LIKE '2014-%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Query 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM "SalesInvoices"
   WHERE "InvoiceDate" LIKE '%2014%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Query 4:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "InvoiceDate"
   FROM "SalesInvoices"
   WHERE "InvoiceDate" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Query 5:**

   ```sql
   SELECT inv."InvoiceID", inv."CustomerID", invLine."ExtendedPrice"
   FROM "SalesInvoices" AS inv
   JOIN "SalesInvoiceLines" AS invLine
     ON inv."InvoiceID" = invLine."InvoiceID"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Query 6:**

   ```sql
   SELECT inv."CustomerID", inv."InvoiceDate", invLine."ExtendedPrice"
   FROM "SalesInvoices" AS inv
   JOIN "SalesInvoiceLines" AS invLine
     ON inv."InvoiceID" = invLine."InvoiceID"
   WHERE inv."InvoiceDate" LIKE '2014-%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Query 7:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "CustomerID", COUNT(*) AS "InvoiceCount"
   FROM "SalesInvoices"
   GROUP BY "CustomerID"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Use Database Command:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";
   ```

10. **Use Schema Command:**

    ```sql
    USE SCHEMA "SALES";
    ```

11. **Show Databases:**

    ```sql
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```

12. **Show Schemas in Database:**

    ```sql
    SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";
    ```

13. **Show Tables in Schema:**

    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "ADVENTUREWORKS"."SALES";
    ```

14. **Find Table Information:**

    ```sql
    SELECT TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
    FROM "ADVENTUREWORKS".INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
    WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'SalesInvoices';
    ```

15. **Fully Qualified Query Example:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "InvoiceLineID", "InvoiceID", "ExtendedPrice"
    FROM "ADVENTUREWORKS"."SALES"."SalesInvoiceLines"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Setting Context:** By using `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA`, you set the context for your session, so you don't need to fully qualify table names in your queries.

- **Adjusting Table Names:** Since SQL is case-sensitive when identifiers are enclosed in double quotes, ensure that the table and column names match exactly. In `ADVENTUREWORKS`, the tables might be named `"SalesInvoices"` and `"SalesInvoiceLines"`.

- **Using Correct Syntax:** Avoid using square brackets `[]` or placeholders in your SQL queries. If you need to use placeholders, they should be replaced with actual names before running the query.

---

**Note:**

- If you receive errors like `Object 'SalesInvoices' does not exist or not authorized`, it indicates that the table might not be present in the specified database and schema or you might not have the necessary permissions.

- To search for a table across all databases and schemas you have access to, you can use the following query (if you have the necessary permissions):

  ```sql
  SELECT TABLE_CATALOG AS "Database", TABLE_SCHEMA AS "Schema", TABLE_NAME AS "Table"
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES
  WHERE TABLE_NAME ILIKE '%INVOICE%';
  ```

  This query searches for any table containing "INVOICE" in its name.

---

**Finding the Correct Database and Schema:**

1. **List All Databases:**

   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

2. **For Each Database, List Schemas:**

   ```sql
   -- Replace "Database_Name" with each database name
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "Database_Name";
   ```

3. **For Each Schema, List Tables:**

   ```sql
   -- Replace "Database_Name" and "Schema_Name" with actual names
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "Database_Name"."Schema_Name";
   ```

4. **Search for Specific Tables Using INFORMATION_SCHEMA:**

   ```sql
   -- Replace "Database_Name" with the name of each database
   SELECT TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
   FROM "Database_Name".INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
   WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'SalesInvoices';
   ```

---

**Recommendations:**

- **Verify Object Names:** Ensure that the database, schema, table, and column names are correct and match those in your Snowflake account.

- **Permissions:** Check that you have the necessary permissions to access the databases and schemas.

- **Consult Documentation or Administrator:** If you're unable to locate the tables, consider reaching out to your database administrator or consult your organization's documentation for assistance.

2025-02-10 21:08:49 - root - INFO - I see that you're still encountering errors with your SQL queries. Let's address the issues step by step and help you resolve them.

---

### **Issue 1: Syntax Error Due to Square Brackets**

**Error Message:**

```
001003 (42000): SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 2 at position 8 unexpected '['.
```

**Explanation:**

- **Square Brackets `[]`:** In SQL, square brackets are not standard for placeholders or identifiers. In some SQL dialects (like SQL Server), square brackets are used to enclose identifiers that contain special characters or reserved words, but in Snowflake, identifiers are enclosed in double quotes `"`.
  
- **Placeholders:** Including `[Database_Name]` and `[Schema_Name]` directly in your SQL query causes a syntax error because the SQL parser doesn't recognize them as placeholders.

---

### **Issue 2: Multiple Statements Error**

**Error Message:**

```
000008 (0A000): Actual statement count 2 did not match the desired statement count 1.
```

**Explanation:**

- This error occurs when the SQL parser detects multiple statements but only a single statement is expected or allowed.
- **Comments:** The comment line `-- Replace [Database_Name] and [Schema_Name] with the correct names` may be causing the parser to interpret the comment and the query as two separate statements.

---

### **Steps to Resolve the Issues**

#### **1. Remove Square Brackets and Replace Placeholders**

You need to:

- **Remove the square brackets `[]`** around `Database_Name` and `Schema_Name`.
- **Replace `Database_Name` and `Schema_Name`** with the actual names of the database and schema where your `SALES_INVOICES` table is located.

#### **2. Properly Handle Comments**

- Ensure that your SQL client correctly recognizes comments starting with `--`.
- Alternatively, **remove the comment line** when running the SQL query to avoid confusion.

---

### **Finding the Correct Database and Schema**

From the `SHOW DATABASES;` output you provided, I notice several databases like `ADVENTUREWORKS`, `E_COMMERCE`, `CHINOOK`, etc. Since `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` is not present, we need to find out which database contains the `SALES_INVOICES` table.

#### **Step 1: List All Databases**

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

#### **Step 2: Loop Through Databases and Schemas to Find the Table**

For each database, perform the following steps:

##### **a. Show Schemas in the Database**

```sql
-- Replace 'Database_Name' with the actual database name
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "Database_Name";
```

##### **b. Show Tables in Each Schema**

For each schema in the database:

```sql
-- Replace 'Database_Name' and 'Schema_Name' with actual names
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "Database_Name"."Schema_Name";
```

##### **c. Look for `SALES_INVOICES` Table**

Check if the `SALES_INVOICES` table is listed in any of the schemas.

#### **Step 3: Search for the Table Using an Account Usage View**

If you have the necessary permissions, you can search across all databases:

```sql
SELECT
    table_catalog AS database_name,
    table_schema,
    table_name
FROM
    SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES
WHERE
    table_name = 'SALES_INVOICES'
    AND deleted IS NULL
ORDER BY
    database_name,
    table_schema;
```

**Note:** If you don't have access to `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES`, you can try the following for each database:

```sql
-- Replace 'Database_Name' with the actual database name
SELECT
    table_catalog,
    table_schema,
    table_name
FROM
    "Database_Name".INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE
    table_name = 'SALES_INVOICES';
```

---

### **Assuming the Table is in `ADVENTUREWORKS` Database**

Let's suppose you find that the `SALES_INVOICES` table is in the `ADVENTUREWORKS` database and the `SALES` schema.

#### **Set the Context**

```sql
USE DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";
USE SCHEMA "SALES";
```

#### **Run the Query Without Placeholders or Comments**

```sql
SELECT "InvoiceDate"
FROM "SALES_INVOICES"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Sample Corrected Queries**

Here are your corrected queries, assuming the database is `ADVENTUREWORKS` and the schema is `SALES`. **Please replace with the actual database and schema names if they are different.**

#### **1. Set Database and Schema Context**

```sql
USE DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";
USE SCHEMA "SALES";
```

#### **2. Query: Retrieve Invoice Dates**

```sql
SELECT "InvoiceDate"
FROM "SALES_INVOICES"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **3. Query: Retrieve Invoices from 2014**

```sql
SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
FROM "SALES_INVOICES"
WHERE "InvoiceDate" LIKE '2014-%'
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **4. Query: Retrieve Invoices Containing '2014' in Date**

```sql
SELECT "InvoiceID", "InvoiceDate"
FROM "SALES_INVOICES"
WHERE "InvoiceDate" LIKE '%2014%'
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **5. Query: Distinct Invoice Dates**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "InvoiceDate"
FROM "SALES_INVOICES"
WHERE "InvoiceDate" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **6. Query: Join Invoices with Invoice Lines**

```sql
SELECT inv."InvoiceID", inv."CustomerID", invline."ExtendedPrice"
FROM "SALES_INVOICES" AS inv
JOIN "SALES_INVOICELINES" AS invline
  ON inv."InvoiceID" = invline."InvoiceID"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **7. Query: Retrieve Invoice Details from 2014**

```sql
SELECT inv."CustomerID", inv."InvoiceDate", invline."ExtendedPrice"
FROM "SALES_INVOICES" AS inv
JOIN "SALES_INVOICELINES" AS invline
  ON inv."InvoiceID" = invline."InvoiceID"
WHERE inv."InvoiceDate" LIKE '2014-%'
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **8. Query: Count Invoices per Customer**

```sql
SELECT "CustomerID", COUNT(*) AS "InvoiceCount"
FROM "SALES_INVOICES"
GROUP BY "CustomerID"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Important Notes**

- **Remove Placeholders:** Ensure that you **remove placeholders** like `[Database_Name]` and `[Schema_Name]` from your SQL queries. Replace them with the actual names without square brackets.

- **Remove Comments When Running Queries:** Comments starting with `--` may cause issues in some SQL clients if not properly recognized. You may either remove the comment lines or ensure your client handles them correctly.

- **Case Sensitivity:** Snowflake is case-sensitive when identifiers are enclosed in double quotes `"`. Ensure that table and column names match exactly as they are defined in your database.

- **Permissions:** Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the databases, schemas, and tables.

---

### **If the `SALES_INVOICES` Table is Not Found**

If you cannot find the `SALES_INVOICES` table in any of your databases:

- **Check for Similar Tables:** Look for tables with similar names like `INVOICES`, `SALES`, `INVOICE_LINES`, etc.

- **Consult Documentation:** Check any documentation available for your Snowflake environment to identify where relevant sales and invoice data may be stored.

- **Reach Out to Administrator:** If you're unable to locate the necessary tables, it might be helpful to contact your database administrator or IT support for assistance.

---

### **Finding Tables with Similar Names**

You can search for tables containing 'INVOICE' in their names:

```sql
SELECT
    table_catalog AS database_name,
    table_schema,
    table_name
FROM
    SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES
WHERE
    table_name ILIKE '%INVOICE%'
    AND deleted IS NULL
ORDER BY
    database_name,
    table_schema;
```

---

### **Example: Adjusting the Query Based on New Table Names**

Suppose you find a table named `INVOICES` in the `E_COMMERCE` database and `PUBLIC` schema.

#### **Set the Context**

```sql
USE DATABASE "E_COMMERCE";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";
```

#### **Run the Query**

```sql
SELECT "InvoiceDate"
FROM "INVOICES"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Summary**

- **Remove placeholders and square brackets** from your SQL queries.
- **Replace placeholders with actual database and schema names**.
- **Remove or properly handle comments** in your SQL queries.
- **Set the correct database and schema context** before running your queries.
- **Ensure case sensitivity** matches in table and column names.
- **Search for the correct tables** if the expected ones are not found.

2025-02-10 21:11:06 - root - INFO - It appears that the table `"SALES_INVOICES"` does not exist in your current context, which is why you're receiving the error:

```
SQL compilation error:
Object 'SALES_INVOICES' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This suggests that:

- The table `"SALES_INVOICES"` doesn't exist in your database.
- The table is located in a different schema or database.
- You don't have the necessary permissions to access it.

Let's work through steps to identify the correct table and adjust your queries accordingly.

---

### **1. Verify Available Databases**

You've provided a list of databases. From the partial output, we can see databases like:

- `ADVENTUREWORKS`
- `CHINOOK`
- `ECOMMERCE`
- `E_COMMERCE`
- `SALES_DB` (if available)

Since `WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS` is not in your database list, we'll need to look for similar databases that might contain sales and invoice data.

---

### **2. Search for Relevant Tables**

#### **a. Set the Database Context**

Let's try using the `ADVENTUREWORKS` database, which is a common sample database containing sales data.

```sql
USE DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";
```

#### **b. List Schemas in the Database**

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";
```

Look for schemas that might contain sales data, such as `SALES`, `PUBLIC`, or others.

#### **c. Set the Schema Context**

Suppose the relevant schema is `SALES`:

```sql
USE SCHEMA "SALES";
```

#### **d. List Tables in the Schema**

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "ADVENTUREWORKS"."SALES";
```

#### **e. Search for Tables Containing 'INVOICE'**

If the `SHOW TABLES` command doesn't reveal a table named `"SALES_INVOICES"`, try searching for tables with names that include `'INVOICE'` or `'ORDER'`:

```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'SALES'
  AND (TABLE_NAME LIKE '%INVOICE%' OR TABLE_NAME LIKE '%ORDER%');
```

---

### **3. Adjust Your Queries Based on Available Tables**

Assuming you find tables like `"SalesOrderHeader"` and `"SalesOrderDetail"`, you can adjust your queries:

#### **a. Query to Retrieve Order Dates**

```sql
SELECT "OrderDate"
FROM "SalesOrderHeader"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **b. Query to Retrieve Orders from 2014**

```sql
SELECT "SalesOrderID", "CustomerID", "OrderDate"
FROM "SalesOrderHeader"
WHERE "OrderDate" BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2014-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **c. Query to Join Orders with Order Details**

```sql
SELECT h."SalesOrderID", h."CustomerID", h."OrderDate", d."LineTotal"
FROM "SalesOrderHeader" AS h
JOIN "SalesOrderDetail" AS d
  ON h."SalesOrderID" = d."SalesOrderID"
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **d. Query to Retrieve Orders from 2014 with Details**

```sql
SELECT h."CustomerID", h."OrderDate", d."LineTotal"
FROM "SalesOrderHeader" AS h
JOIN "SalesOrderDetail" AS d
  ON h."SalesOrderID" = d."SalesOrderID"
WHERE h."OrderDate" BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2014-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **e. Query to Count Orders per Customer**

```sql
SELECT "CustomerID", COUNT(*) AS "OrderCount"
FROM "SalesOrderHeader"
GROUP BY "CustomerID"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **4. Compute the Median Average Monthly Spending**

Using the available tables, you can adjust your original task:

#### **SQL Query to Calculate Median Average Monthly Spending**

```sql
WITH monthly_spending AS (
    SELECT
        h."CustomerID",
        DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', h."OrderDate") AS "Month",
        SUM(d."LineTotal") AS "MonthlyTotal"
    FROM "SalesOrderHeader" AS h
    JOIN "SalesOrderDetail" AS d
        ON h."SalesOrderID" = d."SalesOrderID"
    WHERE h."OrderDate" BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2014-12-31'
    GROUP BY h."CustomerID", DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', h."OrderDate")
),
customer_avg_spending AS (
    SELECT
        "CustomerID",
        AVG("MonthlyTotal") AS "AverageMonthlySpending"
    FROM monthly_spending
    GROUP BY "CustomerID"
),
customer_spending_values AS (
    SELECT
        "AverageMonthlySpending"
    FROM customer_avg_spending
)
SELECT
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY "AverageMonthlySpending") AS "MedianAverageMonthlySpending"
FROM customer_spending_values;
```

---

### **5. Verify Table and Column Names**

Ensure that:

- The table names (`"SalesOrderHeader"`, `"SalesOrderDetail"`) are correct.
- The column names (`"CustomerID"`, `"OrderDate"`, `"LineTotal"`) match your database schema.

List columns in a table to verify:

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE "SalesOrderHeader";
DESCRIBE TABLE "SalesOrderDetail";
```

---

### **6. If Tables Are Not Found in `ADVENTUREWORKS`**

If the tables aren't in `ADVENTUREWORKS`, try the following databases:

#### **Check `ECOMMERCE` Database**

```sql
USE DATABASE "ECOMMERCE";
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "ECOMMERCE";
USE SCHEMA "YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME"; -- Replace with the appropriate schema name
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "ECOMMERCE"."YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME";
```

Search for tables with names like `%ORDER%`, `%INVOICE%`, or `%SALE%`.

---

### **7. General Approach to Finding Tables**

#### **a. List All Databases**

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

#### **b. For Each Database, List Schemas**

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "Database_Name";
```

#### **c. For Each Schema, List Tables**

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "Database_Name"."Schema_Name";
```

#### **d. Search for Tables with Specific Names**

Within each database, you can search for tables:

```sql
SELECT TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
FROM "Database_Name".INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_NAME LIKE '%INVOICE%'
   OR TABLE_NAME LIKE '%ORDER%'
   OR TABLE_NAME LIKE '%SALE%';
```

---

### **8. If You Still Can't Find the Tables**

- **Consult Documentation:** Check your organization's data catalog or documentation to find where sales data is stored.
- **Contact Database Administrator:** They can provide insights into the correct database and schema or provision access if needed.
- **Check Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the databases and schemas.

---

### **9. Use Available Sample Data**

If you have access to Snowflake's sample data (`SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA`), you can explore datasets like `TPCDS_SF100TCL` or `TPCH_SF100TCL`, which contain sales and orders data.

Example:

```sql
USE DATABASE SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA;
USE SCHEMA TPCDS_SF100TCL;

SELECT "ss_sold_date_sk", "ss_customer_sk", "ss_ext_sales_price"
FROM "STORE_SALES"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **10. Summary**

- **Error Reason:** The table `"SALES_INVOICES"` does not exist in your current context.
- **Solution:** Find the correct table by exploring your databases and schemas.
- **Adjust Queries:** Modify your queries to use the tables and columns that are available.
- **Verify Names:** Always check that you're using the correct table and column names.
- **Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the data.
- **Assistance:** Don't hesitate to reach out to your database administrator for help.

- **Table Not Present:** The table `"SalesOrderHeader"` might not exist in the `ADVENTUREWORKS` database you are using.
- **Different Schema:** The table might be located in a different schema within the database.
- **Naming Differences:** The table might have a different name or casing.
- **Permissions:** You might not have the required permissions to access the table.

---

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

#### **1. Verify Schemas in the Database**

Since you've successfully set the database to `ADVENTUREWORKS`, let's list all the schemas within it to identify where your tables might be located.

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";
```

This command will display all schemas available in the `ADVENTUREWORKS` database.

#### **2. Set the Correct Schema**

From the list of schemas obtained, identify the schema that likely contains the sales data. Common schema names in `ADVENTUREWORKS` include:

- `"SalesLT"`
- `"Person"`
- `"Production"`
- `"Purchasing"`

Suppose the sales data is in the `"SalesLT"` schema. You can set the schema context:

```sql
USE SCHEMA "SalesLT";
```

#### **3. List Tables in the Schema**

After setting the schema, list all tables to find the exact table names:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "ADVENTUREWORKS"."SalesLT";
```

This will help you identify the tables available and their exact names.

#### **4. Identify the Correct Table Name**

Look for tables that might contain sales orders or invoices. Common table names in `ADVENTUREWORKS` might include:

- `"SalesOrderHeader"`
- `"SalesOrderDetail"`
- `"Customer"`

Ensure you note the exact casing and spelling of the table names, as Snowflake is case-sensitive when using double quotes.

#### **5. Verify Table Columns**

Once you've identified a potential table, verify its columns:

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE "SalesOrderHeader";
```

Check if the columns `"SalesOrderID"` and `"OrderDate"` exist. Adjust your queries according to the actual column names.

#### **6. Adjust Your Query**

With the correct schema and table names, adjust your query. For example:

```sql
SELECT "SalesOrderID", "OrderDate"
FROM "SalesOrderHeader"
WHERE YEAR("OrderDate") = 2014
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:** The `YEAR()` function extracts the year from a date. Using `LIKE '%2014%'` might not work if the date is stored in a date or datetime data type.

#### **7. Example of Adjusted Query**

Assuming the table and columns exist, your adjusted query would be:

```sql
-- Set the database and schema context
USE DATABASE "ADVENTUREWORKS";
USE SCHEMA "SalesLT";

-- Retrieve sales orders from 2014
SELECT "SalesOrderID", "OrderDate"
FROM "SalesOrderHeader"
WHERE YEAR("OrderDate") = 2014
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **If the Table Still Does Not Exist**

If, after following the above steps, the table `"SalesOrderHeader"` still does not exist, it's possible that:

- The `ADVENTUREWORKS` database in your environment does not contain the sales tables.
- The tables are named differently.
- The data is located in a different database.

#### **Alternative Steps:**

**a. List All Databases:**

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

Review the list of databases to see if there is another database that might contain the sales data you need.

**b. Explore Other Databases:**

If you find a database named `"E_COMMERCE"` or similar, you can try setting it as your current database:

```sql
USE DATABASE "E_COMMERCE";
```

Then, repeat the steps to list schemas and tables.

**c. Use Snowflake Sample Data:**

Snowflake provides sample data in the `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA` database.

```sql
USE DATABASE "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA";
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA";
```

You can explore schemas like `"TPCDS_SF100TCL"` which contain sales data.

---

### **Final Recommendation**

Given that the required tables are not found in your current database, I recommend:

- **Consulting Documentation:** Check your organization's data catalog or documentation to identify where the sales or invoice data is stored.
- **Contacting Database Administrator:** Reach out to your database administrator or IT support team to get assistance in locating the necessary data.
- **Verifying Permissions:** Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the databases and schemas that contain the sales data.

---

### **Summary**

- **Error Explanation:** The table `"SalesOrderHeader"` does not exist or you're not authorized to access it.
- **Solution:** Verify the correct schema and table names in the `ADVENTUREWORKS` database or other databases.
- **Next Steps:** Consult documentation or administrators to locate the relevant data.

2025-02-10 21:15:59 - root - INFO - It looks like you're encountering an error when trying to use the schema `"TPCH_SF1"` in the `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA` database.

**Error Message:**

```
002043 (02000): ... SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

**Explanation:**

This error occurs because the schema `"TPCH_SF1"` does not exist in the `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA` database in your account, or you don't have the necessary permissions to access it.

---

### **Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

#### **1. List Available Schemas in `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA`**

First, let's check which schemas are available in the `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA` database:

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA";
```

This command will list all the schemas you have access to within the `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA` database.

#### **2. Identify an Available Schema**

From the output of the `SHOW SCHEMAS` command, look for schemas that are available in your environment. Common schemas in `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA` include:

- `TPCH_SF1`
- `TPCH_SF10`
- `TPCH_SF100`
- `TPCDS_SF1`
- `TPCDS_SF10`
- `TPCDS_SF100`

If you don't see `TPCH_SF1`, but you have another similar schema, you can use that instead.

#### **3. Use an Available Schema**

Suppose you have the schema `TPCH_SF10` available. You can set your schema context to it:

```sql
USE SCHEMA "TPCH_SF10";
```

#### **4. Verify Tables in the Schema**

Once you've set the schema, list the tables to verify the existence of the required tables:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

Look for tables like `"ORDERS"` and `"LINEITEM"`.

#### **5. Adjust Your Queries to Use the Available Schema**

Now, you can adjust your queries to use the available schema and proceed.

---

### **Corrected SQL Queries Using Available Schema**

Assuming you have access to the `TPCH_SF10` schema in the `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA` database, here are the corrected SQL queries:

**Set Database and Schema Context:**

```sql
USE DATABASE "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA";
USE SCHEMA "TPCH_SF10";
```

**Query 1: Retrieve Distinct Order Dates**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "O_ORDERDATE" AS "OrderDate"
FROM "ORDERS"
WHERE "O_ORDERDATE" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

**Query 2: Join Orders and Line Items**

```sql
SELECT ord."O_ORDERKEY" AS "SalesOrderID", ord."O_CUSTKEY" AS "CustomerID", line."L_EXTENDEDPRICE" AS "LineTotal"
FROM "ORDERS" AS ord
JOIN "LINEITEM" AS line
  ON ord."O_ORDERKEY" = line."L_ORDERKEY"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Query 3: Retrieve Orders from a Specific Year (e.g., 1996)**

```sql
SELECT ord."O_CUSTKEY" AS "CustomerID", ord."O_ORDERDATE" AS "OrderDate", line."L_EXTENDEDPRICE" AS "LineTotal"
FROM "ORDERS" AS ord
JOIN "LINEITEM" AS line
  ON ord."O_ORDERKEY" = line."L_ORDERKEY"
WHERE YEAR(ord."O_ORDERDATE") = 1996
LIMIT 100;
```

**Query 4: Count Orders per Customer**

```sql
SELECT "O_CUSTKEY" AS "CustomerID", COUNT(*) AS "OrderCount"
FROM "ORDERS"
GROUP BY "O_CUSTKEY"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Query 5: List All Databases**

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

**Query 6: Show Schemas in a Database**

*(Already done earlier, but included for completeness)*

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA";
```

**Query 7: Show Tables in the Current Schema**

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

**Query 8: Search for Tables with Names Containing 'ORDER'**

```sql
SELECT TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_NAME LIKE '%ORDER%';
```

---

### **Explanation for the Corrections**

- **Schema Availability:** The original error was due to the schema `"TPCH_SF1"` not existing in your environment. By listing the available schemas, you can find an alternative, such as `"TPCH_SF10"`.

- **Adjusting Queries:** Once you set the database and schema to ones that exist in your environment, you can proceed with your queries using the tables available in that schema.

- **Ensuring Table Names Are Correct:** In the sample data, table names like `"ORDERS"` and `"LINEITEM"` are commonly used. Make sure to use the exact table names as they appear in your schema.

---

### **Alternative Approach Using Your Own Databases**

If the sample data does not contain the needed tables or you're unable to access it, you can explore your own databases.

**List Your Databases:**

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

Review the list to find databases that might contain sales data—such as `ADVENTUREWORKS`, `ECOMMERCE`, `CHINOOK`, etc.

**Set Database and Schema Context:**

For example, using `ECOMMERCE`:

```sql
USE DATABASE "ECOMMERCE";
USE SCHEMA "PUBLIC";  -- or another schema that exists
```

**List Tables in the Schema:**

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

**Search for Tables with Names Containing 'ORDER' or 'INVOICE':**

```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_NAME LIKE '%ORDER%'
   OR TABLE_NAME LIKE '%INVOICE%';
```

**Adjust Queries Accordingly:**

If you find tables like `"ORDERS"`, `"ORDER_DETAILS"`, or `"INVOICES"`, you can adjust your queries to use those tables.

---

### **Final Notes**

- **Check Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the databases, schemas, and tables.

- **Use Correct Object Names:** Make sure to use the exact names of the databases, schemas, tables, and columns as they exist in your environment.

- **Consult Documentation or Administrator:** If you're unable to locate the necessary data, consider reaching out to your database administrator or consulting your organization's documentation.

2025-02-10 21:46:20 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of columns that do not exist in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` view. Specifically, the column `"OWNER"` and several others are not available in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`, which is why you receive the error:

```
000904 (42000): ... SQL compilation error: invalid identifier 'OWNER'
```

Additionally, you might not have access to `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` views, which contain more detailed account-level metadata.

To resolve this issue, you should select only the columns that exist in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` view. Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    "CREATED" AS "created_on",
    "TABLE_NAME" AS "name",
    "TABLE_CATALOG" AS "database_name",
    "TABLE_SCHEMA" AS "schema_name",
    "TABLE_TYPE" AS "kind",
    "COMMENT",
    "ROW_COUNT" AS "rows",
    "BYTES",
    "RETENTION_TIME",
    "IS_EXTERNAL"
FROM "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
WHERE "TABLE_SCHEMA" = 'TPCH_SF1';
```

**Explanation:**

- Removed columns that do not exist in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`:
  - `"OWNER"`
  - `"CLUSTERING_KEY"`
  - `"AUTO_CLUSTERING_ON"`
  - `"CHANGE_TRACKING"`
  - `"SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION"`
  - `"SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_PROGRESS"`
  - `"SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_BYTES"`
  - `"ENABLE_SCHEMA_EVOLUTION"`
  - `"OWNER_ROLE_TYPE"`
  - `"IS_EVENT_TABLE"`
  - `"BUDGET"`
  - `"IS_HYBRID"`
  - `"IS_ICEBERG"`
  - `"IS_DYNAMIC"`
  - `"IS_IMMUTABLE"`

- Retained only the valid columns available in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` view provides metadata about tables accessible to the current user in the database.
- If you require more detailed metadata that includes columns like `"OWNER"`, you would typically query `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES`. However, access to `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` views may require additional permissions that you might not have.
- Since you're receiving the error `Schema 'SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE' does not exist or not authorized.`, it's likely that you don't have access to that schema.

**Steps Forward:**

- Use the corrected SQL query provided above to retrieve the table metadata.
- If you need access to additional metadata not available in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`, consider reaching out to your Snowflake administrator to request access to `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` views.
- Always ensure that the columns you reference in your queries exist in the views or tables you're querying.

**Example of Running the Corrected Query:**

```sql
-- Set the database context
USE DATABASE "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA";

-- Run the corrected query
SELECT
    "CREATED" AS "created_on",
    "TABLE_NAME" AS "name",
    "TABLE_CATALOG" AS "database_name",
    "TABLE_SCHEMA" AS "schema_name",
    "TABLE_TYPE" AS "kind",
    "COMMENT",
    "ROW_COUNT" AS "rows",
    "BYTES",
    "RETENTION_TIME",
    "IS_EXTERNAL"
FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
WHERE "TABLE_SCHEMA" = 'TPCH_SF1';
```

**Expected Output:**

This query will return metadata about the tables in the `TPCH_SF1` schema within the `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA` database, including when they were created, their names, row counts, and other available information.

2025-02-10 21:48:06 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering errors due to the use of a column that does not exist in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` view, and issues with setting the schema.

---

### **Issue 1: Invalid Identifier 'IS_EXTERNAL'**

**Error Message:**

```
SQL compilation error: error line 11 at position 4
invalid identifier 'IS_EXTERNAL'
```

**Explanation:**

The column `"IS_EXTERNAL"` does not exist in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` view in Snowflake. This is why you're receiving the "invalid identifier" error.

**Solution:**

Remove the `"IS_EXTERNAL"` column from your `SELECT` statement.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    "CREATED" AS "created_on",
    "TABLE_NAME" AS "name",
    "TABLE_CATALOG" AS "database_name",
    "TABLE_SCHEMA" AS "schema_name",
    "TABLE_TYPE" AS "kind",
    "COMMENT",
    "ROW_COUNT" AS "rows",
    "BYTES",
    "RETENTION_TIME"
FROM "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
WHERE "TABLE_SCHEMA" = 'TPCH_SF1';
```

---

### **Issue 2: Error When Using Schema 'TPCH_SF1'**

**Error Message:**

```
SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

**Explanation:**

This error occurs when you try to execute:

```sql
USE SCHEMA "TPCH_SF1";
```

This suggests that the schema `"TPCH_SF1"` does not exist in the current database context or you don't have the necessary permissions to access it.

**Solution:**

1. **Fully Qualify the Schema Name:**

   Use the fully qualified schema name including the database:

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCH_SF1";
   ```

2. **Verify the Schema Exists:**

   Check if the schema exists in the `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA` database:

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA";
   ```

   Ensure that `"TPCH_SF1"` is listed.

3. **Check Your Permissions:**

   Verify that you have access to the schema. If you don't see `"TPCH_SF1"` in the list of schemas, you might not have the necessary permissions.

---

### **Recommended Steps:**

**1. Set the Database Context:**

```sql
USE DATABASE "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA";
```

**2. Set the Schema Context:**

```sql
USE SCHEMA "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCH_SF1";
```

**3. Run the Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    "CREATED" AS "created_on",
    "TABLE_NAME" AS "name",
    "TABLE_CATALOG" AS "database_name",
    "TABLE_SCHEMA" AS "schema_name",
    "TABLE_TYPE" AS "kind",
    "COMMENT",
    "ROW_COUNT" AS "rows",
    "BYTES",
    "RETENTION_TIME"
FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
WHERE "TABLE_SCHEMA" = 'TPCH_SF1';
```

---

### **Additional Notes:**

- **Case Sensitivity:** Ensure that you use the exact casing for database and schema names. Snowflake is case-sensitive when identifiers are enclosed in double quotes.

- **Check Schema Existence:**

  Run the following command to list all schemas in the `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA` database:

  ```sql
  SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA";
  ```

  You should see output similar to:

  ```
  name
  ---------------------------
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA
  TPCDS_SF100TCL
  TPCDS_SF10TCL
  TPCH_SF1
  TPCH_SF10
  TPCH_SF100
  TPCH_SF1000
  ```

  Ensure that `"TPCH_SF1"` is listed.

- **Verify Permissions:**

  If you cannot access the schema after using the fully qualified name, you may not have the necessary permissions. Contact your database administrator to verify your access rights.

---

### **Example of Setting Context and Running the Query:**

```sql
-- Set the database context
USE DATABASE "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA";

-- Set the schema context
USE SCHEMA "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCH_SF1";

-- Run the query
SELECT
    "CREATED" AS "created_on",
    "TABLE_NAME" AS "name",
    "TABLE_CATALOG" AS "database_name",
    "TABLE_SCHEMA" AS "schema_name",
    "TABLE_TYPE" AS "kind",
    "COMMENT",
    "ROW_COUNT" AS "rows",
    "BYTES",
    "RETENTION_TIME"
FROM "INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES"
WHERE "TABLE_SCHEMA" = 'TPCH_SF1';
```

---

### **Alternative Without Changing Schema Context:**

If you continue to face issues setting the schema, you can run your queries without changing the schema context by fully qualifying the table names.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT
    "O_ORDERKEY" AS "SalesOrderID",
    "O_ORDERDATE" AS "OrderDate"
FROM "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCH_SF1"."ORDERS"
WHERE YEAR("O_ORDERDATE") = 1996
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Summary:**

- **Remove the `"IS_EXTERNAL"` Column:** The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` view does not include an `"IS_EXTERNAL"` column.

- **Fully Qualify Schema Names:** Use `"SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCH_SF1"` when referencing the schema, especially if encountering issues.

- **Check Schema Existence and Permissions:** Ensure the schema exists and you have the necessary permissions.

Relevant tables and columns:

- **Table:** `SALES_INVOICES`
  - `"InvoiceID"`: Unique identifier for each invoice.
  - `"CustomerID"`: Identifies the customer associated with the invoice.
  - `"InvoiceDate"`: Date of the invoice. Used to filter invoices in the year 2014 and determine the month.

- **Table:** `SALES_INVOICELINES`
  - `"InvoiceLineID"`: Unique identifier for each invoice line.
  - `"InvoiceID"`: Used to join with `SALES_INVOICES`.
  - `"ExtendedPrice"`: Total price for each invoice line. Used to sum up the amounts per customer per month.

- **Table:** `SALES_CUSTOMERS`
  - `"CustomerID"`: Unique identifier for each customer.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter invoices where the `"InvoiceDate"` falls within the year 2014.
- Extract the month from `"InvoiceDate"` to group data by month.
- Join `SALES_INVOICES` and `SALES_INVOICELINES` on `"InvoiceID"` to relate invoice headers with their lines.
- Sum `"ExtendedPrice"` per customer per month to calculate total spending.

---

Here are 10 SQL queries to explore the relevant data:

1. **Retrieve a sample of invoices with their dates and customer IDs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get a list of distinct customer IDs from invoices:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "CustomerID"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **View invoice lines with their extended prices:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceLineID", "InvoiceID", "ExtendedPrice"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICELINES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Examine the format of invoice dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceDate"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Select invoices from the year 2014 using a date pattern:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "CustomerID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICES"
   WHERE "InvoiceDate" LIKE '2014-%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find invoices where the date contains '2014':**
   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceID", "InvoiceDate"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICES"
   WHERE "InvoiceDate" LIKE '%2014%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List distinct invoice dates to check date variability:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "InvoiceDate"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICES"
   WHERE "InvoiceDate" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Join invoices with invoice lines to see extended prices per invoice:**
   ```sql
   SELECT inv."InvoiceID", inv."CustomerID", invline."ExtendedPrice"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICES" AS inv
   JOIN WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICELINES" AS invline
   ON inv."InvoiceID" = invline."InvoiceID"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Extract invoice lines for invoices from 2014:**
   ```sql
   SELECT inv."CustomerID", inv."InvoiceDate", invline."ExtendedPrice"
   FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICES" AS inv
   JOIN WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICELINES" AS invline
   ON inv."InvoiceID" = invline."InvoiceID"
   WHERE inv."InvoiceDate" LIKE '2014-%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count the number of invoices per customer:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "CustomerID", COUNT(*) AS "InvoiceCount"
    FROM WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS.WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS."SALES_INVOICES"
    GROUP BY "CustomerID"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries will help in understanding the data within the relevant tables and assist in formulating the final solution to calculate the median of the average monthly spending across all customers for the year 2014.Query:

Task: Using the invoice date to determine each month of the year 2014, and summing the total invoice line amounts for each customer across these months, what is the median of the resulting average monthly spending across all customers?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
median_average_monthly_spending
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine the median of the average monthly spending across all customers for the year 2014, we need to:
1. For each customer, sum the invoice line amounts for each month in 2014.
2. Calculate the average monthly spending for each customer (total spending divided by 12 months).
3. Compile the average monthly spendings of all customers.
4. Find the median value among these averages.

Since we don't have the actual data, the median average monthly spending is represented as `value:float`..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS': {'WIDE_WORLD_IMPORTERS': ['APPLICATION_DELIVERYMETHODS', 'SALES_CUSTOMERTRANSACTIONS', 'SALES_ORDERLINES', 'WAREHOUSE_STOCKITEMSTOCKGROUPS', 'WAREHOUSE_VEHICLETEMPERATURES', 'PURCHASING_SUPPLIERCATEGORIES', 'APPLICATION_PAYMENTMETHODS', 'APPLICATION_PEOPLE', 'APPLICATION_SYSTEMPARAMETERS', 'SALES_BUYINGGROUPS', 'SALES_CUSTOMERCATEGORIES', 'SALES_CUSTOMERS', 'SALES_INVOICES', 'WAREHOUSE_STOCKITEMHOLDINGS', 'WAREHOUSE_STOCKITEMS', 'WAREHOUSE_STOCKGROUPS', 'SALES_SPECIALDEALS', 'APPLICATION_COUNTRIES', 'APPLICATION_STATEPROVINCES', 'APPLICATION_TRANSACTIONTYPES', 'PURCHASING_SUPPLIERS', 'SALES_ORDERS', 'WAREHOUSE_COLORS', 'WAREHOUSE_STOCKITEMTRANSACTIONS', 'PURCHASING_PURCHASEORDER', 'APPLICATION_CITIES', 'PURCHASING_PURCHASEORDERLINES', 'PURCHASING_SUPPLIERTRANSACTIONS', 'SALES_INVOICELINES', 'WAREHOUSE_COLDROOMTEMPERATURES', 'WAREHOUSE_PACKAGETYPES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 21:53:30 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Using the invoice date to determine each month of the year 2014, and summing the total invoice line amounts for each customer across these months, what is the median of the resulting average monthly spending across all customers?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
median_average_monthly_spending
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine the median of the average monthly spending across all customers for the year 2014, we need to:
1. For each customer, sum the invoice line amounts for each month in 2014.
2. Calculate the average monthly spending for each customer (total spending divided by 12 months).
3. Compile the average monthly spendings of all customers.
4. Find the median value among these averages.

Since we don't have the actual data, the median average monthly spending is represented as `value:float`. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
