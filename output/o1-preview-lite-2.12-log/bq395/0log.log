**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_hud_pit_homelessness.hud_pit_by_coc`
  - **CoC_Number**: Contains the Continuum of Care codes. The first two characters represent the state's abbreviation, which can be used to identify the state.
  - **Unsheltered_Homeless_Individuals**: Number of unsheltered homeless individuals per CoC.
  - **Count_Year**: The year when the count was recorded. Used to filter data for 2015 and 2018.

**Potential Conditions:**

- **Count_Year = 2015 or 2018**: To focus on the years relevant to the task.
- **Grouping by State Abbreviation**: Extracted from `CoC_Number` to aggregate data at the state level.

**Explanation:**

By executing these queries step by step, we understand the data structure and compute the necessary values to determine the top 5 states whose percentage change in unsheltered homeless individuals from 2015 to 2018 are closest to the national average.

The final query (Query 14) provides the required state abbreviations by calculating the percentage change per state, comparing it with the national percentage change, and then selecting the states with the smallest absolute difference.

**Note:** Actual state abbreviations and numerical values are not provided since we are not executing the queries but illustrating the approach.Query:

Task: Which 5 states' percentage change in unsheltered homeless individuals from 2015 to 2018 were top 5 closest to the national average? Please provide the state abbreviation.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
State_Abbreviation
state1:str
state2:str
state3:str
state4:str
state5:str
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

**Explanation:**

To identify the 5 states whose percentage change in unsheltered homeless individuals from 2015 to 2018 were closest to the national average, the following steps were undertaken:

1. **Data Extraction**: Retrieved data on unsheltered homeless individuals for each state for the years 2015 and 2018 from the `hud_pit_by_coc` table in the `sdoh_hud_pit_homelessness` schema.

2. **State Grouping**: Mapped each Continuum of Care (CoC) to its corresponding state using the first two letters of the `CoC_Number`, which represent the state abbreviation.

3. **Calculating State Totals**: Summed the `Unsheltered_Homeless_Individuals` counts for all CoCs within each state for both 2015 and 2018.

4. **Percentage Change Calculation**: For each state, calculated the percentage change using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Count}_{2018} - \text{Count}_{2015}}{\text{Count}_{2015}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   - Handled cases where the 2015 count was zero to avoid division by zero errors.

5. **National Average Computation**: Calculated the national average percentage change by summing the counts of all states and applying the same formula.

6. **Difference Assessment**: Determined the absolute difference between each state's percentage change and the national average.

7. **Selection of States**: Ranked the states based on the smallest absolute differences and selected the top 5 closest to the national average.

**Note**: Since the specific data is not provided, placeholder state abbreviations are used in the answer..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
