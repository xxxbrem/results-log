2025-01-20 05:42:07 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the misuse of the `TO_VARCHAR` function with a numeric input and a date format model. In your query, `"grant_date"` is a numeric field stored in the format `YYYYMMDD` (e.g., `20090113` for January 13, 2009). The `TO_VARCHAR` function expects a date or timestamp data type when a format model like `'YYYY'` is provided, not a number.

**Error Explanation:**

- **Error Message:**
  ```
  Bad output format model 'YYYY' for FIXED: invalid numeric format keyword: 'YYYY'
  ```

- **Cause:**
  Applying `TO_VARCHAR` with a date format model (`'YYYY'`) directly to a numeric field (`"grant_date"`) leads to this error, as the function doesn't know how to interpret the number in terms of a date without explicit conversion.

**Solution:**

To fix this error, you need to:

1. **Convert the Numeric "grant_date" to a Date:**

   Use the `TO_DATE` function to convert the numeric `"grant_date"` to a `DATE` data type. Since `"grant_date"` is in `YYYYMMDD` format, you can convert it by first casting it to a string and then specifying the format model.

   ```sql
   TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD')
   ```

2. **Extract the Year from the Date:**

   Use the `EXTRACT` function or the `YEAR` function to get the year from the date.

   ```sql
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD'))
   ```

   **Or**

   ```sql
   YEAR(TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD'))
   ```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected query that should work without errors:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD')) AS "grant_year", COUNT(*) AS "patent_count"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US' 
  AND "kind_code" = 'B2' 
  AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
GROUP BY "grant_year"
ORDER BY "grant_year"
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Alternate using `TO_CHAR`:**

Alternatively, you can convert the date to a string representation of the year using `TO_CHAR`:

```sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD'), 'YYYY') AS "grant_year", COUNT(*) AS "patent_count"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US' 
  AND "kind_code" = 'B2' 
  AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
GROUP BY "grant_year"
ORDER BY "grant_year"
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD'):**
  - Converts the numeric `"grant_date"` to a `DATE` data type.
  - `::VARCHAR` casts the number to a string, which `TO_DATE` can interpret.
  - `'YYYYMMDD'` specifies the format of the input string.

- **EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ...):**
  - Extracts the year component from the date.

- **TO_CHAR(..., 'YYYY'):**
  - Converts the date back to a string formatted as `'YYYY'`, which is useful if you want the `grant_year` as a string.

**Additional Note:**

Ensure that the `"grant_date"` values are valid dates and that there are no null or improperly formatted entries. If necessary, you can add a condition to exclude or handle invalid dates.

**Revised Query for Null or Invalid Dates:**

If there may be null or invalid dates, consider adding a condition:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE("grant_date"::VARCHAR, 'YYYYMMDD')) AS "grant_year", COUNT(*) AS "patent_count"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "country_code" = 'US' 
  AND "kind_code" = 'B2' 
  AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
  AND "grant_date" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "grant_year"
ORDER BY "grant_year"
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Summary:**

- Convert numeric dates to actual `DATE` types before formatting or extracting components.
- Use the appropriate functions (`TO_DATE`, `EXTRACT`, `TO_CHAR`) for date manipulations.
- Always ensure data types match the expected input for functions in SQL to avoid errors.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `PUBLICATIONS`
  - `"country_code"`: Potential usage - To filter for US patents (`'US'`).
  - `"kind_code"`: Potential usage - To filter for B2 patents (`'B2'`).
  - `"grant_date"`: Potential usage - To filter patents granted between 2008 and 2018.
  - `"claims_localized"`: Potential usage - To extract and inspect claims text for the absence of the word 'claim'.
  - `"publication_number"`: Potential usage - To identify individual patents.
  - `"title_localized"`: Potential usage - To view patent titles.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `"country_code" = 'US'`
- `"kind_code" = 'B2'`
- `"grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231"` (Assuming date format is `YYYYMMDD`)
- Claims that **do not include** the word 'claim': Requires inspecting `"claims_localized"` contents.

   SELECT "publication_number", "grant_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Retrieve publication numbers and claims for US B2 patents:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "claims_localized"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Flatten `claims_localized` to examine individual claims:**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", f.value::STRING AS "claim_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Retrieve publication numbers where claims include the word 'claim':**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", f.value::STRING AS "claim_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
   WHERE f.value::STRING ILIKE '%claim%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Retrieve publication numbers where claims do not include the word 'claim':**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."publication_number", f.value::STRING AS "claim_text"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
   WHERE f.value::STRING NOT ILIKE '%claim%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **View the structure of `claims_localized` field:**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."claims_localized") f
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Retrieve titles for US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "title_localized"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Count the number of US B2 patents per year between 2008 and 2018:**

    ```sql
    SELECT TO_VARCHAR("grant_date", 'YYYY') AS "grant_year", COUNT(*) AS "patent_count"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "grant_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231
    GROUP BY "grant_year"
    ORDER BY "grant_year"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Check if `claims_localized` is populated for US B2 patents:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "publication_number", "claims_localized"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "country_code" = 'US' AND "kind_code" = 'B2' AND "claims_localized" IS NOT NULL

When the integrated circuit is under at-speed scan test mode of operation, the clock generation circuit receives a scan-clock signal to scan in a test vector to the scannable flip-flops during an input shift phase when shifting is enabled and to scan out a resultant vector from the scannable flip-flops during an output shift phase when shifting is also enabled. However, when shifting is not enabled during a capture phase between the two shift phases, the scan-clock signal triggers a 2-pulse circuit to release two pulses during the capture phase of at-speed scan testing. The two pulses from the 2-pulse circuit are based on an internal PLL-based clock signal. The clock generation circuit may be utilized in single or multiple clock domain systems. In a multiple clock domain environment, separate scan-clock signals may be sent to individual clock domains within an integrated circuit and only the domain to be acted on by a test vector has its respective scan-clock pulsed during the capture phase."",

Task: How many US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 contain claims that do not include the word 'claim'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 that contain claims not including the word 'claim', the result is presented in the following format:

```csv
number_of_patents
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 that contain claims not including the word 'claim', the result is presented in the following format:

```csv
number_of_patents
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
