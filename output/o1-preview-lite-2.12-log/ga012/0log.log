Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we'll begin by identifying the relevant tables and columns, list potential conditions, and then provide at least 10 BigQuery SQL queries ranging from simple to complex to explore and analyze the data.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Tables:**
  - `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130`

- **Columns:**

  - `event_date`: Used to filter events on November 30, 2020.
    - **Usage:** `event_date = '20201130'`

  - `event_name`: Identifies the type of event (e.g., 'purchase').
    - **Usage:** `event_name = 'purchase'`

  - `ecommerce` (STRUCT):
    - `tax_value_in_usd`: The tax value in USD.
      - **Usage:** Used to calculate tax rate.
    - `purchase_revenue_in_usd`: The purchase revenue in USD.
      - **Usage:** Used to calculate tax rate.
    - `transaction_id`: Unique identifier for the transaction.
      - **Usage:** Retrieved for transactions in the top-tax-rate category.
    - `total_item_quantity`: Total quantity of items purchased.
      - **Usage:** Retrieved for transactions in the top-tax-rate category.

  - `items` (ARRAY of STRUCTs):
    - `item_category`: Category of the item.
      - **Usage:** Grouping and identifying the category with the highest tax rate.
    - Other item-level details like `item_id`, `item_name`, `price_in_usd`, `quantity`, etc.
      - **Usage:** For detailed analysis if needed.

**Potential Conditions:**

- Filter by event date:
  - `event_date = '20201130'`

- Filter by event name:
  - `event_name = 'purchase'`

- Ensure non-zero purchase revenue to avoid division by zero:
  - `ecommerce.purchase_revenue_in_usd > 0`

- Unnest `items` array to access `item_category`.

    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Count of Transactions per Item Category:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      i.item_category,
      COUNT(DISTINCT ecommerce.transaction_id) AS transaction_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130` AS t,

    UNNEST(t.items) AS i
    WHERE t.event_name = 'purchase'
    GROUP BY i.item_category
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Identify Transactions with Highest Individual Tax Rate:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      ecommerce.transaction_id,
      i.item_category,
      (ecommerce.tax_value_in_usd / ecommerce.purchase_revenue_in_usd) AS tax_rate
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130` AS t,
    UNNEST(t.items) AS i
    WHERE t.event_name = 'purchase' AND ecommerce.purchase_revenue_in_usd > 0
    ORDER BY tax_rate DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in exploring the data, calculating tax rates, identifying the item category with the highest tax rate, and retrieving the required transaction details. By analyzing the outputs of these queries, we can fulfill the task requirements.

Task: On November 30, 2020, identify the item category with the highest tax rate by dividing tax value in usd by purchase revenue in usd for purchase events, and then retrieve the transaction IDs, total item quantities, and both purchase revenue in usd and purchase revenue for those purchase events in that top-tax-rate category.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the item category with the highest tax rate on November 30, 2020, we calculate the tax rate for each item category by dividing `tax_value_in_usd` by `purchase_revenue_in_usd` for purchase events on that date. After identifying the top-tax-rate category, we retrieve the transaction IDs, total item quantities, and both `purchase_revenue_in_usd` and `purchase_revenue` for the purchase events in that category.

The data can be formatted as follows:

```csv
transaction_id,total_item_quantity,purchase_revenue_in_usd,purchase_revenue
transaction_id1:str,total_item_quantity1:int,purchase_revenue_in_usd1:float,purchase_revenue1:float
transaction_id2:str,total_item_quantity2:int,purchase_revenue_in_usd2:float,purchase_revenue2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 14:58:26 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing On November 30, 2020, identify the item category with the highest tax rate by dividing tax value in usd by purchase revenue in usd for purchase events, and then retrieve the transaction IDs, total item quantities, and both purchase revenue in usd and purchase revenue for those purchase events in that top-tax-rate category., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the item category with the highest tax rate on November 30, 2020, we calculate the tax rate for each item category by dividing `tax_value_in_usd` by `purchase_revenue_in_usd` for purchase events on that date. After identifying the top-tax-rate category, we retrieve the transaction IDs, total item quantities, and both `purchase_revenue_in_usd` and `purchase_revenue` for the purchase events in that category.

The data can be formatted as follows:

```csv
transaction_id,total_item_quantity,purchase_revenue_in_usd,purchase_revenue
transaction_id1:str,total_item_quantity1:int,purchase_revenue_in_usd1:float,purchase_revenue1:float
transaction_id2:str,total_item_quantity2:int,purchase_revenue_in_usd2:float,purchase_revenue2:float
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-10 14:59:44 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing On November 30, 2020, identify the item category with the highest tax rate by dividing tax value in usd by purchase revenue in usd for purchase events, and then retrieve the transaction IDs, total item quantities, and both purchase revenue in usd and purchase revenue for those purchase events in that top-tax-rate category., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the item category with the highest tax rate on November 30, 2020, we calculate the tax rate for each item category by dividing `tax_value_in_usd` by `purchase_revenue_in_usd` for purchase events on that date. After identifying the top-tax-rate category, we retrieve the transaction IDs, total item quantities, and both `purchase_revenue_in_usd` and `purchase_revenue` for the purchase events in that category.

The data can be formatted as follows:

```csv
transaction_id,total_item_quantity,purchase_revenue_in_usd,purchase_revenue
transaction_id1:str,total_item_quantity1:int,purchase_revenue_in_usd1:float,purchase_revenue1:float
transaction_id2:str,total_item_quantity2:int,purchase_revenue_in_usd2:float,purchase_revenue2:float
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
