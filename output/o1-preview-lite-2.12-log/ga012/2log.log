**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `event_date`: Used to filter events on November 30, 2020 (`event_date = '20201130'`).
- `event_name`: To identify purchase events (`event_name = 'purchase'`).
- `ecommerce.tax_value_in_usd`: To obtain the tax value in USD for the event.
- `ecommerce.purchase_revenue_in_usd`: To obtain the purchase revenue in USD for the event.
- `ecommerce.transaction_id`: To retrieve transaction IDs of the purchase events.
- `ecommerce.total_item_quantity`: To retrieve total item quantities in the purchase events.
- `items`: An array of structs; contains item-level details.
- `items.item_category`: To identify item categories within each purchase event.
  
**Conditions:**

- Filter events occurring on November 30, 2020 (`event_date = '20201130'`).
- Filter events where `event_name` is `'purchase'`.
- Need to UNNEST `items` to access `item_category`.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct item categories on November 30, 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT item.item_category
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130`,
   UNNEST(items) AS item
   WHERE event_date = '20201130'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

2. **Count of purchase events on November 30, 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS purchase_event_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130`
   WHERE event_date = '20201130' AND event_name = 'purchase'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

3. **Retrieve tax and revenue values for purchase events:**

   ```sql
   SELECT ecommerce.tax_value_in_usd, ecommerce.purchase_revenue_in_usd
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130`
   WHERE event_date = '20201130' AND event_name = 'purchase'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

4. **List transaction IDs and total item quantities for purchase events:**

   ```sql
   SELECT ecommerce.transaction_id, ecommerce.total_item_quantity
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130`
   WHERE event_date = '20201130' AND event_name = 'purchase'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

5. **Calculate tax rate for each purchase event:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     ecommerce.transaction_id,
     ecommerce.tax_value_in_usd / ecommerce.purchase_revenue_in_usd AS tax_rate
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130`
   WHERE event_date = '20201130' AND event_name = 'purchase'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

6. **Retrieve item categories with their corresponding tax rates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     item.item_category,
     ecommerce.tax_value_in_usd / ecommerce.purchase_revenue_in_usd AS tax_rate
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130`,
   UNNEST(items) AS item
   WHERE event_date = '20201130' AND event_name = 'purchase'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

7. **Calculate average tax rate per item category:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     item.item_category,
     AVG(ecommerce.tax_value_in_usd / ecommerce.purchase_revenue_in_usd) AS average_tax_rate
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130`,
   UNNEST(items) AS item
   WHERE event_date = '20201130' AND event_name = 'purchase'
   GROUP BY item.item_category
   LIMIT 100
   ```

8. **Identify the item category with the highest average tax rate:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     item.item_category,
     AVG(ecommerce.tax_value_in_usd / ecommerce.purchase_revenue_in_usd) AS average_tax_rate
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130`,
   UNNEST(items) AS item
   WHERE event_date = '20201130' AND event_name = 'purchase'
   GROUP BY item.item_category
   ORDER BY average_tax_rate DESC
   LIMIT 1
   ```

9. **Retrieve details of purchase events in the top-tax-rate category:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     ecommerce.transaction_id,
     ecommerce.total_item_quantity,
     ecommerce.purchase_revenue_in_usd,
     ecommerce.purchase_revenue
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130`,

   WHERE event_date = '20201130'
     AND event_name = 'purchase'
     AND item.item_category = 'Top_Tax_Rate_Category'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

   *(Note: Replace 'Top_Tax_Rate_Category' with the actual category name from previous query.)*

10. **List all transaction IDs associated with the top-tax-rate item category:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT ecommerce.transaction_id
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20201130`,
    UNNEST(items) AS item
    WHERE event_date = '20201130'
      AND event_name = 'purchase'
      AND item.item_category = 'Top_Tax_Rate_Category'
    LIMIT 100
    ```

Task: On November 30, 2020, identify the item category with the highest tax rate by dividing tax value in usd by purchase revenue in usd for purchase events, and then retrieve the transaction IDs, total item quantities, and both purchase revenue in usd and purchase revenue for those purchase events in that top-tax-rate category.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the item category with the highest tax rate on November 30, 2020, we calculate the tax rate for each item category by dividing `tax_value_in_usd` by `purchase_revenue_in_usd` for purchase events on that date. After identifying the top-tax-rate category, we retrieve the transaction IDs, total item quantities, and both `purchase_revenue_in_usd` and `purchase_revenue` for the purchase events in that category.

The data can be formatted as follows:

```csv
transaction_id,total_item_quantity,purchase_revenue_in_usd,purchase_revenue
transaction_id1:str,total_item_quantity1:int,purchase_revenue_in_usd1:float,purchase_revenue1:float
transaction_id2:str,total_item_quantity2:int,purchase_revenue_in_usd2:float,purchase_revenue2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 14:57:30 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing On November 30, 2020, identify the item category with the highest tax rate by dividing tax value in usd by purchase revenue in usd for purchase events, and then retrieve the transaction IDs, total item quantities, and both purchase revenue in usd and purchase revenue for those purchase events in that top-tax-rate category., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the item category with the highest tax rate on November 30, 2020, we calculate the tax rate for each item category by dividing `tax_value_in_usd` by `purchase_revenue_in_usd` for purchase events on that date. After identifying the top-tax-rate category, we retrieve the transaction IDs, total item quantities, and both `purchase_revenue_in_usd` and `purchase_revenue` for the purchase events in that category.

The data can be formatted as follows:

```csv
transaction_id,total_item_quantity,purchase_revenue_in_usd,purchase_revenue
transaction_id1:str,total_item_quantity1:int,purchase_revenue_in_usd1:float,purchase_revenue1:float
transaction_id2:str,total_item_quantity2:int,purchase_revenue_in_usd2:float,purchase_revenue2:float
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
