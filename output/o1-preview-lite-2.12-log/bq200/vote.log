1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

I have compared the three SQL queries provided (`0result.sql`, `1result.sql`, and `2result.sql`) along with their results, and determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer for the following reasons:

1. **Comprehensive Inclusion of Fielders:**
   - **`1result.sql`** correctly includes all possible fielder positions (`homeFielder1` to `homeFielder12` and `awayFielder1` to `awayFielder12`) by using arrays and the `UNNEST` function. This ensures that the query accurately checks if the `pitcherId` appears in any of the fielder positions for both the home and away teams.
   - **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** either explicitly list fielder positions (which may miss some positions if not all are included) or only consider a subset of fielders (`homeFielder1` to `homeFielder9`, missing positions 10 to 12 as in `2result.sql`).

2. **Accurate Association of Pitchers to Teams:**
   - **`1result.sql`** uses a CASE statement with `UNNEST`ed arrays to accurately determine the team (`Team_ID`) for each pitcher by checking both home and away fielder lists.
   - This method reliably confirms that the pitcher played for the team in that game, satisfying the condition to verify the pitcher's association with the team.

3. **Inclusion of Both Regular and Post-Season Data:**
   - **`1result.sql`** effectively combines data from both the regular season (`games_wide`) and post-season (`games_post_wide`) tables using `UNION ALL`, ensuring that all relevant games are considered.
   - This is essential to meet the requirement of using data from both the regular season and the post-season.

4. **Correct Calculation of Maximum Pitch Speed per Team:**
   - The query calculates the maximum pitch speed (`Max_Pitch_Speed`) for each pitcher and groups the results by `Team_ID`, `pitcherId`, and `Pitcher_Name`.
   - It then ranks the pitchers for each team and selects the one with the highest `Max_Pitch_Speed`, which aligns with the task's objective.

5. **Robust and Scalable Query Structure:**
   - By using arrays and the `UNNEST` function, **`1result.sql`** provides a scalable solution that can handle any changes in the number of fielder positions without requiring modifications to the query.
   - This approach reduces the risk of errors and omissions compared to hardcoding each fielder position.

**Conclusion:**

Given the above points, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that accurately identifies the pitcher who achieved the highest non-zero pitch speed for each team. It confirms the pitcher's participation by checking all fielder positions, includes both regular and post-season data, and calculates the maximum pitch speed accurately.
