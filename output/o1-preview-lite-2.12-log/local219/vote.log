After comparing the three SQL queries (`0result.sql`, `1result.sql`, and `2result.sql`), we can conclude that all of them correctly identify the team with the fewest total match wins in each league, including teams with zero wins, and ensure that only one team is returned per league in case of ties. However, **`2result.sql`** is the most efficient and straightforward solution.

**Reasons:**

- **Simplicity and Efficiency:** `2result.sql` calculates the total wins per team using a single aggregation step with a `CASE WHEN` statement, avoiding the need for multiple UNION operations or intermediate CTEs to combine home and away wins.
  
- **Direct Computation:** It sums up the wins directly while processing each match, which can be more efficient than first identifying winners and then grouping them.

- **Clarity:** The query uses well-organized CTEs that clearly represent each step of the computation, making it easier to understand and maintain.

**Therefore, `2result.sql` is the correct SQL script for this task.**
