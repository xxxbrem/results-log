This query calculates the total number of match wins for each team in each league, including teams with zero wins. It then identifies the team with the fewest total wins in each league. If multiple teams tie for the fewest wins, only one team (with the smallest `team_id`) is returned per league.

Here's a breakdown of the query:

- **TeamsInLeague**: Retrieves all teams that have participated in each league.
- **WinsPerTeam**: Calculates the total wins for each team in each league.
- **TotalWinsPerTeam**: Combines all teams with their total wins, using `COALESCE` to include teams with zero wins.
- **MinWinsPerLeague**: Determines the minimum number of wins in each league.
- **TeamsWithMinWins**: Selects one team per league with the fewest wins.
- The final `SELECT` retrieves the league name, team name, and total wins for each team with the fewest wins per league.

   ```

4. **Count the number of matches per league:**

   ```sql
   SELECT league_id, COUNT(*) AS match_count
   FROM Match
   GROUP BY league_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find matches where the home team won:**

   ```sql
   SELECT league_id, home_team_api_id, home_team_goal, away_team_api_id, away_team_goal
   FROM Match
   WHERE home_team_goal > away_team_goal
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find matches where the away team won:**

   ```sql
   SELECT league_id, away_team_api_id, away_team_goal, home_team_api_id, home_team_goal
   FROM Match
   WHERE away_team_goal > home_team_goal
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate home wins for each team:**

   ```sql
   SELECT home_team_api_id AS team_id, COUNT(*) AS home_wins
   FROM Match
   WHERE home_team_goal > away_team_goal
   GROUP BY home_team_api_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate away wins for each team:**

   ```sql
   SELECT away_team_api_id AS team_id, COUNT(*) AS away_wins
   FROM Match
   WHERE away_team_goal > home_team_goal
   GROUP BY away_team_api_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate total wins for each team:**

   ```sql
   SELECT team_id, SUM(wins) AS total_wins
   FROM (

        WHERE away_team_goal > home_team_goal
        GROUP BY league_id, away_team_api_id
      )
      GROUP BY league_id, team_id

    JOIN Team t ON w.team_id = t.team_api_id
    GROUP BY l.id
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List teams and their total number of matches played in each league:**

    ```sql
    SELECT league_id, team_id, COUNT(*) AS total_matches
    FROM (
      SELECT league_id, home_team_api_id AS team_id
      FROM Match
      UNION ALL
      SELECT league_id, away_team_api_id AS team_id
      FROM Match
    )
    GROUP BY league_id, team_id
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Identify leagues with the number of unique teams participating:**

    ```sql
    SELECT league_id, COUNT(DISTINCT team_id) AS team_count
    FROM (
      SELECT league_id, home_team_api_id AS team_id
      FROM Match
      UNION
      SELECT league_id, away_team_api_id AS team_id
      FROM Match
    )
    GROUP BY league_id
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find total goals scored by each team in each league:**

    ```sql
    SELECT league_id, team_id, SUM(goals_scored) AS total_goals
    FROM (
      SELECT league_id, home_team_api_id AS team_id, SUM(home_team_goal) AS goals_scored
      FROM Match
      GROUP BY league_id, home_team_api_id
      UNION ALL
      SELECT league_id, away_team_api_id AS team_id, SUM(away_team_goal) AS goals_scored
      FROM Match
      GROUP BY league_id, away_team_api_id
    )
    GROUP BY league_id, team_id
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

16. **Retrieve the maximum number of wins achieved by any team in each league:**

    ```sql
    SELECT l.name AS league_name, MAX(w.total_wins) AS max_wins
    FROM (
      SELECT league_id, team_id, SUM(wins) AS total_wins
      FROM (
        SELECT league_id, home_team_api_id AS team_id, COUNT(*) AS wins
        FROM Match
        WHERE home_team_goal > away_team_goal
        GROUP BY league_id, home_team_api_id
        UNION ALL
        SELECT league_id, away_team_api_id AS team_id, COUNT(*) AS wins
        FROM Match
        WHERE away_team_goal > home_team_goal
        GROUP BY league_id, away_team_api_id
      )
      GROUP BY league_id, team_id
    ) w
    JOIN League l ON w.league_id = l.id
    GROUP BY l.id
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the necessary data to solve the task. They start by retrieving basic information about leagues and teams and advance toward calculating wins and identifying teams with the fewest wins in each league.

- Queries 1-3 retrieve basic information about leagues, teams, and matches.
- Queries 4-6 explore match details and outcomes (home wins, away wins).
- Queries 7-9 calculate home wins, away wins, and total wins for each team.
- Query 10 calculates total wins for each team within each league.
- Query 11 identifies teams with zero wins.
- Query 12 attempts to find the team with the fewest wins in each league.
- Queries 13-16 provide additional insights into matches played, team participation, goals scored, and maximum wins in each league.

This step-by-step approach helps in understanding the data and structures required to solve the task of finding, in each league, the single team with the fewest total match wins.Query:

Task: In each league, considering all seasons, which single team has the fewest total match wins based on comparing home and away goals, including teams with zero wins, ensuring that if multiple teams tie for the fewest wins, only one team is returned for each league?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
LeagueName,TeamName,TotalWins
league_name1:str,team_name1:str,total_wins1:int
league_name2:str,team_name2:str,total_wins2:int
...
(Attention: one row per league)
```
For each league, we calculated the total number of match wins for all teams by comparing home and away goals in each match. The team with the fewest total wins, including those with zero wins, was identified for each league. In cases where multiple teams tied for the fewest wins, only one team was returned per league..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['sqlite_sequence', 'Player_Attributes', 'Player', 'Match', 'League', 'Country', 'Team', 'Team_Attributes']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
