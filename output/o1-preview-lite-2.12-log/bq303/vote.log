After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL that fulfills the task requirements is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Association:** `1result.sql` ensures that for each contribution—whether it's a question authored, an answer posted, or a comment on a question or answer—the tags of the relevant parent question are correctly associated. This directly addresses the task's emphasis on correctly associating comments or answers with their parent question's tags.

- **Comprehensive Retrieval:** The query retrieves all contributions made by users within the specified ID range (`16712208` to `18712208`) and date range (`'2019-07-01'` to `'2019-12-31'`), including:
  - Questions authored by the users.
  - Answers posted by the users.
  - Comments made by the users on questions.
  - Comments made by the users on answers.

- **Clear Structure and Filtering:** By performing the `UNION ALL` of the four types of contributions and then applying the filters for `user_id` and `contribution_date` at the end, the query ensures that all relevant contributions are included. Each subquery joins directly to the `posts_questions` table to obtain the `tags`, which aligns with the requirement of associating contributions with the correct question tags.

- **Aligned with Task Requirements:** The organization and logic of `1result.sql` closely mirror the task description, making it the appropriate choice.

**Summary:** `1result.sql` is the correct SQL because it accurately retrieves the required data while correctly associating each contribution with the relevant question's tags, adhering to all specified conditions.
