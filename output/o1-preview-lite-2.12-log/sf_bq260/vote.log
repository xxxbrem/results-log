After reviewing both SQL queries, **2result.sql** is the correct one for the task. Here's why:

- **Task Requirement:** The task specifies that we need to consider users who registered between **January 1, 2019**, and **April 30, 2022**.

- **Comparison:**

  - **0result.sql:**
    - **Date Filtering:** This query does **not** include any date filtering based on `"created_at"`.
    - **Result:** It calculates the youngest and oldest ages and counts across **all users**, regardless of when they registered.
    - **Conclusion:** It does not meet the task requirement because it doesn't limit the data to the specified date range.
  
  - **2result.sql:**
    - **Date Filtering:** This query includes a `WHERE` clause in both the subquery and the main query to filter users where `"created_at"` is between **1546300800000000** (January 1, 2019) and **1651363199000000** (April 30, 2022).
    - **Result:** It correctly calculates the youngest and oldest ages and counts **only** for users who registered within the specified date range.
    - **Conclusion:** This query meets all the task requirements.

- **Conclusion:** Since **2result.sql** correctly filters the data to the specified date range and calculates the required counts, it is the correct SQL for the task.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plaintext
2result.sql
