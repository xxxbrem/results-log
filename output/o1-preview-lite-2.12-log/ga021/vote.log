After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Here's why:**

1. **Focus on Users Who Started a Session:**
   - `0result.sql` correctly identifies users who started a session (`session_start`) between **July 2, 2018, and July 16, 2018**, as required.
   - Both `1result.sql` and `2result.sql` also consider session starters, but the key differences lie in the retention calculation.

2. **Initial Quickplay Event Identification:**
   - `0result.sql` determines each user's **first quickplay event** and associates it with the corresponding `quickplay_event_type`.
   - It uses `event_name LIKE '%_quickplay'` to capture all quickplay event types.

3. **Retention Calculation:**
   - **`0result.sql` considers a user as retained if they had **any event** during the retention window (14 to 21 days after their initial quickplay event), regardless of the event type**.
     - This aligns with standard retention metrics, which focus on whether users return to the app, not necessarily performing the same action.
   - **`1result.sql` and `2result.sql` only consider users as retained if they perform the same `quickplay_event_type` during the retention period**.
     - This is a more stringent criterion and may underrepresent true user retention, as users might return and engage with different features.

4. **Per Quickplay Event Type Retention Rate:**
   - `0result.sql` calculates the retention rate separately for each initial `quickplay_event_type`, as required.
   - The retention rates in `0result.sql` are based on a broader and more inclusive definition of user retention.

5. **Results Consistency:**
   - The retention rates produced by `0result.sql` are reasonable and reflect expected user behavior patterns.
     - For example, users who started with `level_complete_quickplay` have a higher retention rate than those who started with `level_reset_quickplay`, which makes sense intuitively.

**Conclusion:**

- **`0result.sql`** best answers the question by accurately calculating the two-week user retention rate per `quickplay_event_type`, focusing on users who started a session during the specified period, and using an appropriate retention criteria.
