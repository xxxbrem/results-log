After reviewing the three candidate SQL queries and their results, we can determine which one correctly addresses the task.

**Task Summary:**

- **Calculate month-end balances** for each customer and each month of 2020 by:
  - **Adding all deposit amounts.**
  - **Subtracting all withdrawal amounts.**

- **Determine**:
  - The month with the **highest count** of customers having a **positive month-end balance**.
  - The month with the **lowest count** of customers having a **positive month-end balance**.

- **Compute the difference** between the **average month-end balances** of these two months.

**Analysis:**

1. **Transaction Types in the Data:**
   - The transaction types include **'deposit'**, **'withdrawal'**, and **'purchase'**.
   - From earlier queries, we see that **'purchase'** transactions are present in the dataset:
     ```
     txn_type,transaction_count
     deposit,2671
     purchase,1617
     withdrawal,1580
     ```
   - It is important to decide whether **'purchase'** transactions should be treated like **'withdrawal'** transactions (i.e., subtracted from the balance).

2. **Candidate SQL Queries Comparison:**

   - **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**
     - **Includes 'purchase' transactions** in the month-end balance calculation by **subtracting** them.
     - Uses:
       ```sql
       CASE
         WHEN "txn_type" = 'deposit' THEN "txn_amount"
         WHEN "txn_type" IN ('withdrawal', 'purchase') THEN - "txn_amount"
         ELSE 0
       END
       ```
     - This aligns with the logic that **'purchase'** transactions reduce the balance, similar to **'withdrawal'** transactions.

   - **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`) and Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):**
     - **Do not include 'purchase' transactions** in the month-end balance calculation.
     - Only consider **'deposit'** and **'withdrawal'** types.
     - Use:
       ```sql
       CASE
         WHEN "txn_type" = 'deposit' THEN "txn_amount"
         WHEN "txn_type" = 'withdrawal' THEN - "txn_amount"
         ELSE 0
       END
       ```
     - **Excludes 'purchase'** transactions from impacting the balance.

3. **Correct Approach:**

   - Since **'purchase'** transactions represent money spent by the customer, they should be **treated as withdrawals**, reducing the balance.
   - **Candidate 0** correctly accounts for **all transaction types** affecting the balance.
   - **Candidates 1 and 2** omit **'purchase'** transactions, leading to an incomplete calculation.

4. **Result Comparison:**

   - **Candidate 0 Result:** `432.6998`
   - **Candidate 1 Result:** `419.994`
   - **Candidate 2 Result:** `334.8723`

   - The difference in results indicates that **excluding 'purchase' transactions** affects the calculated averages and the final difference between them.

**Conclusion:**

- **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`) is the correct SQL query** as it accurately computes the month-end balances by including both **'withdrawal'** and **'purchase'** transactions as deductions.
- **Candidates 1 and 2 do not account for 'purchase' transactions**, leading to incorrect month-end balances and average calculations.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plaintext
0result.sql
```
