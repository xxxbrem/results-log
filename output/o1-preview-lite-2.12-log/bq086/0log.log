Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we first need to identify the relevant tables and columns, understand how they can be used, and explore the data to ensure accurate calculations.

---

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`

   - `date`: Used to filter data up to June 30, 2020.
   - `country_name`: Name of the country; helps identify the country.
   - `country_code`: ISO code of the country; useful for joining with other datasets.
   - `location_key`: Unique key for the location; might be used for joins if consistent across datasets.
   - `aggregation_level`: Indicates the data's aggregation level; `0` for country-level data.
   - `cumulative_confirmed`: Cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases up to a specific date.

2. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_global_population.population_by_country`

   - `country`: Name of the country.
   - `country_code`: ISO code of the country; useful for joining with other datasets.
   - `year_2018`: Population data for the year 2018.

---

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Date Filtering:** `date = '2020-06-30'` to get data up to June 30, 2020.
- **Aggregation Level:** `aggregation_level = 0` to get country-level data.
- **Joining Conditions:** Using `country_code` or `country_name` to join between datasets.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing or null values in `cumulative_confirmed` or `year_2018`.

---

**SQL Queries to Explore and Understand the Data:**

1. **List all distinct country names from the COVID-19 dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `country_name`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve cumulative confirmed cases by country on June 30, 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `country_name`, `cumulative_confirmed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE `date` = '2020-06-30' AND `aggregation_level` = 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get population data for all countries from the World Bank dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `country`, `country_code`, `year_2018` AS population_2018
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_global_population.population_by_country`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find countries with missing cumulative confirmed cases on June 30, 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `country_name`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE `date` = '2020-06-30' AND `aggregation_level` = 0 AND `cumulative_confirmed` IS NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List distinct country codes and names from the COVID-19 dataset:**

   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE `aggregation_level` = 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Identify discrepancies in country codes between the two datasets:**

   ```sql
   SELECT wb.`country`, wb.`country_code`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_global_population.population_by_country` wb
   WHERE wb.`country_code` NOT IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT `country_code`
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
     WHERE `aggregation_level` = 0
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Check the range of cumulative confirmed cases on June 30, 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(`cumulative_confirmed`) AS min_confirmed, MAX(`cumulative_confirmed`) AS max_confirmed
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE `date` = '2020-06-30' AND `aggregation_level` = 0;
   ```

8. **Count the number of countries with population data for 2018:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_countries_with_population_2018
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_global_population.population_by_country`
   WHERE `year_2018` IS NOT NULL;
   ```

9. **Retrieve cumulative confirmed cases for a specific country (e.g., Brazil) over time:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `date`, `cumulative_confirmed`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE `country_name` = 'Brazil' AND `aggregation_level` = 0 AND `date` <= '2020-06-30'
   ORDER BY `date`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Join the two datasets to get population and cumulative confirmed cases for countries on June 30, 2020:**

    ```sql
    SELECT wb.`country`, wb.`year_2018` AS population_2018, covid.`cumulative_confirmed`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_global_population.population_by_country` wb
    INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data` covid
      ON wb.`country_code` = covid.`country_code`
    WHERE covid.`date` = '2020-06-30' AND covid.`aggregation_level` = 0
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help us:

- **Understand the available data:** By listing country names and codes, we see how countries are represented in each dataset.
- **Check data completeness:** By identifying missing cumulative confirmed cases or population data, we can address potential data gaps.
- **Explore data ranges:** Checking minimum and maximum values helps us understand the spread and identify outliers.
- **Prepare for data merging:** By examining country codes present in both datasets and discrepancies, we ensure a proper join between tables.
- **Visualize trends:** Retrieving time series data for specific countries allows us to see how cases progressed up to June 30, 2020.

Task: You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `covid19_open_data` dataset and the 2018 population data from the `population_by_country` table in the World Bank dataset. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed_cases / population_2018) * 100`.

The resulting data would be formatted as follows:

```csv
country_name,confirmed_cases_percentage
country1:str,percentage1:0<=float<=100
country2:str,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'covid19_open_data': ['covid19_open_data'], 'world_bank_global_population': ['population_by_country'], 'world_bank_health_population': ['series_summary', 'country_series_definitions', 'series_times', 'country_summary', 'health_nutrition_population'], 'world_bank_intl_debt': ['series_summary', 'country_series_definitions', 'series_times', 'country_summary', 'international_debt'], 'world_bank_intl_education': ['series_summary', 'country_series_definitions', 'international_education', 'country_summary'], 'world_bank_wdi': ['series_summary', 'country_series_definitions', 'footnotes', 'series_time', 'indicators_data', 'country_summary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 09:30:20 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `covid19_open_data` dataset and the 2018 population data from the `population_by_country` table in the World Bank dataset. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed_cases / population_2018) * 100`.

The resulting data would be formatted as follows:

```csv
country_name,confirmed_cases_percentage
country1:str,percentage1:0<=float<=100
country2:str,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-10 09:31:02 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `covid19_open_data` dataset and the 2018 population data from the `population_by_country` table in the World Bank dataset. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed_cases / population_2018) * 100`.

The resulting data would be formatted as follows:

```csv
country_name,confirmed_cases_percentage
country1:str,percentage1:0<=float<=100
country2:str,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-10 09:32:12 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `covid19_open_data` dataset and the 2018 population data from the `population_by_country` table in the World Bank dataset. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed_cases / population_2018) * 100`.

The resulting data would be formatted as follows:

```csv
country_name,confirmed_cases_percentage
country1:str,percentage1:0<=float<=100
country2:str,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
