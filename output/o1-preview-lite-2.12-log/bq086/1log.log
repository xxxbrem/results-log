Task: You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `covid19_open_data` dataset and the 2018 population data from the `population_by_country` table in the World Bank dataset. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed_cases / population_2018) * 100`.

The resulting data would be formatted as follows:

```csv
country_name,confirmed_cases_percentage
country1:str,percentage1:0<=float<=100
country2:str,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'covid19_open_data': ['covid19_open_data'], 'world_bank_global_population': ['population_by_country'], 'world_bank_health_population': ['series_summary', 'country_series_definitions', 'series_times', 'country_summary', 'health_nutrition_population'], 'world_bank_intl_debt': ['series_summary', 'country_series_definitions', 'series_times', 'country_summary', 'international_debt'], 'world_bank_intl_education': ['series_summary', 'country_series_definitions', 'international_education', 'country_summary'], 'world_bank_wdi': ['series_summary', 'country_series_definitions', 'footnotes', 'series_time', 'indicators_data', 'country_summary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 09:29:01 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing You need to calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020. The population data for 2018 can be found in the World Bank dataset, and the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases data is available in the COVID-19 Open Data dataset. Calculate the percentage of each country's population, that was cumulatively confirmed to have COVID-19, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To calculate the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative confirmed cases up to that date from the `covid19_open_data` dataset and the 2018 population data from the `population_by_country` table in the World Bank dataset. The percentage is calculated as `(cumulative_confirmed_cases / population_2018) * 100`.

The resulting data would be formatted as follows:

```csv
country_name,confirmed_cases_percentage
country1:str,percentage1:0<=float<=100
country2:str,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
