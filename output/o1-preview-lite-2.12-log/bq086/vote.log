After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **1result.sql** is the correct SQL query for calculating the percentage of each country's population that had been confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020.

**Reasoning:**

- **Data Filtering:** `1result.sql` correctly filters the COVID-19 data to include only records where the date is `'2020-06-30'` and the `aggregation_level` is `0`, ensuring we are using country-level data as of June 30, 2020.

- **Direct Join:** It joins the COVID-19 data (`iso_3166_1_alpha_3`) with the World Bank population data (`country_code`) directly, matching countries accurately using the three-letter ISO codes.

- **Division Handling:** By using `NULLIF(p.year_2018, 0)`, it avoids division by zero errors in cases where the population data might be zero or null.

- **Ordering Results:** It orders the results by `confirmed_cases_percentage` in descending order, providing a clear ranking of countries based on the percentage of their population confirmed with COVID-19.

- **Precision:** The use of `ROUND` to four decimal places ensures that the percentages are precise and easy to read.

- **No Aggregation Issues:** Unlike the other queries, `1result.sql` does not group by or aggregate data unnecessarily, reducing the risk of incorrect calculations due to multiple entries per country.

Therefore, **1result.sql** accurately computes the percentage of each country's population that had been cumulatively confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020.
