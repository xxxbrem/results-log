After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **2result.sql** is the correct answer because it:

- **Correctly filters for active stations** by using `s."status" ILIKE 'active'`, ensuring case-insensitive matching.
- **Calculates the total number of trips**, average trip duration, and percentage of total starting trips from active stations.
- **Handles ties appropriately** by using `DENSE_RANK()`, which includes all stations that share the same number of total starting trips in the top 15.
- **Orders the results** based on the station's rank as required.

Therefore, the SQL script that best meets the task requirements is:

```plaintext
2result.sql
