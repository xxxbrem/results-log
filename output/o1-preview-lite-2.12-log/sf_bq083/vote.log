After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct query for calculating the daily change in the market value of USDC tokens in 2023. Here's the reasoning:

### Reasoning:

1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - **`1result.sql`**:
     - Uses `LEFT("input", 10) = '0x40c10f19'` to filter transactions.
     - Includes length checks (`LENGTH("input") >= 138` and `LENGTH("input") >= 74`), which might exclude valid transactions with shorter input lengths.
     - The result shows `$0.0000` for all dates, indicating that the query might be too restrictive or not capturing relevant data.

   - **`2result.sql`**:
     - Uses `LIKE '0x40c10f19%'` to filter transactions, which is more flexible and includes all inputs starting with the given patterns.
     - Does not impose length restrictions, allowing for more transactions to be included.
     - The result shows meaningful non-zero values for "Δ Total Market Value" on several dates, indicating that the data extraction is working correctly.

2. **Data Extraction**:
   - **`1result.sql`**:
     - Extracts amounts using `SUBSTR("input", 75, 64)` for minting and `SUBSTR("input", 11, 64)` for burning.
     - Applies `LTRIM` and `TRY_TO_NUMBER` functions but might miss transactions due to strict length checks and the exact match on the first 10 characters.

   - **`2result.sql`**:
     - Also extracts amounts using `SUBSTRING("input", 75, 64)` and `SUBSTRING("input", 11, 64)`, which are appropriate positions for the amount in the contract's input data.
     - Converts hexadecimal strings to numbers correctly using `TRY_TO_NUMBER(..., 16)`.

3. **Results**:
   - **`1result.sql`**:
     - The CSV output shows all dates with `$0.0000`, suggesting that no transactions were processed or amounts were not correctly extracted.

   - **`2result.sql`**:
     - The CSV output shows dates with non-zero "Δ Total Market Value", reflecting actual minting and burning events.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - **`2result.sql`** is correctly capturing and processing the relevant transactions to compute the daily change in USDC market value.
   - It uses more inclusive filtering and properly extracts and converts the amounts from the transaction input data.
