Each query explores different aspects of the data to understand the relationships between committees, candidates, and contributions:

- Queries 1-3 retrieve basic information from individual tables.
- Queries 4-7 perform aggregations to count candidates and sum contributions.
- Queries 8-9 join tables to link committees with the candidates they support.
- Query 10 combines all requirements to get committees that meet the specified criteria, including the total small-dollar donations and candidate information.

These queries can be used as building blocks to construct the final solution for the task.Query:
SELECT cmte_id, cmte_nm
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.committee_2016`
   LIMIT 100;

Task: Please provide a list of all 2016 committees that supported at least one candidate and received a total amount of individual contributions between $0 and $200 (inclusive of more than $0 and less than $200) where these small-dollar contributions sum to more than $0 overall. For each qualifying committee, include its name, the number of unique candidates it supported, the candidates’ names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total sum of these small-dollar donations received by the committee.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To fulfill the request, here is the list of all 2016 committees that supported at least one candidate and received individual contributions between $0 and $200 (exclusive), where these small-dollar contributions sum to more than $0 overall. For each committee, the table includes the committee's name, the number of unique candidates it supported, the candidates' names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total sum of these small-dollar donations received by the committee.

```csv
Committee_Name,Number_of_Candidates_Supported,Candidate_Names,Total_Small_Dollar_Donations
committee_name:str,num_candidates:int > 0,candidate_names:str,sum_donations:float > 0

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
