Begin Exploring Related Columns
To accomplish the task, we'll need to identify the relevant tables and columns from the provided dataset. Here are the tables and columns we'll use, along with their potential usage:

### Tables and Columns:

1. **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.fec.committee_2016`
   - `cmte_id`: Committee ID; used to identify committees.
   - `cmte_nm`: Committee name; used to get the committee's name.

2. **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_committee_2016`
   - `cmte_id`: Committee ID; used to link committees to candidates they support.
   - `cand_id`: Candidate ID; used to identify supported candidates.

3. **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_2016`
   - `cand_id`: Candidate ID; used to identify candidates.
   - `cand_name`: Candidate name; used to get the candidates' names.

4. **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016`
   - `cmte_id`: Committee ID; used to identify committees receiving contributions.
   - `transaction_amt`: Transaction amount; used to filter and sum small-dollar contributions.
   - `entity_tp`: Entity type; used to filter individual contributions (`entity_tp` = 'IND').
   - `transaction_tp`: Transaction type; may be used to ensure contributions are receipts.
   - `transaction_dt`: Transaction date; if filtering by date is necessary.

### Conditions to be used:

- **Contribution Amount Filter**: `transaction_amt` > 0 AND `transaction_amt` < 200
- **Entity Type Filter**: `entity_tp` = 'IND' (to select individual contributions)
- **Committee Support Condition**: Committees that have at least one entry in `candidate_committee_2016`
- **Sum of Contributions Condition**: Sum of small-dollar contributions per committee > 0

---

Below are 10 different BigQuery SQL queries to explore the relevant data:

1. **List the first 100 committees and their names from the 2016 cycle**:

   ```sql
   SELECT cmte_id, cmte_nm
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.committee_2016`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List the first 100 candidates and their names from the 2016 cycle**:

   ```sql
   SELECT cand_id, cand_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_2016`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find committees that supported at least one candidate**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT cmte_id
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_committee_2016`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve the first 100 individual contributions in 2016**:

   ```sql
   SELECT cmte_id, transaction_amt, entity_tp, transaction_tp
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List individual contributions between $0 and $200 (exclusive) from individuals**:

   ```sql
   SELECT cmte_id, transaction_amt
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016`
   WHERE transaction_amt > 0 AND transaction_amt < 200
     AND entity_tp = 'IND'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate the total small-dollar contributions per committee**:

   ```sql
   SELECT cmte_id, SUM(transaction_amt) AS total_small_dollar
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016`
   WHERE transaction_amt > 0 AND transaction_amt < 200
     AND entity_tp = 'IND'
   GROUP BY cmte_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List committees with total small-dollar contributions greater than $0**:

   ```sql
   SELECT cmte_id, SUM(transaction_amt) AS total_small_dollar
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016`
   WHERE transaction_amt > 0 AND transaction_amt < 200
     AND entity_tp = 'IND'
   GROUP BY cmte_id
   HAVING SUM(transaction_amt) > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get the number of unique candidates supported by each committee**:

   ```sql
   SELECT cmte_id, COUNT(DISTINCT cand_id) AS num_candidates
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_committee_2016`
   GROUP BY cmte_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve candidate names supported by each committee, in alphabetical order**:

   ```sql
   SELECT cc.cmte_id, STRING_AGG(DISTINCT c.cand_name ORDER BY c.cand_name) AS candidate_names
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_committee_2016` AS cc
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_2016` AS c
     ON cc.cand_id = c.cand_id
   GROUP BY cc.cmte_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Combine committee names with their total small-dollar contributions**:

    ```sql
    SELECT c.cmte_nm, SUM(i.transaction_amt) AS total_small_dollar
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016` AS i
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.committee_2016` AS c
      ON i.cmte_id = c.cmte_id
    WHERE i.transaction_amt > 0 AND i.transaction_amt < 200
      AND i.entity_tp = 'IND'
    GROUP BY c.cmte_nm
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the datasets and how to extract the necessary information to fulfill the original task. By exploring the committees, candidates, and individual contributions, we can aggregate and filter the data to obtain the required list of committees along with the specified details.Query:

Task: Please provide a list of all 2016 committees that supported at least one candidate and received a total amount of individual contributions between $0 and $200 (inclusive of more than $0 and less than $200) where these small-dollar contributions sum to more than $0 overall. For each qualifying committee, include its name, the number of unique candidates it supported, the candidates’ names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total sum of these small-dollar donations received by the committee.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To fulfill the request, here is the list of all 2016 committees that supported at least one candidate and received individual contributions between $0 and $200 (exclusive), where these small-dollar contributions sum to more than $0 overall. For each committee, the table includes the committee's name, the number of unique candidates it supported, the candidates' names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total sum of these small-dollar donations received by the committee.

```csv
Committee_Name,Number_of_Candidates_Supported,Candidate_Names,Total_Small_Dollar_Donations
committee_name:str,num_candidates:int > 0,candidate_names:str,sum_donations:float > 0

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
