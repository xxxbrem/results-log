**Relevant Table:**

- `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `nppes_provider_state`: Used to filter data by state (e.g., `'NY'` for New York) and group data by state.
- `drug_name`: Used to identify and filter specific drugs; essential for finding the drug with the highest prescriptions.
- `total_claim_count`: Used to sum up the number of prescriptions for each drug or state.
- `total_drug_cost`: Used to sum up the total cost associated with prescriptions for each drug or state.
- `nppes_provider_city`: May be used to filter data by city within a state.
- `npi`: National Provider Identifier; can be used to count unique providers.
- `nppes_provider_last_org_name` and `nppes_provider_first_name`: Used to identify providers; useful for provider-level analysis.

Task: For the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, could you list the top five states with the highest total claim counts for this drug? Please also include their total claim counts and total drug costs. 

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
State,Total_Claim_Count,Total_Drug_Cost
state1:str,claim_count1:int,drug_cost1:float
state2:str,claim_count2:int,drug_cost2:float
state3:str,claim_count3:int,drug_cost3:float
state4:str,claim_count4:int,drug_cost4:float
state5:str,claim_count5:int,drug_cost5:float
(Attention: answer in five rows)
```

To solve this task, we first identified the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014 by summing the `total_claim_count` for each `drug_name` where `nppes_provider_state` is 'NY'. After determining the top drug, we then calculated the total claim counts and total drug costs for this drug across all states. We aggregated the data by state, summing `total_claim_count` and `total_drug_cost`, and selected the top five states with the highest total claim counts. The results are presented in the table above..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 09:09:46 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, could you list the top five states with the highest total claim counts for this drug? Please also include their total claim counts and total drug costs. , reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
State,Total_Claim_Count,Total_Drug_Cost
state1:str,claim_count1:int,drug_cost1:float
state2:str,claim_count2:int,drug_cost2:float
state3:str,claim_count3:int,drug_cost3:float
state4:str,claim_count4:int,drug_cost4:float
state5:str,claim_count5:int,drug_cost5:float
(Attention: answer in five rows)
```

To solve this task, we first identified the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014 by summing the `total_claim_count` for each `drug_name` where `nppes_provider_state` is 'NY'. After determining the top drug, we then calculated the total claim counts and total drug costs for this drug across all states. We aggregated the data by state, summing `total_claim_count` and `total_drug_cost`, and selected the top five states with the highest total claim counts. The results are presented in the table above. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
