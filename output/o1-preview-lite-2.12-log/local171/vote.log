After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I recommend choosing **`2result.sql`** as the correct answer. Here's why:

**Reasons for Choosing `2result.sql`:**

1. **Handling of NULL or 'Present' `term_end` Values:**
   - **`2result.sql`** includes a `terms` CTE where it replaces `NULL` or `'Present'` values in `term_end` with a far-future date `'9999-12-31'`. This ensures that legislators who are currently serving or have no specified end date are correctly considered as actively serving in the calculations.
   - **`0result.sql`** does not handle `NULL` or `'Present'` values in `term_end`, which might lead to inaccurate results by excluding some active legislators from the counts.

2. **Use of Recursive CTE for Years Generation:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses a recursive CTE (`numbers`) to generate the range of years from 31 to 49 elegantly and can be easily adjusted for different ranges if needed.
   - **`0result.sql`** lists the years explicitly, which is less flexible and harder to maintain or modify for different ranges.

3. **Same Results but Better Robustness:**
   - Both queries produce the same results, but **`2result.sql`** is more robust due to its better handling of date ranges and term end values.
   - By ensuring that all possible active terms are accounted for, **`2result.sql`** provides a more accurate count of legislators actively serving on December 31 of each relevant year.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above reasons, **`2result.sql`** is the preferred SQL query as it accurately addresses the requirements and ensures correct and reliable results.
