2025-02-10 12:29:35 - root - INFO - It seems that the error occurs due to a type mismatch in your SQL query, specifically in the condition `stn = '725030'`. The error message indicates that you're trying to compare a **STRING** to an **INT64** (integer) using the `=` operator, which is causing the query to fail.

**Diagnosis:**

- The **`stn`** column in the `gsod` tables is of type **INT64** (integer).
- In your query, **`'725030'`** is enclosed in single quotes, making it a **STRING**.
- Comparing an INT64 to a STRING using `=` results in a type mismatch error.

**Solution:**

- Remove the single quotes around **`725030`** to treat it as an integer.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT year, temp, wdsp, prcp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2011' AND '2020'
  AND stn = 725030
  AND mo = 6
  AND da = 12
ORDER BY year
LIMIT 100
```

**Explanation:**

- **`stn = 725030`**: By removing the quotes, both sides of the `=` operator are integers (INT64), resolving the type mismatch.
- The query now correctly selects the average temperature (`temp`), average wind speed (`wdsp`), and precipitation (`prcp`) for LaGuardia Airport (station ID **`725030`**) on June 12 for each year from 2011 to 2020.

---

**Additional Information:**

- **Data Types Matter**: In SQL, it's important that the data types on both sides of an operator match or are compatible.
  - **Strings** are enclosed in single quotes (e.g., `'string_value'`).
  - **Integers** and **floats** are written without quotes (e.g., `123`, `45.67`).

- **Understanding the Error Message**:
  - *"No matching signature for operator = for argument types: STRING, INT64"* indicates that one side is a STRING and the other is an INT64.
  - Since **`stn`** is of type INT64, and `'725030'` is a STRING (due to the quotes), the comparison fails.

- **Using `_TABLE_SUFFIX`**:
  - The `_TABLE_SUFFIX` pseudo-column is of type STRING.
  - When filtering tables using `_TABLE_SUFFIX`, compare it to STRING literals (e.g., `'2011'`).

**Verification of Data Types**:

If you want to confirm the data types of the columns, you can run a query like:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE table_name = 'gsod2011'
  AND column_name IN ('stn', 'temp', 'wdsp', 'prcp')
```

**Moving Forward:**

- Always ensure that literals match the data types of the columns they are being compared with.
- When in doubt, you can check the schema of the table using BigQuery's `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.

2025-02-10 12:30:15 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com//openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-02-10 12:30:15 - root - INFO - I apologize for the confusion earlier. Upon reviewing the data types of the columns, I realized that there was a mistake in my previous explanation.

**Diagnosis:**

- The **`stn`**, **`mo`**, and **`da`** columns in the `gsod` tables are of type **STRING**.
- In your query, you're comparing **`mo`** (STRING) to **`6`** (INT64) and **`da`** (STRING) to **`12`** (INT64).
- This mismatch between STRING and INT64 types in the `=` operator causes the error.

**Error Message Explanation:**

- *"No matching signature for operator = for argument types: STRING, INT64"* indicates that one side of the `=` operator is a STRING and the other is an INT64.
- The error occurs at line **[4:7]**, which corresponds to the first condition after `WHERE`, likely `mo = 6`.

**Solution:**

- Enclose the values **`6`** and **`12`** in single quotes to convert them to STRING literals.
- Since **`stn`** is also a STRING, comparing it to **`'725030'`** is correct.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT year, temp, wdsp, prcp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2011' AND '2020'
  AND stn = '725030'
  AND mo = '6'
  AND da = '12'
ORDER BY year
LIMIT 100
```

**Explanation:**

- **`stn = '725030'`**: Correctly compares the STRING column **`stn`** to the STRING literal `'725030'`.
- **`mo = '6'`**: Compares the STRING column **`mo`** to the STRING literal `'6'`.
- **`da = '12'`**: Compares the STRING column **`da`** to the STRING literal `'12'`.
- The date components **`year`** is of type INT64, so comparing it to numbers is fine.

**Verification of Data Types:**

To confirm the data types of the columns, you can run:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE table_name = 'gsod2011'
  AND column_name IN ('stn', 'mo', 'da', 'temp', 'wdsp', 'prcp')
```

This will show that:

- **`stn`**: STRING
- **`mo`**: STRING
- **`da`**: STRING
- **`temp`**: FLOAT64
- **`wdsp`**: STRING or FLOAT64 (depending on the dataset)
- **`prcp`**: FLOAT64

**Additional Notes:**

- **Data Type Consistency**: Always ensure that when using comparison operators (`=`, `<`, `>`, etc.), both operands are of the same or compatible data types.
- **Quotes for Strings**: Enclose string literals in single quotes `'value'`.
- **Casting (Optional)**: Alternatively, you could cast the string columns to integers, but it's simpler to compare strings to strings.

  For example:

  ```sql
  CAST(mo AS INT64) = 6
  ```

  However, since the data is stored as strings, comparing strings is more straightforward.

**Conclusion:**

By adjusting your query to match the correct data types, the error should be resolved, and you should be able to retrieve the desired data for LaGuardia Airport on June 12 from 2011 through 2020.

**Final Query Ready to Run:**

```sql
SELECT year, temp, wdsp, prcp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2011' AND '2020'
  AND stn = '725030'
  AND mo = '6'
  AND da = '12'
ORDER BY year
LIMIT 100
```

These queries explore different aspects of the dataset relevant to your task. They help retrieve average temperature, wind speed, and precipitation data for LaGuardia Airport (station ID `725030`) on June 12 for each year from 2011 through 2020.

- **Note on Wildcard Table Queries**: When querying multiple yearly tables, the wildcard `gsod*` is used, and `_TABLE_SUFFIX` filters the specific years.

- **Additional Data Exploration**: Some queries retrieve related information, such as dew point, sea level pressure, and visibility, which may provide more insight into the weather conditions.

By running these queries, you can gather the necessary data to analyze the weather patterns at LaGuardia Airport on June 12 over the specified years.Query:
SELECT g.year, g.temp, g.wdsp, g.prcp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS g
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS s
  ON g.stn = CONCAT(s.usaf, '-', s.wban)
WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2011' AND '2020'
  AND s.name LIKE '%LAGUARDIA%'
  AND g.mo = '06'
  AND g.da = '12'
ORDER BY g.year
LIMIT 100

Task: Can you help me retrieve the average temperature, average wind speed, and precipitation for LaGuardia Airport in NYC on June 12 for each year from 2011 through 2020, specifically using the station ID 725030?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To retrieve the average temperature, average wind speed, and precipitation for LaGuardia Airport in NYC on June 12 for each year from 2011 through 2020, we use the GSOD (Global Surface Summary of the Day) dataset provided by NOAA, focusing on station ID `725030` which corresponds to LaGuardia Airport.

```csv
Year,Avg_Temperature,Avg_Wind_Speed,Precipitation
2011,temp1:float,wdsp1:float,prcp1:float
2012,temp2:float,wdsp2:float,prcp2:float
2013,temp3:float,wdsp3:float,prcp3:float
2014,temp4:float,wdsp4:float,prcp4:float
2015,temp5:float,wdsp5:float,prcp5:float
2016,temp6:float,wdsp6:float,prcp6:float
2017,temp7:float,wdsp7:float,prcp7:float
2018,temp8:float,wdsp8:float,prcp8:float
2019,temp9:float,wdsp9:float,prcp9:float
2020,temp10:float,wdsp10:float,prcp10:float
```
(Attention: answer in ten rows)

**Explanation:**
- **Year**: Each year from 2011 through 2020.
- **Avg_Temperature**: The average temperature on June 12 for the given year, in degrees Fahrenheit.
- **Avg_Wind_Speed**: The average wind speed on June 12 for the given year, in knots.
- **Precipitation**: The total precipitation on June 12 for the given year, in inches.

This data provides an overview of the weather conditions at LaGuardia Airport on June 12 over a ten-year period, helping to identify any patterns or anomalies in temperature, wind speed, and precipitation..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...)

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

**Explanation:**
- **Year**: Each year from 2011 through 2020.
- **Avg_Temperature**: The average temperature on June 12 for the given year, in degrees Fahrenheit.
- **Avg_Wind_Speed**: The average wind speed on June 12 for the given year, in knots.
- **Precipitation**: The total precipitation on June 12 for the given year, in inches.

This data provides an overview of the weather conditions at LaGuardia Airport on June 12 over a ten-year period, helping to identify any patterns or anomalies in temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
