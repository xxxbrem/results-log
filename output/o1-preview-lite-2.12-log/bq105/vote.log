After carefully analyzing and comparing both SQL scripts and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct and more accurate script for the following reasons:

1. **Mapping via State Abbreviations**:
   - The second script groups the population data by `state_code` (state abbreviation), which is more standardized and consistent than `state_name`.
   - In the population data, `state_name` sometimes includes variations (e.g., "Washington (state)" or "Georgia (U.S. state)") and combined states (e.g., "Iowa, Minnesota"), which can lead to incorrect mappings when joining on `state_name`.
   - By using `state_code`, the second script avoids potential mismatches and ensures accurate joins between the population and accident data.

2. **Accurate Population Aggregation**:
   - The second script aggregates the state populations more precisely by grouping on `state_code`, avoiding issues with inconsistent or combined state names in the `zipcode_area` data.
   - This results in more accurate calculations of accidents per 100,000 people.

3. **Reliable Join Conditions**:
   - The second script joins the accidents with population data on `state_abbreviation = state_code`, providing a more dependable link between datasets.
   - The first script's reliance on `state_name` for joins could introduce errors due to inconsistencies in state naming.

4. **Consistent Results**:
   - The accident rates calculated in the second script align closely with those in the first script, with minor differences likely due to rounding or data mapping.
   - Given the aforementioned mapping concerns, the second script's results are considered more trustworthy.

**Therefore, the second SQL script (`1result.sql`) is the correct answer.**
