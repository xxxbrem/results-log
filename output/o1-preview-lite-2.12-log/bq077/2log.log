2025-01-22 23:04:52 - root - INFO - Apologies for the error in the SQL query. The issue is due to a mismatched quotation mark in the WHERE clause. Specifically, the string literal `'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT\`` is not properly closed with a single quote `'`. Instead, it has a backtick <code>\`</code> at the end.

Here is the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT `year`, COUNT(*) AS motor_vehicle_theft_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
  AND `year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
GROUP BY `year`
ORDER BY `year`
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of the Correction:**

- Changed the closing backtick <code>\`</code> to a single quote `'` in the string `'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'`.
  
  ```sql
  WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
  ```

Please run this corrected query, and it should execute without syntax errors.

Let me know if you encounter any further issues or have additional questions!

   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Count motor vehicle thefts per month for each year between 2010 and 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `year`, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date`) AS month, COUNT(*) AS theft_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT`
     AND `year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
   GROUP BY `year`, month
   ORDER BY `year`, month
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find the highest number of motor vehicle thefts in one month for each year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `year`, MAX(monthly_theft_count) AS max_monthly_thefts
   FROM (
     SELECT `year`, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date`) AS month, COUNT(*) AS monthly_theft_count
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
     WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT`
       AND `year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
     GROUP BY `year`, month
   )
   GROUP BY `year`
   ORDER BY `year`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Identify months with the highest motor vehicle thefts for each year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT t1.`year`, t1.month, t1.monthly_theft_count
   FROM (
     SELECT `year`, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date`) AS month, COUNT(*) AS monthly_theft_count
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
     WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT`
       AND `year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
     GROUP BY `year`, month
   ) t1
   JOIN (
     SELECT `year`, MAX(monthly_theft_count) AS max_theft
     FROM (
       SELECT `year`, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date`) AS month, COUNT(*) AS monthly_theft_count
       FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
       WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT`
         AND `year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
       GROUP BY `year`, month
     )
     GROUP BY `year`
   ) t2
   ON t1.`year` = t2.`year` AND t1.monthly_theft_count = t2.max_theft
   ORDER BY t1.`year`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Analyze the proportion of motor vehicle thefts that resulted in an arrest between 2010 and 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `arrest`, COUNT(*) AS count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT`
     AND `year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
   GROUP BY `arrest`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List the top 100 blocks with the highest number of motor vehicle thefts:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `block`, COUNT(*) AS theft_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT`
     AND `year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
   GROUP BY `block`
   ORDER BY theft_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve the number of motor vehicle thefts by community area between 2010 and 2016:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `community_area`, COUNT(*) AS theft_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
    WHERE `primary_type` = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT`
      AND `year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
    GROUP BY `community_area`
    ORDER BY theft_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the data related to motor vehicle thefts in the `crime` table, helping to understand the patterns and distributions necessary to answer the task.

Task: For each year from 2010 to 2016, what is the highest number of motor thefts in one month?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the highest number of motor thefts in one month for each year from 2010 to 2016, you would analyze the data from the `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime` table. By filtering for motor vehicle thefts and aggregating the counts by month and year, the results can be presented in the following format:

```csv
Year,Highest_Number_of_Motor_Thefts_in_One_Month
2010,num:int
2011,num:int
2012,num:int
2013,num:int
2014,num:int
2015,num:int
2016,num:int
(Attention: answer in seven rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'chicago_crime': ['crime'], 'chicago_taxi_trips': ['taxi_trips']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-22 23:06:00 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each year from 2010 to 2016, what is the highest number of motor thefts in one month?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the highest number of motor thefts in one month for each year from 2010 to 2016, you would analyze the data from the `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime` table. By filtering for motor vehicle thefts and aggregating the counts by month and year, the results can be presented in the following format:

```csv
Year,Highest_Number_of_Motor_Thefts_in_One_Month
2010,num:int
2011,num:int
2012,num:int
2013,num:int
2014,num:int
2015,num:int
2016,num:int
(Attention: answer in seven rows)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
