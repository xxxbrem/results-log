Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address this task, we'll first identify the relevant tables and columns, along with their potential usage and any conditions that might be applicable.

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

**Table:** `packaging`
- `id`: Unique identifier for each packaging item.
  - *Potential usage*: To identify packaging items and join with other tables.
- `name`: Name of the packaging item.
  - *Potential usage*: To display the names of containers and items.

**Table:** `packaging_relations`
- `packaging_id`: ID of the packaging item that contains another item.
  - *Potential usage*: To determine which packaging items are containers.
- `contains_id`: ID of the item contained within a packaging item.
  - *Potential usage*: To identify items contained within containers.
- `qty`: Quantity of the contained item.
  - *Potential usage*: To calculate total quantities of items across all nested levels.

### Conditions that May Be Used:

- **Identifying Top-Level Containers**: Packaging items not contained within any other packaging.
  - *Condition*: `packaging.id` not present in `packaging_relations.contains_id`.
- **Calculating Total Quantities**: Accumulating quantities across all nested levels.
  - *Note*: Requires recursive traversal of packaging relations.
- **Filtering Items Exceeding Quantity Threshold**: Total quantity exceeds 500.
  - *Condition*: Total accumulated quantity `> 500`.

---

### SQL Queries to Understand the Data:

1. **List all packaging items:**

   ```sql
   SELECT id, name
   FROM packaging
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all packaging relations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT packaging_id, contains_id, qty
   FROM packaging_relations
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Identify all containers (packaging items that contain other items):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p.id, p.name
   FROM packaging AS p
   JOIN packaging_relations AS pr ON p.id = pr.packaging_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Identify all items that are contained within other packaging items:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p.id, p.name
   FROM packaging AS p
   JOIN packaging_relations AS pr ON p.id = pr.contains_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find packaging items that are both containers and contained items:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p.id, p.name
   FROM packaging AS p
   WHERE p.id IN (SELECT packaging_id FROM packaging_relations)
     AND p.id IN (SELECT contains_id FROM packaging_relations)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Identify top-level packaging containers (not contained within any other packaging):**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.id, p.name
   FROM packaging AS p
   WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT contains_id FROM packaging_relations)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List items directly contained in top-level containers along with quantities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p_top.name AS container_name, p_item.name AS item_name, pr.qty
   FROM packaging AS p_top
   JOIN packaging_relations AS pr ON p_top.id = pr.packaging_id
   JOIN packaging AS p_item ON pr.contains_id = p_item.id
   WHERE p_top.id NOT IN (SELECT contains_id FROM packaging_relations)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Identify items that are not containers themselves (do not contain other items):**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.id, p.name
   FROM packaging AS p
   WHERE p.id NOT IN (SELECT packaging_id FROM packaging_relations)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find total quantities of items directly contained in top-level containers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pr.contains_id, p.name, SUM(pr.qty) AS total_qty
   FROM packaging_relations AS pr
   JOIN packaging AS p ON pr.contains_id = p.id
   WHERE pr.packaging_id IN (
     SELECT id FROM packaging
     WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT contains_id FROM packaging_relations)
   )
   GROUP BY pr.contains_id, p.name
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List all packaging items along with their immediate parents:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p_child.name AS item_name, p_parent.name AS container_name
    FROM packaging_relations AS pr
    JOIN packaging AS p_child ON pr.contains_id = p_child.id
    JOIN packaging AS p_parent ON pr.packaging_id = p_parent.id
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Find the total quantity of each item contained within a specific container (e.g., container with `id = 1`):**

    ```sql
    SELECT p.name AS item_name, pr.qty
    FROM packaging_relations AS pr
    JOIN packaging AS p ON pr.contains_id = p.id
    WHERE pr.packaging_id = 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Identify containers containing items with quantities exceeding a certain threshold (e.g., 500) at the first level:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p_top.name AS container_name, p_item.name AS item_name, pr.qty
    FROM packaging AS p_top
    JOIN packaging_relations AS pr ON p_top.id = pr.packaging_id
    JOIN packaging AS p_item ON pr.contains_id = p_item.id
    WHERE pr.qty > 500
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List all items along with the number of containers they are directly contained in:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p.name AS item_name, COUNT(*) AS container_count
    FROM packaging_relations AS pr
    JOIN packaging AS p ON pr.contains_id = p.id
    GROUP BY p.name
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Find all items contained within containers that are themselves contained in top-level containers (two levels deep):**

    ```sql
    SELECT p_item.name AS item_name, p_top.name AS top_container_name
    FROM packaging_relations AS pr1
    JOIN packaging_relations AS pr2 ON pr1.contains_id = pr2.packaging_id
    JOIN packaging AS p_item ON pr2.contains_id = p_item.id
    JOIN packaging AS p_top ON pr1.packaging_id = p_top.id
    WHERE p_top.id NOT IN (SELECT contains_id FROM packaging_relations)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find the accumulated quantity of items within top-level containers (limited to two levels deep):**

    ```sql
    SELECT p_item.name AS item_name, p_top.name AS container_name,
           (pr1.qty * pr2.qty) AS total_qty
    FROM packaging_relations AS pr1
    JOIN packaging_relations AS pr2 ON pr1.contains_id = pr2.packaging_id
    JOIN packaging AS p_item ON pr2.contains_id = p_item.id
    JOIN packaging AS p_top ON pr1.packaging_id = p_top.id
    WHERE p_top.id NOT IN (SELECT contains_id FROM packaging_relations)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help us explore the structure of the packaging hierarchy and understand how items are nested within containers. While recursive computation is needed to accumulate quantities across all nested levels, these queries provide insights into the data and prepare us for further analysis required to solve the task.Query:

Task: Which top-level packaging containers, meaning those not contained within any other packaging, have any item for which the total quantity accumulated across all nested levels in the hierarchy exceeds 500, and what are the names of both these containers and the corresponding items?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To solve this task, we first identify the top-level packaging containers, which are packaging items not contained within any other packaging. Then, for each of these containers, we recursively traverse the hierarchy of contained items, multiplying quantities along the paths to calculate the total quantities of each item. If any item's total accumulated quantity exceeds 500, we list the names of the container and the corresponding item.

```csv
Container_Name,Item_Name
container_name1:str,item_name1:str
container_name2:str,item_name2:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['customers', 'conway_gen_zero', 'web_devices', 'web_demographics', 'channels_dim', 'gender_dim', 'packaging', 'packaging_relations', 'product_groups', 'products', 'monthly_sales', 'breweries', 'purchases', 'product_alcohol', 'customer_favorites', 'customer_reviews', 'locations', 'inventory', 'orders', 'orderlines', 'monthly_budget', 'product_minimums', 'stock', 'ticker', 'web_apps', 'web_pages', 'web_counter_hist', 'server_heartbeat', 'web_page_visits', 'employees', 'emp_hire_periods', 'picking_list', 'picking_line', 'picking_log', 'id_name_type', 'id_name_coll_type', 'id_name_coll_entries', 'favorite_coll_type']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
