Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **For unemployment data from 5-year ACS data (2015 and 2018):**
   - Table: `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2015_5yr`
     - `geo_id`: County identifier
     - `unemployed_pop`: Number of unemployed individuals in 2015
   - Table: `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2018_5yr`
     - `geo_id`: County identifier
     - `unemployed_pop`: Number of unemployed individuals in 2018
   - **Potential Usage:** Compare `unemployed_pop` between 2015 and 2018 to identify counties with an increase in unemployment.

2. **For dual-eligible enrollee counts between December 1, 2015, and December 1, 2018:**
   - Table: `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cms_dual_eligible_enrollment.dual_eligible_enrollment_by_county_and_program`
     - `FIPS`: County identifier
     - `Date`: Date of enrollment data
     - `Public_Total`: Total number of dual-eligible enrollees
   - **Potential Usage:** Compare `Public_Total` on `Date` '2015-12-01' and '2018-12-01' to identify counties with a decrease in dual-eligible enrollees.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**
- Joining tables on county identifiers (`geo_id` and `FIPS`)
- Filtering data for specific dates
- Calculating differences in `unemployed_pop` and `Public_Total`
- Identifying counties where unemployment increased and dual-eligible enrollee counts decreased

Task: Count the number of counties that experienced an increase in unemployment from 2015 to 2018, using 5-year ACS data, and a decrease in dual-eligible enrollee counts between December 1, 2015, and December 1, 2018.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_Counties
count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This represents the number of counties that experienced an increase in unemployment from 2015 to 2018, using 5-year ACS data, and a decrease in dual-eligible enrollee counts between December 1, 2015, and December 1, 2018..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 01:54:29 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Count the number of counties that experienced an increase in unemployment from 2015 to 2018, using 5-year ACS data, and a decrease in dual-eligible enrollee counts between December 1, 2015, and December 1, 2018., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Number_of_Counties
count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This represents the number of counties that experienced an increase in unemployment from 2015 to 2018, using 5-year ACS data, and a decrease in dual-eligible enrollee counts between December 1, 2015, and December 1, 2018. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
