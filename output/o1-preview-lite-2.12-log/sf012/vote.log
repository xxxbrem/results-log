Upon comparing the SQL queries and their respective results, I have the following observations:

1. **0result.sql**:
   - Uses `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "DATE_OF_LOSS") AS "Year"` to extract the year.
   - Filters the date range using `"DATE_OF_LOSS" >= '2010-01-01' AND "DATE_OF_LOSS" <= '2019-12-31'`.
   - Fully qualifies the table name using double quotes and periods.
   
2. **1result.sql**:
   - Also uses `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "DATE_OF_LOSS") AS "Year"` to extract the year.
   - Uses the `BETWEEN` operator to filter the date range: `"DATE_OF_LOSS" BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2019-12-31'`.
   - Specifies the table name without double quotes, which is acceptable in SQL syntax.
   
3. **2result.sql**:
   - Uses `YEAR("DATE_OF_LOSS") AS "Year"` to extract the year, which is a function available in some SQL dialects but not standard SQL.
   - Filters the date range using `YEAR("DATE_OF_LOSS") BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019`, which may not be as precise if "DATE_OF_LOSS" contains time components.
   - Applies `ROUND` function to the sums, which is unnecessary for damage amounts unless specified.
   
**Reasons for choosing the correct SQL:**

- **Accuracy and Clarity:** All three queries aim to calculate the total building and contents damage amounts for 'City Of New York' from 2010 through 2019, grouped by each year.
- **SQL Standard Compliance:** Using `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "DATE_OF_LOSS")` is standard SQL syntax and ensures compatibility across different SQL databases.
- **Date Filtering:** Using `"DATE_OF_LOSS" BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2019-12-31'` is clear and concise, and it includes both the start and end dates.
- **Unnecessary Functions:** The `ROUND` function in **2result.sql** is not required unless there's a need to format the numbers, which the task does not specify.

**Conclusion:**

Between **0result.sql** and **1result.sql**, both are correct and produce the same results. However, **1result.sql** is slightly more concise due to the use of the `BETWEEN` operator and avoids unnecessary quotation marks around the table name.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

This SQL query accurately addresses the task by calculating the total building and contents damage amounts for each year from 2010 through 2019 for the NFIP community named 'City Of New York,' grouped by each year of loss.
