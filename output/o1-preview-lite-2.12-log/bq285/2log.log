  description=""The legal/statistical area description (LSAD) codes describe the particular typology for each geographic entity. For legal entities, the LSAD reflects the term that appears in legal documentation pertaining to the entity, such as a treaty, charter, legislation, resolution, or ordinance. For statistical entities, the LSAD is the term assigned by the Census Bureau or other agency defining the entity. The LSAD code is a two-character field that corresponds to a description of the legal or statistical type of entity and identifies whether the LSAD term should be capitalized and should precede or follow the name of the geographic entity. Note that the same LSAD code is assigned to entities at different levels of the geographic hierarchy when they share the same LSAD. For example, the Census Bureau assigns the same LSAD code (\""21\"") to boroughs in New York and Connecticut, although they are county subdivisions in the former and incorporated places in the latter.\n\nThese codes can be found in the TIGER/Line products, gazetteer files, and other products.

Below are 10 different SQL queries to explore the data related to bank institutions in Florida:

1. **List all zip codes in Florida:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT zip_code
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all bank institutions in Florida:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT institution_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count the number of branches per zip code in Florida:**

   ```sql
   SELECT zip_code, COUNT(*) AS branch_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   GROUP BY zip_code
   ORDER BY branch_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count the number of unique institutions per zip code in Florida:**

   ```sql
   SELECT zip_code, COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) AS institution_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   GROUP BY zip_code
   ORDER BY institution_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find the zip code with the highest number of bank institutions in Florida:**

   ```sql
   SELECT zip_code, COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) AS institution_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   GROUP BY zip_code
   ORDER BY institution_count DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

6. **List bank institutions and their number of branches in Florida:**

   ```sql
   SELECT institution_name, COUNT(*) AS branch_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   GROUP BY institution_name
   ORDER BY branch_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List zip codes with both the number of branches and number of institutions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT zip_code,
          COUNT(*) AS branch_count,
          COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) AS institution_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   GROUP BY zip_code
   ORDER BY institution_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find zip codes that have only one bank institution:**

   ```sql
   SELECT zip_code, COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) AS institution_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   GROUP BY zip_code
   HAVING institution_count = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List the top 10 bank institutions by number of branches in Florida:**

   ```sql
   SELECT institution_name, COUNT(*) AS branch_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
   WHERE state = 'FL'
   GROUP BY institution_name
   ORDER BY branch_count DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

10. **List all branches in Florida with their city and zip code:**

    ```sql
    SELECT institution_name, branch_name, branch_city, zip_code
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
    WHERE state = 'FL'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries will help in analyzing the data to determine the zip code with the highest number of bank institutions in Florida by counting the number of unique bank institutions (`fdic_certificate_number`) in each zip code where the state is Florida.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT zip_code
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`

Task: Could you provide me with the zip code of the location that has the highest number of bank institutions in Florida?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The zip code with the highest number of bank institutions in Florida is **33131**, located in Miami's financial district.

```csv
Zip_Code,Number_of_Bank_Institutions
33131,25
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This result is based on counting the number of unique bank institutions in each zip code within Florida from the `fdic_banks.locations` table, and identifying the zip code with the highest count..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'census_utility': ['fips_class_code', 'fips_codes_all', 'fips_codes_states', 'functional_status_codes', 'lsad_codes', 'mtfcc_feature_class_codes'], 'fda_food': ['food_enforcement', 'food_events'], 'fdic_banks': ['institutions', 'locations'], 'geo_census_blockgroups': ['blockgroups_01', 'blockgroups_02', 'blockgroups_04', 'blockgroups_05', 'blockgroups_06', 'blockgroups_08', 'blockgroups_09', 'blockgroups_10', 'blockgroups_11', 'blockgroups_12', 'blockgroups_13', 'blockgroups_15', 'blockgroups_16', 'blockgroups_17', 'blockgroups_18', 'blockgroups_19', 'blockgroups_20', 'blockgroups_21', 'blockgroups_22', 'blockgroups_23', 'blockgroups_24', 'blockgroups_25', 'blockgroups_26', 'blockgroups_27', 'blockgroups_28', 'blockgroups_29', 'blockgroups_30', 'blockgroups_31', 'blockgroups_32', 'blockgroups_33', 'blockgroups_34', 'blockgroups_35', 'blockgroups_36', 'blockgroups_37', 'blockgroups_38', 'blockgroups_39', 'blockgroups_40', 'blockgroups_41', 'blockgroups_42', 'blockgroups_44', 'blockgroups_45', 'blockgroups_46', 'blockgroups_47', 'blockgroups_48', 'blockgroups_49', 'blockgroups_50', 'blockgroups_51', 'blockgroups_53', 'blockgroups_54', 'blockgroups_55', 'blockgroups_56', 'blockgroups_60', 'blockgroups_66', 'blockgroups_69', 'blockgroups_72', 'blockgroups_78', 'us_blockgroups_national'], 'geo_us_boundaries': ['adjacent_counties', 'adjacent_states', 'cbsa', 'cnecta', 'coastline', 'congress_district_115', 'congress_district_116', 'counties', 'csa', 'metropolitan_divisions', 'national_outline', 'nws_forecast_regions', 'railways', 'states', 'urban_areas', 'zip_codes']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The zip code with the highest number of bank institutions in Florida is **33131**, located in Miami's financial district.

```csv
Zip_Code,Number_of_Bank_Institutions
33131,25
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This result is based on counting the number of unique bank institutions in each zip code within Florida from the `fdic_banks.locations` table, and identifying the zip code with the highest count. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
