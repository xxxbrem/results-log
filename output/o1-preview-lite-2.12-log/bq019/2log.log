   GROUP BY provider_city
   ORDER BY city_total_discharges DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

7. **Calculate Weighted Average Total Payments for Each City**

   ```sql
   SELECT provider_city,
          SUM(average_total_payments * total_discharges) / SUM(total_discharges) AS weighted_avg_total_payments
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   WHERE drg_definition = 'Specific DRG'
   GROUP BY provider_city
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get Detailed Payment Data for the Top DRG and Cities**

   ```sql
   SELECT provider_city, total_discharges, average_total_payments
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   WHERE drg_definition = 'Specific DRG'
   ORDER BY provider_city
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Check the Distribution of Discharges Across Cities for the Top DRG**

   ```sql
   SELECT provider_city, COUNT(provider_id) AS number_of_providers, SUM(total_discharges) AS total_discharges
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
   WHERE drg_definition = 'Specific DRG'
   GROUP BY provider_city
   ORDER BY total_discharges DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Compare Average Total Payments Across Top Cities**

    ```sql
    SELECT provider_city,
           AVG(average_total_payments) AS avg_total_payments
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`

    WHERE drg_definition IS NULL OR provider_city IS NULL OR total_discharges IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

By executing these queries, we can:

- Determine which DRG definition has the highest total discharges.
- Identify the top three cities with the most discharges for that DRG.
- Calculate the weighted average total payments for each of those cities, weighted by total discharges.

Task: In the 2014 CMS Medicare inpatient charges data, which DRG definition has the highest total number of discharges, and among the top three cities with the most discharges for that DRG definition, what are their respective weighted average total payments (weighted by total discharges)

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The DRG definition with the highest total number of discharges in the 2014 CMS Medicare inpatient charges data, along with the top three cities with the most discharges for that DRG definition and their respective weighted average total payments (weighted by total discharges), are as follows:

```csv
DRG_definition,City,Weighted_Average_Total_Payments
drg_definition:str,city1:str,payment1:float
drg_definition:str,city2:str,payment2:float
drg_definition:str,city3:str,payment3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 16:25:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing In the 2014 CMS Medicare inpatient charges data, which DRG definition has the highest total number of discharges, and among the top three cities with the most discharges for that DRG definition, what are their respective weighted average total payments (weighted by total discharges), reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The DRG definition with the highest total number of discharges in the 2014 CMS Medicare inpatient charges data, along with the top three cities with the most discharges for that DRG definition and their respective weighted average total payments (weighted by total discharges), are as follows:

```csv
DRG_definition,City,Weighted_Average_Total_Payments
drg_definition:str,city1:str,payment1:float
drg_definition:str,city2:str,payment2:float
drg_definition:str,city3:str,payment3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
