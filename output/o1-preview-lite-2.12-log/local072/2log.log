Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task, we'll first identify the relevant tables and columns, outline how they will be used, and then construct SQL queries to explore the data.

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

**Table:** `cities`
- **"city_id"**: Unique identifier for each city. *Potential usage:* Reference cities uniquely.
- **"city_name"**: Name of the city. *Potential usage:* Identify cities by name.
- **"country_code_2"**: Two-letter country code. *Potential usage:* Group entries by country.
- **"capital"**: Integer indicating if the city is a capital city (1 for capital, 0 for not). *Potential usage:* Determine if a city is the capital.
- **"insert_date"**: Date when the data was inserted. *Potential usage:* Filter entries by specific dates and find insertion patterns.

**Table:** `cities_countries`
- **"country_id"**: Unique identifier for each country.
- **"country_name"**: Name of the country. *Potential usage:* Get the full name of the country from the country code.
- **"country_code_2"**: Two-letter country code. *Potential usage:* Join with the `cities` table to get country names.

### Conditions that May Be Used:
- Filter entries where `"insert_date"` is in January 2022 (e.g., `"insert_date" LIKE '2022-01-%'`).
- Group entries by `"country_code_2"` and count distinct `"insert_date"` to find countries with data inserted on nine different days.
- Find the longest consecutive data insertion period for a specific country.
- Calculate the proportion of entries from the capital city within a specific period.

### SQL Queries:

Below are SQL queries designed to explore the data and help solve the task.

1. **Get distinct insertion dates in January 2022 to understand the date format:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "insert_date" 
   FROM "cities" 
   WHERE "insert_date" LIKE '2022-01-%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all countries with their country codes to understand available countries:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_code_2", "country_name"
   FROM "cities_countries"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count the number of distinct insertion dates per country in January 2022:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "country_code_2", COUNT(DISTINCT "insert_date") AS "num_insert_dates"
   FROM "cities"
   WHERE "insert_date" LIKE '2022-01-%'
   GROUP BY "country_code_2"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find countries with exactly nine distinct insertion dates in January 2022:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "country_code_2"
   FROM (
     SELECT "country_code_2", COUNT(DISTINCT "insert_date") AS "num_insert_dates"
     FROM "cities"
     WHERE "insert_date" LIKE '2022-01-%'
     GROUP BY "country_code_2"
   )
   WHERE "num_insert_dates" = 9
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List insertion dates for the identified country to check for consecutive days:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "insert_date"
   FROM "cities"
   WHERE "country_code_2" = 'XX' AND "insert_date" LIKE '2022-01-%'
   ORDER BY "insert_date"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *(Replace 'XX' with the actual country code identified in the previous query.)*

6. **Retrieve entries for the identified country during its longest consecutive insertion period:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "city_name", "insert_date", "capital"
   FROM "cities"
   WHERE "country_code_2" = 'XX' AND "insert_date" BETWEEN '2022-01-YY' AND '2022-01-ZZ'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *(Replace 'XX' with the country code, 'YY' with the start date, and 'ZZ' with the end date of the longest consecutive period.)*

7. **Count the total number of entries during the longest consecutive period for the country:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "total_entries"
   FROM "cities"
   WHERE "country_code_2" = 'XX' AND "insert_date" BETWEEN '2022-01-YY' AND '2022-01-ZZ'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count the number of entries from the capital city during the same period:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "capital_entries"
   FROM "cities"
   WHERE "country_code_2" = 'XX' AND "capital" = 1 AND "insert_date" BETWEEN '2022-01-YY' AND '2022-01-ZZ'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate the proportion of capital city entries during the period:**
   ```sql
   SELECT (CAST(capital_entries AS FLOAT) / total_entries) AS "proportion_from_capital"
   FROM (
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS "total_entries"
     FROM "cities"
     WHERE "country_code_2" = 'XX' AND "insert_date" BETWEEN '2022-01-YY' AND '2022-01-ZZ'
   ), (
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS "capital_entries"
     FROM "cities"
     WHERE "country_code_2" = 'XX' AND "capital" = 1 AND "insert_date" BETWEEN '2022-01-YY' AND '2022-01-ZZ'
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Get the name of the capital city for the identified country:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "city_name"
    FROM "cities"
    WHERE "country_code_2" = 'XX' AND "capital" = 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **List all entries for the capital city during January 2022 to verify data:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "city_name", "insert_date"
    FROM "cities"
    WHERE "country_code_2" = 'XX' AND "capital" = 1 AND "insert_date" LIKE '2022-01-%'
    ORDER BY "insert_date"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Find the longest consecutive insertion streak for the country in January 2022:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "insert_date"
    FROM "cities"
    WHERE "country_code_2" = 'XX' AND "insert_date" LIKE '2022-01-%'
    GROUP BY "insert_date"
    ORDER BY "insert_date"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Determine the total number of cities in the country to calculate proportions accurately:**
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "city_id") AS "total_cities"
    FROM "cities"
    WHERE "country_code_2" = 'XX'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Get the population data for entries during the period to see if it affects insertion frequency:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "city_name", "population"
    FROM "cities"
    WHERE "country_code_2" = 'XX' AND "insert_date" BETWEEN '2022-01-YY' AND '2022-01-ZZ'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Check for any other countries with similar insertion patterns for comparison:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "country_code_2", COUNT(DISTINCT "insert_date") AS "num_insert_dates"
    FROM "cities"
    WHERE "insert_date" LIKE '2022-01-%'
    GROUP BY "country_code_2"
    HAVING "num_insert_dates" >= 7
    ORDER BY "num_insert_dates" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

*(Note: Replace 'XX' with the actual country code identified, and 'YY' and 'ZZ' with the specific start and end dates of the longest consecutive period.)*

These queries are designed to extract the necessary information step by step, ultimately enabling the calculation of the proportion of entries from the capital city during the longest consecutive data insertion period in January 2022 for the identified country.Query:

Task: Identify the country with data inserted on nine different days in January 2022. Then, find the longest consecutive period with data insertions for this country during January 2022, and calculate the proportion of entries that are from its capital city within this longest consecutive insertion period.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: We identified the country with data inserted on nine different days in January 2022. During the longest consecutive insertion period within that month for this country, we calculated the proportion of entries that are from its capital city as follows:

```csv
proportion_of_entries_from_capital
value:float<1
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 17:25:37 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Identify the country with data inserted on nine different days in January 2022. Then, find the longest consecutive period with data insertions for this country during January 2022, and calculate the proportion of entries that are from its capital city within this longest consecutive insertion period., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: We identified the country with data inserted on nine different days in January 2022. During the longest consecutive insertion period within that month for this country, we calculated the proportion of entries that are from its capital city as follows:

```csv
proportion_of_entries_from_capital
