The two SQL queries provided are:

1. **0result.sql**: This query dynamically identifies the traffic source with the highest total transaction revenue for the year 2017 and calculates the difference between its highest and lowest monthly transaction revenues.

2. **2result.sql**: This query assumes that `(direct)` is the traffic source with the highest total transaction revenue and calculates the difference between its highest and lowest monthly transaction revenues.

**Comparison and Reasoning:**

- **0result.sql**:
  - *Pros:*
    - Dynamically finds the top traffic source based on the actual data.
    - Does not make assumptions about which traffic source has the highest revenue.
    - Ensures accuracy even if the data changes in the future.
  - *Cons:*
    - Slightly more complex due to the use of subqueries.
  
- **2result.sql**:
  - *Pros:*
    - Simpler query structure.
  - *Cons:*
    - Assumes that `(direct)` is the top traffic source without verifying it.
    - May produce incorrect results if `(direct)` is not the top source in the data.
    - Less robust and not dynamic.

**Conclusion:**

- **0result.sql** is the correct and preferred SQL query because it accurately identifies the traffic source with the highest total transaction revenue in 2017 without making any assumptions. It then calculates the required difference between the highest and lowest monthly revenues for that source.
- **2result.sql** is less reliable because it hardcodes the traffic source, which might not hold true in different datasets or if the data changes.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plaintext
0result.sql
