After reviewing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer for the following reasons:

1. **Sessionization**: The query in `0result.sql` properly accounts for user sessions by creating a `session_id` based on 30-minute inactivity gaps. This aligns with the requirement to calculate transitions **within the same session**.

2. **Accurate PLP and PDP Identification**: It uses a comprehensive approach to classify PLP and PDP views by analyzing the URL path segments and matching them against the specified categories. This ensures that pages are correctly identified as PLP or PDP based on the given criteria.

3. **Correct Transition Counting**: By joining PLP and PDP views on both `user_pseudo_id` and `session_id`, and ensuring that the PDP event occurs after the PLP event within the same session, it accurately counts the number of PLP views that lead to PDP views within the same session.

4. **Result Interpretation**: The calculated percentage of **21.8559%** indicates the proportion of PLP views that transitioned to PDP views within sessions, which seems reasonable given typical user browsing behavior on e-commerce sites.

In contrast, `2result.sql` does not account for session boundaries and only considers transitions at the user level, potentially spanning multiple sessions. This could lead to inaccuracies because the task specifically asks for transitions within the same session.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

0result.sql
