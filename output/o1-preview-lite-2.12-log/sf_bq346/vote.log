After comparing both SQL queries, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct query.

**Reason:**

- **Syntax Accuracy:** In `1result.sql`, the `SegmentedPropertyCategory` field is accessed using correct syntax with quotation marks around `"CodeMeaning"`, which is necessary due to the uppercase letters and to accurately reference the key within the VARIANT column. The syntax `s."SegmentedPropertyCategory":"CodeMeaning"::STRING` correctly extracts the `CodeMeaning` from the JSON structure stored in the `SegmentedPropertyCategory` column.

- **Table and Column References:** The query uses double quotes around table and column names (`"SEGMENTATIONS"` and `"DICOM_PIVOT"`) to preserve case sensitivity, which is important if the database was created with case-sensitive identifiers.

- **Consistency:** The query aligns with standard SQL practices for querying JSON data and ensures accurate data retrieval.

**Result:**

```plaintext
1result.sql
