After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL that fulfills the task requirements.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Task Requirements:**
   - Retrieve the top 100 independent patent claims with the highest word counts.
   - Match these claims with their publication numbers.
   - Ensure only the earliest publication for each application is included.
   - Filter for independent claims (`ind_flg = '1'`).
   - Order the results by descending word count.

2. **Analysis of SQL Queries:**

   - **`0result.sql`:**
     - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` partitioned by `"application_number"` and ordered by `"publication_date"` ascending to identify the earliest publication per application.
     - Filters to include only the earliest publication (`WHERE t."rn" = 1`).
     - Correctly joins `PATENT_CLAIMS_STATS`, `MATCH`, and `PUBLICATIONS` tables.
     - Filters for independent claims (`pcs."ind_flg" = '1'`).
     - Orders the results by descending `"word_ct"` and limits to the top 100.

   - **`1result.sql`:**
     - Similar approach but uses a subquery with `ROW_NUMBER()` in the join. However, it may not correctly limit to the earliest publication per application due to the placement of `p."rn" = 1` in the join condition.
     - The results show inconsistent word counts and publications not aligning with the task requirements.

   - **`2result.sql`:**
     - Uses `filing_date` instead of `publication_date` to determine the earliest publication, which may not be appropriate as the task specifies the earliest publication.
     - Also includes an additional ordering by `pcs."word_ct"` in the `ROW_NUMBER()`, which may skew the selection of claims within the earliest publication.
     - Results may not strictly reflect the earliest publications per application.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - **`0result.sql`** accurately captures the earliest publication per application using `publication_date` and correctly filters and orders the independent claims as per the task specifications.
