**Conditions that may be used:**

- Ensure that pizzas named 'Meatlovers' receive a `pizza_id` of **1**, while all other pizzas receive a `pizza_id` of **2**.
- The final set of ingredients is determined by:
  - Starting with the standard toppings from the pizza's recipe.
  - Removing any toppings specified as exclusions.
  - Adding any toppings specified as extras.
- The ingredients should be presented in **alphabetical order**.
- If an ingredient appears multiple times (e.g., both standard and extra), prefix it with **'2x'**.
- Concatenate the ingredients into a string that begins with the pizza name followed by ': '.
- Group by `row_id`, `order_id`, `pizza_name`, and `order_time` so that each order appears once.
- Return the listing of toppings in **ascending order by `row_id`**.

    FROM "pizza_names" AS n
    WHERE n."pizza_name" NOT LIKE '%Meat%lover%' AND n."pizza_id" = 2
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    FROM "pizza_clean_customer_orders" AS o
    JOIN "pizza_recipes" AS r ON o."pizza_id" = r."pizza_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

19. **List orders along with their toppings adjusted for exclusions and extras:**

    ```sql
    SELECT o."order_id", r."toppings" AS "standard_toppings", ex."exclusions", extra."extras"
    FROM "pizza_clean_customer_orders" AS o
    JOIN "pizza_recipes" AS r ON o."pizza_id" = r."pizza_id"
    LEFT JOIN "pizza_get_exclusions" AS ex ON o."order_id" = ex."order_id"
    LEFT JOIN "pizza_get_extras" AS extra ON o."order_id" = extra."order_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

20. **List all unique topping names used in standard recipes:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT t."topping_name"
    FROM "pizza_recipes" AS r
    JOIN "pizza_toppings" AS t ON r."toppings" LIKE '%' || t."topping_id" || '%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: For each pizza order, please list a single result row containing the row ID, order ID, customer ID, pizza name, and the final set of ingredients. The final set of ingredients should be determined by taking the standard toppings from the pizza’s recipe, removing any toppings specified as exclusions, then adding any toppings specified as extras. The resulting ingredients must be presented in alphabetical order, prefixed by ‘2x’ if the same ingredient appears multiple times (for example, if both standard and extra or added multiple times), and concatenated into a string that begins with the pizza name followed by ‘: ’. Group by row ID, order ID, pizza name, and order time so that each order appears once, and return the listing of toppings in ascending order by row ID, ensuring that ‘Meatlovers’ pizzas receive a pizza_id of 1 while all others receive a pizza_id of 2.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
row_id,order_id,customer_id,pizza_name,final_ingredients
row_id1:int,order_id1:int,customer_id1:int,pizza_name1:str,final_ingredients1:str
row_id2:int,order_id2:int,customer_id2:int,pizza_name2:str,final_ingredients2:str
...
```

**Explanation:**

For each pizza order, we list the `row_id`, `order_id`, `customer_id`, `pizza_name`, and the `final_ingredients`. The `final_ingredients` are determined by taking the standard toppings from the pizza's recipe, removing any exclusions, and adding any extras. Ingredients are presented in alphabetical order, prefixed by '2x' if an ingredient appears multiple times (e.g., both standard and extra). The ingredients string begins with the pizza name followed by ': '. Orders are grouped by `row_id`, `order_id`, `pizza_name`, and `order_time` so that each order appears once. The results are sorted in ascending order by `row_id`, ensuring that 'Meatlovers' pizzas receive a `pizza_id` of 1 while all others receive a `pizza_id` of 2..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['pizza_names', 'companies_funding', 'pizza_customer_orders', 'pizza_toppings', 'trees', 'pizza_recipes', 'statistics', 'income_trees', 'pizza_clean_runner_orders', 'pizza_runner_orders', 'word_list', 'companies_dates', 'pizza_get_extras', 'pizza_get_exclusions', 'pizza_clean_customer_orders', 'companies_industries', 'pizza_runners']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 11:26:47 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each pizza order, please list a single result row containing the row ID, order ID, customer ID, pizza name, and the final set of ingredients. The final set of ingredients should be determined by taking the standard toppings from the pizza’s recipe, removing any toppings specified as exclusions, then adding any toppings specified as extras. The resulting ingredients must be presented in alphabetical order, prefixed by ‘2x’ if the same ingredient appears multiple times (for example, if both standard and extra or added multiple times), and concatenated into a string that begins with the pizza name followed by ‘: ’. Group by row ID, order ID, pizza name, and order time so that each order appears once, and return the listing of toppings in ascending order by row ID, ensuring that ‘Meatlovers’ pizzas receive a pizza_id of 1 while all others receive a pizza_id of 2., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
row_id,order_id,customer_id,pizza_name,final_ingredients
row_id1:int,order_id1:int,customer_id1:int,pizza_name1:str,final_ingredients1:str
row_id2:int,order_id2:int,customer_id2:int,pizza_name2:str,final_ingredients2:str
...
```

**Explanation:**

For each pizza order, we list the `row_id`, `order_id`, `customer_id`, `pizza_name`, and the `final_ingredients`. The `final_ingredients` are determined by taking the standard toppings from the pizza's recipe, removing any exclusions, and adding any extras. Ingredients are presented in alphabetical order, prefixed by '2x' if an ingredient appears multiple times (e.g., both standard and extra). The ingredients string begins with the pizza name followed by ': '. Orders are grouped by `row_id`, `order_id`, `pizza_name`, and `order_time` so that each order appears once. The results are sorted in ascending order by `row_id`, ensuring that 'Meatlovers' pizzas receive a `pizza_id` of 1 while all others receive a `pizza_id` of 2. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
