2025-02-12 04:38:16 - root - INFO - It appears that the error is due to a mismatch in the case sensitivity of the column names or an undefined alias. Let's correct the SQL query to ensure it matches the exact column names in the database.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "product_id" 
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS"
WHERE "status" = 'Complete'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Notes:**

- **Column Names Case Sensitivity:** In SQL, when you enclose identifiers in double quotes, they become case-sensitive. Ensure that the column names exactly match the case used in the database schema. Based on the DDL provided:

  - The column is `"product_id"`, not `"PRODUCT_ID"` or `"product_ID"`.
  - The column is `"status"`, not `"STATUS"`.

- **Status Value Correction:** In the data samples you provided earlier, the `status` values include 'Complete', 'Cancelled', 'Processing', and 'Shipped'. The value 'Completed' does not appear. So, the correct status to filter on is `'Complete'` instead of `'Completed'`.

- **Alias Usage:** The error message mentions `OI.PRODUCT_ID`, which suggests an alias `OI` was expected but not defined in your query. Since this query doesn't use any aliases, this error might be from a previous query. Ensure that all aliases are properly defined if you use them.

**If Case Sensitivity Issues Persist:**

If you're still encountering errors, you can remove the double quotes to make the identifiers case-insensitive (assuming your database allows it):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT product_id 
FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.ORDER_ITEMS
WHERE status = 'Complete'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Removing Double Quotes:** Without double quotes, SQL treats identifiers as case-insensitive, which can help avoid issues if the exact case is uncertain.

- **Ensuring Correct Column Names:** Verify the exact column names in your database schema if possible. They should match the names used in the DDL you provided.

Please try running the corrected query, and it should return the desired results without errors.

Task: Please provide the names of the top three most profitable products for each month from January 2019 through August 2022, excluding any products associated with orders that were canceled or returned. For each product in each month, the profit should be calculated as the sum of the sale prices of all order items minus the sum of the costs of those sold items in that month.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Month,Product_Name,Profit
Jan-2019,product1:str,profit1:float
Jan-2019,product2:str,profit2:float
Jan-2019,product3:str,profit3:float
Feb-2019,product1:str,profit1:float
Feb-2019,product2:str,profit2:float
Feb-2019,product3:str,profit3:float
...
Aug-2022,product1:str,profit1:float
Aug-2022,product2:str,profit2:float
Aug-2022,product3:str,profit3:float
```

The table above lists the top three most profitable products for each month from January 2019 through August 2022. For each product, the profit is calculated as the sum of the sale prices of all order items minus the sum of the costs of those sold items in that month, excluding any products associated with orders that were canceled or returned..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': {'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': ['DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS', 'ORDERS', 'USERS', 'EVENTS', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS', 'PRODUCTS', 'ORDER_ITEMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
