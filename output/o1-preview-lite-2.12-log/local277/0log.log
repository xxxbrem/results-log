These queries help us understand the sales data for products 4160 and 7790 from January 2016 to December 2018, which is essential for forecasting their average annual sales for 2018. The queries range from simple data retrieval to more complex calculations like growth rates, average sales, seasonality, and identifying missing data. They provide insights into the sales trends and patterns necessary for applying weighted regression and seasonality adjustments in forecasting.

**Note:**

To perform the actual forecasting with weighted regression and seasonality adjustments, additional steps involving statistical analysis and possibly more complex SQL queries or external tools would be required. The provided queries serve as a foundation for understanding and preparing the data for such analysis.Query:

Task: What is the average forecasted annual sales for products 4160 and 7790 during 2018, using monthly sales data starting from January 2016 for the first 36 months, applying seasonality adjustments from time steps 7 through 30, and employing a weighted regression method to estimate sales?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product ID,Average Forecasted Annual Sales (2018)
4160,N/A
7790,N/A
(Attention: The average forecasted annual sales cannot be computed without the actual sales data.)
```

**Explanation:**

To determine the average forecasted annual sales for products **4160** and **7790** during **2018**, we would need access to the monthly sales data from January 2016 to December 2018. This data is essential to perform a weighted regression analysis and apply seasonality adjustments from time steps 7 through 30 (which correspond to months July 2016 through June 2018). Without the actual sales figures, we cannot calculate the forecasted sales values..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['customers', 'conway_gen_zero', 'web_devices', 'web_demographics', 'channels_dim', 'gender_dim', 'packaging', 'packaging_relations', 'product_groups', 'products', 'monthly_sales', 'breweries', 'purchases', 'product_alcohol', 'customer_favorites', 'customer_reviews', 'locations', 'inventory', 'orders', 'orderlines', 'monthly_budget', 'product_minimums', 'stock', 'ticker', 'web_apps', 'web_pages', 'web_counter_hist', 'server_heartbeat', 'web_page_visits', 'employees', 'emp_hire_periods', 'picking_list', 'picking_line', 'picking_log', 'id_name_type', 'id_name_coll_type', 'id_name_coll_entries', 'favorite_coll_type']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 13:43:01 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the average forecasted annual sales for products 4160 and 7790 during 2018, using monthly sales data starting from January 2016 for the first 36 months, applying seasonality adjustments from time steps 7 through 30, and employing a weighted regression method to estimate sales?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product ID,Average Forecasted Annual Sales (2018)
4160,N/A
7790,N/A
(Attention: The average forecasted annual sales cannot be computed without the actual sales data.)
```

**Explanation:**

To determine the average forecasted annual sales for products **4160** and **7790** during **2018**, we would need access to the monthly sales data from January 2016 to December 2018. This data is essential to perform a weighted regression analysis and apply seasonality adjustments from time steps 7 through 30 (which correspond to months July 2016 through June 2018). Without the actual sales figures, we cannot calculate the forecasted sales values. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
