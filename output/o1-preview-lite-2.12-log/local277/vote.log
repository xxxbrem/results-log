After analyzing the three provided SQL scripts and their results, the best choice that meets the task requirements is `1result.sql`.

**Here's the reasoning:**

---

### **Understanding the Task Requirements:**

- **Data Range:** Use monthly sales data starting from January 2016 for the first 36 months (i.e., from January 2016 to December 2018).

- **Products:** Focus on products with IDs **4160** and **7790**.

- **Seasonality Adjustments:** Apply seasonality adjustments using data from **time steps 7 through 30** (i.e., from July 2016 to December 2018).

- **Weighted Regression:** Employ a weighted regression method to estimate sales.

- **Objective:** Calculate the **average forecasted annual sales for 2018** for both products.

---

### **Comparison of the SQL Scripts:**

#### **1. `0result.sql`:**

- **Approach:**
  - Filters data for time steps 7 through 30.
  - Performs a simple linear regression without any seasonality adjustments or weighting.
  - Forecasts sales for time steps 25 to 36 (January to December 2018).

- **Limitations:**
  - Does **not** apply seasonality adjustments.
  - Does **not** employ a weighted regression method.
  - Ignores the impact of seasonal variations on sales patterns.

#### **2. `1result.sql`:**

- **Approach:**
  - Calculates the **seasonality indices** for each month using data from time steps 7 through 30.
  - **Deseasonalizes** the sales data by dividing the actual sales by the seasonality index.
  - Performs a linear regression on the deseasonalized data.
  - **Reapplies** the seasonality indices to the forecasted deseasonalized sales to obtain the final forecast.
  - Forecasts sales for time steps 25 to 36 (January to December 2018).

- **Strengths:**
  - **Correctly applies seasonality adjustments**, addressing the seasonal patterns in sales data.
  - Uses data from the specified time steps for seasonality calculation.
  - Provides a more accurate forecast by accounting for monthly sales fluctuations.

- **Limitations:**
  - Does **not explicitly** employ a weighted regression method.
  - However, the seasonality adjustment indirectly gives more importance to the seasonal patterns.

#### **3. `2result.sql`:**

- **Approach:**
  - Applies **weights** to the regression by giving a weight of 2 to data from time steps 7 to 30 and a weight of 1 to other data.
  - Performs a weighted linear regression on the original sales data (without deseasonalization).
  - Forecasts sales for time steps 25 to 36 (January to December 2018).

- **Limitations:**
  - Does **not** apply seasonality adjustments.
  - The weighting alone may not sufficiently address the seasonal variations in the sales data.
  - Forecasts may be less accurate due to the absence of seasonality adjustments.

---

### **Conclusion:**

- **`1result.sql`** aligns most closely with the task requirements by effectively applying **seasonality adjustments** using data from time steps 7 through 30 and performing regression on the deseasonalized data.
- While it does not explicitly incorporate weighting in the regression, the accurate seasonality adjustment can significantly enhance the forecast's reliability.
- Considering the critical importance of seasonality in sales forecasting and the task's emphasis on seasonality adjustments, **`1result.sql`** provides a more precise and appropriate method for estimating the average forecasted annual sales for 2018.

**Therefore, the correct SQL script is:**

```plaintext
1result.sql
