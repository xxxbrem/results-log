**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **monthly_sales**
    - **product_id**: Used to identify products 4160 and 7790.
    - **mth**: The month of the sales data (format 'YYYY-MM-DD'). We'll use it to filter data from January 2016 to December 2018.
    - **qty**: Quantity sold. This is the value we need for the analysis.

- **products**
    - **id**: Product identifier.
    - **name**: Product name. Useful for understanding which products correspond to the IDs.

**Conditions:**

- **Product IDs**: `4160` and `7790`.
- **Date Range**: From `'2016-01-01'` to `'2018-12-01'` (the first 36 months starting from January 2016).

**Explanation:**

These queries are designed to explore the sales data for products **4160** and **7790** from January 2016 to December 2018:

- **Queries 1-3**: Retrieve basic information about the products and the available months in the sales data.
- **Queries 4-6**: Extract and summarize sales quantities for the specified products and time frame.
- **Queries 7-8**: Examine monthly sales data separately for each product.
- **Query 9**: Check data completeness by counting the number of months with sales data for each product.
- **Query 10**: Combine product names with sales data for better clarity.
- **Queries 11-12**: Analyze monthly sales trends over time to identify patterns.
- **Query 13**: Identify the highest and lowest sales months for each product.
- **Query 14**: Detect potential outliers that may affect the regression analysis.
- **Query 15**: Calculate average sales per quarter to observe seasonal trends.

By executing these queries, we gain insights into the sales patterns, data completeness, and any irregularities that may influence the forecasting model. This understanding is essential for applying seasonality adjustments and performing a weighted regression to estimate the average forecasted annual sales for 2018.Query:

Task: What is the average forecasted annual sales for products 4160 and 7790 during 2018, using monthly sales data starting from January 2016 for the first 36 months, applying seasonality adjustments from time steps 7 through 30, and employing a weighted regression method to estimate sales?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product ID,Average Forecasted Annual Sales (2018)
4160,N/A
7790,N/A
(Attention: The average forecasted annual sales cannot be computed without the actual sales data.)
```

**Explanation:**

To determine the average forecasted annual sales for products **4160** and **7790** during **2018**, we would need access to the monthly sales data from January 2016 to December 2018. This data is essential to perform a weighted regression analysis and apply seasonality adjustments from time steps 7 through 30 (which correspond to months July 2016 through June 2018). Without the actual sales figures, we cannot calculate the forecasted sales values..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['customers', 'conway_gen_zero', 'web_devices', 'web_demographics', 'channels_dim', 'gender_dim', 'packaging', 'packaging_relations', 'product_groups', 'products', 'monthly_sales', 'breweries', 'purchases', 'product_alcohol', 'customer_favorites', 'customer_reviews', 'locations', 'inventory', 'orders', 'orderlines', 'monthly_budget', 'product_minimums', 'stock', 'ticker', 'web_apps', 'web_pages', 'web_counter_hist', 'server_heartbeat', 'web_page_visits', 'employees', 'emp_hire_periods', 'picking_list', 'picking_line', 'picking_log', 'id_name_type', 'id_name_coll_type', 'id_name_coll_entries', 'favorite_coll_type']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 13:36:02 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the average forecasted annual sales for products 4160 and 7790 during 2018, using monthly sales data starting from January 2016 for the first 36 months, applying seasonality adjustments from time steps 7 through 30, and employing a weighted regression method to estimate sales?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product ID,Average Forecasted Annual Sales (2018)
4160,N/A
7790,N/A
(Attention: The average forecasted annual sales cannot be computed without the actual sales data.)
```

**Explanation:**

To determine the average forecasted annual sales for products **4160** and **7790** during **2018**, we would need access to the monthly sales data from January 2016 to December 2018. This data is essential to perform a weighted regression analysis and apply seasonality adjustments from time steps 7 through 30 (which correspond to months July 2016 through June 2018). Without the actual sales figures, we cannot calculate the forecasted sales values. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
