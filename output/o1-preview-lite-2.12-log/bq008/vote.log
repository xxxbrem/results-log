1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

The task is to identify:

1. The most commonly visited next page after pages starting with `/home` among visitors in January 2017 whose campaign name contains 'Data Share'.
2. The maximum time (in seconds) they spent on the `/home` page before moving on.

We have three candidate SQL queries and their results:

---

**0result.sql**

- **Summary:**
  - Excludes instances where the next page is the same as the current `/home` page (`current_page != next_page`).
  - Reports the next most common page excluding `/home`.
- **Result:**
  - Next Page: `/google+redesign/apparel/men++s/men++s+outerwear`
  - Max Time on `/home`: 1785.274 seconds

**Analysis:**
- By excluding transitions from `/home` to `/home`, it omits the most frequent actual next page, which is `/home` itself.
- The task doesn't specify that we should exclude such repeats, so this query doesn't fully address the task.

---

**1result.sql**

- **Summary:**
  - Includes all next pages, even if the next page is `/home` again.
  - Accurately counts all transitions from `/home` to any other page.
  - Calculates the maximum time spent on the `/home` page before moving on.
- **Result:**
  - Next Page: `/home`
  - Max Time on `/home`: 1785.274 seconds

**Analysis:**
- The most commonly visited next page after `/home` is `/home` itself, which aligns with the data showing users frequently reload or revisit the `/home` page.
- It provides both pieces of required information accurately.
- This query best answers the task, considering all valid transitions.

**2result.sql**

- **Summary:**
  - Similar to `1result.sql`, includes all next pages, counting transitions even when the next page is `/home`.
  - However, reports a lower maximum time spent on `/home`.
- **Result:**
  - Next Page: `/home`
  - Max Time on `/home`: 1547.97 seconds

**Analysis:**
- While it identifies `/home` as the most common next page, the maximum time reported is lower than in `1result.sql`.
- This suggests that the query might not capture the maximum time as effectively, possibly due to differences in filtering or data aggregation.

---

**Conclusion:**

- **`1result.sql`** is the correct query.
- It accurately identifies the most commonly visited next page after `/home` (which is `/home` itself) and computes the maximum time spent on the `/home` page before moving on (1785.274 seconds).
- It fulfills both requirements of the task without excluding valid data.
