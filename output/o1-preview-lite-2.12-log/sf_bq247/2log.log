Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `PUBLICATIONS`

   - **"family_id"**: Used to group publications by family and identify the top six families with the most publications.
   - **"publication_number"**: Used to join with the `ABS_AND_EMB` table to retrieve abstracts.
   - **Conditions:**
     - Exclude records where `"family_id"` is '-1' (`"family_id" <> '-1'`).

2. **Table:** `ABS_AND_EMB`

   - **"publication_number"**: Used to join with the `PUBLICATIONS` table.
   - **"abstract"**: Contains the abstract text; we need non-empty abstracts.
   - **Conditions:**
     - Abstract is not null or empty (`"abstract" IS NOT NULL AND "abstract" <> ''`).

**SQL Queries to Explore Data:**

1. **Retrieve distinct family IDs excluding '-1':**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "family_id"
   FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "family_id" <> '-1'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the number of publications per family:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "family_id", COUNT(*) AS "publication_count"
   FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "family_id" <> '-1'
   GROUP BY "family_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List publication numbers and their corresponding family IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "family_id"
   FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "family_id" <> '-1'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find the top 100 families with the most publications:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "family_id", COUNT(*) AS "publication_count"
   FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "family_id" <> '-1'
   GROUP BY "family_id"
   ORDER BY "publication_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve abstracts from `ABS_AND_EMB` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "publication_number", "abstract"
   FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.ABS_AND_EMB
   WHERE "abstract" IS NOT NULL AND "abstract" <> ''
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join publications with abstracts on `publication_number`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."publication_number", p."family_id", a."abstract"
   FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS p
   JOIN PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.ABS_AND_EMB a
     ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
   WHERE p."family_id" <> '-1'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List abstracts for publications in a specific family (e.g., 'family123'):**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."family_id", a."abstract"
   FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS p
   JOIN PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.ABS_AND_EMB a
     ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
   WHERE p."family_id" = 'family123' AND a."abstract" IS NOT NULL AND a."abstract" <> ''
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Flatten nested JSON in `abstract_localized` from `PUBLICATIONS`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."publication_number", f.value::VARIANT:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
   FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS p,
     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => p."abstract_localized") f
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Get publication numbers and titles from `PUBLICATIONS` where the title contains 'innovation':**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."publication_number", t.value::VARIANT:"text"::STRING AS "title_text"
   FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS p,
     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => p."title_localized") t
   WHERE t.value::VARIANT:"text"::STRING ILIKE '%innovation%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find the top terms from `ABS_AND_EMB` for publications in top families:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."family_id", a."top_terms"
    FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS p
    JOIN PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.ABS_AND_EMB a
      ON p."publication_number" = a."publication_number"
    WHERE p."family_id" IN (
      SELECT "family_id"
      FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS
      WHERE "family_id" <> '-1'
      GROUP BY "family_id"
      ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
      LIMIT 6
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Retrieve inventors for publications in top families:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."family_id", i.value::VARIANT:"name"::STRING AS "inventor_name"
    FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS p,
      LATERAL FLATTEN(input => p."inventor") i
    WHERE p."family_id" IN (
      SELECT "family_id"
      FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS
      WHERE "family_id" <> '-1'
      GROUP BY "family_id"
      ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
      LIMIT 6
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **List CPC classifications for the top families:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."family_id", c.value::VARIANT:"section"::STRING AS "cpc_section"
    FROM PATENTS_GOOGLE.PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS p,
      LATERAL FLATTEN(input => p."cpc") c

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: From the publications dataset, first identify the top six families with the most publications whose family_id is not '-1'. Then, using the abs_and_emb table (joined on publication_number), provide each of those families’ IDs alongside every non-empty abstract associated with their publications.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the top six families with the most publications where `family_id` is not '-1', we first count the number of publications per family in the `PUBLICATIONS` table, exclude those with `family_id = '-1'`, and select the top six families. Then, we join these results with the `ABS_AND_EMB` table on `publication_number` to retrieve the non-empty abstracts associated with their publications.

Here is the list of these families' IDs alongside every non-empty abstract associated with their publications:

```csv
family_id,abstract
family_id1:str,abstract1:str
family_id1:str,abstract2:str
family_id1:str,abstract3:str
family_id2:str,abstract1:str
family_id2:str,abstract2:str
family_id2:str,abstract3:str
family_id3:str,abstract1:str
family_id3:str,abstract2:str
family_id4:str,abstract1:str
family_id4:str,abstract2:str
family_id5:str,abstract1:str
family_id6:str,abstract1:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'PATENTS_GOOGLE': {'PATENTS_GOOGLE': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS', 'ABS_AND_EMB']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-12 21:50:52 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing From the publications dataset, first identify the top six families with the most publications whose family_id is not '-1'. Then, using the abs_and_emb table (joined on publication_number), provide each of those families’ IDs alongside every non-empty abstract associated with their publications., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To identify the top six families with the most publications where `family_id` is not '-1', we first count the number of publications per family in the `PUBLICATIONS` table, exclude those with `family_id = '-1'`, and select the top six families. Then, we join these results with the `ABS_AND_EMB` table on `publication_number` to retrieve the non-empty abstracts associated with their publications.

Here is the list of these families' IDs alongside every non-empty abstract associated with their publications:
