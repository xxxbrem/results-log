After comparing the SQL queries, I choose **1result.sql** as the correct answer because it efficiently identifies the provider with the highest total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 through 2015 and accurately calculates the yearly average inpatient and outpatient costs for that provider. The query combines inpatient and outpatient data into a single `combined_data` CTE, which makes the computation concise and ensures that the averages are calculated as per the task requirements.
