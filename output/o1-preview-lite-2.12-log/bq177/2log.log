2025-02-10 09:11:44 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error you're encountering is due to a mismatch in data types when comparing `provider_id` (which is a STRING) to an integer value `330101`. In SQL, when comparing a STRING to an INT64, you need to ensure both sides of the comparison are of the same data type.

To fix this, you should enclose `330101` in single quotes to treat it as a STRING. This change should be made in all the `WHERE` clauses where `provider_id` is compared.

**Corrected SQL:**

```sql

    UNION ALL

    UNION ALL

  GROUP BY

SELECT
  inpatient.year,
  inpatient.average_inpatient_cost,
  outpatient.average_outpatient_cost
FROM
  inpatient
LEFT JOIN
  outpatient
ON
  inpatient.year = outpatient.year
ORDER BY
  inpatient.year;
```

**Note:**

- Enclosed `330101` within single quotes in all `WHERE` clauses to match the data type of `provider_id`.
- This correction ensures that the comparison is between two strings, resolving the type mismatch error.

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Error Cause:** The error message indicates a type mismatch in the `WHERE` clause when comparing `provider_id` (STRING) to `330101` (INT64).
- **Solution:** Enclose `330101` in single quotes `'330101'` to make it a STRING.
- **Consistent Application:** Ensure this change is applied to all occurrences where `provider_id` is compared to `330101`.

By making this change, your query should execute successfully without any type mismatch errors.

**Note:** In Queries 6, 7, 8, and 9, replace `'TOP_PROVIDER_ID'` with the actual provider ID obtained from Query 5.

These queries progressively explore the data needed to solve the task:

1. Identify the providers involved.
2. Calculate total inpatient payments per provider per year.
3. Sum the payments across years to find the provider with the highest total inpatient cost.
4. Calculate yearly average inpatient and outpatient costs for that provider.
5. Combine and present the data to fulfill the task requirements.Query:

Task: For the provider whose total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 through 2015 is the highest (computed as the sum of average_medicare_payments multiplied by total_discharges), please list that provider’s yearly average inpatient cost and yearly average outpatient cost for each calendar year in this period, where the inpatient cost is calculated as the average of (average_medicare_payments × total_discharges) and the outpatient cost is calculated as the average of (average_total_payments × outpatient_services).

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Average_inpatient_cost,Average_outpatient_cost
2011,cost1:float,cost2:float
2012,cost3:float,cost4:float
2013,cost5:float,cost6:float
2014,cost7:float,cost8:float
2015,cost9:float,cost10:float
(Attention: answer in five rows)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: Each calendar year from 2011 through 2015.
- **Average_inpatient_cost**: The average of (average_medicare_payments × total_discharges) for the provider in that year.
- **Average_outpatient_cost**: The average of (average_total_payments × outpatient_services) for the provider in that year.

This table represents the yearly average inpatient and outpatient costs for the provider with the highest total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 to 2015. The costs are indicated as floats since the exact numerical values require access to the specific dataset..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['icd10_procedures_2019', 'hcpcs', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'home_health_agencies_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014', 'hospital_general_info'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['observation', 'drug_era', 'observation_period', 'drug_strength', 'condition_era', 'domain', 'provider', 'person', 'concept_relationship', 'procedure_occurrence', 'care_site', 'vocabulary', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'relationship', 'payer_plan_period', 'concept', 'location', 'condition_occurrence', 'drug_exposure', 'concept_ancestor', 'cost', 'dose_era', 'concept_class']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: Each calendar year from 2011 through 2015.
- **Average_inpatient_cost**: The average of (average_medicare_payments × total_discharges) for the provider in that year.
- **Average_outpatient_cost**: The average of (average_total_payments × outpatient_services) for the provider in that year.

This table represents the yearly average inpatient and outpatient costs for the provider with the highest total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 to 2015. The costs are indicated as floats since the exact numerical values require access to the specific dataset. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
