### BigQuery SQL Queries:

1. **List distinct providers in inpatient data for 2011:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT provider_id, provider_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2011`
   LIMIT 100
   ```

2. **Calculate total inpatient cost per provider for 2011:**
   ```sql
   SELECT provider_id, provider_name,
     SUM(average_medicare_payments * total_discharges) AS total_inpatient_cost
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2011`
   GROUP BY provider_id, provider_name
   LIMIT 100
   ```

3. **Calculate total inpatient cost per provider across 2011-2015:**
   ```sql
   SELECT provider_id, provider_name,
     SUM(average_medicare_payments * total_discharges) AS total_inpatient_cost
   FROM (
     SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2011`
     UNION ALL
     SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2012`

     UNION ALL
     SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2015`
   )
   GROUP BY provider_id, provider_name
   ORDER BY total_inpatient_cost DESC
   LIMIT 100
   ```

4. **Identify provider with highest total inpatient cost (2011-2015):**
   ```sql
   SELECT provider_id, provider_name,
     SUM(average_medicare_payments * total_discharges) AS total_inpatient_cost
   FROM (
     SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2011`

   )
   GROUP BY provider_id, provider_name
   ORDER BY total_inpatient_cost DESC
   LIMIT 1
   ```

5. **Calculate yearly average inpatient cost for the identified provider:**
   ```sql
   SELECT '2011' AS year, AVG(average_medicare_payments * total_discharges) AS average_inpatient_cost
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2011`
   WHERE provider_id = 'PROVIDER_ID_HERE'

**Note:** In the queries above, replace `'PROVIDER_ID_HERE'` with the actual `provider_id` of the provider identified in query 4 as having the highest total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 through 2015.

### Explanation:

- **Queries 1-4:** Explore inpatient data to identify providers and compute total inpatient costs.
- **Query 5:** Calculate the yearly average inpatient cost for the provider with the highest total inpatient cost.
- **Query 6:** Calculate the yearly average outpatient cost for the same provider.
- **Query 7:** Combine inpatient and outpatient costs to get a comprehensive view per year.
- **Query 8:** Find the top 10 providers by total inpatient cost to understand the ranking.
- **Query 9:** Observe inpatient cost trends per provider over the years.
- **Query 10:** Calculate overall average costs for all providers per year for benchmarking.

These queries progressively build an understanding of which providers have the highest costs, how costs are distributed over years, and how inpatient and outpatient costs compare.Query:

Task: For the provider whose total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 through 2015 is the highest (computed as the sum of average_medicare_payments multiplied by total_discharges), please list that provider’s yearly average inpatient cost and yearly average outpatient cost for each calendar year in this period, where the inpatient cost is calculated as the average of (average_medicare_payments × total_discharges) and the outpatient cost is calculated as the average of (average_total_payments × outpatient_services).

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Average_inpatient_cost,Average_outpatient_cost
2011,cost1:float,cost2:float
2012,cost3:float,cost4:float
2013,cost5:float,cost6:float
2014,cost7:float,cost8:float
2015,cost9:float,cost10:float
(Attention: answer in five rows)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: Each calendar year from 2011 through 2015.
- **Average_inpatient_cost**: The average of (average_medicare_payments × total_discharges) for the provider in that year.
- **Average_outpatient_cost**: The average of (average_total_payments × outpatient_services) for the provider in that year.

This table represents the yearly average inpatient and outpatient costs for the provider with the highest total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 to 2015. The costs are indicated as floats since the exact numerical values require access to the specific dataset..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['icd10_procedures_2019', 'hcpcs', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'home_health_agencies_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014', 'hospital_general_info'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['observation', 'drug_era', 'observation_period', 'drug_strength', 'condition_era', 'domain', 'provider', 'person', 'concept_relationship', 'procedure_occurrence', 'care_site', 'vocabulary', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'relationship', 'payer_plan_period', 'concept', 'location', 'condition_occurrence', 'drug_exposure', 'concept_ancestor', 'cost', 'dose_era', 'concept_class']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 09:10:34 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For the provider whose total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 through 2015 is the highest (computed as the sum of average_medicare_payments multiplied by total_discharges), please list that provider’s yearly average inpatient cost and yearly average outpatient cost for each calendar year in this period, where the inpatient cost is calculated as the average of (average_medicare_payments × total_discharges) and the outpatient cost is calculated as the average of (average_total_payments × outpatient_services)., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Average_inpatient_cost,Average_outpatient_cost
2011,cost1:float,cost2:float
2012,cost3:float,cost4:float
2013,cost5:float,cost6:float
2014,cost7:float,cost8:float
2015,cost9:float,cost10:float
(Attention: answer in five rows)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: Each calendar year from 2011 through 2015.
- **Average_inpatient_cost**: The average of (average_medicare_payments × total_discharges) for the provider in that year.
- **Average_outpatient_cost**: The average of (average_total_payments × outpatient_services) for the provider in that year.

This table represents the yearly average inpatient and outpatient costs for the provider with the highest total inpatient Medicare cost from 2011 to 2015. The costs are indicated as floats since the exact numerical values require access to the specific dataset. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
