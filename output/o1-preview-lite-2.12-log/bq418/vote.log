After carefully comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I conclude that `2result.sql` is the correct answer. Here's the reasoning:

**Reasoning:**

1. **UniProt ID Standardization:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses `REGEXP_EXTRACT` and `UPPER` functions to standardize UniProt IDs by extracting the base ID (before any hyphens) and converting it to uppercase. This is crucial because UniProt IDs may include isoform designations (e.g., "P12345-1"), and without standardization, matching could be inaccurate.
   - **`1result.sql`** does not standardize UniProt IDs, which could lead to mismatches when joining tables, especially if some IDs include isoform suffixes or varying cases.

2. **Accurate Matching:**
   - By standardizing UniProt IDs, `2result.sql` ensures that all targets are correctly matched across different tables, leading to accurate counts of targets and non-targets in pathways.
   - The lack of standardization in `1result.sql` may result in undercounting or overcounting, affecting the chi-squared statistic calculations.

3. **Results Consistency:**
   - The `Non_targets_not_in_Pathway` values in `2result.csv` are lower than in `1result.csv`. This suggests that `2result.sql` may be excluding redundant or incorrectly matched entries due to proper ID handling.
   - The chi-squared statistics in `2result.csv` are also consistent with the corrected counts, providing more reliable results.

Therefore, the SQL query that correctly implements the required conditions and provides accurate results is:

2result.sql
