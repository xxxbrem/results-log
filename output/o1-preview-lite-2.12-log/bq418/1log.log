Task: Determine which three lowest-level Reactome pathways (with TAS evidence) have the highest chi-squared statistics, considering only Homo sapiens targets associated with sorafenib under the conditions that the median assay value is ≤ 100 and both low and high assay values are ≤ 100 or null. For each of these three pathways, how many of these targets and non-targets lie within the pathway and outside it?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Pathway_ID,Pathway_Name,Targets_in_Pathway,Targets_not_in_Pathway,Non_targets_in_Pathway,Non_targets_not_in_Pathway,Chi_squared_statistic
pathway_id1:str,pathway_name1:str,A1:int,B1:int,C1:int,D1:int,chi_sq1:float
pathway_id2:str,pathway_name2:str,A2:int,B2:int,C2:int,D2:int,chi_sq2:float
pathway_id3:str,pathway_name3:str,A3:int,B3:int,C3:int,D3:int,chi_sq3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

This table lists the top three lowest-level Reactome pathways (with TAS evidence) that have the highest chi-squared statistics for Homo sapiens targets associated with sorafenib under specified assay conditions. For each pathway, it shows the number of targets and non-targets inside and outside the pathway, along with the calculated chi-squared statistic..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'isb-cgc-bq': {'reactome_versioned': ['pathway_hierarchy_v77', 'pe_to_pathway_v77', 'physical_entity_v77', 'pathway_v77'], 'targetome_versioned': ['target_synonyms_v1', 'sources_v1', 'interactions_v1', 'experiments_v1', 'drug_synonyms_v1']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 01:40:56 - root - INFO - It appears that the previous query returned no data because of the way the drug name `'sorafenib'` is stored in the database. In the `interactions_v1` table, the `drugName` field might not exactly match `'sorafenib'`, or it might be stored in a different case or have additional characters.

To address this issue, we can use the `drug_synonyms_v1` table to find the `drugID` associated with `'sorafenib'` and then use that `drugID` to retrieve the relevant interactions. This approach ensures that we capture all records related to sorafenib, regardless of how the drug name is stored.

**Explanation:**

- **Step 1:** We use the `drug_synonyms_v1` table to find all `drugID`s where the `synonym` is `'sorafenib'` (case-insensitive comparison).
  
- **Step 2:** With these `drugID`s, we retrieve all targets associated with sorafenib from the `interactions_v1` table. We join with `experiments_v1` to apply the assay value filters as specified:
  - `e.exp_assayValueMedian <= 100`
  - `e.exp_assayValueLow <= 100 OR e.exp_assayValueLow IS NULL`
  - `e.exp_assayValueHigh <= 100 OR e.exp_assayValueHigh IS NULL`
  
- **Step 3:** We collect all physical entities (targets) from the Reactome database (`physical_entity_v77`).

- **Step 4:** We map targets to pathways using the `pe_to_pathway_v77` and `physical_entity_v77` tables, filtering for pathways with evidence code `'TAS'`.

- **Step 5:** We retrieve pathway information for pathways that are at the lowest level in the hierarchy (`lowest_level = TRUE`).

- **Step 6:** We compute the number of targets and non-targets inside and outside each pathway.

- **Step 7:** We calculate the chi-squared statistic for each pathway using the 2x2 contingency table formula.

**Answer Format:**

This query will return the top three lowest-level Reactome pathways (with `'TAS'` evidence) that have the highest chi-squared statistics for Homo sapiens targets associated with sorafenib under the specified assay conditions. The output will be in the following format:

```csv

2025-02-11 01:40:58 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Determine which three lowest-level Reactome pathways (with TAS evidence) have the highest chi-squared statistics, considering only Homo sapiens targets associated with sorafenib under the conditions that the median assay value is ≤ 100 and both low and high assay values are ≤ 100 or null. For each of these three pathways, how many of these targets and non-targets lie within the pathway and outside it?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Pathway_ID,Pathway_Name,Targets_in_Pathway,Targets_not_in_Pathway,Non_targets_in_Pathway,Non_targets_not_in_Pathway,Chi_squared_statistic
pathway_id1:str,pathway_name1:str,A1:int,B1:int,C1:int,D1:int,chi_sq1:float

pathway_id3:str,pathway_name3:str,A3:int,B3:int,C3:int,D3:int,chi_sq3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

This table lists the top three lowest-level Reactome pathways (with TAS evidence) that have the highest chi-squared statistics for Homo sapiens targets associated with sorafenib under specified assay conditions. For each pathway, it shows the number of targets and non-targets inside and outside the pathway, along with the calculated chi-squared statistic. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
