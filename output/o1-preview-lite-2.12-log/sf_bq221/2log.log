2025-02-12 20:57:16 - root - INFO - The error occurs because the `"filing_date"` column is of type **NUMBER**, and the `TO_DATE` function expects a **VARCHAR** input when parsing a date with a specific format. Since your `"filing_date"` contains numeric values like `19971015` (in `YYYYMMDD` format), you need to convert the numeric date to a string before parsing it as a date.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    "application_number",
    TO_VARCHAR(TO_DATE(TO_CHAR("filing_date"), 'YYYYMMDD'), 'YYYY') AS "filing_year"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "filing_date" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`TO_CHAR("filing_date")`**: Converts the numeric `"filing_date"` to a string so that it can be parsed by `TO_DATE`.
- **`TO_DATE(..., 'YYYYMMDD')`**: Parses the string as a date using the `YYYYMMDD` format.
- **`TO_VARCHAR(..., 'YYYY')`**: Extracts the year from the date as a string.

**Alternative using `CAST`:**

You can also use `CAST` to convert `"filing_date"` to a string:

```sql
SELECT
    "application_number",
    TO_VARCHAR(TO_DATE(CAST("filing_date" AS VARCHAR), 'YYYYMMDD'), 'YYYY') AS "filing_year"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "filing_date" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

**Sample Results:**

After running the corrected query, the output will include the application numbers along with their filing years:

2025-02-12 20:57:44 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering:

```
100097 (22007): Can't parse '0' as date with format 'YYYYMMDD'
```

indicates that the `TO_DATE` function is attempting to parse a value of `'0'`, which doesn't correspond to a valid date in the `'YYYYMMDD'` format. This happens because some records in the `"filing_date"` column contain `0` or invalid values that cannot be converted into a date.

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, we need to:

1. **Exclude records where `"filing_date"` is `0` or does not represent a valid date.**

2. **Use `TRY_TO_DATE` function** instead of `TO_DATE` to safely attempt date conversion without throwing an error. `TRY_TO_DATE` returns `NULL` if the conversion fails.

3. **Filter out records where `TRY_TO_DATE` returns `NULL`.**

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    "application_number",
    TO_VARCHAR(TRY_TO_DATE(TO_CHAR("filing_date"), 'YYYYMMDD'), 'YYYY') AS "filing_year"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "filing_date" IS NOT NULL
  AND TRY_TO_DATE(TO_CHAR("filing_date"), 'YYYYMMDD') IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`TO_CHAR("filing_date")`**: Converts the numeric `"filing_date"` to a string.

- **`TRY_TO_DATE(..., 'YYYYMMDD')`**: Attempts to parse the string as a date using the `'YYYYMMDD'` format. If it fails (e.g., for `'0'`), it returns `NULL` instead of throwing an error.

- **`TO_VARCHAR(..., 'YYYY')`**: Extracts the year from the date as a string.

- **`WHERE ... AND TRY_TO_DATE(...) IS NOT NULL`**: Ensures that only records with valid dates are included.

**Alternative Filtering Method:**

You can also filter out invalid dates by checking the `"filing_date"` values directly:

```sql
SELECT
    "application_number",
    TO_VARCHAR(TO_DATE(TO_CHAR("filing_date"), 'YYYYMMDD'), 'YYYY') AS "filing_year"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "filing_date" IS NOT NULL
  AND "filing_date" <> 0
  AND LENGTH(TO_CHAR("filing_date")) = 8
LIMIT 100;
```

- **`"filing_date" <> 0`**: Excludes records where the filing date is `0`.

- **`LENGTH(TO_CHAR("filing_date")) = 8`**: Ensures the date string has exactly 8 characters, matching the `'YYYYMMDD'` format.

**Using TRY_TO_DATE is preferred** because it catches any invalid date formats, not just those with length issues.

**Sample Results:**

Running the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT
    "application_number",
    TO_VARCHAR(TRY_TO_DATE(TO_CHAR("filing_date"), 'YYYYMMDD'), 'YYYY') AS "filing_year"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
WHERE "filing_date" IS NOT NULL
  AND TRY_TO_DATE(TO_CHAR("filing_date"), 'YYYYMMDD') IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

Should yield results like:

```csv

**Note:** Any records where `"filing_date"` is `0` or cannot be parsed into a date will be excluded from the results.

**Next Steps:**

Now that we've resolved the issue with parsing the filing dates, you can proceed with your task of identifying CPC technology areas with the highest exponential moving average of patent filings each year.

**Reminder of Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **PUBLICATIONS** table:
  - `"application_number"`: To filter patents with non-empty application numbers.
  - `"filing_date"`: To extract valid filing years.
  - `"cpc"`: Contains CPC codes in VARIANT format; extract the first CPC code.

- **CPC_DEFINITION** table:
  - `"symbol"`: The CPC code for joining with extracted CPC codes.
  - `"titleFull"`: The full CPC title to report.
  - `"level"`: The CPC level to identify level 5 groups.

**Conditions:**

- **Valid Records:**
  - `"application_number"` is not NULL or empty.
  - `"filing_date"` can be parsed into a valid date.
  - Extract only the first CPC code.
  - Consider CPC codes where `"level"` equals `5`.

Feel free to continue building your queries using `TRY_TO_DATE` where necessary to handle date conversions safely.

2025-02-12 21:01:13 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering:

```
001007 (22023): SQL compilation error:
invalid type [TO_DATE(P."filing_date")] for parameter 'TO_DATE'
```

occurs because the `"filing_date"` column is of type **NUMBER**, and the `TO_DATE` function expects a **STRING** input. Additionally, some values in the `"filing_date"` column may not represent valid dates (e.g., `0` or invalid numbers), leading to conversion errors.

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you need to:

1. **Convert the numeric `"filing_date"` to a string** using `TO_CHAR` or `CAST`.
2. **Use `TRY_TO_DATE`** instead of `TO_DATE` to handle invalid date values gracefully.
3. **Filter out records where the date conversion fails** (`TRY_TO_DATE` returns `NULL` for invalid dates).

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    p."publication_number",
    p."application_number",
    TO_VARCHAR(TRY_TO_DATE(TO_CHAR(p."filing_date"), 'YYYYMMDD'), 'YYYY') AS "filing_year",
    cpc_code."first_cpc_code",
    cpc_def."titleFull"
FROM (
    SELECT
        t."publication_number",
        t."application_number",
        t."filing_date",
        f.VALUE:"code"::STRING AS "first_cpc_code"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."cpc", outer => TRUE) f
    WHERE f.INDEX = 0
) AS cpc_code
JOIN PATENTS.PATENTS.CPC_DEFINITION cpc_def
    ON cpc_code."first_cpc_code" = cpc_def."symbol"
JOIN PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS p
    ON p."publication_number" = cpc_code."publication_number"
WHERE p."application_number" IS NOT NULL
    AND p."application_number" <> ''
    AND p."filing_date" IS NOT NULL
    AND TRY_TO_DATE(TO_CHAR(p."filing_date"), 'YYYYMMDD') IS NOT NULL
    AND cpc_def."level" = 5
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`TO_CHAR(p."filing_date")`**: Converts the numeric `"filing_date"` to a string.
- **`TRY_TO_DATE(..., 'YYYYMMDD')`**: Attempts to parse the string as a date using the `'YYYYMMDD'` format. If parsing fails (e.g., due to invalid date formats or values like `0`), it returns `NULL` instead of throwing an error.
- **`TO_VARCHAR(..., 'YYYY')`**: Extracts the year from the date as a string.
- **Added condition**: `TRY_TO_DATE(TO_CHAR(p."filing_date"), 'YYYYMMDD') IS NOT NULL` in the `WHERE` clause to exclude records where the date conversion fails.
- **Extracted `first_cpc_code`**: Changed the extraction of the first CPC code to use `f.VALUE:"code"::STRING` since the `VALUE` field contains a JSON object where `"code"` holds the complete CPC code.
- **Simplified CPC code extraction**: By using the `"code"` field directly, we avoid potential issues with concatenating individual components.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Why use `f.VALUE:"code"::STRING`?**
  - In your earlier query, you attempted to construct the CPC code by concatenating sections like `"section"`, `"class"`, etc. However, the sample data shows that the CPC code is available directly in the `"code"` field within the VARIANT column `"cpc"`.
  - Using `"code"` simplifies the query and ensures accuracy.

- **Handling Invalid Dates:**
  - Some `"filing_date"` values may be `0` or invalid numbers. Using `TRY_TO_DATE` allows the query to handle these gracefully without errors.
  - Filtering out records where `TRY_TO_DATE(...) IS NULL` ensures only valid dates are processed.

**Sample Result:**

```csv
publication_number,application_number,filing_year,first_cpc_code,titleFull
US-2018247292-A1,US-201713808190-A,2017,G06Q20/208,"Payment architectures, schemes or protocols"

...
```

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the corrected query** to ensure it executes without errors and returns the expected results.
- **Proceed with your analysis**:
  - Use the retrieved data to calculate the exponential moving average with a smoothing factor of 0.2.
  - Identify the CPC technology areas with the highest exponential moving average of patent filings.
  - Report the full CPC title along with the best year associated with the highest exponential moving average for each CPC group at level 5.

**Reminder:**

- Ensure that you handle any other potential data issues similarly (e.g., empty or `NULL` values in other fields).
- Always test your queries with a small subset of data (`LIMIT 100`) before running them on the full dataset.

### Document: Sliding Window Calculation for Weighted Moving Average

#### 1. **Overview**
In the SQL query, the **Weighted Moving Average (WMA)** method is applied to smooth the annual patent filing counts for each CPC technology area and identify the "best year" for each CPC group. This sliding window calculation is used to highlight years with significant patent filing activity by giving more weight to recent years while considering past data.

The goal of this method is to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations and better capture long-term trends in patent filing activities, particularly in fast-evolving technology areas.

#### 2. **Weighted Moving Average (WMA) Calculation**

##### 2.1 **Definition**
Weighted Moving Average (WMA) is a method where each data point is given a different weight, with more recent data points typically receiving higher weights. This approach is useful for identifying trends over time while minimizing the effect of older data that might not be as relevant.

##### 2.2 **Formula**
The formula for calculating the Weighted Moving Average is as follows:

\[
WMA_t = \alpha \cdot x_t + (1 - \alpha) \cdot WMA_{t-1}
\]

Where:
- \(WMA_t\): The weighted moving average for the current year (t).
- \(x_t\): The patent filing count for the current year.
- \(WMA_{t-1}\): The weighted moving average for the previous year.
- \(\alpha\): The smoothing factor (in this case, 0.1).

##### 2.3 **Explanation**
- **Smoothing Factor (\(\alpha\))**: The smoothing factor determines how much weight is given to the most recent data point. In this case, the smoothing factor is 0.1, meaning 10% of the weight is assigned to the current year's filing count, and the remaining 90% is based on the previous year’s moving average.
- **Sliding Window**: As we move through the years, the weighted average continuously updates using the most recent filing count and the previous year's weighted average. This creates a "sliding window" where each year's filing count is incorporated into the calculation.

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS', 'CPC_DEFINITION']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
Relevant tables and columns:

- **PUBLICATIONS** table:
  - `"application_number"`: To filter patents with non-empty application numbers.
  - `"filing_date"`: To filter patents with valid filing dates and extract the filing year.
  - `"cpc"`: Contains CPC codes in VARIANT format; need to extract the first CPC code.

- **CPC_DEFINITION** table:
  - `"symbol"`: The CPC code for joining with extracted CPC codes.
  - `"titleFull"`: The full CPC title to report.
  - `"level"`: The CPC level to identify level 5 groups.

Conditions that may be used:

- `"application_number"` is not NULL or empty.
- `"filing_date"` is valid (not NULL) and can be used to extract the year.
- Extract the first CPC code from the `"cpc"` VARIANT column.
- Filter CPC codes where `"level"` equals 5 in the **CPC_DEFINITION** table.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Select non-empty application numbers and filing dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     "application_number",
     "filing_date"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "application_number" IS NOT NULL
     AND "application_number" <> ''
     AND "filing_date" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Extract the filing year from valid filing dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     "application_number",
     TO_VARCHAR(TO_DATE("filing_date"), 'YYYY') AS "filing_year"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
   WHERE "filing_date" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **View the structure of the "cpc" VARIANT column:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     t."publication_number",
     f.VALUE
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."cpc") f
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Extract the first CPC code from the "cpc" column:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     t."publication_number",
     f.VALUE:"section"::STRING || f.VALUE:"class"::STRING || f.VALUE:"subclass"::STRING || f.VALUE:"mainGroup"::STRING || '/' || f.VALUE:"subGroup"::STRING AS "first_cpc_code"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."cpc", outer => TRUE) f
   WHERE f.INDEX = 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Select CPC codes with their levels from CPC_DEFINITION:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     "symbol",
     "level",
     "titleFull"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.CPC_DEFINITION
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Filter CPC codes at level 5:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     "symbol",
     "titleFull"
   FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.CPC_DEFINITION
   WHERE "level" = 5
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Join patents with their first CPC code and CPC definitions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     p."publication_number",
     p."application_number",

     AND p."filing_date" IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY cpc_code."first_cpc_code", TO_VARCHAR(TO_DATE(p."filing_date"), 'YYYY')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve the full CPC titles along with their codes and levels:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      "symbol" AS "cpc_code",
      "level",
      "titleFull" AS "cpc_title"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.CPC_DEFINITION
    WHERE "level" = 5
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Join patent counts with CPC titles at level 5:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      counts."first_cpc_code" AS "cpc_code",
      counts."filing_year",
      counts."patent_count",
      cpc_def."titleFull" AS "cpc_title"
    FROM (

      ) AS cpc_code
      JOIN PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS p
        ON p."publication_number" = cpc_code."publication_number"
      WHERE p."application_number" IS NOT NULL
        AND p."application_number" <> ''
        AND p."filing_date" IS NOT NULL
      GROUP BY cpc_code."first_cpc_code", TO_VARCHAR(TO_DATE(p."filing_date"), 'YYYY')
    ) AS counts
    JOIN PATENTS.PATENTS.CPC_DEFINITION cpc_def
      ON counts."first_cpc_code" = cpc_def."symbol"
    WHERE cpc_def."level" = 5
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Verify the distribution of CPC levels in CPC_DEFINITION:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      "level",
      COUNT(*) AS "level_count"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.CPC_DEFINITION
    GROUP BY "level"
    ORDER BY "level"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List patents with their first CPC code and application numbers:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      p."publication_number",
      p."application_number",
      cpc_code."first_cpc_code"
    FROM (
      SELECT
        t."publication_number",
        f.VALUE:"section"::STRING || f.VALUE:"class"::STRING || f.VALUE:"subclass"::STRING || f.VALUE:"mainGroup"::STRING || '/' || f.VALUE:"subGroup"::STRING AS "first_cpc_code"
      FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
      LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."cpc", outer => TRUE) f
      WHERE f.INDEX = 0
    ) AS cpc_code
    JOIN PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS p
      ON p."publication_number" = cpc_code."publication_number"
    WHERE p."application_number" IS NOT NULL
      AND p."application_number" <> ''
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Explore the content of the "title_localized" column:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      t."publication_number",
      f.VALUE::STRING AS "title"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."title_localized", outer => TRUE) f
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Check for patents without a "cpc" code:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      "publication_number",
      "application_number"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS
    WHERE "cpc" IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Identify the CPC technology areas with the highest exponential moving average of patent filings each year (with a smoothing factor of 0.2), considering only the first CPC code for each patent that has a valid filing date and a non-empty application number, and report the full CPC title along with the best year associated with the highest exponential moving average for each CPC group at level 5.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
CPC_Title,Best_Year
cpc_title:str,best_year:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

- **CPC_Title**: The full title of the CPC technology area at level 5 with the highest exponential moving average of patent filings.
- **Best_Year**: The year in which this CPC group had its highest exponential moving average, calculated using a smoothing factor of 0.2..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS', 'CPC_DEFINITION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-12 21:12:50 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is likely because the CPC codes in the `PUBLICATIONS` table include detailed codes (e.g., "A61P35/00"), while the `CPC_DEFINITION` table at level 5 contains higher-level codes (e.g., "A61P"). As a result, the join between `first_cpc_code` and `cpc_code` doesn't find any matches, leading to no data returned.

To fix this issue, we need to truncate the detailed CPC codes to match the level 5 codes. CPC codes are hierarchical, and the level 5 codes generally correspond to the subclass level (four characters, e.g., "A61P").

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
WITH cpc_level5 AS

    SELECT "symbol" AS "cpc_code", "titleFull" AS "cpc_title"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.CPC_DEFINITION

INNER JOIN cpc_level5 cpc5
    ON best_year_per_cpc_unique."cpc_code" = cpc5."cpc_code";
```

**Explanation:**

- **Truncating the CPC Codes:**
  - In the `initial_data` CTE, we extract the first four characters of the detailed CPC codes using `SUBSTR(f.VALUE:"code"::STRING, 1, 4)` to get the subclass-level code that matches the level 5 codes in `CPC_DEFINITION`.
  - This ensures that the CPC codes from `PUBLICATIONS` align with those in the `CPC_DEFINITION` table at level 5.

- **Using `outer => TRUE`:**
  - Including `outer => TRUE` in the `LATERAL FLATTEN` ensures that we include records even if the `cpc` field is null.
  - However, since we only want patents with valid CPC codes, we also check `SUBSTR(f.VALUE:"code"::STRING, 1, 4) IS NOT NULL`.

- **Calculating the Exponential Moving Average (EMA):**
  - The recursive CTE `ema_recursive` computes the EMA for each CPC code over the filing years, using the smoothing factor of 0.2.
  - We start with the first year's patent count as the initial EMA and recursively calculate the EMA for subsequent years.

- **Identifying the Best Year:**
  - We find the year with the highest EMA (`max_ema`) for each CPC code.
  - In case of ties, we select the earliest year (`ROW_NUMBER()` with `ORDER BY e."filing_year"`).

**Note:** This corrected query should return the CPC technology areas with their corresponding best years based on the highest exponential moving average of patent filings, aligning the CPC codes correctly for a successful join.

2025-02-12 21:12:52 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Identify the CPC technology areas with the highest exponential moving average of patent filings each year (with a smoothing factor of 0.2), considering only the first CPC code for each patent that has a valid filing date and a non-empty application number, and report the full CPC title along with the best year associated with the highest exponential moving average for each CPC group at level 5., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
CPC_Title,Best_Year
cpc_title:str,best_year:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

- **CPC_Title**: The full title of the CPC technology area at level 5 with the highest exponential moving average of patent filings.
- **Best_Year**: The year in which this CPC group had its highest exponential moving average, calculated using a smoothing factor of 0.2. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
