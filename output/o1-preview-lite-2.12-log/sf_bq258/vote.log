After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **1result.sql** is the correct SQL that fulfills the task requirements.

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Correct Filtering:** The SQL in **1result.sql** correctly filters orders that have a status of `'Complete'` by joining the `ORDERS` table and applying the condition `o."status" = 'Complete'`. It also ensures that the orders were delivered before 2022 by using `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(o."delivered_at" / 1e6) < '2022-01-01'`.

- **Accurate Grouping:** It groups the data by year, month, and product category, which aligns with the requirement to generate a monthly report for each product category.

- **Required Calculations:**
  - **Total Revenue:** Calculates the total revenue per category per month using `SUM(oi."sale_price")`.
  - **Total Completed Orders:** Counts the total number of completed orders per category per month using `COUNT(DISTINCT o."order_id")`.
  - **Month-over-Month Growth:** Computes the month-over-month percentage growth for both revenue and orders using the `LAG` function and window functions partitioned by category and ordered by year and month.
  - **Total Cost and Profit:** Calculates the total cost using `SUM(p."cost")`, total profit using `SUM(oi."sale_price" - p."cost")`, and the profit-to-cost ratio.
  - **Formatting:** Applies `ROUND` functions to present the data with appropriate precision, improving readability.

- **Compliance with the Task:**
  - The SQL includes all the necessary columns specified in the task.
  - It correctly computes the required aggregations and calculations.
  - It orders the final results by year, month, and category.

**Comparison with Other SQLs:**

- **0result.sql:**
  - While this SQL also performs similar calculations and filtering, it does not apply rounding functions, which may result in less readable outputs with excessive decimal places.
  - The use of common table expressions (CTEs) adds complexity, and the final SELECT statement is more complex, which may affect performance with large datasets.
  - The calculation of profit-to-cost ratio and month-over-month growth is correct, but the presentation is less polished compared to **1result.sql**.

- **2result.sql:**
  - This SQL filters based on `oi."status" = 'Complete'` (order items), but the task specifies filtering orders with a status of `'Complete'` from the `ORDERS` table.
  - It does not join the `ORDERS` table, possibly missing important order-level data such as order-level status and delivered date.
  - Therefore, it does not fully meet the task requirements, as it might include order items from orders that are not marked as `'Complete'` at the order level.

**Conclusion:**

The SQL in **1result.sql** best satisfies the task's specifications by accurately filtering, grouping, and calculating all required metrics, and by presenting the data clearly and precisely.

**Note:** When implementing this SQL query, ensure that the `delivered_at` field is correctly converted from its stored format (assuming it's a microsecond timestamp) using `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(o."delivered_at" / 1e6)`. Adjust the division factor if the timestamp is stored differently.
