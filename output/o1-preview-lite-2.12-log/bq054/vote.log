After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** best fulfills the task requirements. Here's the reasoning:

### Comparison of SQL Queries:

1. **`0result.sql` and `0result.csv`:**
   - **Issue with Species Names:** This query does not account for variations in species naming across different years. For example, in the 1995 census, the London planetree is recorded as `PLATANUS ACERIFOLIA`, whereas in 2015, it's recorded as `PLATANUS X ACERIFOLIA`. Similarly, honeylocust is recorded as `GLEDITSIA TRIACANTHOS` in 1995 and `GLEDITSIA TRIACANTHOS VAR. INERMIS` in 2015.
   - **Resulting Data Discrepancy:** Due to the lack of standardization, species like London planetree and honeylocust appear to have zero trees in 1995, leading to an inflated growth in total tree counts that doesn't reflect reality.

2. **`1result.sql` and `1result.csv`:**
   - **Attempt at Standardization:** This query attempts to standardize species names by extracting the first two words of the Latin names. However, this method is insufficient for accurately matching species across years because it doesn't account for key variations or synonyms in the names.
   - **Persistent Inconsistencies:** As a result, discrepancies remain in the matching of species names, leading to inaccuracies in the counts and growth calculations.

3. **`2result.sql` and `2result.csv`:**
   - **Effective Species Name Standardization:** This query explicitly standardizes species names using `CASE` statements to map different Latin names to a common standardized name. For example:
     - Maps `PLATANUS ACERIFOLIA` (1995) to `PLATANUS X ACERIFOLIA` (2015).
     - Maps `GLEDITSIA TRIACANTHOS` (1995) to `GLEDITSIA TRIACANTHOS VAR. INERMIS` (2015).
     - Merges all species starting with `PRUNUS` into `PRUNUS`.
   - **Accurate Growth Calculation:** By standardizing the species names, the query accurately calculates the growth in total tree counts between 1995 and 2015. The growth figures reflect true changes rather than artifacts of inconsistent naming.
   - **Inclusion of Common Names and Counts:** The query includes the uppercase Latin names where they are not empty, the common names, total number of trees, counts of alive and dead trees for each year, and computes the growth, all as per the task requirements.

### Conclusion:

`2result.sql` effectively addresses the task by ensuring that species are correctly matched across different years, leading to accurate calculations of tree counts and growth. It provides a reliable analysis of the top 10 tree species based on the difference in total tree counts between 1995 and 2015.
