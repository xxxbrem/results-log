2025-02-11 09:49:48 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering occurs because you're trying to compare a **STRING** field (`wdsp`) with a **FLOAT64** value (`999.9`). In BigQuery, you cannot directly compare a string to a numeric value without converting one of them to the appropriate data type.

**Explanation of the Error:**

- **Error Message:**
  ```
  No matching signature for operator != for argument types: STRING, FLOAT64
  ```
- **Cause:**
  - The `wdsp` column in the `gsod2011` table is of type **STRING**.
  - You're attempting to compare it with the numeric value `999.9`.
  - BigQuery requires both operands of the `<>` (not equal) operator to be of the same type.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to **cast** the `wdsp` field from STRING to FLOAT64 before performing the comparison. Here's how you can modify your query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2011`
WHERE `stn` = '744860'
  AND CAST(`wdsp` AS FLOAT64) <> 999.9
LIMIT 100;
```

**Alternative with SAFE_CAST:**

If there's any possibility that the `wdsp` field contains non-numeric strings that could cause a casting error, you can use `SAFE_CAST` instead. This function returns `NULL` if the cast fails, preventing errors during query execution.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2011`
WHERE `stn` = '744860'
  AND SAFE_CAST(`wdsp` AS FLOAT64) <> 999.9
LIMIT 100;
```

**Further Steps:**

- Ensure that after casting, you handle any `NULL` values appropriately.
- Remember that `999.9` is used as a placeholder for missing data in the GSOD dataset.
- To exclude missing or invalid wind speed records, you might also want to check for non-null and valid values.

**Complete Corrected Query:**

Here's the full corrected query, including date conversion for further analysis if needed:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2011`
WHERE `stn` = '744860'
  AND CAST(`wdsp` AS FLOAT64) <> 999.9
LIMIT 100;
```

**Additional Information:**

- **Casting Syntax:** In BigQuery, you can cast a field to a different data type using `CAST(field AS data_type)`.
- **Common Data Types:**
  - `STRING`
  - `INT64`
  - `FLOAT64`
  - `DATE`
  - `TIMESTAMP`

**Why This Fix Works:**

By casting `wdsp` to `FLOAT64`, both sides of the comparison are numeric, and the comparison operation can proceed without type mismatch errors.

---

Feel free to run the corrected query, and it should execute without the previous error. If you encounter any more issues or need further assistance with your analysis, please let me know!

2025-02-11 09:51:40 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is because the column `stn` does not exist in the `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` table.

**Error Message:**

```
Unrecognized name: stn at [1:17]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Cause of the Error:** The `stn` column is not a valid column in the `stations` table. This is why BigQuery is throwing the "Unrecognized name" error.
- **Available Columns in `stations` Table:**
  - `usaf`
  - `wban`
  - `name`
  - `country`
  - `state`
  - `call`
  - `lat`
  - `lon`
  - `elev`
  - `begin`
  - `end`

**Solution:**

Since `stn` does not exist in the `stations` table, but you need to find the station identifier that matches `'744860'` (JFK Airport), you can reconstruct the `stn` by combining the `usaf` and `wban` codes.

- The `stn` identifier in the NOAA GSOD data is typically a concatenation of `usaf` and `wban`, separated by a hyphen.
- To create the `stn` column, use the `CONCAT` function.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  CONCAT(`usaf`, '-', `wban`) AS `stn`,
  `name`,
  `usaf`,
  `wban`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
WHERE LOWER(`name`) LIKE '%jfk%'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **CONCAT Function:** We use `CONCAT` to combine `usaf` and `wban` into a single `stn` identifier, matching the format used in the GSOD data tables.
  - Example: If `usaf` is `'744860'` and `wban` is `'94789'`, `stn` becomes `'744860-94789'`.
- **Selecting Existing Columns:** We include `usaf`, `wban`, and `name` in the `SELECT` clause, all of which are valid columns in the `stations` table.
- **No Reference to Non-Existent Columns:** By removing the non-existent `stn` column from the `SELECT` clause and constructing it from existing columns, we avoid the error.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Matching Station IDs:** If you need to match stations in the `gsodYYYY` tables, the `stn` column there is often just the `usaf` code without the `wban`. In some cases, you might need to adjust depending on how `stn` is structured.
- **Verifying Station Information:** This query helps you verify the correct `usaf` and `wban` codes for JFK Airport.

**Sample Output (Hypothetical):**

| stn          | name                      | usaf    | wban  |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------|-------|
| 744860-94789 | NEW YORK JFK INTL AIRPORT | 744860  | 94789 |

**Use in Further Queries:**

Now that you have the correct `usaf` and `wban` codes for JFK Airport, you can use `stn = '744860'` in your other queries against the `gsodYYYY` tables.

**Revised Query in Context:**

If you're querying weather data, ensure you're using the correct `stn` value:

```sql
SELECT
  DATE(CONCAT(`year`, '-', `mo`, '-', `da`)) AS weather_date,
  CAST(`wdsp` AS FLOAT64) AS wind_speed
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2015`
WHERE `stn` = '744860'
ORDER BY weather_date
LIMIT 100;
```

**Reminder:**

- Always verify the structure of your tables and the availability of columns.
- Use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` if you need to inspect the table schema.

**INFORMATION_SCHEMA Query (Optional):**

To check the columns available in the `stations` table:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE table_name = 'stations';
```

        AND `complaint_type` = 'Noise - Residential'
      GROUP BY complaint_date
    ) AS daily_complaints
    ON daily_totals.complaint_date = daily_complaints.complaint_date
    ORDER BY daily_totals.complaint_date
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries are designed to explore and retrieve the necessary data to analyze the Pearson correlations between daily complaint proportions and daily average wind speed at station 744860 (JFK Airport) from 2011 to 2020.

- **Queries 1-3**: Identify complaint types and their total counts to filter those with more than 3000 requests.
- **Queries 4-5**: Obtain daily total complaints and daily complaints per type to calculate daily proportions.
- **Queries 6-9**: Retrieve wind speed data from NOAA GSOD tables for the specified station and years.
- **Query 10**: Demonstrate how to calculate daily complaint proportions for a specific complaint type.

**Note:** In practice, you would need to repeat the wind speed data retrieval (Query 6) for each year from 2011 to 2020 by including all relevant `gsodYYYY` tables using `UNION ALL`. Due to the limitations in this example, only two years are shown.

Task: Which complaint types with more than 3000 total requests from 2011 to 2020 show the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations with the daily average wind speed measured at station 744860 (JFK Airport), based on daily complaint proportions (the ratio of type-specific complaints to total daily complaints)? Please provide the complaint types and their correlation coefficients, rounded to four decimal places.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the exact complaint types and their correlation coefficients without access to the necessary data. However, I can outline the steps you can take to find the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations between daily complaint proportions and daily average wind speed at station 744860 (JFK Airport) from 2011 to 2020.

**Steps to Perform the Analysis:**

1. **Filter the 311 Service Requests:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests` table.
   - Select complaints from **2011 to 2020**.
   - Group the data by `complaint_type` and count the total requests for each type.
   - Filter out complaint types with fewer than **3000** total requests.

2. **Calculate Daily Complaint Proportions:**
   - For each day, count the total number of complaints.
   - For each complaint type, count the number of complaints per day.
   - Calculate the **daily proportion** for each complaint type:
     \[
     \text{{Daily Proportion}} = \frac{\text{{Daily Complaints for Type}}}{{\text{{Total Daily Complaints}}}}
     \]

3. **Obtain Daily Average Wind Speed Data:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` tables (from 2011 to 2020).
   - Filter records where `stn` = **'744860'** (JFK Airport).
   - Select the `date` and `wdsp` (mean wind speed) columns.

4. **Merge Datasets:**
   - Join the daily complaint proportions with the wind speed data on the date.

5. **Compute Pearson Correlation Coefficients:**
   - For each complaint type, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily complaint proportions and the daily average wind speed.

6. **Identify Strongest Positive and Negative Correlations:**
   - Sort the complaint types based on their correlation coefficients.
   - Identify the types with the highest positive and highest negative coefficients.

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
Complaint Type,Correlation Coefficient
Most Positively Correlated Complaint,float
Most Negatively Correlated Complaint,float
```

**Note:** Replace `Most Positively Correlated Complaint` and `Most Negatively Correlated Complaint` with the actual complaint types from your analysis, and provide the corresponding correlation coefficients rounded to four decimal places..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

     \text{{Daily Proportion}} = \frac{\text{{Daily Complaints for Type}}}{{\text{{Total Daily Complaints}}}}
     \]

3. **Obtain Daily Average Wind Speed Data:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` tables (from 2011 to 2020).
   - Filter records where `stn` = **'744860'** (JFK Airport).
   - Select the `date` and `wdsp` (mean wind speed) columns.

4. **Merge Datasets:**
   - Join the daily complaint proportions with the wind speed data on the date.

5. **Compute Pearson Correlation Coefficients:**
   - For each complaint type, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily complaint proportions and the daily average wind speed.

6. **Identify Strongest Positive and Negative Correlations:**
   - Sort the complaint types based on their correlation coefficients.
   - Identify the types with the highest positive and highest negative coefficients.

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
Complaint Type,Correlation Coefficient
Most Positively Correlated Complaint,float
Most Negatively Correlated Complaint,float
```

**Note:** Replace `Most Positively Correlated Complaint` and `Most Negatively Correlated Complaint` with the actual complaint types from your analysis, and provide the corresponding correlation coefficients rounded to four decimal places. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
