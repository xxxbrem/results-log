Task: Which complaint types with more than 3000 total requests from 2011 to 2020 show the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations with the daily average wind speed measured at station 744860 (JFK Airport), based on daily complaint proportions (the ratio of type-specific complaints to total daily complaints)? Please provide the complaint types and their correlation coefficients, rounded to four decimal places.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the exact complaint types and their correlation coefficients without access to the necessary data. However, I can outline the steps you can take to find the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations between daily complaint proportions and daily average wind speed at station 744860 (JFK Airport) from 2011 to 2020.

**Steps to Perform the Analysis:**

1. **Filter the 311 Service Requests:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests` table.
   - Select complaints from **2011 to 2020**.
   - Group the data by `complaint_type` and count the total requests for each type.
   - Filter out complaint types with fewer than **3000** total requests.

2. **Calculate Daily Complaint Proportions:**
   - For each day, count the total number of complaints.
   - For each complaint type, count the number of complaints per day.
   - Calculate the **daily proportion** for each complaint type:
     \[
     \text{{Daily Proportion}} = \frac{\text{{Daily Complaints for Type}}}{{\text{{Total Daily Complaints}}}}
     \]

3. **Obtain Daily Average Wind Speed Data:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` tables (from 2011 to 2020).
   - Filter records where `stn` = **'744860'** (JFK Airport).
   - Select the `date` and `wdsp` (mean wind speed) columns.

4. **Merge Datasets:**
   - Join the daily complaint proportions with the wind speed data on the date.

5. **Compute Pearson Correlation Coefficients:**
   - For each complaint type, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily complaint proportions and the daily average wind speed.

6. **Identify Strongest Positive and Negative Correlations:**
   - Sort the complaint types based on their correlation coefficients.
   - Identify the types with the highest positive and highest negative coefficients.

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
Complaint Type,Correlation Coefficient
Most Positively Correlated Complaint,float
Most Negatively Correlated Complaint,float
```

**Note:** Replace `Most Positively Correlated Complaint` and `Most Negatively Correlated Complaint` with the actual complaint types from your analysis, and provide the corresponding correlation coefficients rounded to four decimal places..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'new_york': ['tlc_yellow_trips_2016', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2016', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2014', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2010', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2009', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2012', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2015', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2011', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2013', 'tree_census_1995', 'tree_census_1995', 'tree_census_2005', 'tree_census_2015', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2016', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2016', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2015', 'tlc_green_trips_2013', 'tlc_green_trips_2013', 'tlc_green_trips_2014', 'tlc_green_trips_2016', 'tlc_green_trips_2015', 'citibike_stations', 'tree_species', 'citibike_trips', '311_service_requests', 'nypd_mv_collisions'], 'noaa_gsod': ['gsod2000', 'gsod2000', 'gsod2001', 'gsod1933', 'gsod1942', 'gsod1963', 'gsod1954', 'gsod1982', 'gsod1946', 'gsod2012', 'gsod1978', 'gsod2020', 'gsod1948', 'gsod2009', 'gsod2011', 'gsod1976', 'gsod1943', 'gsod1981', 'gsod1970', 'gsod1945', 'gsod1968', 'gsod1973', 'gsod1998', 'gsod1950', 'gsod1977', 'gsod1947', 'gsod1999', 'gsod1971', 'gsod1936', 'gsod2023', 'gsod1957', 'gsod1992', 'gsod1991', 'gsod1951', 'gsod1964', 'gsod1930', 'gsod1958', 'gsod2022', 'gsod1974', 'gsod1959', 'gsod1961', 'gsod2018', 'gsod1980', 'gsod1949', 'gsod2006', 'gsod2005', 'gsod2013', 'gsod1953', 'gsod2021', 'gsod1996', 'gsod1969', 'gsod1937', 'gsod2008', 'gsod2010', 'gsod2007', 'gsod1993', 'gsod1939', 'gsod1985', 'gsod2015', 'gsod1962', 'gsod1986', 'gsod1952', 'gsod1987', 'gsod1944', 'gsod1990', 'gsod1975', 'gsod1941', 'gsod1967', 'gsod1938', 'gsod1934', 'gsod2004', 'gsod1994', 'gsod1983', 'gsod1972', 'gsod1995', 'gsod1929', 'gsod1984', 'gsod1979', 'gsod2016', 'gsod1965', 'gsod1989', 'gsod1956', 'gsod2017', 'gsod1960', 'gsod1997', 'gsod1955', 'gsod1935', 'gsod2002', 'gsod1988', 'gsod1931', 'gsod1940', 'gsod2024', 'gsod1966', 'gsod1932', 'gsod2019', 'gsod2014', 'gsod2003', 'stations']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-11 09:52:36 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which complaint types with more than 3000 total requests from 2011 to 2020 show the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations with the daily average wind speed measured at station 744860 (JFK Airport), based on daily complaint proportions (the ratio of type-specific complaints to total daily complaints)? Please provide the complaint types and their correlation coefficients, rounded to four decimal places., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the exact complaint types and their correlation coefficients without access to the necessary data. However, I can outline the steps you can take to find the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations between daily complaint proportions and daily average wind speed at station 744860 (JFK Airport) from 2011 to 2020.

**Steps to Perform the Analysis:**

1. **Filter the 311 Service Requests:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests` table.
   - Select complaints from **2011 to 2020**.
   - Group the data by `complaint_type` and count the total requests for each type.
   - Filter out complaint types with fewer than **3000** total requests.

2. **Calculate Daily Complaint Proportions:**
   - For each day, count the total number of complaints.
   - For each complaint type, count the number of complaints per day.
   - Calculate the **daily proportion** for each complaint type:
     \[
     \text{{Daily Proportion}} = \frac{\text{{Daily Complaints for Type}}}{{\text{{Total Daily Complaints}}}}
     \]

3. **Obtain Daily Average Wind Speed Data:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` tables (from 2011 to 2020).
   - Filter records where `stn` = **'744860'** (JFK Airport).
   - Select the `date` and `wdsp` (mean wind speed) columns.

4. **Merge Datasets:**
   - Join the daily complaint proportions with the wind speed data on the date.

5. **Compute Pearson Correlation Coefficients:**
   - For each complaint type, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily complaint proportions and the daily average wind speed.

6. **Identify Strongest Positive and Negative Correlations:**
   - Sort the complaint types based on their correlation coefficients.
   - Identify the types with the highest positive and highest negative coefficients.

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
Complaint Type,Correlation Coefficient
Most Positively Correlated Complaint,float
Most Negatively Correlated Complaint,float
```

**Note:** Replace `Most Positively Correlated Complaint` and `Most Negatively Correlated Complaint` with the actual complaint types from your analysis, and provide the corresponding correlation coefficients rounded to four decimal places. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-11 09:53:44 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which complaint types with more than 3000 total requests from 2011 to 2020 show the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations with the daily average wind speed measured at station 744860 (JFK Airport), based on daily complaint proportions (the ratio of type-specific complaints to total daily complaints)? Please provide the complaint types and their correlation coefficients, rounded to four decimal places., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the exact complaint types and their correlation coefficients without access to the necessary data. However, I can outline the steps you can take to find the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations between daily complaint proportions and daily average wind speed at station 744860 (JFK Airport) from 2011 to 2020.

**Steps to Perform the Analysis:**

1. **Filter the 311 Service Requests:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests` table.
   - Select complaints from **2011 to 2020**.
   - Group the data by `complaint_type` and count the total requests for each type.
   - Filter out complaint types with fewer than **3000** total requests.

2. **Calculate Daily Complaint Proportions:**
   - For each day, count the total number of complaints.
   - For each complaint type, count the number of complaints per day.
   - Calculate the **daily proportion** for each complaint type:
     \[
     \text{{Daily Proportion}} = \frac{\text{{Daily Complaints for Type}}}{{\text{{Total Daily Complaints}}}}
     \]

3. **Obtain Daily Average Wind Speed Data:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` tables (from 2011 to 2020).
   - Filter records where `stn` = **'744860'** (JFK Airport).
   - Select the `date` and `wdsp` (mean wind speed) columns.

4. **Merge Datasets:**
   - Join the daily complaint proportions with the wind speed data on the date.

5. **Compute Pearson Correlation Coefficients:**
   - For each complaint type, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily complaint proportions and the daily average wind speed.

6. **Identify Strongest Positive and Negative Correlations:**
   - Sort the complaint types based on their correlation coefficients.
   - Identify the types with the highest positive and highest negative coefficients.

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
Complaint Type,Correlation Coefficient
Most Positively Correlated Complaint,float
Most Negatively Correlated Complaint,float
```

**Note:** Replace `Most Positively Correlated Complaint` and `Most Negatively Correlated Complaint` with the actual complaint types from your analysis, and provide the corresponding correlation coefficients rounded to four decimal places. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-11 09:55:00 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which complaint types with more than 3000 total requests from 2011 to 2020 show the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations with the daily average wind speed measured at station 744860 (JFK Airport), based on daily complaint proportions (the ratio of type-specific complaints to total daily complaints)? Please provide the complaint types and their correlation coefficients, rounded to four decimal places., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the exact complaint types and their correlation coefficients without access to the necessary data. However, I can outline the steps you can take to find the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations between daily complaint proportions and daily average wind speed at station 744860 (JFK Airport) from 2011 to 2020.

**Steps to Perform the Analysis:**

1. **Filter the 311 Service Requests:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests` table.
   - Select complaints from **2011 to 2020**.
   - Group the data by `complaint_type` and count the total requests for each type.
   - Filter out complaint types with fewer than **3000** total requests.

2. **Calculate Daily Complaint Proportions:**
   - For each day, count the total number of complaints.
   - For each complaint type, count the number of complaints per day.
   - Calculate the **daily proportion** for each complaint type:
     \[
     \text{{Daily Proportion}} = \frac{\text{{Daily Complaints for Type}}}{{\text{{Total Daily Complaints}}}}
     \]

3. **Obtain Daily Average Wind Speed Data:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` tables (from 2011 to 2020).
   - Filter records where `stn` = **'744860'** (JFK Airport).
   - Select the `date` and `wdsp` (mean wind speed) columns.

4. **Merge Datasets:**
   - Join the daily complaint proportions with the wind speed data on the date.

5. **Compute Pearson Correlation Coefficients:**
   - For each complaint type, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily complaint proportions and the daily average wind speed.

6. **Identify Strongest Positive and Negative Correlations:**
   - Sort the complaint types based on their correlation coefficients.
   - Identify the types with the highest positive and highest negative coefficients.

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
Complaint Type,Correlation Coefficient
Most Positively Correlated Complaint,float
Most Negatively Correlated Complaint,float
```

**Note:** Replace `Most Positively Correlated Complaint` and `Most Negatively Correlated Complaint` with the actual complaint types from your analysis, and provide the corresponding correlation coefficients rounded to four decimal places. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-11 09:55:45 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which complaint types with more than 3000 total requests from 2011 to 2020 show the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations with the daily average wind speed measured at station 744860 (JFK Airport), based on daily complaint proportions (the ratio of type-specific complaints to total daily complaints)? Please provide the complaint types and their correlation coefficients, rounded to four decimal places., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the exact complaint types and their correlation coefficients without access to the necessary data. However, I can outline the steps you can take to find the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations between daily complaint proportions and daily average wind speed at station 744860 (JFK Airport) from 2011 to 2020.

**Steps to Perform the Analysis:**

1. **Filter the 311 Service Requests:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests` table.
   - Select complaints from **2011 to 2020**.
   - Group the data by `complaint_type` and count the total requests for each type.
   - Filter out complaint types with fewer than **3000** total requests.

2. **Calculate Daily Complaint Proportions:**
   - For each day, count the total number of complaints.
   - For each complaint type, count the number of complaints per day.
   - Calculate the **daily proportion** for each complaint type:
     \[
     \text{{Daily Proportion}} = \frac{\text{{Daily Complaints for Type}}}{{\text{{Total Daily Complaints}}}}
     \]

3. **Obtain Daily Average Wind Speed Data:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` tables (from 2011 to 2020).
   - Filter records where `stn` = **'744860'** (JFK Airport).
   - Select the `date` and `wdsp` (mean wind speed) columns.

4. **Merge Datasets:**
   - Join the daily complaint proportions with the wind speed data on the date.

5. **Compute Pearson Correlation Coefficients:**
   - For each complaint type, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily complaint proportions and the daily average wind speed.

6. **Identify Strongest Positive and Negative Correlations:**
   - Sort the complaint types based on their correlation coefficients.
   - Identify the types with the highest positive and highest negative coefficients.

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
Complaint Type,Correlation Coefficient
Most Positively Correlated Complaint,float
Most Negatively Correlated Complaint,float
```

**Note:** Replace `Most Positively Correlated Complaint` and `Most Negatively Correlated Complaint` with the actual complaint types from your analysis, and provide the corresponding correlation coefficients rounded to four decimal places. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-02-11 09:57:46 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which complaint types with more than 3000 total requests from 2011 to 2020 show the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations with the daily average wind speed measured at station 744860 (JFK Airport), based on daily complaint proportions (the ratio of type-specific complaints to total daily complaints)? Please provide the complaint types and their correlation coefficients, rounded to four decimal places., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the exact complaint types and their correlation coefficients without access to the necessary data. However, I can outline the steps you can take to find the strongest positive and negative Pearson correlations between daily complaint proportions and daily average wind speed at station 744860 (JFK Airport) from 2011 to 2020.

**Steps to Perform the Analysis:**

1. **Filter the 311 Service Requests:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests` table.
   - Select complaints from **2011 to 2020**.
   - Group the data by `complaint_type` and count the total requests for each type.
   - Filter out complaint types with fewer than **3000** total requests.

2. **Calculate Daily Complaint Proportions:**
   - For each day, count the total number of complaints.
   - For each complaint type, count the number of complaints per day.
   - Calculate the **daily proportion** for each complaint type:
     \[
     \text{{Daily Proportion}} = \frac{\text{{Daily Complaints for Type}}}{{\text{{Total Daily Complaints}}}}
     \]

3. **Obtain Daily Average Wind Speed Data:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` tables (from 2011 to 2020).
   - Filter records where `stn` = **'744860'** (JFK Airport).
   - Select the `date` and `wdsp` (mean wind speed) columns.

4. **Merge Datasets:**
   - Join the daily complaint proportions with the wind speed data on the date.

5. **Compute Pearson Correlation Coefficients:**
   - For each complaint type, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily complaint proportions and the daily average wind speed.

6. **Identify Strongest Positive and Negative Correlations:**
   - Sort the complaint types based on their correlation coefficients.
   - Identify the types with the highest positive and highest negative coefficients.

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
Complaint Type,Correlation Coefficient
Most Positively Correlated Complaint,float
Most Negatively Correlated Complaint,float
```

**Note:** Replace `Most Positively Correlated Complaint` and `Most Negatively Correlated Complaint` with the actual complaint types from your analysis, and provide the corresponding correlation coefficients rounded to four decimal places. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests` table.
   - Select complaints from **2011 to 2020**.
   - Group the data by `complaint_type` and count the total requests for each type.
   - Filter out complaint types with fewer than **3000** total requests.

2. **Calculate Daily Complaint Proportions:**

   - Calculate the **daily proportion** for each complaint type:
     \[
     \text{{Daily Proportion}} = \frac{\text{{Daily Complaints for Type}}}{{\text{{Total Daily Complaints}}}}
     \]

3. **Obtain Daily Average Wind Speed Data:**
   - Use the `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` tables (from 2011 to 2020).
   - Filter records where `stn` = **'744860'** (JFK Airport).
   - Select the `date` and `wdsp` (mean wind speed) columns.

4. **Merge Datasets:**
   - Join the daily complaint proportions with the wind speed data on the date.

5. **Compute Pearson Correlation Coefficients:**
   - For each complaint type, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily complaint proportions and the daily average wind speed.

6. **Identify Strongest Positive and Negative Correlations:**
   - Sort the complaint types based on their correlation coefficients.
   - Identify the types with the highest positive and highest negative coefficients.

**Expected Output Format:**
