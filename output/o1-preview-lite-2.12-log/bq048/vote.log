0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

After carefully comparing the three SQL scripts (`0result.sql`, `1result.sql`, and `2result.sql`) and their corresponding results, `0result.sql` is the correct and preferred SQL script for the following reasons:

1. **Efficiency in Querying Weather Data:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses the wildcard table notation (`noaa_gsod.gsod*`) with the `_TABLE_SUFFIX` to query all the necessary NOAA GSOD tables for the years 2011 to 2020 in a single, efficient query. This approach leverages BigQuery's ability to handle wildcard tables, making the query more concise and potentially more performant.
   - In contrast, **`1result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** use multiple `UNION ALL` statements to combine data from each yearly table (`gsod2011` to `gsod2020`). This method is more verbose and can be less efficient, especially when dealing with many tables over a range of years.

2. **Consistency in Results:**
   - All three scripts produce the same correlation coefficients for the complaint types, as evidenced by the identical contents of `0result.csv`, `1result.csv`, and `2result.csv`. This consistency indicates that `0result.sql` correctly calculates the required correlations.
   - Since the outputs are the same, choosing the more efficient and cleaner script makes sense.

3. **Use of SAFE_CAST and Data Filtering:**
   - **`0result.sql`** appropriately filters out invalid wind speed data by excluding records where `CAST(wdsp AS FLOAT64) = 999.9`, which is the placeholder value for missing or invalid data in the NOAA dataset.
   - The script also takes care to ensure that the wind speed data is correctly cast to `FLOAT64` and valid before performing calculations, ensuring data accuracy in the correlation analysis.

4. **Simplicity and Readability:**
   - By utilizing the wildcard notation and avoiding repetitive `UNION ALL` statements, `0result.sql` is shorter, easier to read, and maintainable.
   - This simplicity reduces the likelihood of errors that can occur when manually listing and combining multiple tables.

5. **Alignment with BigQuery Best Practices:**
   - Using wildcard tables is a recommended practice in BigQuery for querying multiple tables with similar schemas, especially when they follow a naming pattern like the NOAA GSOD data.
   - It allows for scalable queries that can easily adapt if more yearly tables are added in the future without modifying the SQL script.

**Conclusion:**

Given the identical results and the reasons above, `0result.sql` is the correct and preferred SQL script. It efficiently and accurately calculates the Pearson correlation coefficients between daily complaint proportions and daily average wind speed at JFK Airport for complaint types with more than 3000 total complaints from 2011 to 2020.
