After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **1result.sql** is the correct answer. This is because it includes additional filters to exclude null or empty specializations (`AND hpt.specialization IS NOT NULL AND hpt.specialization != ''`) at an earlier stage in the query. This ensures that only valid specializations are considered when counting NPIs, leading to more accurate results. Additionally, using `UPPER` in the city name comparison standardizes the data for consistency.
