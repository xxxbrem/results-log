```

**Reason:**

The SQL query in `2result.sql` is the correct answer for the following reasons:

1. **Simplicity and Clarity:**
   - The query uses the `cleaned_weekly_sales` table, which already contains the necessary columns like `"calendar_year"` and `"week_number"`. This eliminates the need for complex string manipulations and date conversions seen in `0result.sql`.
   - By directly referencing `"calendar_year"` and `"week_number"`, the query is more readable and easier to understand.

2. **Accurate Filtering:**
   - The query accurately selects the four weeks before and after June 15 by using `"week_number" BETWEEN 21 AND 24` for the weeks leading up to June 15 and `"week_number" BETWEEN 25 AND 28` for the weeks following June 15. This approach assumes that week numbers align consistently across years, which is reasonable for this dataset.
   - It ensures that data is correctly grouped and aggregated for each year without the risk of misinterpretation caused by date formatting issues.

3. **Performance Efficiency:**
   - By avoiding subqueries and complicated string parsing functions, the query is likely to perform better, especially on larger datasets.
   - The use of straightforward aggregations and joins allows the database engine to optimize the query execution plan effectively.

4. **Consistency in Results:**
   - Both queries produce the same results, indicating that the simpler query achieves the desired outcome without unnecessary complexity.
   - Choosing the cleaner query reduces the potential for errors and simplifies future maintenance or modifications.

**Conclusion:**

The SQL in `2result.sql` is preferred due to its simplicity, clarity, and efficient use of the structured data available in the `cleaned_weekly_sales` table. It effectively calculates the percentage change in sales between the specified periods for each year without unnecessary complexity.
