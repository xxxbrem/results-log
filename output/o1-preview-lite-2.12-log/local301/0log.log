**Relevant Table:** `weekly_sales`

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"week_date"**: Used to identify the dates of each week and to filter data for the specified time periods (four weeks before and after June 15) for each year.
- **"sales"**: Used to calculate the total sales during the specified periods.
- **"region"**: Potentially used if regional analysis is required.
- **"platform"**: Potentially used if analysis by platform is needed.
- **"segment"**: Potentially used if segmentation analysis is desired.
- **"customer_type"**: Potentially used to analyze sales by customer type.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filtering `"week_date"` to select the four weeks before and after June 15 for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.
- Extracting the year from `"week_date"` to separate data by year.
- Using date ranges in the format `'YYYY-MM-DD'` for accurate filtering.

Task: For weekly-sales data, I need an analysis of our sales performance around mid-June for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Specifically, calculate the percentage change in sales between the four weeks leading up to June 15 and the four weeks following June 15 for each year.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Percentage_Change_Sales
2018,pc1:float
2019,pc2:float
2020,pc3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

The table above presents the percentage change in sales between the four weeks before June 15 and the four weeks after June 15 for each of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Specifically, calculate the percentage change in sales between the four weeks leading up to June 15 and the four weeks following June 15 for each year., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

The table above presents the percentage change in sales between the four weeks before June 15 and the four weeks after June 15 for each of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
