After reviewing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`)** results in a percentage of **100%**, which is highly unlikely and suggests a flaw in the query logic. The issue arises because the numerator and denominator in the final calculation are derived from the same joined dataset, leading to the same count and thus, a percentage of 100%. This doesn't reflect the actual proportion of users who experienced a crash before uninstalling.

- **Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`)** calculates a percentage of **1.1527%**. While this seems plausible, the query might not fully account for all users who meet the criteria due to potential limitations in how it handles timestamps and events outside of September 2018 (since it only queries `events_201809*`). It might also miss users with events spanning multiple months.

- **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`)** results in a percentage of **2.8169%**. This query:

  - Correctly identifies users who first opened the app in September 2018.
  - Accurately filters users who uninstalled within seven days by calculating the days between the first open and uninstall events using dates.
  - Ensures that only crashes (`app_exception` events) that occurred **before** the uninstall event are considered.
  - Uses the entire dataset (`events_*`) to account for events that might span across different months.

The logic in **`0result.sql`** aligns precisely with the task requirements, providing a reliable and accurate calculation of the percentage of users who experienced an app crash before uninstalling within seven days of first using the app in September 2018.
