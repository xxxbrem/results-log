The SQL script in `0result.sql` is the correct one because it fulfills the requirement of using June 2019 data as the basis for calculating the growth rates for July 2019. Here's why:

1. **Includes June Data**: The query selects data from **June 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019**, ensuring that June data is included for the growth rate calculations.

2. **Growth Rate Calculation**: By including June data, the script allows for the calculation of growth rates in July using June as the previous month. The `LAG` function is used to access prior month data within each product category.

3. **Sorting and Formatting**: The results are sorted by `"Month"` and `"Product_Category"` in ascending order, and the `"Month"` is formatted as `'YYYY-MM'`, as specified.

4. **Calculates Total Sums and Growth Rates**: The query computes the total sum of `Order_Count`, `Revenue`, and `Profit`, along with their month-over-month growth rates for each product category.

In contrast, the SQL script in `2result.sql` filters out June data by applying a `WHERE` clause that starts from July 1, 2019:

```sql
WHERE "Month" >= '2019-07-01' AND "Month" <= '2019-12-01'
```

This omission of June data means that July cannot use June as the basis for growth rate calculations, which does not meet the specified requirement.

Therefore, `0result.sql` is the correct SQL script that aligns with the task's requirements.
