After reviewing the SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have determined that `0result.sql` is the correct SQL script for the following reasons:

- **Comprehensive Table Joins**: It joins all three relevant tables—`ORDERS`, `ORDER_ITEMS`, and `PRODUCTS`—ensuring that all orders are included regardless of their status, as per the task requirement.

- **Accurate Date Filtering**: The query uses the `"created_at"` field from the `ORDERS` table for date filtering. This ensures that the orders are accurately filtered between June 2019 and December 2019 based on when the orders were created.

- **Correct Calculations**:
  - It calculates the total number of orders, total revenue, and total profit for each product category and month.
  - It computes the month-over-month growth rates using June 2019 as the baseline, correctly handling possible division by zero using `NULLIF`.

- **Proper Sorting and Formatting**: The results are sorted in ascending order by month (formatted as `'YYYY-MM'`) and then by product category, aligning with the task's specifications.

Here is the name of the selected SQL script:
