After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script for the following reasons:

1. **Proper ZIP Code Formatting:**
   - `1result.sql` uses `LPAD(TRIM(...), 5, '0')` to ensure that all ZIP codes are consistently formatted as 5-digit strings. This is crucial because ZIP codes can have leading zeros, and inconsistent formatting might lead to incorrect joins or data mismatches.
   - By standardizing the ZIP code format, the query accurately joins the ZIP code data across different tables, ensuring that each ZIP code correctly maps to its corresponding state and data.

2. **Accurate Data Filtering:**
   - The query explicitly filters out records with `NULL` median incomes and employment figures using `IS NOT NULL`. This ensures that calculations are performed only on valid and complete data, enhancing the integrity of the results.
   - It identifies ZIP codes where the median income decreased between 2015 and 2018, as specified in the task.

3. **Logical Structure with CTEs:**
   - The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) makes the query more organized and readable. Breaking down the query into `income_decreased_zips`, `employment_data`, and `zip_state_mapping` simplifies complex operations and improves maintainability.

4. **Accurate Calculation of Vulnerable Workers:**
   - The query correctly calculates the number of vulnerable workers by applying the specified percentages to the employment figures.
   - It aggregates these calculations at the state level, providing the required totals for vulnerable wholesale trade workers, vulnerable manufacturing workers, and the combined total.

5. **Consistent Results:**
   - The results produced by `1result.sql` align with the expected outcome, accurately listing states in descending order of total vulnerable workers.

**Therefore, `1result.sql` is the SQL script that correctly fulfills the task requirements.**
