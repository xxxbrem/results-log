All three SQL queries aim to compute the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the number of cases per 100,000 people for the specified countries on April 20, 2020, using the 2020 population data.

**Comparison of the SQL queries:**

1. **Candidate `0result.sql`:**

   - **Country Mapping:** Uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `country_mapping` to explicitly map `country_region` from the COVID-19 data to `country_name` in the population data. This is particularly useful for handling discrepancies in country names between datasets.
   - **Population Data:** Selects population data for the year 2020.
   - **Clarity and Scalability:** The use of a CTE for mapping makes the query clear and easily maintainable, allowing additional countries to be added to the mapping as needed.

2. **Candidate `1result.sql`:**

   - **Country Mapping:** Utilizes a `CASE` statement within the `ON` clause of the `JOIN` to map countries. This method can become cumbersome as more countries with name discrepancies are added.
   - **Population Data:** Selects population data for the year 2020.
   - **Aggregation:** Uses `MAX(p.value)` to get the population, which is acceptable but might be unnecessary since the population value is the same for the specified country and year.

3. **Candidate `2result.sql`:**

   - **Country Mapping:** Employs an `OR` condition in the `JOIN` clause to handle country name discrepancies.
   - **Population Data:** Selects population data for the year 2020.
   - **Query Complexity:** While it achieves the desired result, using multiple `OR` conditions can make the query less readable and harder to maintain.

**Reason for selecting `0result.sql`:**

- **Readability:** The use of a CTE for country mapping in `0result.sql` provides a clean and organized structure, making the query more readable.
- **Maintainability:** With the mapping table, it's easy to add or modify country mappings without altering the main query logic.
- **Scalability:** The approach is scalable for handling more countries or additional mappings in the future.
- **Data Integrity:** Explicitly mapping country names helps prevent potential mismatches and ensures accurate data joining.
- **Clarity in Logic:** Separating the mapping logic from the main query enhances clarity and reduces the risk of errors.

**Conclusion:**

After comparing the SQL queries, **`0result.sql`** is the correct and most suitable answer because it provides a clear, maintainable, and scalable solution that accurately addresses the task requirements.
