**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `date`: Used to filter data within the specified date ranges (January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019, and January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020).
- `sub_region_2`: Used to filter data for the five specific New York City counties (Bronx County, Queens County, Kings County, New York County, Richmond County).
- `symptom_anosmia`: Represents the search frequency for the symptom 'Anosmia'; used to calculate average weekly search frequencies.
- `sub_region_1`: May be used to confirm that the data is within New York State.
- `country_region_code`, `country_region`: May be used to confirm that the data is within the United States.

**Potential Conditions:**

- `sub_region_2` IN ('Bronx County', 'Queens County', 'Kings County', 'New York County', 'Richmond County')
- `date` BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' or BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
- `sub_region_1` = 'New York'
- `country_region_code` = 'US'

12. **Calculate standard deviation of 'Anosmia' search frequency in 2020**

```sql
SELECT STDDEV(CAST(`symptom_anosmia` AS FLOAT64)) AS stddev_anosmia_2020
FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_symptom_search.symptom_search_sub_region_2_weekly`

  AND `date` BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
LIMIT 100
```

13. **Check for null values in 'Anosmia' data for 2019**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_values_2019
FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_symptom_search.symptom_search_sub_region_2_weekly`
WHERE `symptom_anosmia` IS NULL
  AND LOWER(`sub_region_2`) IN (LOWER('Bronx County'), LOWER('Queens County'), LOWER('Kings County'), LOWER('New York County'), LOWER('Richmond County'))
  AND `date` BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31'
LIMIT 100
```

14. **Retrieve 'Anosmia' data along with `place_id` for validation**

```sql
SELECT `place_id`, `sub_region_2`, `date`, `symptom_anosmia`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_symptom_search.symptom_search_sub_region_2_weekly`
WHERE LOWER(`sub_region_2`) IN (LOWER('Bronx County'), LOWER('Queens County'), LOWER('Kings County'), LOWER('New York County'), LOWER('Richmond County'))
LIMIT 100
```

15. **Approximate median 'Anosmia' search frequency for combined years**

```sql
SELECT APPROX_QUANTILES(CAST(`symptom_anosmia` AS FLOAT64), 2)[OFFSET(1)] AS median_anosmia
FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_symptom_search.symptom_search_sub_region_2_weekly`

Task: Please calculate the overall percentage change in the average weekly search frequency for the symptom 'Anosmia' across the five New York City counties—Bronx County, Queens County, Kings County, New York County, and Richmond County—by comparing the combined data from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019, with the combined data from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Percentage_change
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

To calculate the overall percentage change in the average weekly search frequency for the symptom **Anosmia** across the five New York City counties—**Bronx County**, **Queens County**, **Kings County**, **New York County**, and **Richmond County**—between **2019** and **2020**, follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve Data:**
   - Extract the weekly search frequency values for `symptom_anosmia` from the `symptom_search_sub_region_2_weekly` table.
   - Filter the data for the specified counties by matching the `sub_region_2` field with the county names.
   - Select data within the two date ranges:
     - **2019 Data:** January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019.
     - **2020 Data:** January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020.

2. **Calculate Average Weekly Frequencies:**
   - For each year, calculate the average weekly search frequency for Anosmia across the five counties.
   - This involves summing the weekly frequencies for all counties and weeks in the year and then dividing by the total number of weeks.

3. **Compute Percentage Change:**
   - Use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage\_change} = \left( \frac{\text{Average\_2020} - \text{Average\_2019}}{\text{Average\_2019}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - This calculates the overall percentage increase or decrease from 2019 to 2020.

**Note:** The `value:float` in the CSV should be replaced with the calculated percentage change, rounded to an appropriate number of decimal places. The percentage represents how much the average weekly search frequency for Anosmia changed between the two years across the selected counties..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'covid19_symptom_search': ['symptom_search_sub_region_1_daily', 'symptom_search_sub_region_1_daily', 'symptom_search_sub_region_2_daily', 'symptom_search_country_daily', 'symptom_search_country_weekly', 'symptom_search_sub_region_1_weekly', 'symptom_search_sub_region_1_weekly', 'symptom_search_sub_region_2_weekly']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
