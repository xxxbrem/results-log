After comparing both SQL queries, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice. Here's the reasoning:

- **Excludes NULL Values**: `1result.sql` includes the condition `AND symptom_anosmia IS NOT NULL` in both subqueries for 2019 and 2020. This ensures that only records with valid `symptom_anosmia` values are included in the average calculation, leading to a more accurate result.

- **Consistent Case Matching**: It directly matches `sub_region_2` with the county names without applying the `LOWER()` function, assuming that the data in `sub_region_2` is properly cased. This avoids any potential issues with case sensitivity if the data is consistently formatted.

- **Accurate Calculation**: By carefully filtering the data, `1result.sql` provides a precise calculation of the average weekly search frequencies and the subsequent percentage change between 2019 and 2020.

Therefore, the correct SQL script to use is:

1result.sql
