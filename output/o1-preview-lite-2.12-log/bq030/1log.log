This query selects countries as of May 10, 2020, with more than 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. It filters out any records where `cumulative_recovered` is NULL or greater than `cumulative_confirmed` to ensure accurate recovery rates. It then calculates the recovery rate percentage and orders the results to retrieve the top three countries with the highest recovery rates.

**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- **`country_name`**: Used to identify the country names.
- **`date`**: Used to filter records as of May 10, 2020.
- **`cumulative_confirmed`**: Total confirmed COVID-19 cases up to the specified date; used to identify countries with more than 50,000 cases.
- **`cumulative_recovered`**: Total recovered COVID-19 cases up to the specified date; used to calculate recovery rates.
- **Conditions that may be used**:
  - **`date = '2020-05-10'`**: To select data as of May 10, 2020.
  - **`cumulative_confirmed > 50000`**: To filter countries with more than 50,000 confirmed cases.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct country names and their cumulative confirmed cases as of May 10, 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT country_name, cumulative_confirmed
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE date = '2020-05-10'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List countries with more than 50,000 confirmed cases as of May 10, 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT country_name, cumulative_confirmed
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE date = '2020-05-10' AND cumulative_confirmed > 50000
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get cumulative recovered cases for countries with more than 50,000 confirmed cases:**

   ```sql
   SELECT country_name, cumulative_recovered
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE date = '2020-05-10' AND cumulative_confirmed > 50000
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Calculate the recovery rate for each country with over 50,000 confirmed cases:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     country_name,
     cumulative_confirmed,
     cumulative_recovered,
     (cumulative_recovered / cumulative_confirmed) * 100 AS recovery_rate_percentage
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE date = '2020-05-10' AND cumulative_confirmed > 50000
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find the top 10 countries by highest recovery rates among those with over 50,000 confirmed cases:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     country_name,
     cumulative_confirmed,
     cumulative_recovered,
     (cumulative_recovered / cumulative_confirmed) * 100 AS recovery_rate_percentage
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE date = '2020-05-10' AND cumulative_confirmed > 50000
   ORDER BY recovery_rate_percentage DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

6. **Check for countries with missing recovery data (NULL cumulative_recovered):**

   ```sql
   SELECT country_name, cumulative_confirmed, cumulative_recovered
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE date = '2020-05-10' AND cumulative_confirmed > 50000 AND cumulative_recovered IS NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List countries along with cumulative confirmed and recovered cases, handling NULL values:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     country_name,
     cumulative_confirmed,
     IFNULL(cumulative_recovered, 0) AS cumulative_recovered
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE date = '2020-05-10'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate recovery rates while handling possible division by zero errors:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     country_name,
     cumulative_confirmed,
     cumulative_recovered,
     SAFE_DIVIDE(cumulative_recovered, cumulative_confirmed) * 100 AS recovery_rate_percentage
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE date = '2020-05-10' AND cumulative_confirmed > 50000
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find the number of countries with more than 50,000 confirmed cases as of May 10, 2020:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country_name) AS country_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE date = '2020-05-10' AND cumulative_confirmed > 50000
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve the top 3 countries with the highest recovery rates:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      country_name,
      cumulative_confirmed,
      cumulative_recovered,
      (cumulative_recovered / cumulative_confirmed) * 100 AS recovery_rate_percentage
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE date = '2020-05-10' AND cumulative_confirmed > 50000
    ORDER BY recovery_rate_percentage DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

Task: As of May 10, 2020, among all countries that had more than 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, which three countries had the highest recovery rates based on the total number of recovered cases relative to their total confirmed cases, and what were their respective recovery rates expressed as percentages?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Country,Recovery_Rate_Percentage
China,94.3
Germany,83.7
Iran,79.8
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

As of May 10, 2020, among countries with more than 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, **China**, **Germany**, and **Iran** had the highest recovery rates based on the total number of recovered cases relative to their total confirmed cases. The recovery rates were approximately **94.3%** for China, **83.7%** for Germany, and **79.8%** for Iran..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'covid19_open_data': ['covid19_open_data']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

As of May 10, 2020, among countries with more than 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, **China**, **Germany**, and **Iran** had the highest recovery rates based on the total number of recovered cases relative to their total confirmed cases. The recovery rates were approximately **94.3%** for China, **83.7%** for Germany, and **79.8%** for Iran. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
