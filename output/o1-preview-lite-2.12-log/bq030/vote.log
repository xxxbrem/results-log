After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **1result.sql** is the correct SQL query.

**Reason:**

- **1result.sql** accurately selects countries that meet the criteria:
  - The data is from **May 10, 2020** (`date = '2020-05-10'`).
  - The cumulative confirmed cases are greater than **50,000**.
  - Both `cumulative_confirmed` and `cumulative_recovered` are **not null**, ensuring valid data for calculation.
  - `cumulative_recovered` is less than or equal to `cumulative_confirmed`, which is logical since recoveries can't exceed total confirmed cases.
  - The data is at the **country level** (`aggregation_level = 0`).

- It correctly calculates the **recovery rate percentage** by dividing `cumulative_recovered` by `cumulative_confirmed`, multiplying by 100, and rounding to four decimal places.

- The query orders the results in **descending order** of recovery rates, ensuring that the top countries with the highest recovery rates are listed first.

- The results obtained from this query match the expected outcomes, identifying **China**, **Italy**, and **Brazil** as the top three countries with the highest recovery rates among those with more than 50,000 confirmed cases as of May 10, 2020.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:
