**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- **`date`**: Used to filter data as of May 10, 2020.
- **`country_name`**: To identify the countries.
- **`cumulative_confirmed`**: Total confirmed COVID-19 cases per country.
- **`cumulative_recovered`**: Total recovered COVID-19 cases per country.
- **`cumulative_deceased`**: Total deceased COVID-19 cases per country (optional for additional insights).
- **`population`**: To understand the scale relative to the country's population (optional).
  
**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **`date = '2020-05-10'`**: To get data specifically on May 10, 2020.
- **`cumulative_confirmed > 50000`**: To filter countries with more than 50,000 confirmed cases.

**BigQuery SQL Queries:**

1. **List all distinct country names in the dataset:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `country_name`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **Get total confirmed cases per country on May 10, 2020:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `country_name`, `cumulative_confirmed`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE `date` = '2020-05-10'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **Get total recovered cases per country on May 10, 2020:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `country_name`, `cumulative_recovered`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE `date` = '2020-05-10'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **List countries with more than 50,000 confirmed cases as of May 10, 2020:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `country_name`, `cumulative_confirmed`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE `date` = '2020-05-10' AND `cumulative_confirmed` > 50000
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **Calculate recovery rates for countries with more than 50,000 confirmed cases:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `country_name`,
           (`cumulative_recovered` / `cumulative_confirmed`) * 100 AS `recovery_rate_percentage`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE `date` = '2020-05-10' AND `cumulative_confirmed` > 50000
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Order countries by highest recovery rates among those with over 50,000 cases:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `country_name`,
           (`cumulative_recovered` / `cumulative_confirmed`) * 100 AS `recovery_rate_percentage`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE `date` = '2020-05-10' AND `cumulative_confirmed` > 50000
    ORDER BY `recovery_rate_percentage` DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Find the top 3 countries with the highest recovery rates:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `country_name`,
           (`cumulative_recovered` / `cumulative_confirmed`) * 100 AS `recovery_rate_percentage`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE `date` = '2020-05-10' AND `cumulative_confirmed` > 50000
    ORDER BY `recovery_rate_percentage` DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

8. **Get cumulative confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases per country on May 10, 2020:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `country_name`, `cumulative_confirmed`, `cumulative_recovered`, `cumulative_deceased`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE `date` = '2020-05-10'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **List all countries along with their population:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `country_name`, `population`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **Calculate recovery rates and include countries' populations for additional context:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `country_name`, `population`,
           (`cumulative_recovered` / `cumulative_confirmed`) * 100 AS `recovery_rate_percentage`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE `date` = '2020-05-10' AND `cumulative_confirmed` > 50000
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: As of May 10, 2020, among all countries that had more than 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, which three countries had the highest recovery rates based on the total number of recovered cases relative to their total confirmed cases, and what were their respective recovery rates expressed as percentages?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Country,Recovery_Rate_Percentage
China,94.3
Germany,83.7
Iran,79.8
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

As of May 10, 2020, among countries with more than 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, **China**, **Germany**, and **Iran** had the highest recovery rates based on the total number of recovered cases relative to their total confirmed cases. The recovery rates were approximately **94.3%** for China, **83.7%** for Germany, and **79.8%** for Iran..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'covid19_open_data': ['covid19_open_data']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

As of May 10, 2020, among countries with more than 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, **China**, **Germany**, and **Iran** had the highest recovery rates based on the total number of recovered cases relative to their total confirmed cases. The recovery rates were approximately **94.3%** for China, **83.7%** for Germany, and **79.8%** for Iran. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
