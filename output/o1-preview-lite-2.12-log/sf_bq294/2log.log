Task: Could you provide the details of the top 5 longest bike share trips that started between July 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017, including the trip ID, duration in seconds, start date, start station name, route (derived from start station name to end station name), bike number, subscriber type, member's birth year, the member's current age (calculated using the current year), an age classification based on whether the member is younger than 40, between 40 and 60, or older than 60, the member's gender, and the name of the region of the start station? Please exclude any trips where the start station name, member's birth year, or member's gender is not specified.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv

(Attention: answer in five rows)
```

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the details of the top 5 longest bike share trips that started between July 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017. Each row represents one trip and includes the following information:

- **trip_id**: The unique identifier for the trip (string).
- **duration_sec**: The duration of the trip in seconds (integer).
- **start_date**: The date when the trip started (date).
- **start_station_name**: The name of the station where the trip began (string).
- **route**: The route taken during the trip, derived from the start station name to the end station name, formatted as "start_station_name - end_station_name" (string).
- **bike_number**: The identifier of the bike used for the trip (integer).
- **subscriber_type**: The type of subscriber (e.g., "Subscriber" or "Customer") (string).
- **member_birth_year**: The birth year of the member (integer).
- **member_current_age**: The current age of the member, calculated using the current year (integer).
- **age_classification**: Classification based on the member's age:
  - 'Young (<40 Y.O)' for members younger than 40
  - 'Adult (40-60 Y.O)' for members between 40 and 60
  - 'Senior Adult (>60 Y.O)' for members older than 60 (string).
- **member_gender**: The gender of the member (string).
- **region_name**: The name of the region where the start station is located (string).

Trips where the start station name, member's birth year, or member's gender were not specified have been excluded from this list. The trips are ordered by their duration in descending order, showcasing the top 5 longest trips during the specified period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS': {'SAN_FRANCISCO_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATION_STATUS', 'BIKESHARE_REGIONS', 'BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_FILM_LOCATIONS': ['FILM_LOCATIONS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS': ['BOUNDARIES'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_SFFD_SERVICE_CALLS': ['SFFD_SERVICE_CALLS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_SFPD_INCIDENTS': ['SFPD_INCIDENTS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_TRANSIT_MUNI': ['CALENDAR', 'FARES', 'SHAPES', 'VEHICLE_MONITORING', 'STOPS', 'STOP_TIMES', 'TRIPS', 'ROUTES', 'STOP_MONITORING'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_TREES': ['STREET_TREES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

```

**Explanation:**

The error occurred because there were empty strings (`''`) in numeric fields, which cannot be cast to numbers. To fix this, I added the following checks to ensure that empty strings are excluded before casting:

- **For `duration_sec`, `start_date`, and `member_birth_year`:**

  - Ensured the fields are not `NULL` and not empty strings using `IS NOT NULL` and `<> ''`.
  - Used `TRY_CAST` to safely attempt casting to the desired numeric type; if casting fails, it returns `NULL` instead of throwing an error.
  - In the `ORDER BY` clause, added `NULLS LAST` to handle any remaining `NULL` values after casting.

- **For `start_date`:**

  - Wrapped the division and timestamp conversion with `TRY_CAST` and `TRY_CAST` to handle any non-numeric values safely.
  - Ensured that `start_date` is a valid numeric value before converting it to a timestamp.

By incorporating these changes, the query now filters out records with invalid numeric values and avoids casting errors, allowing it to execute successfully and retrieve the desired top 5 longest trips.

**Explanation:**

The error occurred because even after filtering, there were still rows where the casting operations in the `SELECT` clause encountered invalid numeric values. To fix this:

- **Use `TRY_CAST` in the CTE (`valid_trips`):** I applied `TRY_CAST` to the fields `duration_sec`, `start_date`, and `member_birth_year` directly in the CTE. This ensures that any invalid values are converted to `NULL`.

- **Filter out `NULL` values after casting:** In the `WHERE` clause of the CTE, I checked that the results of the `TRY_CAST` are not `NULL`. This effectively filters out any rows where the casting failed due to invalid data.

- **Avoid re-casting in the outer query:** Since the fields are already cast in the CTE and validated, we can use them directly in the outer query without additional casting, preventing any casting-related errors.

- **Additional Adjustments:**
  - Renamed `start_date` in the CTE to `start_date_num` to avoid confusion and to make it clear that it's a numeric value ready for timestamp conversion.
  - In the outer query, used `start_date_num` for the timestamp conversion.

By making these changes, the query should now execute without errors and return the top 5 longest trips between July 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017, with all the requested details.

**Explanation:**

In this query:

- **CTE (`valid_trips`) Adjustments:**
  - Moved all `TRY_TO_NUMBER` conversions into the CTE to ensure that the numeric fields are correctly cast before being used in calculations.
  - Added checks in the `WHERE` clause to filter out any rows where the conversions result in `NULL`.
  - Now, `vt."duration_sec"`, `vt."start_date_num"`, and `vt."member_birth_year"` are guaranteed to be numeric and not `NULL`.

- **Main Query Adjustments:**
  - In the `SELECT` clause, used the numeric fields directly without additional casting or conversions.
  - Calculations like `2023 - vt."member_birth_year"` and the `CASE` statement now operate on numeric values, ensuring they don't encounter empty strings or invalid numbers.
  - The `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ` function receives a valid numeric timestamp.

By restructuring the query this way, we eliminate the possibility of empty strings or invalid numeric values causing casting errors during query execution.

**Note:** If there are still errors, it might be due to residual invalid data that wasn't caught by the existing filters. In that case, you might consider adding additional filters or checking the data for anomalies.

**Explanation:**

The error occurred because empty strings (`''`) in numeric fields were causing casting errors when using `TRY_TO_NUMBER`. To fix this, I utilized the `NULLIF` function to convert empty strings to `NULL` before attempting to convert them to numbers. Here's what I did:

- **Used `NULLIF` on Numeric Fields:**
  - Wrapped `bt."duration_sec"`, `bt."start_date"`, and `bt."member_birth_year"` with `NULLIF(bt."column_name", '')`. This converts any empty strings to `NULL`.
  - Then applied `TRY_TO_NUMBER` to these adjusted fields.

- **Adjusted the WHERE Clause:**
  - Removed unnecessary `IS NOT NULL` checks for fields that can't be `NULL` due to the table structure (e.g., `bt."start_station_name"` can't be `NULL`, but we still check for empty strings).
  - Ensured that after applying `NULLIF` and `TRY_TO_NUMBER`, the numeric fields are not `NULL` and meet reasonable criteria:
    - `duration_sec` and `start_date` are greater than zero.
    - `member_birth_year` is between 1900 and 2023.

- **Casting `start_station_id`:**
  - In the JOIN condition, cast `vt."start_station_id"` to a string using `TO_VARCHAR` to match the data type of `bsi."station_id"`.

- **Final Adjustments:**
  - Ensured that the `start_date_num` is not `NULL` before converting it to a timestamp.
  - Used `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ` to convert `start_date_num / 1000000` into a timestamp, matching the date range specified in the requirement.

By making these adjustments, we effectively filter out any rows that could cause casting errors due to empty strings or invalid numeric values, thus preventing the "Numeric value '' is not recognized" error.

**Note:** This query should now execute successfully and return the details of the top 5 longest bike share trips that meet the specified criteria.
