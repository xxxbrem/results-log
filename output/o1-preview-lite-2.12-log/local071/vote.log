After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, I have concluded that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script that accurately identifies the countries with the longest streak of consecutive inserted city dates in June 2022.

**Reasoning:**

- **Objective Alignment:** All three SQL scripts aim to find the countries with the longest consecutive streaks of insert dates in June 2022.

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - `0result.sql` effectively calculates the streaks by:
    - Selecting distinct dates per country within June 2022.
    - Assigning row numbers to these dates partitioned by country.
    - Calculating a group identifier using the difference between the Julian day number of the insert date and the row number.
    - Grouping by country and this group identifier to find consecutive sequences.
    - Determining the maximum streak length per country.
    - Selecting the countries with the longest streak length.
  - The computation accurately captures consecutive insert dates per country and correctly identifies the countries with the longest streaks.

- **Results Verification:**
  - The output of `0result.sql` lists the countries `br`, `in`, and `us`, which aligns with the provided data indicating these countries have insertions on every day in June 2022, thus a streak length of 30.

- **Clarity and Efficiency:**
  - `0result.sql` uses clear and efficient CTEs (Common Table Expressions) with descriptive names, making the query readable and maintainable.
  - The use of `CROSS JOIN` with the `longest_streak` CTE neatly filters the countries matching the maximum streak length.

- **Comparison with Other Scripts:**
  - While `1result.sql` and `2result.sql` are similar in logic and also produce the correct results, `0result.sql` stands out for its structured approach and clarity.
  - `0result.sql` explicitly calculates `longest_streak_length` and uses it to filter the final results, which enhances understanding of each step.

**Conclusion:**

The SQL script in `0result.sql` correctly identifies the countries with the longest streak of consecutive inserted city dates in June 2022.
