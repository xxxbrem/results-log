Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
  - `title` (STRING): Used to find questions that contain the word "how" in the title.
  - `tags` (STRING): Used to identify questions tagged with specified Android-related tags like 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', etc.
  - `view_count` (INT64): Used to determine the most viewed question.
  - `id` (INT64): The question ID (potentially useful for linking to other tables or for additional details).
  - `creation_date` (TIMESTAMP): Could be used for filtering questions based on when they were asked.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Title contains "how" (case-insensitive):** `LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'`
- **Tags contain specified Android-related tags:** Checking if `tags` contains any of the tags like '<android-layout>', '<android-activity>', '<android-intent>', etc.
- **Ordering by view count descending:** To find the most viewed question, use `ORDER BY view_count DESC`.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Select titles containing "how":**

   ```sql
   SELECT title
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select titles containing "how" and tagged with 'android':**

   ```sql
   SELECT title, tags
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'
     AND tags LIKE '%<android>%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select titles containing "how" and tagged with specified Android tags:**

   ```sql
   SELECT title, tags
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'
     AND (
       tags LIKE '%<android-layout>%'
       OR tags LIKE '%<android-activity>%'
       OR tags LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
     )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Select titles, tags, and view counts for specified conditions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT title, tags, view_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'
     AND (
       tags LIKE '%<android>%'
       OR tags LIKE '%<android-layout>%'
       OR tags LIKE '%<android-activity>%'
       OR tags LIKE '%<android-intent>%'
       OR tags LIKE '%<android-studio>%'
     )
   ORDER BY view_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Select the most viewed question matching the criteria:**

   ```sql
   SELECT title, view_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'
     AND (
       tags LIKE '%<android>%'
       OR tags LIKE '%<android-layout>%'
       OR tags LIKE '%<android-activity>%'

       OR tags LIKE '%<android-studio>%'
     )
   ORDER BY view_count DESC

   ```

6. **Use regular expressions to match tags starting with 'android':**

   ```sql
   SELECT title, view_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'
     AND REGEXP_CONTAINS(tags, r'<android(-[a-z0-9]+)?>')
   ORDER BY view_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Extract and match individual tags using UNNEST:**

   ```sql
   SELECT title, view_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` AS pq
   WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'
     AND EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM UNNEST(SPLIT(REGEXP_REPLACE(pq.tags, r'^<|>$', ''), '><')) AS tag
       WHERE tag IN ('android', 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', 'android-studio')
     )
   ORDER BY view_count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Select titles where title starts with "how" and tagged with 'android':**

   ORDER BY view_count DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

10. **Count the number of questions matching the criteria:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS question_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
    WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'
      AND (
        tags LIKE '%<android>%'
        OR tags LIKE '%<android-layout>%'

Task: What is the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow, across specified tags such as 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', and others

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow across specified tags is:

```csv
Title
title:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This question has the highest number of views among those tagged with Android-related tags (such as 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', etc.) and containing the word "how" in the title..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'stackoverflow': ['badges', 'comments', 'post_history', 'post_links', 'posts_answers', 'posts_moderator_nomination', 'posts_orphaned_tag_wiki', 'posts_privilege_wiki', 'posts_questions', 'posts_tag_wiki', 'posts_tag_wiki_excerpt', 'posts_wiki_placeholder', 'stackoverflow_posts', 'tags', 'users', 'votes']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 11:36:09 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow, across specified tags such as 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', and others, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
