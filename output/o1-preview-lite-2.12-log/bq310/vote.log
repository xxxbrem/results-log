After comparing the two SQL queries, both aim to retrieve the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow. They both search for questions where the title contains "how" (case-insensitive) and where the tags include any tag that starts with "android".

**Comparison:**

- **0result.sql**:
  - Uses a JOIN-like approach by including `UNNEST` in the `FROM` clause.
  - Potentially generates a larger intermediate table because it expands each row per tag.
  - Syntax:
    ```sql
    SELECT title
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` AS pq,
    UNNEST(SPLIT(REGEXP_REPLACE(pq.tags, r'^<|>$', ''), '><')) AS tag
    WHERE LOWER(pq.title) LIKE '%how%'
      AND LOWER(tag) LIKE 'android%'
    ORDER BY pq.view_count DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

- **2result.sql**:
  - Uses the `EXISTS` clause with a subquery to check for the presence of at least one matching tag.
  - More efficient because it doesn't expand the rows; it simply checks for the existence of the condition.
  - Syntax:
    ```sql
    SELECT title
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
    WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'
      AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM UNNEST(SPLIT(REGEXP_REPLACE(tags, '^<|>$', ''), '><')) AS tag
        WHERE LOWER(tag) LIKE '%android%'
      )
    ORDER BY view_count DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

**Reason for Choosing 2result.sql:**

- **Efficiency**: Using `EXISTS` is more efficient than joining the unnested tags directly in the `FROM` clause, as it avoids unnecessary data expansion and reduces computation time.
- **Clarity**: The `EXISTS` clause clearly expresses the intent to check for the existence of a tag without altering the result set's cardinality.
- **Performance**: It reduces the risk of duplicating rows due to multiple tags matching, which can happen in the first query.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above reasons, **2result.sql** is the correct and more optimal SQL query for retrieving the desired result.
