After comparing the provided SQL queries, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer. This query accurately implements all the specified requirements for generating the report:

- **Excludes Series from the NLST Collection**: Filters out any series where `"collection_id" = 'NLST'`.
- **Excludes Localizer Images and JPEG-Compressed Series**: Filters out series based on `"ImageType"` and `"TransferSyntaxUID"`.
- **Checks for Single Orientation and Identical Pixel Spacing**: Uses window functions to count distinct `"ImageOrientationPatient"` and `"PixelSpacing"` per series and filters for those with a count of one.
- **Ensures Matching SOP Instance and Position Counts**: Verifies that the counts of `"SOPInstanceUID"` and `"ImagePositionPatient"` are equal for each series.
- **Confirms Uniform Pixel Rows and Columns**: Counts distinct `"Rows"` and `"Columns"` per series and filters for those with a single value.
- **Computes Near-Unity Dot Product of Image Orientation Vectors**: Parses and calculates the normal vector from `"ImageOrientationPatient"` and computes the dot product with the z-axis unit vector.
- **Calculates Slice Interval Differences**: Computes the differences in z-positions between slices.
- **Computes Exposure Differences**: Aggregates exposure values to find the minimum and maximum per series.
- **Calculates Approximate Series Size in MB**: Sums the `"instance_size"` for each series and converts it to megabytes.

The query not only filters and validates the data according to the requirements but also performs all necessary computations to generate the desired report.
