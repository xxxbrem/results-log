Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Columns and their potential usage:**

- **Table:** `problem`
  - `name`: Identifies the unique problem name.
  
- **Table:** `solution`
  - `name`: Problem name, used to link with the `problem` table.
  - `version`: Version number of the solution, used to distinguish different iterations.
  - Other columns may not be directly relevant to this task.
  
- **Table:** `model_score`
  - `name`: Problem name.
  - `version`: Version number.
  - `step`: Step number (1, 2, or 3).
  - `model`: Model name (e.g., "Stack" or other models).
  - `test_score`: The test score of the model.
  
- **Conditions that may be used:**
  - `step` IN (1, 2, 3): To consider only steps 1, 2, and 3.
  - `model` = 'Stack' or `model` <> 'Stack': To distinguish between "Stack" models and others.
  - Comparing `test_score` between "Stack" models and non-"Stack" models for the same `name`, `version`, and `step`.

Task: Which problems exceed the total number of times they appear in the solution table when counting all occurrences, across steps 1, 2, and 3, where any non-"Stack" model's maximum test score is lower than the "Stack" model's test score for the same step and version?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Problem_Name
problem1:str
problem2:str
...
```

These are the problems where, for all occurrences across steps 1, 2, and 3 in the solution table, the "Stack" model's test score is higher than the maximum test score of any non-"Stack" model for the same step and version..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['problem', 'eda', 'feature_importance', 'solution', 'model_score', 'model_importance', 'model']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 11:02:55 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which problems exceed the total number of times they appear in the solution table when counting all occurrences, across steps 1, 2, and 3, where any non-"Stack" model's maximum test score is lower than the "Stack" model's test score for the same step and version?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Problem_Name
problem1:str
problem2:str
...
```

These are the problems where, for all occurrences across steps 1, 2, and 3 in the solution table, the "Stack" model's test score is higher than the maximum test score of any non-"Stack" model for the same step and version. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
