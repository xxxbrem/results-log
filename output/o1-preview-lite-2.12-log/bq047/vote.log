After comparing the SQL queries and their corresponding results, I conclude that **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer for the following reasons:

1. **Accurate Implementation of the Task Requirements:**
   - **Complaint Filtering:** The query correctly filters complaint types with more than 5,000 total occurrences by utilizing the condition `HAVING Total_Complaints > 5000`.
   - **Temperature Data Handling:** It excludes days with missing or invalid temperature data (`temp != 9999.9`) and only includes data from the specified stations (`stn IN ('725030', '744860')`) within the years 2008 to 2017.
   - **Correlation Calculations:** The query calculates both Pearson correlation coefficients between the average temperature and:
     - Daily complaint count (`CORR(daily_complaint_count, avg_temp)`)
     - Daily percentage of total complaints (`CORR(SAFE_DIVIDE(daily_complaint_count, total_daily_complaints), avg_temp)`)

2. **Correct Application of Filters for Strong Correlation:**
   - The query correctly identifies complaint types with a strong correlation (absolute value greater than 0.5) by applying the condition `AND ABS(Pearson_Correlation_Count_Temperature) > 0.5` in the `HAVING` clause.

3. **Accurate Aggregation and Rounding:**
   - It calculates the total number of complaints and total days with valid temperature records accurately.
   - The Pearson correlation coefficients are rounded to four decimals as specified.

4. **Result Consistency with Task Expectations:**
   - The output `0result.csv` aligns with expected results, displaying complaint types with strong correlations and the required statistics.

Therefore, the correct SQL file that fulfills all the task requirements is:

0result.sql
