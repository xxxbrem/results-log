End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Could you analyze the relationship between each complaint type and daily temperature in New York City, specifically using temperature data from LaGuardia (STN=725030) and JFK (STN=744860) airports for the 10 years starting in 2008, and then determine, for each complaint type that has more than 5000 total occurrences and shows a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) with temperature, the total number of complaints, the total number of days with valid temperature records, and the Pearson correlation coefficients (rounded to four decimals) between temperature and both the daily complaint count as well as the daily percentage of total complaints, excluding any days with missing or invalid temperature data (such as 9999.9)?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the analysis, the following complaint types have more than 5000 total occurrences and show a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) with temperature:

```csv
Complaint_Type,Total_Complaints,Total_Days_with_Valid_Temperature_Records,Pearson_Correlation_Count_Temperature,Pearson_Correlation_Percentage_Temperature
complaint_type1:str,total_complaints1:int,total_days1:int,correlation_count1:float,correlation_percentage1:float
complaint_type2:str,total_complaints2:int,total_days2:int,correlation_count2:float,correlation_percentage2:float
...
```

In this table:
- **Complaint_Type**: The type of complaint.
- **Total_Complaints**: The total number of complaints of this type from 2008 to 2017.
- **Total_Days_with_Valid_Temperature_Records**: The number of days with valid temperature records used in the analysis.
- **Pearson_Correlation_Count_Temperature**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between temperature and the daily complaint count (rounded to four decimals).
- **Pearson_Correlation_Percentage_Temperature**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between temperature and the daily percentage of total complaints (rounded to four decimals).

Only complaint types with more than 5000 total occurrences and a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) are included. Days with missing or invalid temperature data (such as 9999.9) were excluded from the analysis to ensure accuracy..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 23:08:39 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you analyze the relationship between each complaint type and daily temperature in New York City, specifically using temperature data from LaGuardia (STN=725030) and JFK (STN=744860) airports for the 10 years starting in 2008, and then determine, for each complaint type that has more than 5000 total occurrences and shows a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) with temperature, the total number of complaints, the total number of days with valid temperature records, and the Pearson correlation coefficients (rounded to four decimals) between temperature and both the daily complaint count as well as the daily percentage of total complaints, excluding any days with missing or invalid temperature data (such as 9999.9)?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Based on the analysis, the following complaint types have more than 5000 total occurrences and show a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) with temperature:

```csv
Complaint_Type,Total_Complaints,Total_Days_with_Valid_Temperature_Records,Pearson_Correlation_Count_Temperature,Pearson_Correlation_Percentage_Temperature
complaint_type1:str,total_complaints1:int,total_days1:int,correlation_count1:float,correlation_percentage1:float
complaint_type2:str,total_complaints2:int,total_days2:int,correlation_count2:float,correlation_percentage2:float
...
```

In this table:
- **Complaint_Type**: The type of complaint.
- **Total_Complaints**: The total number of complaints of this type from 2008 to 2017.
- **Total_Days_with_Valid_Temperature_Records**: The number of days with valid temperature records used in the analysis.
- **Pearson_Correlation_Count_Temperature**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between temperature and the daily complaint count (rounded to four decimals).
- **Pearson_Correlation_Percentage_Temperature**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between temperature and the daily percentage of total complaints (rounded to four decimals).

Only complaint types with more than 5000 total occurrences and a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) are included. Days with missing or invalid temperature data (such as 9999.9) were excluded from the analysis to ensure accuracy. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
