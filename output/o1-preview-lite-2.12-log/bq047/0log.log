2025-02-10 23:01:20 - root - INFO - **Explanation:**

The error occurred because the column `stn` does not exist in the `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` table. In this table, the station identifiers are provided by the columns `usaf` and `wban`, not `stn`.

In the `gsod` (Global Summary of the Day) tables (e.g., `gsod2008`, `gsod2009`, etc.), the `stn` column represents the USAF station number, which corresponds to the `usaf` column in the `stations` table.

**Corrected Query:**

To retrieve the station names for LaGuardia and JFK airports using their USAF station numbers (`usaf`), you can modify your query as follows:

```sql
SELECT usaf, name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
WHERE usaf IN ('725030', '744860')
LIMIT 100;
```

Alternatively, if you're not sure about the station numbers, you can search for the stations by name using the `name` column:

```sql
SELECT usaf, wban, name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%la guardia%' OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%kennedy%' OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%jfk%'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **Use of `usaf` Column:** The `usaf` column in the `stations` table corresponds to the `stn` column in the `gsod` tables. Therefore, when querying the `stations` table, you should use `usaf` instead of `stn`.
- **Station Names:** Since airport names might be listed differently (e.g., "LA GUARDIA AIRPORT"), using `LOWER(name) LIKE '%la guardia%'` helps find all variations.

**Additional Clarifications:**

- Ensure that when you refer to station identifiers, you're using the correct columns:
  - In `gsod` tables: use `stn` (station number, corresponds to `usaf`).
  - In `stations` table: use `usaf` for the station number.
- When joining or matching stations between tables, match `stn` from `gsod` tables with `usaf` from `stations` table.

**Example to Confirm Station IDs:**

To confirm the station details for LaGuardia and JFK airports, you can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT usaf, wban, name, country, state, lat, lon
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
WHERE usaf IN ('725030', '744860')
LIMIT 100;
```

**Next Steps:**

- **Use `usaf` Instead of `stn` in `stations` Table:** Whenever you need to reference the station number in the `stations` table, use the `usaf` column.
- **Verify Station Codes:** Make sure that the station codes (`usaf`) you're using correspond to LaGuardia and JFK airports by checking their names.
- **Adjust Other Queries if Necessary:** If other queries reference non-existent columns, adjust them to use the correct column names.

**Revised Query Examples:**

1. **Retrieve Station Names for LaGuardia and JFK Airports:**

   ```sql
   SELECT usaf AS station_usaf, name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
   WHERE usaf IN ('725030', '744860')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find Stations by Name Containing 'La Guardia' or 'JFK':**

   ```sql
   SELECT usaf, wban, name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations`
   WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%la guardia%' OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%kennedy%' OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%jfk%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve Temperature Data from LaGuardia and JFK for the Year 2008:**

   ```sql
   SELECT stn AS station_usaf, year, mo, da, temp
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2008`
   WHERE stn IN ('725030', '744860') AND temp != 9999.9
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Join Station Names with Temperature Data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT g.stn AS station_usaf, s.name, g.year, g.mo, g.da, g.temp
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2008` AS g
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS s
   ON g.stn = s.usaf
   WHERE g.stn IN ('725030', '744860') AND g.temp != 9999.9
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Conclusion:**

By adjusting the column names in your queries to match the actual schema of the tables, you should be able to retrieve the desired data without encountering the "Unrecognized name" error.

LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Corrected Column Name:** In the `valid_temps` CTE, I changed `stn` to `usaf` because the GSOD tables use `usaf` as the station identifier, matching the `usaf` column in the `stations` table. The `stn` column might not be present or correctly referenced.
  
- **Removed Correlation Threshold:** To ensure the query returns data, I removed the `WHERE` clause that filters complaint types based on the correlation coefficient. This way, all complaint types with more than 5000 total complaints will be included, regardless of the correlation values.

- **Used `SAFE_DIVIDE`:** In calculating the correlation with the daily percentage of total complaints, I used `SAFE_DIVIDE` to prevent division by zero errors.

- **Ordering the Results:** The final `SELECT` statement orders the results by `total_complaints` to show the most frequent complaint types first.

This query calculates:

- **Total Complaints:** The total number of complaints for each type between 2008 and 2017.
- **Total Days with Valid Temperature Records:** The number of days where both complaint data and valid temperature data are available.
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficients:** The correlation between temperature and both the daily complaint count and the daily percentage of total complaints.

By removing the strict correlation threshold, the query will return data for all complaint types meeting the total complaints criterion, and you can examine the correlation coefficients to identify any strong relationships.

2025-02-10 23:09:13 - root - INFO - Apologies for the confusion earlier.

**Explanation:**

- In the `gsod*` tables (e.g., `gsod2008`, `gsod2009`, etc.), the station identifier is under the column `stn`, not `usaf`.
- The `usaf` column is present in the `stations` table and corresponds to the `stn` column in the `gsod` tables.
- Therefore, when querying the `gsod*` tables, you should use `stn` as the station identifier.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here is the corrected query using `stn` instead of `usaf`:

```sql
WITH valid_temps AS (
  SELECT
    DATE(CONCAT(year, '-', LPAD(mo, 2, '0'), '-', LPAD(da, 2, '0'))) AS date,
    AVG(temp) AS avg_temp
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
  WHERE
    _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2008' AND '2017'
    AND stn IN ('725030', '744860')
    AND temp != 9999.9
  GROUP BY date
),
daily_complaints AS (
  SELECT
    DATE(created_date) AS date,
    complaint_type,
    COUNT(unique_key) AS daily_complaint_count
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_date) BETWEEN 2008 AND 2017
  GROUP BY date, complaint_type
),
total_daily_complaints AS (
  SELECT
    date,
    SUM(daily_complaint_count) AS total_daily_complaints
  FROM
    daily_complaints
  GROUP BY date
),
complaints_with_temps AS (
  SELECT
    c.date,
    c.complaint_type,
    c.daily_complaint_count,
    t.avg_temp,
    total.total_daily_complaints
  FROM
    daily_complaints c
  JOIN
    valid_temps t ON c.date = t.date
  JOIN
    total_daily_complaints total ON c.date = total.date
),
complaints_with_stats AS (
  SELECT
    complaint_type,
    SUM(daily_complaint_count) AS total_complaints,
    COUNT(DISTINCT date) AS total_days_with_valid_temp,
    CORR(daily_complaint_count, avg_temp) AS corr_count_temp,
    CORR(SAFE_DIVIDE(daily_complaint_count, total_daily_complaints), avg_temp) AS corr_percentage_temp
  FROM
    complaints_with_temps
  GROUP BY
    complaint_type
  HAVING
    total_complaints > 5000
    AND ABS(CORR(daily_complaint_count, avg_temp)) > 0.5  -- Added correlation threshold
)
SELECT
  complaint_type,
  total_complaints,
  total_days_with_valid_temp,
  ROUND(corr_count_temp, 4) AS pearson_corr_count_temp,
  ROUND(corr_percentage_temp, 4) AS pearson_corr_percentage_temp
FROM
  complaints_with_stats
ORDER BY
  total_complaints DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Key Changes and Notes:**

- **Changed `usaf` back to `stn` in the `valid_temps` CTE:** This resolves the error about the unrecognized column `usaf`.

- **Applied the Correlation Threshold:** I included the condition `ABS(CORR(daily_complaint_count, avg_temp)) > 0.5` in the `HAVING` clause to filter complaint types with a strong correlation (absolute value greater than 0.5) as specified in your task.

- **Explanation of Each CTE:**

  - **`valid_temps`:** Computes the average temperature for each date from 2008 to 2017 for LaGuardia and JFK airports, excluding invalid temperature readings.

  - **`daily_complaints`:** Calculates the daily complaint counts per complaint type from 2008 to 2017.

  - **`total_daily_complaints`:** Sums up the total number of complaints for each day across all types.

  - **`complaints_with_temps`:** Joins the daily complaints with the corresponding average temperatures and total daily complaints.

  - **`complaints_with_stats`:** Computes the total complaints, number of days with valid temperature data, and Pearson correlation coefficients between temperature and both the daily complaint count and the daily percentage of total complaints for each complaint type.

- **Use of `SAFE_DIVIDE`:** This function ensures that division by zero does not cause errors. If `total_daily_complaints` is zero on any day (unlikely but possible), `SAFE_DIVIDE` will return `NULL`, and the correlation calculation will skip those entries.

- **Rounding the Correlation Coefficients:** The final `SELECT` rounds the correlation coefficients to four decimals as requested.

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:** Please execute this corrected SQL query. It should run without errors and provide you with the desired analysis.

- **Review the Results:** The output will list complaint types that have more than 5000 total occurrences and show a strong correlation with temperature (absolute value greater than 0.5), along with the required statistics.

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Could you analyze the relationship between each complaint type and daily temperature in New York City, specifically using temperature data from LaGuardia (STN=725030) and JFK (STN=744860) airports for the 10 years starting in 2008, and then determine, for each complaint type that has more than 5000 total occurrences and shows a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) with temperature, the total number of complaints, the total number of days with valid temperature records, and the Pearson correlation coefficients (rounded to four decimals) between temperature and both the daily complaint count as well as the daily percentage of total complaints, excluding any days with missing or invalid temperature data (such as 9999.9)?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the analysis, the following complaint types have more than 5000 total occurrences and show a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) with temperature:

```csv
Complaint_Type,Total_Complaints,Total_Days_with_Valid_Temperature_Records,Pearson_Correlation_Count_Temperature,Pearson_Correlation_Percentage_Temperature
complaint_type1:str,total_complaints1:int,total_days1:int,correlation_count1:float,correlation_percentage1:float
complaint_type2:str,total_complaints2:int,total_days2:int,correlation_count2:float,correlation_percentage2:float
...
```

In this table:
- **Complaint_Type**: The type of complaint.
- **Total_Complaints**: The total number of complaints of this type from 2008 to 2017.
- **Total_Days_with_Valid_Temperature_Records**: The number of days with valid temperature records used in the analysis.
- **Pearson_Correlation_Count_Temperature**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between temperature and the daily complaint count (rounded to four decimals).
- **Pearson_Correlation_Percentage_Temperature**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between temperature and the daily percentage of total complaints (rounded to four decimals).

Only complaint types with more than 5000 total occurrences and a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) are included. Days with missing or invalid temperature data (such as 9999.9) were excluded from the analysis to ensure accuracy..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-02-10 23:12:56 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you analyze the relationship between each complaint type and daily temperature in New York City, specifically using temperature data from LaGuardia (STN=725030) and JFK (STN=744860) airports for the 10 years starting in 2008, and then determine, for each complaint type that has more than 5000 total occurrences and shows a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) with temperature, the total number of complaints, the total number of days with valid temperature records, and the Pearson correlation coefficients (rounded to four decimals) between temperature and both the daily complaint count as well as the daily percentage of total complaints, excluding any days with missing or invalid temperature data (such as 9999.9)?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Based on the analysis, the following complaint types have more than 5000 total occurrences and show a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) with temperature:

```csv
Complaint_Type,Total_Complaints,Total_Days_with_Valid_Temperature_Records,Pearson_Correlation_Count_Temperature,Pearson_Correlation_Percentage_Temperature
complaint_type1:str,total_complaints1:int,total_days1:int,correlation_count1:float,correlation_percentage1:float
complaint_type2:str,total_complaints2:int,total_days2:int,correlation_count2:float,correlation_percentage2:float
...
```

In this table:
- **Complaint_Type**: The type of complaint.
- **Total_Complaints**: The total number of complaints of this type from 2008 to 2017.
- **Total_Days_with_Valid_Temperature_Records**: The number of days with valid temperature records used in the analysis.
- **Pearson_Correlation_Count_Temperature**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between temperature and the daily complaint count (rounded to four decimals).
- **Pearson_Correlation_Percentage_Temperature**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between temperature and the daily percentage of total complaints (rounded to four decimals).

Only complaint types with more than 5000 total occurrences and a strong correlation (absolute value > 0.5) are included. Days with missing or invalid temperature data (such as 9999.9) were excluded from the analysis to ensure accuracy. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
