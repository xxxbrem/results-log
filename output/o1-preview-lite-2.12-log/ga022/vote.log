The correct SQL query is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

After comparing both SQL queries and their results, we conclude that `0result.sql` is the more accurate and appropriate query for calculating the weekly retention rates for new users who first used the app during the first week of September 2018 (in Shanghai timezone). Here's why:

1. **Accurate First Open Timestamp:**
   - `0result.sql` calculates the **minimum** `event_timestamp` for the `first_open` event per user, ensuring that we capture the exact moment each user first opened the app.
   - It adjusts this timestamp to Shanghai timezone by adding the appropriate offset (`+8 * 3600 * 1000000` microseconds), guaranteeing that the date comparisons are accurate for the specified timezone.
   - By calculating `first_open_date_shanghai`, we ensure that users are correctly included in the cohort if they first opened the app between '20180901' and '20180907' in Shanghai time.

2. **Comprehensive Event Tracking:**
   - The query uses a **LEFT JOIN** between the cohort of new users (`new_users`) and all events (`events`), allowing us to track all subsequent events for each user after their first open.
   - By aggregating over all events per user and using `MAX(CASE WHEN ...)`, the query accurately determines whether a user was active in each week after their initial use.

3. **Precise Retention Calculation:**
   - The retention rates are calculated by summing the flags (`week1_active`, `week2_active`, `week3_active`) and dividing by the total number of users in the cohort.
   - This method ensures that each user is counted only once per week, providing an accurate retention rate.

4. **Timezone Consistency:**
   - All date and timestamp calculations in `0result.sql` are consistently adjusted to Shanghai timezone **before** any comparisons are made.
   - This approach avoids potential errors that might occur if events near the timezone boundaries are incorrectly assigned to the wrong day.

5. **Use of CTEs for Clarity:**
   - The query is structured with clear Common Table Expressions (CTEs), making it easier to read and understand each step of the data processing.
   - Each CTE builds upon the previous one, providing a logical flow from raw events to the final retention rates.

In contrast, while `2result.sql` also adjusts for Shanghai timezone and calculates similar retention rates, it may not accurately account for users whose **first recorded event** is not the actual first time they opened the app. It selects users based on `first_open` events within the date range but doesn't verify if this event is indeed their first-ever interaction with the app. Additionally, it relies on subqueries for each week's retention calculation, which can be less efficient and harder to maintain.

Therefore, `0result.sql` is the better choice for accurately determining the weekly customer retention rates for the specified cohort.
