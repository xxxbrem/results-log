**Comparison of the SQL Queries and Selection of the Correct One:**

To determine the correct SQL query that accurately addresses the task, let's analyze each query and its results.

---

**Task**: As of December 31, 2022, list the top 10 active large banks, each with assets over $10 billion, that have the highest percentage of uninsured assets based on quarterly estimates. Provide the names of these banks and their respective percentages of uninsured assets.

---

### **Query 0 (`0result.sql`):**

**Summary:**

- **Calculates**: 
  \[
  \text{Percentage of Uninsured Assets} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Deposits} - \text{Estimated Insured Deposits}}{\text{Total Assets}} \right) \times 100
  \]
- **Variables Used**:
  - `ASSET` for Total Assets (`ta`)
  - `DEP` for Total Deposits (`td`)
  - `DEPINSR` for Estimated Insured Deposits (`di`)
- **Date Filter**: `ta."DATE" = '2022-12-31'`
- **Filters**:
  - Banks with Total Assets over $10 billion.
  - Active banks (`e."IS_ACTIVE" = TRUE`).

**Results:**

- The top banks show percentages of uninsured assets above 90%, with the highest being around 97.7%.

**Analysis:**

- **Concern**: The percentages of uninsured assets are exceptionally high (over 90%), which is unusual.
- **Possible Issue**: This could indicate a misalignment between the variables used and their definitions or a misinterpretation of liabilities (deposits) as assets.

### **Query 1 (`1result.sql`):**

**Summary:**

- **Calculates**: 
  \[
  \text{Percentage of Uninsured Assets} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Deposits} - \text{Estimated Insured Deposits}}{\text{Total Assets}} \right) \times 100
  \]
- **Variables Used**:
  - `ASSET` for Total Assets (`ts."TOTAL_ASSETS"`)
  - `DEP` for Total Deposits (`ts."TOTAL_DEPOSITS"`)
  - `DEPINS` for Estimated Insured Deposits (`ts."ESTIMATED_INSURED_DEPOSITS"`)
- **Date Filter**: `t."DATE" = '2022-12-31'`
- **Filters**:
  - Banks with Total Assets over $10 billion.
  - Active banks (`e."IS_ACTIVE" = TRUE`).
  - Excludes records where Total Deposits or Estimated Insured Deposits are `NULL`.

**Results:**

- The top banks show percentages of uninsured assets ranging from approximately 54% to 81.5%.
- The banks listed are known for handling large institutional funds (e.g., The Bank of New York Mellon, State Street Bank).

**Analysis:**

- **Accuracy**: The percentages are within a reasonable range and align with industry expectations for banks that serve institutional clients.
- **Variable Definitions**:
  - `DEPINS`: Estimated Insured Deposits.
  - Calculating uninsured deposits as `Total Deposits - Estimated Insured Deposits` is appropriate.
- **Interpretation**: The calculation reflects the proportion of total assets funded by uninsured deposits, which is a reasonable measure of exposure to uninsured funds.

### **Query 2 (`2result.sql`):**

**Summary:**

- **Calculates**: 
  \[
  \text{Percentage of Uninsured Assets} = \left( \frac{\text{Uninsured Deposits}}{\text{Total Assets}} \right) \times 100
  \]
- **Variables Used**:
  - `ASSET` for Total Assets (`t_assets`)
  - `DEPUNA` for Estimated Uninsured Deposits in U.S. territories and possessions (`t_uninsured`)
- **Date Filter**: `t_assets."DATE" = '2022-12-31'`
- **Filters**:
  - Banks with Total Assets over $10 billion.
  - Active banks.
  - Banks with `END_DATE` after `2022-12-31` or `NULL`.

**Results:**

- The top banks show percentages of uninsured assets ranging from approximately 53% to 66.5%.
- The banks listed are similar to those in Query 1.

**Analysis:**

- **Concern**: The variable `DEPUNA` represents uninsured deposits in domestic offices in U.S. territories and possessionsâ€”not total uninsured deposits.
- **Limitation**: This variable may not capture all uninsured deposits across all bank operations, potentially leading to underestimation.
- **Variable Selection**: Using `DEPUNA` may not be appropriate for calculating total uninsured deposits.

---

### **Selection and Reasoning:**

**Chosen Query**: **`1result.sql`**

**Reasoning:**

- **Appropriateness of Variables**:
  - Query 1 uses `DEPINS` (Estimated Insured Deposits) and calculates uninsured deposits as `Total Deposits - Estimated Insured Deposits`, which is accurate and aligns with standard banking definitions.
  - It considers all uninsured deposits rather than limiting to a subset (as in Query 2 with `DEPUNA`).
- **Reasonableness of Results**:
  - The percentages obtained are within expected ranges for large banks with significant institutional deposits.
  - The results are plausible and consistent with industry data.
- **Data Completeness**:
  - Query 1 ensures that only banks with non-null values for Total Deposits and Estimated Insured Deposits are included, enhancing the accuracy of the results.

**Conclusion:**

- **Query 1 (`1result.sql`)** accurately calculates the percentage of uninsured assets by determining the proportion of total assets funded by uninsured deposits.
- It uses appropriate variables and provides plausible results that reflect the real-world scenario.
