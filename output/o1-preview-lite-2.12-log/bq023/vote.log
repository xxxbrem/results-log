After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Accurate Allocation of Donations:**
   - The query in `2result.sql` uses the `total_ratio` from the HUD ZIP Code to Census Tract Crosswalk to allocate donations proportionally to census tracts. This ratio reflects the proportion of total addresses (residential, commercial, etc.) in a ZIP code that are within a specific census tract.
   - By multiplying the donation amount by `total_ratio`, the query accurately distributes each donation across the relevant census tracts based on the proportion of the ZIP code that lies within each tract.

2. **Correct Calculation of Average Donation Amount:**
   - The query sums the adjusted donation amounts (`transaction_amt * total_ratio`) for each census tract.
   - It then divides this sum by the total of the `total_ratio` values for that tract to compute the weighted average donation amount.
   - This approach ensures that the average donation amount per census tract is accurately calculated, accounting for the varying proportions of ZIP codes overlapping with each tract.

3. **Proper Filtering for Kings County (Brooklyn):**
   - The query filters census tracts to those in Kings County (`county_fips_code = '047'`), ensuring that only tracts in Brooklyn are included in the results.
   - This directly addresses the task requirement to focus on census tracts located in Kings County.

4. **Comprehensive Data Joining:**
   - The query joins the FEC donations data with the HUD crosswalk, the New York census tracts dataset, and the ACS median income data.
   - This ensures that each census tract in the final result includes both the average donation amount and the median income, as required.

5. **Use of SAFE_DIVIDE and SAFE_CAST:**
   - The query uses `SAFE_DIVIDE` to avoid division-by-zero errors, which can occur if the sum of `total_ratio` is zero for any tract.
   - It also uses `SAFE_CAST` to handle any potential data type issues, promoting robustness in the calculation.

**In contrast, the other queries have limitations:**

- **`0result.sql` and `1result.sql` use `residential_ratio`** for weighting donations, which only considers residential addresses. Donations can originate from businesses or other entities, so using `total_ratio` provides a more accurate allocation.
- **They calculate the average of adjusted donation amounts directly**, without properly normalizing by the sum of the ratios, which may lead to incorrect average calculations.
