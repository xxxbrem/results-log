After reviewing and comparing the three SQL queries provided, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL script for the following reasons:

1. **Accurate Proportional Allocation**: `2result.sql` correctly allocates each tract's population and income to the ZIP codes based on the overlapping area between their geographic boundaries. It calculates the proportion of each census tract that overlaps with a ZIP code and applies this proportion to allocate population and income accurately.

2. **Proper Filtering of ZIP Codes**: The script filters ZIP codes to include only those within a 5-mile radius of the specified point at latitude 47.685833°N and longitude -122.191667°W. This is accomplished using the `ST_DWithin` function on the ZIP code geometries and the given point.

3. **Correct Calculation of Total Population and Average Income**: It calculates the total allocated population and the total allocated income for each ZIP code and then computes the average individual income by dividing the total income by the total population. The results are rounded to one decimal place as per the requirement.

4. **Sorting the Results Appropriately**: The final results are sorted by the average individual income in descending order, fulfilling the last part of the task.

5. **Code Clarity and Structure**: The query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to structure the query logically, making it easier to read and understand. It also includes necessary checks, such as ensuring that the intersection areas are greater than zero.

In comparison:

- **`0result.sql`** is similar to `2result.sql`, but it uses an additional buffer calculation with `ST_BUFFER` and intersects tracts directly with this buffer. While this approach works, it introduces an unnecessary step since we can filter ZIP codes directly using `ST_DWithin`, as done in `2result.sql`.

- **`1result.sql`** attempts to perform the allocation but lacks precision in calculating the average individual income. It divides the weighted sum of per capita incomes by the sum of area proportions, which does not accurately reflect the average income per person. Moreover, it might not handle cases where area proportions sum to zero appropriately.

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** best meets all the requirements specified in the task.
