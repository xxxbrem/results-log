After comparing both SQL queries, we can determine that **2result.sql** is the more appropriate choice for the following reasons:

1. **Use of JOINs for Clarity and Efficiency:**
   - The second query (`2result.sql`) utilizes `JOIN` operations to directly link the `pickup_location_id` and `dropoff_location_id` with the corresponding borough information in the `taxi_zone_geom` table.
   - This method is more efficient and readable compared to using `IN` clauses with subqueries, as in the first query (`1result.sql`).

2. **Accurate Borough Matching:**
   - By joining the tables, the second query ensures that only the trips with both pickup and dropoff locations in Brooklyn are considered.
   - It avoids potential issues that might arise if there are any discrepancies or duplicates in the `zone_id` values when using subqueries.

3. **Consistency in Results:**
   - Both queries produce the same average trip duration, but the second query's approach is more standardized and preferred in SQL practices.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:
