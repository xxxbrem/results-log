After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct and preferred query.

**Reason:**

- **Clarity and Readability:** The query in `1result.sql` utilizes a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `gene_region` to calculate the minimum start position and maximum end position for the BRCA1 gene region. This approach improves the readability and organization of the query.

- **Accurate Computation:** It accurately computes the gene region by selecting the `MIN(start_position)` and `MAX(end_position)` from all variants where `vep_annotation.SYMBOL = 'BRCA1'`.

- **Correct Filtering:** The main query selects variants within the BRCA1 gene region (`start_position BETWEEN gene_region.min_start AND gene_region.max_end`) and filters for those where the `Consequence` includes `'missense_variant'`.

- **Proper Ordering:** It orders the `Protein_position` values numerically in ascending order using `CAST()` and `REGEXP_EXTRACT()` functions, ensuring accurate sorting even if the `Protein_position` contains strings like `'123/456'`.

- **Efficient and Standard Syntax:** The use of a CTE and standard `UNNEST` syntax makes the query efficient and aligns with best practices for querying nested and repeated fields in BigQuery.

**Output:**
