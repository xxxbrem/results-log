After carefully comparing both SQL scripts and their results, I have chosen `1result.sql` as the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Clarity and Structure:** `1result.sql` uses clear and descriptive names for the Common Table Expressions (CTEs), such as `Team_Points`, `Team_Season_Points`, `Season_Max_Points`, which improves readability and understanding of the query's flow.

- **Efficiency:** The query in `1result.sql` is streamlined with fewer nested CTEs, making it potentially more efficient in execution compared to `0result.sql`.

- **Accurate Calculation:** Both scripts correctly calculate the total points for each team per season by considering both home and away matches and correctly award 3 points for wins, 1 point for ties, and 0 points for losses.

- **Determining the Champion's League and Country:** Both scripts identify the primary league and country for each champion team by selecting the league in which the team played the most matches during the season. However, `1result.sql` achieves this with a clearer and more concise approach.

- **Identical Results:** The outputs from both scripts are the same, indicating that `1result.sql` accurately fulfills the task requirements.

**Selected SQL Script:**
