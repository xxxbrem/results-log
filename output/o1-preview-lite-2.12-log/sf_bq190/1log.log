Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve this task, we need to consider the relevant tables and columns.

**Relevant Table:**

- **`THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS`**

**Relevant Columns:**

- **`"age"`**: potential usage - to find the ages of users, helping us identify the youngest and oldest users.
- **`"gender"`**: potential usage - to filter users by male and female genders.
- **`"created_at"`**: potential usage - to filter users who were created between January 2019 and April 2022.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **`"gender" = 'Male'`** or **`"gender" = 'Female'`** to filter by gender.
- **`"created_at"`** between the timestamps corresponding to January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022, to filter users within the specified date range.

---

Here are 10 different Snowflake SQL queries to explore the data in the relevant columns:

1. **Select distinct genders from the USERS table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "gender"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select the range of user creation dates (`"created_at"`):**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("created_at") AS "Earliest_Creation", MAX("created_at") AS "Latest_Creation"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select distinct ages of users:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "age"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   ORDER BY "age"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Select users with `"gender"` = 'Male' and display their ages and creation dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "age", "created_at"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   WHERE "gender" = 'Male'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Select users with `"gender"` = 'Female' and display their ages and creation dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "age", "created_at"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   WHERE "gender" = 'Female'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Select users created between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022:**

   (Assuming `created_at` is a UNIX timestamp in seconds)

   ```sql
   SELECT "age", "gender", "created_at"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   WHERE "created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800 AND 1651276800
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Select male users created between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "age", "created_at"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   WHERE "gender" = 'Male' AND "created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800 AND 1651276800
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Select female users created between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "age", "created_at"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   WHERE "gender" = 'Female' AND "created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800 AND 1651276800
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Select distinct ages of male users within the date range:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "age"
   FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
   WHERE "gender" = 'Male' AND "created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800 AND 1651276800
   ORDER BY "age"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Select distinct ages of female users within the date range:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "age"
    FROM THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS
    WHERE "gender" = 'Female' AND "created_at" BETWEEN 1546300800 AND 1651276800
    ORDER BY "age"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: What is the count of the youngest and oldest users respectively for male and female users from January 2019 to April 2022?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Here is the count of the youngest and oldest users respectively for male and female users from January 2019 to April 2022:

```csv
Gender,Age_Type,Age,Count
Male,Youngest,age1:int,count1:int
Male,Oldest,age2:int,count2:int
Female,Youngest,age3:int,count3:int
Female,Oldest,age4:int,count4:int
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': {'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': ['DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS', 'EVENTS', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS', 'ORDERS', 'ORDER_ITEMS', 'PRODUCTS', 'USERS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 06:11:55 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the count of the youngest and oldest users respectively for male and female users from January 2019 to April 2022?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Here is the count of the youngest and oldest users respectively for male and female users from January 2019 to April 2022:

```csv
Gender,Age_Type,Age,Count

Male,Oldest,age2:int,count2:int
Female,Youngest,age3:int,count3:int
Female,Oldest,age4:int,count4:int
