    FROM "sales" AS s
    JOIN "products" AS p ON s."prod_id" = p."prod_id"
    JOIN "customers" AS cu ON s."cust_id" = cu."cust_id"
    JOIN "countries" AS co ON cu."country_id" = co."country_id"
    WHERE s."promo_id" = 999
      AND co."country_name" = 'United States'

Task: Among all products sold in the United States with promo_id=999, considering only those cities whose sales increased by at least 20% from Q4 2019 (calendar_quarter_id=1772) to Q4 2020 (calendar_quarter_id=1776), which product that ranks in the top 20% of total sales has the smallest percentage-point change in its share of total sales between these two quarters?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name,Percentage_Point_Change
product_name:str,change_in_percentage_points:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find this product, we considered all products sold in the United States with `promo_id=999`. We focused on cities where sales increased by at least 20% from Q4 2019 (`calendar_quarter_id=1772`) to Q4 2020 (`calendar_quarter_id=1776`). Among the products in the top 20% of total sales, we identified the one with the smallest change in its share of total sales between these two quarters..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is (table names): 
['countries', 'customers', 'promotions', 'products', 'times', 'channels', 'sales', 'costs', 'supplementary_demographics', 'currency']

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

To find this product, we considered all products sold in the United States with `promo_id=999`. We focused on cities where sales increased by at least 20% from Q4 2019 (`calendar_quarter_id=1772`) to Q4 2020 (`calendar_quarter_id=1776`). Among the products in the top 20% of total sales, we identified the one with the smallest change in its share of total sales between these two quarters. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
