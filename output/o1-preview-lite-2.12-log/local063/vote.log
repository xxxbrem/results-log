After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL that answers the task is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

The task requires identifying the product that:

- Is among the **top 20%** of products by total sales.
- Has the **smallest percentage-point change** (i.e., the change closest to zero, whether positive or negative) in its share of total sales between Q4 2019 and Q4 2020.
- Considers only sales in the United States (`country_name = 'United States of America'`).
- Focuses on cities where sales increased by at least **20%** from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020.
- Only includes sales with `promo_id = 999`.

**Analysis of the SQL Queries:**

1. **`0result.sql`**

   - Calculates the percentage-point change but orders the results by `Percentage_Point_Change` in ascending order without considering the absolute value.
   - This leads to selecting the product with the most negative change (largest decrease), which is **"Team shirt"** with a change of **-4.2458** percentage points.
   - It does not accurately identify the product with the smallest change closest to zero.

2. **`1result.sql`**

   - Calculates the percentage-point change in product shares between the two quarters.
   - Uses `ABS(psc.share_change)` to order products by the absolute value of their percentage-point change.
   - Selects the product with the smallest absolute percentage-point change, which accurately reflects the **smallest change in share**.
   - Identifies **"Pro Maple Youth Bat"** as the product with the smallest percentage-point change of **-0.7266**.
   - Correctly implements the requirement of finding the product in the top 20% of sales with the smallest change in share.

**Conclusion:**

- **`1result.sql`** correctly fulfills all the task requirements by accurately calculating and identifying the product with the smallest percentage-point change in its share of total sales between the two quarters.
- Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query.
