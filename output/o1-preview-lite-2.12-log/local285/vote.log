After reviewing and comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL for analyzing the financial performance over the years 2020 to 2023. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Calculation of Total Selling Price:**
   - **`2result.sql`** calculates the `Total_Selling_Price` by summing up the actual transaction amounts:
     ```sql
     SUM(t."unit_selling_px_rmb/kg" * t."qty_sold(kg)") AS "Total_Selling_Price"
     ```
     This method uses the actual selling prices and quantities from each transaction, providing an accurate total.

   - In contrast, **`1result.sql`** estimates the `Total_Selling_Price` by multiplying the average selling price per kilogram with the total quantity sold:
     ```sql
     SUM(c.total_qty_sold * c.avg_selling_price_per_kg) AS "Total_Selling_Price"
     ```
     This approach can introduce inaccuracies due to averaging.

2. **Calculation of Total Loss:**
   - **`2result.sql`** computes the `Total_Loss` in monetary terms by considering the wholesale price:
     ```sql
     SUM((whsle."Avg_Wholesale_Price" * txn."Total_Qty_Sold") * (loss."loss_rate_%" / 100)) AS "Total_Loss"
     ```
     This reflects the actual financial loss based on the cost price.

   - **`0result.sql`**, however, calculates `Total_Loss` as a quantity (in kg) rather than a monetary value:
     ```sql
     SUM(COALESCE(c."Total_Qty_Sold" * c."loss_rate_%" / 100, 0)) AS "Total_Loss"
     ```
     This does not accurately represent the financial impact of the loss.

3. **Use of Actual Data vs. Averages:**
   - **`2result.sql`** relies on actual data from transactions for both selling prices and quantities, ensuring precise calculations.
   - **`1result.sql`** uses average selling prices, which may not capture the variations and can lead to less accurate results.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Both **`2result.sql`** and **`1result.sql`** calculate profit by subtracting total costs and losses from the total selling price. However, **`2result.sql`** uses more accurate inputs for these calculations, leading to a more precise profit figure.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above points, **`2result.sql`** provides a more accurate and reliable analysis of the financial performance, as it utilizes actual transaction data and correctly calculates monetary values for loss and profit.
