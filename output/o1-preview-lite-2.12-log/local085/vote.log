After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, here's the analysis:

**Commonalities:**

- All three queries calculate the number of late orders and the late order percentage for each employee.
- They consider an order late if the `shippeddate` is on or after the `requireddate`.
- They only include employees who have more than 50 total orders (`HAVING COUNT(*) > 50` or `HAVING COUNT("orderid") > 50`).
- They order the results by `Late_Order_Percentage` in descending order and limit the output to the top three employees.

**Differences:**

1. **Use of `COUNT(*)` vs. `COUNT("orderid")`:**

   - **`0result.sql`** uses `COUNT("orderid")`:
     ```sql
     COUNT("orderid")
     ```
   - **`1result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** use `COUNT(*)`:
     ```sql
     COUNT(*)
     ```

2. **Calculation of `Late_Order_Percentage`:**

   - **`0result.sql`** uses `COUNT("orderid")` in the denominator:
     ```sql
     ROUND(SUM(...) * 100.0 / COUNT("orderid"), 4) AS "Late_Order_Percentage"
     ```
   - **`1result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** use `COUNT(*)` in the denominator:
     ```sql
     ROUND(SUM(...) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 4) AS "Late_Order_Percentage"
     ```

**Reasoning:**

- The `orders` table's `orderid` column is presumably a primary key and cannot be `NULL`, so `COUNT("orderid")` and `COUNT(*)` should return the same values.
- However, using `COUNT(*)` is generally preferred when counting all rows in a table because it is more explicit and unambiguous.
- Both `1result.sql` and `2result.sql` are identical in their queries and results.
- The results from all three queries are the same, indicating that the difference between `COUNT(*)` and `COUNT("orderid")` does not affect the outcome in this case.

**Conclusion:**

- **`1result.sql`** is the preferred choice because it uses `COUNT(*)`, which is more conventional and clear when counting all records.
- It provides the correct calculation for the late order percentage and follows best practices in SQL querying.
