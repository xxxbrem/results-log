Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task of listing the **three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest**, we need to identify which tables and columns are relevant.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"races"`
  - `"race_id"`: Used to join with driver_standings and constructor_standings.
  - `"year"`: Used to group by year.
  - `"round"`: Used to identify the last race of each year.
- **Table:** `"driver_standings"`
  - `"race_id"`: To join with races.
  - `"driver_id"`: To identify drivers.
  - `"points"`: Cumulative points of drivers up to that race.
- **Table:** `"constructor_standings"`
  - `"race_id"`: To join with races.
  - `"constructor_id"`: To identify constructors.
  - `"points"`: Cumulative points of constructors up to that race.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Find the last race of each year by selecting the race with the maximum `"round"` number for each `"year"`.
- Use the `"race_id"` of the last race to get the final cumulative `"points"` for drivers and constructors.
- Find the maximum `"points"` achieved by any driver and any constructor in each year.
- Sum the highest driver points and highest constructor points for each year.
- Identify the three years with the lowest sums.

Task: List the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Sum_of_Highest_Points
year1:int,sum1:float
year2:int,sum2:float
year3:int,sum3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

These are the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-28 04:41:32 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing List the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Sum_of_Highest_Points
year1:int,sum1:float
year2:int,sum2:float
year3:int,sum3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

These are the three years where the sum of the highest points achieved by any driver and any constructor was the lowest. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
