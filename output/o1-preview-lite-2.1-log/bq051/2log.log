2025-01-27 21:53:21 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of the `COUNT(*)` aggregate function without a corresponding `GROUP BY` clause for the `trip_date`. In SQL, when you select both aggregated and non-aggregated columns, you must include a `GROUP BY` clause for the non-aggregated columns.

Here's the corrected query with `GROUP BY trip_date` added to each subquery:

```sql
SELECT DATE(pickup_datetime) AS trip_date, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
GROUP BY trip_date

UNION ALL

SELECT DATE(pickup_datetime) AS trip_date, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_green_trips_2016`
GROUP BY trip_date

UNION ALL

SELECT DATE(pickup_datetime) AS trip_date, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_fhv_trips_2016`
GROUP BY trip_date

ORDER BY trip_date
LIMIT 100
```

**Explanation:**

- **Added `GROUP BY trip_date`**: This ensures that the `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of trips for each distinct date.
- **Ordered the results**: Included `ORDER BY trip_date` to sort the combined results by date.
- **Use of `UNION ALL`**: Combines the results from all three tables without eliminating duplicate rows (if any).

**Alternatively**, if you want to get the total number of trips per day across all three datasets combined, you can use subqueries or a common table expression (CTE). Here's how you can do it using a subquery:

```sql
SELECT trip_date, SUM(trip_count) AS total_trips
FROM (
  SELECT DATE(pickup_datetime) AS trip_date, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
  GROUP BY trip_date

  UNION ALL

  SELECT DATE(pickup_datetime) AS trip_date, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_green_trips_2016`
  GROUP BY trip_date

  UNION ALL

  SELECT DATE(pickup_datetime) AS trip_date, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_fhv_trips_2016`
  GROUP BY trip_date
) AS combined_trips
GROUP BY trip_date
ORDER BY trip_date
LIMIT 100
```

**Explanation of the alternative query:**

- **Subquery (`combined_trips`)**: Combines trip counts from all three tables for each date.
- **Outer query**: Aggregates the trip counts from the subquery to get the total trips per date.
- **`SUM(trip_count)`**: Calculates the total number of trips across all datasets for each date.
- **`GROUP BY trip_date`**: Groups the aggregated results by date.
- **`ORDER BY trip_date`**: Orders the final results by date.

**Note:** Adjust the `LIMIT` clause as needed to retrieve the desired number of rows.

1. **`ghcn_d.ghcnd_stations`**
   - `id`: Station ID - to identify weather stations.
   - `latitude`: Station latitude - to calculate proximity to the given coordinates.
   - `longitude`: Station longitude - to calculate proximity to the given coordinates.
   - `name`: Station name - for reference.
   - **Conditions**:
     - Filter stations within a certain latitude and longitude range.
     - Calculate the distance between stations and the specified coordinates to find the closest station.

   ```

6. **Identify rainy days (precipitation > 0.5 mm):**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ghcn_d.ghcnd_2016`
   WHERE id = 'USW00094728'  -- Replace with the actual closest station ID

Task: Get the average number of trips on rainy and non-rainy days in New York City during 2016, using data from the closest weather station located near the coordinates (longitude: -74.0060, latitude: 40.7128). Define a 'rainy day' as any day where the precipitation recorded is more than 0.5 millimeters.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
day_type,average_trips
Rainy,avg_rainy_trips:int
Non-rainy,avg_non_rainy_trips:int
```

To determine the average number of trips on rainy and non-rainy days in New York City during 2016, we first identified the closest weather station to the coordinates (-74.0060, 40.7128). We defined 'rainy days' as any day where the precipitation recorded at this station was more than 0.5 millimeters. Then, we calculated the total number of trips for each day in 2016 using the trip data, categorized the days into rainy and non-rainy based on the precipitation data, and computed the average number of trips for each category..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 21:57:08 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Get the average number of trips on rainy and non-rainy days in New York City during 2016, using data from the closest weather station located near the coordinates (longitude: -74.0060, latitude: 40.7128). Define a 'rainy day' as any day where the precipitation recorded is more than 0.5 millimeters., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
day_type,average_trips
Rainy,avg_rainy_trips:int
Non-rainy,avg_non_rainy_trips:int
```

To determine the average number of trips on rainy and non-rainy days in New York City during 2016, we first identified the closest weather station to the coordinates (-74.0060, 40.7128). We defined 'rainy days' as any day where the precipitation recorded at this station was more than 0.5 millimeters. Then, we calculated the total number of trips for each day in 2016 using the trip data, categorized the days into rainy and non-rainy based on the precipitation data, and computed the average number of trips for each category. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
