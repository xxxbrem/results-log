After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have concluded that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here's the reasoning:

### Comparison and Reasoning

1. **Structure and Readability:**

   - **`2result.sql`** uses a more streamlined approach by incorporating the session type classification (`Purchase` or `NonPurchase`) directly within the initial `sessions` CTE (Common Table Expression). This simplifies the query structure and makes it more readable.
   - **`1result.sql`** separates the sessions into purchase and non-purchase in separate CTEs (`purchase_sessions` and `nonpurchase_sessions`), which adds complexity without providing additional benefits.

2. **Efficiency:**

   - **`2result.sql`** efficiently calculates the average pageviews per visitor by grouping all data in a single step and using conditional aggregation in the final `SELECT` statement.
   - **`1result.sql`** performs separate aggregations for purchase and non-purchase sessions and then joins the results. This requires additional processing and can be less efficient, especially with large datasets.

3. **Results Consistency:**

   - Both queries produce the same results, as evidenced by the identical CSV outputs. However, achieving the same results with a simpler and more efficient query makes **`2result.sql`** the better choice.

4. **Use of CASE Statement and Conditional Aggregation:**

   - **`2result.sql`** effectively uses a `CASE` statement to classify sessions and conditional aggregation (`AVG(IF(...))`) to calculate the averages in a single query.
   - This method reduces the need for multiple joins and intermediate aggregations, leading to clearer and more maintainable code.

### Conclusion

Considering the above points, **`2result.sql`** is not only correct but also optimal in terms of efficiency and clarity.
