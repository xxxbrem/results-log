**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **"customers" table:**
  - **"CustomerId"**: To uniquely identify each customer and join with the "invoices" table.
  - **"Country"**: To determine the country of each customer, group customers by country, and count the number of customers per country.
  - **"FirstName", "LastName"**: For understanding customer identities (not directly used in calculations).

- **"invoices" table:**
  - **"InvoiceId"**: Unique identifier for each invoice.
  - **"CustomerId"**: To associate invoices with customers by joining with the "customers" table.
  - **"Total"**: The total amount of each invoice, representing sales made.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Only consider countries where the number of customers is greater than 4.
- Calculate total sales amounts associated with customers from these countries.
- Gather individual sales amounts to compute the median value.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all distinct countries from the "customers" table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Country"
   FROM "customers"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the number of customers in each country:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Country", COUNT("CustomerId") AS "NumCustomers"
   FROM "customers"
   GROUP BY "Country"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find countries with more than 4 customers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Country", COUNT("CustomerId") AS "NumCustomers"
   FROM "customers"
   GROUP BY "Country"
   HAVING COUNT("CustomerId") > 4
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List customer IDs and their countries where the country has more than 4 customers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "CustomerId", "Country"
   FROM "customers"
   WHERE "Country" IN (
     SELECT "Country"
     FROM "customers"
     GROUP BY "Country"
     HAVING COUNT("CustomerId") > 4
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List all invoices with their total amounts:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "InvoiceId", "CustomerId", "Total"
   FROM "invoices"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join "invoices" and "customers" to see invoices with customer countries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "invoices"."InvoiceId", "invoices"."Total", "customers"."Country"
   FROM "invoices"
   JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate total sales per country:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "customers"."Country", SUM("invoices"."Total") AS "TotalSales"
   FROM "invoices"
   JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
   GROUP BY "customers"."Country"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate total sales for countries with more than 4 customers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "customers"."Country", SUM("invoices"."Total") AS "TotalSales"
   FROM "invoices"
   JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
   WHERE "customers"."Country" IN (
     SELECT "Country"
     FROM "customers"
     GROUP BY "Country"
     HAVING COUNT("CustomerId") > 4
   )
   GROUP BY "customers"."Country"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List all sales amounts (Total) for countries with more than 4 customers:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "invoices"."Total", "customers"."Country"
   FROM "invoices"
   JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
   WHERE "customers"."Country" IN (
     SELECT "Country"
     FROM "customers"
     GROUP BY "Country"
     HAVING COUNT("CustomerId") > 4
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve all individual sales amounts to calculate the median later:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "invoices"."Total"
    FROM "invoices"
    JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
    WHERE "customers"."Country" IN (
      SELECT "Country"
      FROM "customers"
      GROUP BY "Country"
      HAVING COUNT("CustomerId") > 4
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Order total sales per country in descending order for countries with more than 4 customers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customers"."Country", SUM("invoices"."Total") AS "TotalSales"
    FROM "invoices"
    JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
    WHERE "customers"."Country" IN (
      SELECT "Country"
      FROM "customers"
      GROUP BY "Country"
      HAVING COUNT("CustomerId") > 4
    )
    GROUP BY "customers"."Country"
    ORDER BY "TotalSales" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Count the number of invoices per country with more than 4 customers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customers"."Country", COUNT("invoices"."InvoiceId") AS "NumInvoices"
    FROM "invoices"
    JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"

      HAVING COUNT("CustomerId") > 4
    )
    GROUP BY "customers"."Country"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Find the average sales amount per invoice for countries with more than 4 customers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customers"."Country", AVG("invoices"."Total") AS "AverageInvoiceTotal"
    FROM "invoices"
    JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
    WHERE "customers"."Country" IN (
      SELECT "Country"
      FROM "customers"
      GROUP BY "Country"
      HAVING COUNT("CustomerId") > 4
    )
    GROUP BY "customers"."Country"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List distinct customer IDs from countries with more than 4 customers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "CustomerId"
    FROM "customers"
    WHERE "Country" IN (
      SELECT "Country"
      FROM "customers"
      GROUP BY "Country"
      HAVING COUNT("CustomerId") > 4
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Retrieve invoice totals and dates for countries with more than 4 customers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "invoices"."Total", "invoices"."InvoiceDate", "customers"."Country"
    FROM "invoices"
    JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
    WHERE "customers"."Country" IN (
      SELECT "Country"
      FROM "customers"
      GROUP BY "Country"
      HAVING COUNT("CustomerId") > 4
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progress from simple selections and counts to more complex aggregations and joins. They help in understanding the data distribution, identifying relevant countries, and gathering the necessary sales amounts to compute the median value as required for the task.Query:

Task: Using the sales data, what is the median value of total sales made in countries where the number of customers is greater than 4?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Median_Total_Sales
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the median value of total sales made in countries where the number of customers is greater than 4, we need to:

1. **Identify Countries with More Than 4 Customers**: Query the `customers` table to find countries having more than 4 customers.

2. **Calculate Total Sales per Country**: For each of these countries, sum the `Total` from the `invoices` table for invoices associated with customers in that country.

3. **Compute the Median**: Collect the total sales figures for all qualifying countries and calculate the median value among them..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 18:58:03 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Using the sales data, what is the median value of total sales made in countries where the number of customers is greater than 4?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Median_Total_Sales
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the median value of total sales made in countries where the number of customers is greater than 4, we need to:

1. **Identify Countries with More Than 4 Customers**: Query the `customers` table to find countries having more than 4 customers.

2. **Calculate Total Sales per Country**: For each of these countries, sum the `Total` from the `invoices` table for invoices associated with customers in that country.

3. **Compute the Median**: Collect the total sales figures for all qualifying countries and calculate the median value among them. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
