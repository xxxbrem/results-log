**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **"customers"."CustomerId"**: Used to join with "invoices" table via "CustomerId".
- **"customers"."Country"**: Used to group customers by country and count the number of customers per country.
- **"invoices"."CustomerId"**: Used to join with "customers" table.
- **"invoices"."Total"**: Used to calculate total sales per country.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Group customers by **"Country"** and count the number of customers in each country.
- Filter countries where the number of customers is greater than 4.
- Join **"customers"** and **"invoices"** on **"CustomerId"**.
- Sum **"Total"** from **"invoices"** for invoices associated with customers in those countries.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all distinct countries from the "customers" table:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "Country" FROM "customers" LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **Count the number of customers per country:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Country", COUNT(*) AS "CustomerCount"
    FROM "customers"
    GROUP BY "Country"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **Find countries with more than 4 customers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "Country", COUNT(*) AS "CustomerCount"
    FROM "customers"
    GROUP BY "Country"
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 4
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **List customer IDs and their countries where the country has more than 4 customers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "CustomerId", "Country"
    FROM "customers"
    WHERE "Country" IN (
        SELECT "Country"
        FROM "customers"
        GROUP BY "Country"
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 4
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **List invoices with associated customer countries:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "InvoiceId", "Total", "customers"."Country"
    FROM "invoices"
    JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Sum total sales per country:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customers"."Country", SUM("invoices"."Total") AS "TotalSales"
    FROM "invoices"
    JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
    GROUP BY "customers"."Country"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Sum total sales per country where the country has more than 4 customers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customers"."Country", SUM("invoices"."Total") AS "TotalSales"
    FROM "invoices"
    JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
    WHERE "customers"."Country" IN (
        SELECT "Country"
        FROM "customers"
        GROUP BY "Country"
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 4
    )
    GROUP BY "customers"."Country"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. **Retrieve total sales amounts for countries with more than 4 customers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT SUM("invoices"."Total") AS "TotalSales"
    FROM "invoices"
    JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
    WHERE "customers"."Country" IN (
        SELECT "Country"
        FROM "customers"
        GROUP BY "Country"
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 4
    )
    GROUP BY "customers"."Country"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **List total sales per country along with customer count:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customers"."Country", COUNT("customers"."CustomerId") AS "CustomerCount", SUM("invoices"."Total") AS "TotalSales"
    FROM "invoices"
    JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
    GROUP BY "customers"."Country"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **Retrieve total sales per country ordered by total sales descending:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customers"."Country", SUM("invoices"."Total") AS "TotalSales"
    FROM "invoices"
    JOIN "customers" ON "invoices"."CustomerId" = "customers"."CustomerId"
    WHERE "customers"."Country" IN (
        SELECT "Country"
        FROM "customers"
        GROUP BY "Country"
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 4
    )
    GROUP BY "customers"."Country"
    ORDER BY "TotalSales" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in exploring the relevant data:

- **Queries 1-3:** Identify the countries and count the number of customers per country to find those with more than 4 customers.
- **Queries 4-5:** Explore customer and invoice data to understand how they relate.
- **Queries 6-10:** Calculate total sales per country, focusing on those countries with more than 4 customers, which is essential for computing the median total sales.

By using these queries, we can gather the necessary data to compute the median value of total sales made in countries where the number of customers is greater than 4.Query:

Task: Using the sales data, what is the median value of total sales made in countries where the number of customers is greater than 4?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Median_Total_Sales
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the median value of total sales made in countries where the number of customers is greater than 4, we need to:

1. **Identify Countries with More Than 4 Customers**: Query the `customers` table to find countries having more than 4 customers.

2. **Calculate Total Sales per Country**: For each of these countries, sum the `Total` from the `invoices` table for invoices associated with customers in that country.

3. **Compute the Median**: Collect the total sales figures for all qualifying countries and calculate the median value among them..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

3. **Compute the Median**: Collect the total sales figures for all qualifying countries and calculate the median value among them. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
