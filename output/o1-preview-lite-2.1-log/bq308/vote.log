After reviewing the SQL queries and their corresponding results, **I recommend selecting `1result.sql` as the correct SQL script**. Here are the reasons:

1. **Accurate Calculation of Answered Questions**: The query in `1result.sql` uses a subquery with the `EXISTS` clause to check if there's at least one answer posted **within one hour** after the question's creation time. This method ensures that only questions answered within the specified time frame are counted.

   ```sql
   CASE
     WHEN EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers` a
       WHERE a.parent_id = q.id
         AND a.creation_date BETWEEN q.creation_date AND TIMESTAMP_ADD(q.creation_date, INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
     ) THEN 1
     ELSE 0
   END AS answered_within_one_hour
   ```

2. **Avoiding Negative Time Differences**: In contrast, `0result.sql` calculates the minimum time difference between the question and its answers without ensuring that the answers occur **after** the question's creation time. This could lead to negative time differences if there are any data inconsistencies, unintentionally counting questions as answered within one hour when they were not.

3. **Consistent Question Counts**: The total number of questions asked each day of the week matches between `1result.sql` and `0result.sql`, indicating that both queries correctly account for all questions. However, `2result.sql` shows discrepancies in the question counts (e.g., the number of questions on Friday differs), suggesting potential issues with date formatting or time zone considerations.

4. **Correct Percentage Calculations**: The percentages in `1result.csv` are consistent with the counts provided. Since the calculation directly uses the sum of questions answered within one hour divided by the total questions, it provides an accurate percentage.

5. **Explicit Day Mapping**: The use of a `CASE` statement to map `day_of_week_num` to the actual day names ensures clarity and avoids any potential localization issues that could arise from formatting functions.

   ```sql
   CASE day_of_week_num
     WHEN 1 THEN 'Sunday'
     WHEN 2 THEN 'Monday'
     WHEN 3 THEN 'Tuesday'
     WHEN 4 THEN 'Wednesday'
     WHEN 5 THEN 'Thursday'
     WHEN 6 THEN 'Friday'
     WHEN 7 THEN 'Saturday'
   END AS Day_of_week
   ```

**Conclusion**:

`1result.sql` provides a more robust and accurate approach to determine the number of questions asked each day of the week and the number and percentage of those answered within one hour. It ensures that only valid answers (posted after the question and within the specified time frame) are counted.
