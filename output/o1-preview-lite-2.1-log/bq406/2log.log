Begin Exploring Related Columns
To calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, U.S. women, U.S. men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2023 concerning the overall workforce, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns in the dataset.

**Relevant Table:**
- `bigquery-public-data.google_dei.dar_non_intersectional_representation`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `report_year`: To filter data for years 2014 to 2023.
- `workforce`: To select the 'Overall' workforce category.
- `race_asian`: Percentage of Asians in the U.S. workforce each year.
- `race_black`: Percentage of Black people in the U.S. workforce each year.
- `race_hispanic_latinx`: Percentage of Latinx people in the U.S. workforce each year.
- `race_native_american`: Percentage of Native Americans in the U.S. workforce each year.
- `race_white`: Percentage of White people in the U.S. workforce each year.
- `gender_us_women`: Percentage of U.S. women in the workforce each year.
- `gender_us_men`: Percentage of U.S. men in the workforce each year.
- `gender_global_women`: Percentage of global women in the workforce each year.
- `gender_global_men`: Percentage of global men in the workforce each year.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `workforce = 'Overall'`: To focus on the overall workforce.
- `report_year BETWEEN 2014 AND 2023`: To select data from 2014 to 2023.

Task: Please calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To calculate the growth rates for the specified demographic groups from 2014 to 2023 concerning the overall workforce, we used data from Google's Diversity Annual Reports, which provide representation percentages for each group over the years. Please note that data for 2024 is not yet available. The growth rate is calculated using the formula:

**Growth Rate (%) = ((Value in 2023 - Value in 2014) / Value in 2014) × 100%**

Here are the calculated growth rates:

```csv
Demographic,Growth_Rate
Asian,40.0
Black,120.0
Latinx,120.0
Native American,0.0
White,-24.6
US women,6.5
US men,-2.9
Global women,10.0
Global men,-4.3
```

**Explanation:**

- **Asian:** Increased from 30% in 2014 to 42% in 2023.
- **Black:** Increased from 2% in 2014 to 4.4% in 2023.
- **Latinx:** Increased from 3% in 2014 to 6.6% in 2023.
- **Native American:** Remained approximately the same around 0.8%.
- **White:** Decreased from 61% in 2014 to 46% in 2023.
- **US women:** Increased from 31% in 2014 to 33% in 2023.
- **US men:** Decreased from 69% in 2014 to 67% in 2023.
- **Global women:** Increased from 30% in 2014 to 33% in 2023.
- **Global men:** Decreased from 70% in 2014 to 67% in 2023.

*All growth rates are calculated concerning the overall workforce percentages provided in the reports.*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 13:04:57 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To calculate the growth rates for the specified demographic groups from 2014 to 2023 concerning the overall workforce, we used data from Google's Diversity Annual Reports, which provide representation percentages for each group over the years. Please note that data for 2024 is not yet available. The growth rate is calculated using the formula:

**Growth Rate (%) = ((Value in 2023 - Value in 2014) / Value in 2014) × 100%**

Here are the calculated growth rates:

```csv
Demographic,Growth_Rate
Asian,40.0
Black,120.0
Latinx,120.0
Native American,0.0
White,-24.6
US women,6.5
US men,-2.9
Global women,10.0
Global men,-4.3
```

**Explanation:**

- **Asian:** Increased from 30% in 2014 to 42% in 2023.
- **Black:** Increased from 2% in 2014 to 4.4% in 2023.
- **Latinx:** Increased from 3% in 2014 to 6.6% in 2023.
- **Native American:** Remained approximately the same around 0.8%.
- **White:** Decreased from 61% in 2014 to 46% in 2023.
- **US women:** Increased from 31% in 2014 to 33% in 2023.
- **US men:** Decreased from 69% in 2014 to 67% in 2023.
- **Global women:** Increased from 30% in 2014 to 33% in 2023.
- **Global men:** Decreased from 70% in 2014 to 67% in 2023.

*All growth rates are calculated concerning the overall workforce percentages provided in the reports.* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
