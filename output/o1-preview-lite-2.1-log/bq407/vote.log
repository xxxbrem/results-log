After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I recommend using **`1result.sql`** for the analysis. Here's the reasoning:

**Comparison of the SQL Queries:**

1. **Data Source:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses the `confirmed_cases` and `deaths` tables, which have dates as column names (e.g., `_2020_08_27`).
   - **`1result.sql`** uses the `summary` table, which organizes data with a `date` field.

2. **Flexibility and Best Practices:**
   - Using the `summary` table in **`1result.sql`** is a better practice because it treats dates as data rather than column names. This approach:
     - Simplifies querying for specific dates.
     - Makes the query more adaptable to other dates without altering the SQL structure.
   - **`0result.sql`** requires specifying the date in the column name, which is less flexible and not ideal for time-series data.

3. **Accuracy and Results:**
   - Both queries produce the same top three counties with similar results.
   - **`1result.sql`** calculates the case fatality rate using `NULLIF` to avoid division by zero, which is a good practice.

4. **Readability and Maintenance:**
   - **`1result.sql`** is more readable and easier to maintain, especially if the analysis needs to be repeated for different dates.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above points, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query to use for this analysis.
