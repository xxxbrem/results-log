To provide the percentage of participants diagnosed with acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and vitiligo (ICD-10-CM codes L70, L20, L40, L80, including subcategories), we'll use the `cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop` dataset in BigQuery.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.person`
   - `person_id`: Identifier for each participant (used to determine the total number of participants).

2. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.condition_occurrence`
   - `person_id`: Links each condition occurrence to a participant.
   - `condition_source_value`: Contains the ICD-10-CM codes for conditions (used to identify participants with specific conditions).
   - `condition_start_date`: Date when the condition was recorded (could be used for time-based analyses).

**Conditions to be Used:**

- **Acne:** `condition_source_value` LIKE 'L70%'
- **Atopic Dermatitis:** `condition_source_value` LIKE 'L20%'
- **Psoriasis:** `condition_source_value` LIKE 'L40%'
- **Vitiligo:** `condition_source_value` LIKE 'L80%'

Task: Could you provide the percentage of participants for standard acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and vitiligo defined by the International Classification of Diseases 10-CM(ICD-10-CM), including their subcategories? The ICD-10 codes are: Acne (L70), Atopic dermatitis (L20), Psoriasis (L40), and Vitiligo (L80). 

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the percentage of participants diagnosed with acne (L70), atopic dermatitis (L20), psoriasis (L40), and vitiligo (L80), including their subcategories as defined by ICD-10-CM codes, we would perform the following steps using SQL queries on the `cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop` dataset:

1. **Calculate the total number of unique participants**:
   - Query the `person` table to count the distinct `person_id`s.
   
2. **Identify participants with each condition**:
   - Query the `condition_occurrence` table.
   - Filter the `condition_source_value` column for codes that start with the specified ICD-10 codes to include all subcategories (e.g., 'L70%', 'L20%', 'L40%', 'L80%').
   - Retrieve the distinct `person_id`s associated with each condition.

3. **Calculate the number of participants for each condition**:
   - Count the number of unique `person_id`s identified for each condition group.

4. **Compute the percentage for each condition**:
   - Divide the number of participants with each condition by the total number of participants.
   - Multiply the result by 100 to obtain the percentage.

Since we do not have the actual data values, we cannot provide the exact percentages. However, the final results would be presented in the following format:

```csv
Condition,Percentage_of_participants
Acne,percentage:0<=float<=100
Atopic dermatitis,percentage:0<=float<=100
Psoriasis,percentage:0<=float<=100
Vitiligo,percentage:0<=float<=100
```

This table represents the percentage of participants diagnosed with each condition, including all their subcategories, based on the specified ICD-10-CM codes..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['hcpcs', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd10_procedures_2019', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['home_health_agencies_2013', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'hospital_general_info', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['care_site', 'concept', 'concept_ancestor', 'concept_class', 'concept_relationship', 'condition_era', 'condition_occurrence', 'cost', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'domain', 'dose_era', 'drug_era', 'drug_exposure', 'drug_strength', 'location', 'observation', 'observation_period', 'payer_plan_period', 'person', 'procedure_occurrence', 'provider', 'relationship', 'vocabulary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 04:57:38 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide the percentage of participants for standard acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and vitiligo defined by the International Classification of Diseases 10-CM(ICD-10-CM), including their subcategories? The ICD-10 codes are: Acne (L70), Atopic dermatitis (L20), Psoriasis (L40), and Vitiligo (L80). , reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the percentage of participants diagnosed with acne (L70), atopic dermatitis (L20), psoriasis (L40), and vitiligo (L80), including their subcategories as defined by ICD-10-CM codes, we would perform the following steps using SQL queries on the `cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop` dataset:

1. **Calculate the total number of unique participants**:
   - Query the `person` table to count the distinct `person_id`s.
   
2. **Identify participants with each condition**:
   - Query the `condition_occurrence` table.
   - Filter the `condition_source_value` column for codes that start with the specified ICD-10 codes to include all subcategories (e.g., 'L70%', 'L20%', 'L40%', 'L80%').
   - Retrieve the distinct `person_id`s associated with each condition.

3. **Calculate the number of participants for each condition**:
   - Count the number of unique `person_id`s identified for each condition group.

4. **Compute the percentage for each condition**:
   - Divide the number of participants with each condition by the total number of participants.
   - Multiply the result by 100 to obtain the percentage.

Since we do not have the actual data values, we cannot provide the exact percentages. However, the final results would be presented in the following format:

```csv

2025-01-24 04:58:25 - root - INFO - To determine the percentage of participants diagnosed with acne (L70), atopic dermatitis (L20), psoriasis (L40), and vitiligo (L80), including their subcategories as defined by ICD-10-CM codes, we need to adjust for the coding system used in the dataset. The `condition_source_value` in the `cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.condition_occurrence` table contains **ICD-9-CM codes**, so we'll map the ICD-10-CM codes to their corresponding ICD-9-CM codes.

**Mapping of ICD-10-CM codes to ICD-9-CM codes:**

- **Acne:**
  - ICD-10-CM code: **L70**
  - Corresponding ICD-9-CM codes: **706.0** to **706.9** (Acne)
- **Atopic Dermatitis:**
  - ICD-10-CM code: **L20**
  - Corresponding ICD-9-CM codes: **691.0** to **691.9** (Atopic Dermatitis and related conditions)
- **Psoriasis:**
  - ICD-10-CM code: **L40**
  - Corresponding ICD-9-CM codes: **696.0** to **696.9** (Psoriasis and similar disorders)
- **Vitiligo:**
  - ICD-10-CM code: **L80**
  - Corresponding ICD-9-CM code: **709.01** (Vitiligo)

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the total number of unique participants:**
   - Query the `person` table to count the distinct `person_id`s.

2. **Identify participants with each condition:**
   - Query the `condition_occurrence` table.
   - Filter the `condition_source_value` column for codes that start with the specified ICD-9-CM codes to include all subcategories (e.g., `'706%'`, `'691%'`, `'696%'`, `'709%'`).
   - Retrieve the distinct `person_id`s associated with each condition.

3. **Calculate the number of participants for each condition:**
   - Count the number of unique `person_id`s identified for each condition group.

4. **Compute the percentage for each condition:**
   - Divide the number of participants with each condition by the total number of participants.
   - Multiply the result by 100 to obtain the percentage.
   - **Keep all decimals to four decimal places**.

This SQL query calculates the percentage of participants diagnosed with each condition by:

- Counting the distinct `person_id`s for each condition based on the mapped ICD-9-CM codes.
- Calculating the total number of participants from the `person` table.
- Computing the percentage for each condition.
- Rounding the percentages to four decimal places.
- Ordering the results by the condition name.

The final output will have the following columns and values (assuming the percentages provided are accurate):

```csv

Acne,6.7944
Atopic dermatitis,2.6481
Psoriasis,6.2877
Vitiligo,14.2932

1. **Calculate the total number of unique participants**:
   - Query the `person` table to count the distinct `person_id`s.
       
2. **Identify participants with each condition**:
   - Use the `condition_occurrence` table.
   - The `condition_concept_id` in `condition_occurrence` links to the `concept` table.
   - Join `condition_occurrence` with `concept` on `condition_concept_id = concept_id`.
   - Filter the `concept_code` column in the `concept` table for codes that start with the specified ICD-10-CM codes to include all subcategories (e.g., `'L70%'`, `'L20%'`, `'L40%'`, `'L80%'`).
    
3. **Calculate the number of participants for each condition**:
   - Count the number of unique `person_id`s identified for each condition group.

4. **Compute the percentage for each condition**:
   - Divide the number of participants with each condition by the total number of participants.
   - Multiply the result by 100 to obtain the percentage.
   - **Keep all decimals to four decimal places**.

Since we are using ICD-10-CM codes and the `condition_source_value` in the `condition_occurrence` table contains ICD-9-CM codes, we'll utilize the `concept` and `concept_relationship` tables to map and retrieve conditions based on ICD-10-CM codes.

**Final SQL Query:**

  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT person_id) AS total
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.person`
),
icd10_concepts AS (

    ON icd10.concept_id = cr.concept_id_1
    AND cr.relationship_id = 'Mapped from'
  JOIN `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.concept` c
    ON cr.concept_id_2 = c.concept_id
),
condition_counts AS (
  SELECT
    CASE
      WHEN mc.concept_code LIKE 'L70%' THEN 'Acne'
      WHEN mc.concept_code LIKE 'L20%' THEN 'Atopic dermatitis'
      WHEN mc.concept_code LIKE 'L40%' THEN 'Psoriasis'
      WHEN mc.concept_code LIKE 'L80%' THEN 'Vitiligo'
    END AS condition,
    COUNT(DISTINCT co.person_id) AS participants_count
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.condition_occurrence` co
  JOIN mapped_concepts mc
    ON co.condition_source_concept_id = mc.source_concept_id
  GROUP BY condition
)
SELECT
  condition,
  ROUND((participants_count / tp.total) * 100, 4) AS Percentage_of_participants
FROM condition_counts
CROSS JOIN total_participants tp
ORDER BY condition;
```

This query performs the following operations:

- **Maps ICD-10-CM codes to source concept IDs**:
  - Retrieves the `concept_id`s for the specified ICD-10-CM codes from the `concept` table.
  - Uses the `concept_relationship` table to find the mappings to `condition_source_concept_id`s used in `condition_occurrence`.
  
- **Counts the number of participants for each condition**:
  - Joins the `condition_occurrence` table with the mapped concepts to filter conditions based on ICD-10-CM codes.
  - Counts distinct `person_id`s for each condition.
  
- **Calculates the percentage of participants**:
  - Divides the participants count by the total number of participants.
  - Multiplies by 100 and rounds to four decimal places.

**Note**: The mapping via the `concept_relationship` table is essential because the `condition_source_value` may contain ICD-9-CM codes, but by mapping the ICD-10-CM codes to `condition_source_concept_id`s, we ensure accurate retrieval of conditions.

This query will produce a result in the following format:

```csv
condition,Percentage_of_participants
Acne,percentage:0<=float<=100
Atopic dermatitis,percentage:0<=float<=100
Psoriasis,percentage:0<=float<=100
Vitiligo,percentage:0<=float<=100
```

This output represents the percentage of participants diagnosed with each condition, including all their subcategories, based on the specified ICD-10-CM codes.

2025-01-24 05:00:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide the percentage of participants for standard acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and vitiligo defined by the International Classification of Diseases 10-CM(ICD-10-CM), including their subcategories? The ICD-10 codes are: Acne (L70), Atopic dermatitis (L20), Psoriasis (L40), and Vitiligo (L80). , reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the percentage of participants diagnosed with acne (L70), atopic dermatitis (L20), psoriasis (L40), and vitiligo (L80), including their subcategories as defined by ICD-10-CM codes, we would perform the following steps using SQL queries on the `cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop` dataset:

1. **Calculate the total number of unique participants**:
   - Query the `person` table to count the distinct `person_id`s.
   
2. **Identify participants with each condition**:
   - Query the `condition_occurrence` table.
   - Filter the `condition_source_value` column for codes that start with the specified ICD-10 codes to include all subcategories (e.g., 'L70%', 'L20%', 'L40%', 'L80%').
   - Retrieve the distinct `person_id`s associated with each condition.

3. **Calculate the number of participants for each condition**:
   - Count the number of unique `person_id`s identified for each condition group.

4. **Compute the percentage for each condition**:
   - Divide the number of participants with each condition by the total number of participants.
   - Multiply the result by 100 to obtain the percentage.

Since we do not have the actual data values, we cannot provide the exact percentages. However, the final results would be presented in the following format:

```csv
Condition,Percentage_of_participants
Acne,percentage:0<=float<=100
Atopic dermatitis,percentage:0<=float<=100
Psoriasis,percentage:0<=float<=100
Vitiligo,percentage:0<=float<=100
```

This table represents the percentage of participants diagnosed with each condition, including all their subcategories, based on the specified ICD-10-CM codes. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
