After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that `2result.sql` is the correct choice. Here's the reasoning:

- **Median Calculation Precision**: In `2result.sql`, the `APPROX_QUANTILES` function is called with `number_of_quantiles` set to **1001**, which ensures that the median (50th percentile) is accurately represented at `OFFSET(500)`. This is because with 1001 quantiles, the median falls exactly in the middle of the quantiles array.

  - The median position is calculated as `(number_of_quantiles - 1) / 2`, which for 1001 quantiles is `(1001 - 1) / 2 = 500`.

- In contrast, `1result.sql` uses `number_of_quantiles` set to **1000**, resulting in an even number of quantiles. This makes the true median fall between two quantiles, potentially reducing the accuracy of the median calculation, since `(1000 - 1) / 2 = 499.5`.

- **Consistency in Results**: The differences calculated in `2result.sql` are slightly more precise due to the accurate median positioning. This small difference can impact the rankings when determining the years with the smallest absolute differences.

- **Alignment with Statistical Best Practices**: Using an odd number of quantiles is a common practice when calculating medians to ensure the median value corresponds to an actual data point rather than falling between two data points.

Therefore, `2result.sql` provides a more accurate and reliable calculation of the median values and the resulting differences.
