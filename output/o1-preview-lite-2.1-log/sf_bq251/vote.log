After reviewing the provided SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL that fulfills the requirements is **`2result.sql`**.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Task:**
   - **Objective:** Find the **GitHub URL** of the Python package that has the **highest number of downloads on PyPI** and was **updated most recently**.
   - **Constraints:** Only the main repository URL should be provided, excluding specific subsections like issues, blobs, pull requests, or tree views.

2. **Analyzing the SQL Queries and Results:**

   - **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**

     ```sql
     SELECT pu.value::STRING AS "GitHub_URL"
     FROM (
         SELECT fd."project", COUNT(*) AS "download_count", MAX(dm."upload_time") AS "latest_upload_time"
         FROM PYPI.PYPI.FILE_DOWNLOADS fd
         JOIN PYPI.PYPI.DISTRIBUTION_METADATA dm ON fd."project" = dm."name"
         GROUP BY fd."project"
     ) stats
     JOIN PYPI.PYPI.DISTRIBUTION_METADATA dm ON stats."project" = dm."name"
     JOIN LATERAL FLATTEN(input => dm."project_urls") pu
     WHERE pu.value::STRING ILIKE '%github.com%'
       AND pu.value::STRING NOT ILIKE '%/issues%'
       AND pu.value::STRING NOT ILIKE '%/blob%'
       AND pu.value::STRING NOT ILIKE '%/pulls%'
       AND pu.value::STRING NOT ILIKE '%/tree%'
     ORDER BY stats."download_count" DESC NULLS LAST, stats."latest_upload_time" DESC NULLS LAST
     LIMIT 1;
     ```

     **Result:**

     ```
     GitHub_URL
     "Source, https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/"
     ```

     - **Analysis:**
       - The result points to the **`cryptography`** package.
       - The URL includes a label **"Source, "**, which may not be desired.
       - The URL ends with a slash **"/"**, but this is acceptable.
       - **`cryptography`** has one of the highest download counts and recent updates.

   - **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`):**

     ```sql
     WITH download_counts AS (
         SELECT
             "project",
             COUNT(*) AS "download_count"
         FROM PYPI.PYPI.FILE_DOWNLOADS
         GROUP BY "project"
     ),
     latest_uploads AS (
         SELECT
             "name",
             MAX("upload_time") AS "latest_upload_time",
             "project_urls"
         FROM PYPI.PYPI.DISTRIBUTION_METADATA
         GROUP BY "name", "project_urls"
     ),
     project_info AS (
         SELECT
             dc."project",
             dc."download_count",
             lu."latest_upload_time",
             lu."project_urls"
         FROM download_counts dc
         JOIN latest_uploads lu
             ON dc."project" = lu."name"
     ),
     parsed_urls AS (
         SELECT
             pi."project",
             pi."download_count",
             pi."latest_upload_time",
             SPLIT_PART(f.value::STRING, ', ', 2) AS "url"
         FROM project_info pi,
              LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => TRY_PARSE_JSON(pi."project_urls")) f
         WHERE (f.value::STRING LIKE 'Repository,%' OR f.value::STRING LIKE 'Source,%')
               AND f.value::STRING IS NOT NULL
     ),
     filtered_urls AS (
         SELECT
             "project",
             "download_count",
             "latest_upload_time",
             "url"
         FROM parsed_urls
         WHERE "url" LIKE 'https://github.com/%'
           AND NOT (
               "url" ILIKE '%/issues%' OR
               "url" ILIKE '%/blob/%' OR
               "url" ILIKE '%/pull/%' OR
               "url" ILIKE '%/tree/%' OR
               "url" ILIKE '%/wiki%'
           )
     )
     SELECT
         "url" AS "GitHub_URL"
     FROM filtered_urls
     ORDER BY "download_count" DESC, "latest_upload_time" DESC NULLS LAST
     LIMIT 1;
     ```

     **Result:**

     ```
     GitHub_URL
     https://github.com/pypa/wheel
     ```

     - **Analysis:**
       - The result points to the **`wheel`** package.
       - While **`wheel`** is a widely used package, it has **lower download counts** compared to **`cryptography`**.
       - Additionally, its **latest upload time** may not be as recent as other top packages.

   - **Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):**

     ```sql
     SELECT "url"
     FROM (
         SELECT ps."project", ps."download_count", ps."latest_upload_time", SPLIT_PART(f.value::STRING, ', ', 2) AS "url"
         FROM (
             SELECT fd."project", COUNT(*) AS "download_count", MAX(dm."upload_time") AS "latest_upload_time", MAX(dm."project_urls") AS "project_urls"
             FROM "PYPI"."PYPI"."FILE_DOWNLOADS" fd
             JOIN "PYPI"."PYPI"."DISTRIBUTION_METADATA" dm ON fd."project" = dm."name"
             GROUP BY fd."project"
         ) ps, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => ps."project_urls") f
         WHERE SPLIT_PART(f.value::STRING, ', ', 2) ILIKE '%github.com%'
     )
     WHERE REGEXP_LIKE("url", '^https?://github\.com/[^/]+/[^/]+/?$')
     ORDER BY "download_count" DESC NULLS LAST, "latest_upload_time" DESC NULLS LAST
     LIMIT 1;
     ```

     **Result:**

     ```
     url
     https://github.com/pyca/cryptography
     ```

     - **Analysis:**
       - The result is the GitHub URL for **`cryptography`**, matching the main repository URL without additional labels.
       - **`cryptography`** has one of the **highest number of downloads** on PyPI.
       - It was also **updated recently**, satisfying the "updated most recently" criterion.
       - The URL excludes subsections like issues, blobs, pull requests, or tree views.

3. **Conclusion:**

   - **Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`)** provides the correct GitHub URL for the package that meets both criteria: **highest downloads** and **most recently updated**.
   - The URL is clean and points directly to the **main repository** without any unwanted subsections or labels.
   - Therefore, **`2result.sql`** is the appropriate choice.
