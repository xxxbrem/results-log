Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine how many customers were in each spending group in 1998 and what percentage of the total customer base each group represents, we'll identify the relevant tables, columns, and conditions, and then construct SQL queries to understand the data.

**Relevant Tables, Columns, and Potential Usage:**

- **customers**
  - **customerid**: Used to identify unique customers.
- **orders**
  - **orderid**: Used to link orders to order details.
  - **customerid**: Links orders to customers.
  - **orderdate**: Used to filter orders placed in 1998.
- **order_details**
  - **orderid**: Links order details to orders.
  - **unitprice**: Used to calculate the total price per item.
  - **quantity**: Used to calculate the total quantity ordered.
  - **discount**: Used to calculate the discounted price.
- **customergroupthreshold**
  - **groupname**: Names of spending groups.
  - **rangebottom**: Lower bound of spending threshold.
  - **rangetop**: Upper bound of spending threshold.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filter orders to those placed in 1998:
  - `orders.orderdate BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31'`
- Calculate total spending per customer in 1998.
- Assign customers to spending groups based on total spending.

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

```sql
-- 1. List all customer IDs
SELECT DISTINCT customerid FROM customers LIMIT 100;

-- 2. List all orders with their dates
SELECT orderid, customerid, orderdate FROM orders LIMIT 100;

-- 3. List orders placed in 1998
SELECT orderid, customerid, orderdate FROM orders
WHERE orderdate BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31' LIMIT 100;

-- 4. List order details for orders placed in 1998
SELECT od.orderid, od.productid, od.unitprice, od.quantity, od.discount
FROM order_details od
JOIN orders o ON od.orderid = o.orderid
WHERE o.orderdate BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31' LIMIT 100;

-- 5. Calculate total price for each order detail in 1998
SELECT od.orderid,
       od.unitprice, od.quantity, od.discount,
       od.unitprice * od.quantity * (1 - od.discount) AS total_price
FROM order_details od
JOIN orders o ON od.orderid = o.orderid
WHERE o.orderdate BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31' LIMIT 100;

-- 6. Calculate total spending per order in 1998
SELECT od.orderid,
       SUM(od.unitprice * od.quantity * (1 - od.discount)) AS order_total
FROM order_details od
JOIN orders o ON od.orderid = o.orderid
WHERE o.orderdate BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31'
GROUP BY od.orderid LIMIT 100;

-- 7. Calculate total spending per customer in 1998
SELECT o.customerid,
       SUM(od.unitprice * od.quantity * (1 - od.discount)) AS customer_total
FROM order_details od
JOIN orders o ON od.orderid = o.orderid
WHERE o.orderdate BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31'
GROUP BY o.customerid LIMIT 100;

-- 8. List spending group thresholds
SELECT groupname, rangebottom, rangetop FROM customergroupthreshold LIMIT 100;

-- 9. Assign customers to spending groups based on their total spending in 1998
SELECT c.customerid, c.customer_total, g.groupname
FROM (
  SELECT o.customerid,
         SUM(od.unitprice * od.quantity * (1 - od.discount)) AS customer_total
  FROM order_details od
  JOIN orders o ON od.orderid = o.orderid
  WHERE o.orderdate BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31'
  GROUP BY o.customerid
) c
JOIN customergroupthreshold g
  ON c.customer_total BETWEEN g.rangebottom AND g.rangetop
LIMIT 100;

-- 10. Count the number of customers in each spending group in 1998
SELECT g.groupname,
       COUNT(DISTINCT c.customerid) AS number_of_customers
FROM (
  SELECT o.customerid,
         SUM(od.unitprice * od.quantity * (1 - od.discount)) AS customer_total
  FROM order_details od
  JOIN orders o ON od.orderid = o.orderid
  WHERE o.orderdate BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31'
  GROUP BY o.customerid
) c
JOIN customergroupthreshold g
  ON c.customer_total BETWEEN g.rangebottom AND g.rangetop
GROUP BY g.groupname
LIMIT 100;
```

These queries progressively build up our understanding:

1. Retrieve all unique customer IDs to know the customer base.
2. Get a list of all orders with their dates to see the overall order data.
3. Filter orders to those placed in 1998.
4. Get order details for orders in 1998 to see items purchased.
5. Calculate the total price for each order detail, accounting for discounts.
6. Sum up the total spending for each order in 1998.
7. Calculate total spending per customer in 1998.
8. Retrieve spending group thresholds to understand group boundaries.
9. Assign each customer to a spending group based on their total spending.
10. Count the number of customers in each group to answer the original task.

By running these queries, we gain insights into customer spending patterns necessary to compute the number of customers in each spending group and the percentage they represent of the total customer base.Query:

Task: How many customers were in each spending group in 1998, and what percentage of the total customer base does each group represent?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
GroupName,Number_of_Customers,Percentage_of_Total_Customers
groupname:str,number:int,percentage:0<=float<=100
...
```

To determine the number of customers in each spending group for 1998 and the percentage they represent of the total customer base, we first calculate the total spending of each customer in 1998 by summing the order amounts from the `orders` and `order_details` tables. We then map these totals to the appropriate spending groups defined in the `customergroupthreshold` table. Finally, we count the number of customers in each group and calculate their percentage of the total customer base..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

To determine the number of customers in each spending group for 1998 and the percentage they represent of the total customer base, we first calculate the total spending of each customer in 1998 by summing the order amounts from the `orders` and `order_details` tables. We then map these totals to the appropriate spending groups defined in the `customergroupthreshold` table. Finally, we count the number of customers in each group and calculate their percentage of the total customer base. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
