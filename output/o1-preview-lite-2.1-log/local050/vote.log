After analyzing the three SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is **2result.sql**. Here's why:

- **Candidate 0 (0result.sql)** calculates the median of the average **amount sold per sale**, which results in a small median value of approximately **112.42 USD**. This does not represent the total average monthly sales.

- **Candidate 1 (1result.sql)** attempts to calculate growth rates between 2019 and 2020 and projects the sales to 2021. However, the median value obtained is approximately **59.67 USD**, which again seems too low to represent average monthly sales totals.

- **Candidate 2 (2result.sql)** correctly calculates the **average total sales per month** for France in 2019 and 2020, projects these averages into 2021, and then finds the median of these projected monthly sales in USD. The median value obtained is approximately **76,556.25 USD**, which is a realistic figure representing the median of average monthly projected sales.

Therefore, **2result.sql** is the correct SQL query as it aligns with the task of finding the median value from average monthly projected sales in USD for France in 2021 using data from 2019 and 2020.
