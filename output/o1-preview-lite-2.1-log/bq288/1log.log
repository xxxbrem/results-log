  description=""The legal/statistical area description (LSAD) codes describe the particular typology for each geographic entity. For legal entities, the LSAD reflects the term that appears in legal documentation pertaining to the entity, such as a treaty, charter, legislation, resolution, or ordinance. For statistical entities, the LSAD is the term assigned by the Census Bureau or other agency defining the entity. The LSAD code is a two-character field that corresponds to a description of the legal or statistical type of entity and identifies whether the LSAD term should be capitalized and should precede or follow the name of the geographic entity. Note that the same LSAD code is assigned to entities at different levels of the geographic hierarchy when they share the same LSAD. For example, the Census Bureau assigns the same LSAD code (\""21\"") to boroughs in New York and Connecticut, although they are county subdivisions in the former and incorporated places in the latter.\n\nThese codes can be found in the TIGER/Line products, gazetteer files, and other products.

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
  - **Columns and Potential Usage:**
    - `institution_name`: To identify institutions whose names start with 'Bank'.
    - `established_date`: To filter institutions established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000.
    - `total_assets`: To calculate the sum of assets for each state.
    - `state`: To group institutions by state and identify the state with the highest sum of assets.
    - `fdic_certificate_number`: To count the total number of banking institutions.
    - `active`: To consider only active institutions if needed.

**Conditions to be Used:**

- `institution_name` starts with 'Bank':
  - `institution_name LIKE 'Bank%'`
- `established_date` between '1900-01-01' and '2000-12-31':
  - `established_date BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'`
- Grouping by `state` to sum assets and count institutions.

   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE `established_date` BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   ORDER BY `established_date`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find institutions starting with 'Bank' and established in the specified date range:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `institution_name`, `established_date`, `state`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE `institution_name` LIKE 'Bank%'
     AND `established_date` BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   ORDER BY `established_date`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate total assets of banks starting with 'Bank', established in the date range, grouped by state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `state`, SUM(`total_assets`) AS total_assets
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE `institution_name` LIKE 'Bank%'
     AND `established_date` BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   GROUP BY `state`
   ORDER BY total_assets DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List the top 5 states by total assets from the previous query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `state`, SUM(`total_assets`) AS total_assets
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE `institution_name` LIKE 'Bank%'
     AND `established_date` BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   GROUP BY `state`
   ORDER BY total_assets DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

7. **Count the total number of banking institutions in a specific state (replace 'CA' with the desired state code):**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`) AS total_institutions
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE `state` = 'CA'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find all institutions in the state with the highest total assets (e.g., 'TX'):**

   ```sql
   SELECT `institution_name`, `fdic_certificate_number`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
   WHERE `state` = 'TX'
   LIMIT 100;

      AND `active` = TRUE
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Sum total assets of all institutions per state regardless of name and date:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `state`, SUM(`total_assets`) AS total_assets
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
    GROUP BY `state`
    ORDER BY total_assets DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List institutions with missing total assets data:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `institution_name`, `state`, `total_assets`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`
    WHERE `total_assets` IS NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find the number of institutions per state established after the year 2000:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `state`, COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`) AS institutions_post_2000
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.institutions`

    GROUP BY `state`
    ORDER BY institutions_post_2000 DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries explore different aspects of the data to understand which state has the highest sum of assets from banks established between 1900 and 2000 with names starting with 'Bank', and the total number of banking institutions in that state.Query:

Task: What is the total number of all banking institutions in the state that has the highest sum of assets from banks established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000, with institution names starting with 'Bank'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
State,Total_Number_of_Banking_Institutions
state_name:str,total_number:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the total number of all banking institutions in the state with the highest sum of assets from banks established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000, with institution names starting with 'Bank', we:

1. **Filtered** the `institutions` table for banks:
   - Established between 1900-01-01 and 2000-12-31.
   - With `institution_name` starting with 'Bank'.
2. **Aggregated** the total assets for these banks by state.
3. **Identified** the state with the highest sum of assets.
4. **Counted** all banking institutions in that state..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'census_utility': ['fips_class_code', 'fips_codes_all', 'fips_codes_states', 'functional_status_codes', 'lsad_codes', 'mtfcc_feature_class_codes'], 'fda_food': ['food_enforcement', 'food_events'], 'fdic_banks': ['institutions', 'locations'], 'geo_census_blockgroups': ['blockgroups_01', 'blockgroups_02', 'blockgroups_04', 'blockgroups_05', 'blockgroups_06', 'blockgroups_08', 'blockgroups_09', 'blockgroups_10', 'blockgroups_11', 'blockgroups_12', 'blockgroups_13', 'blockgroups_15', 'blockgroups_16', 'blockgroups_17', 'blockgroups_18', 'blockgroups_19', 'blockgroups_20', 'blockgroups_21', 'blockgroups_22', 'blockgroups_23', 'blockgroups_24', 'blockgroups_25', 'blockgroups_26', 'blockgroups_27', 'blockgroups_28', 'blockgroups_29', 'blockgroups_30', 'blockgroups_31', 'blockgroups_32', 'blockgroups_33', 'blockgroups_34', 'blockgroups_35', 'blockgroups_36', 'blockgroups_37', 'blockgroups_38', 'blockgroups_39', 'blockgroups_40', 'blockgroups_41', 'blockgroups_42', 'blockgroups_44', 'blockgroups_45', 'blockgroups_46', 'blockgroups_47', 'blockgroups_48', 'blockgroups_49', 'blockgroups_50', 'blockgroups_51', 'blockgroups_53', 'blockgroups_54', 'blockgroups_55', 'blockgroups_56', 'blockgroups_60', 'blockgroups_66', 'blockgroups_69', 'blockgroups_72', 'blockgroups_78', 'us_blockgroups_national'], 'geo_us_boundaries': ['adjacent_counties', 'adjacent_states', 'cbsa', 'cnecta', 'coastline', 'congress_district_115', 'congress_district_116', 'counties', 'csa', 'metropolitan_divisions', 'national_outline', 'nws_forecast_regions', 'railways', 'states', 'urban_areas', 'zip_codes']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 23:31:13 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the total number of all banking institutions in the state that has the highest sum of assets from banks established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000, with institution names starting with 'Bank'?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.

2. **Aggregated** the total assets for these banks by state.
3. **Identified** the state with the highest sum of assets.
4. **Counted** all banking institutions in that state. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
