After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query is **`1result.sql`**.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Counting:** The query in `1result.sql` uses `COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number)` to count the total number of unique banking institutions. This ensures that each institution is counted only once, avoiding duplicates that might occur in the dataset.

- **Correct Identification of State:** The subquery accurately identifies the state with the highest sum of assets from banks whose names start with 'Bank' and were established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000. It sums the `total_assets` for each state matching these criteria and selects the state with the highest sum.

- **Alignment with Task Requirements:** The main query then counts all banking institutions in that state, regardless of their names or establishment dates, which is precisely what the task asks for.

- **Consistency of Results:** The result shows that North Carolina (`NC`) has the highest sum of assets from banks matching the criteria and that there are 453 banking institutions in that state.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**
