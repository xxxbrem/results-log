After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Element Filtering in WHERE Clause:**
  - `2result.sql` explicitly includes `element IN ('PRCP', 'TMIN', 'TMAX')` in the `WHERE` clause. This ensures that only the relevant measurement types are considered from the start, optimizing query performance by reducing the amount of data processed.
  - Both `0result.sql` and `1result.sql` rely on filtering elements within the `SELECT` clause using `CASE WHEN`, which can be less efficient since irrelevant data is processed before being filtered out.

- **Efficient Date Filtering:**
  - `2result.sql` uses `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) = 12` and `EXTRACT(DAY FROM date) BETWEEN 17 AND 31` to select the last 15 days of December for each year. This method is clear and effective.
  - `0result.sql` constructs dates by concatenating strings and using `DATE_SUB`, which is more complex and less readable.
  - `1result.sql` similarly extracts month and day but lacks the explicit element filtering in the `WHERE` clause.

- **Quality Data Inclusion:**
  - All queries include `(qflag IS NULL OR qflag = '')` to ensure only high-quality, valid data is included.

- **Clarity and Readability:**
  - `2result.sql` presents the query in a clear and straightforward manner, making it easier to understand and maintain.

- **Consistent Results:**
  - The results from `2result.sql` match those required by the task, providing the highest precipitation, lowest minimum temperature, and highest maximum temperature for each year, converted appropriately to millimeters and degrees Celsius.

**Conclusion:**

`2result.sql` is the most accurate and efficient SQL query to fulfill the task's requirements by effectively filtering data early in the query, ensuring optimal performance and clarity.
