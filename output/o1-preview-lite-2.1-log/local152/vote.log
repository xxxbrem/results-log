Based on the comparison of the two provided SQL scripts, **Option 2 (`2result.sql`)** is the correct choice for the following reasons:

1. **Structured and Clear CTEs**:
   - Option 2 uses multiple CTEs (`director_movies`, `director_stats`, and `inter_movie_durations`) to break down the computation into logical and manageable steps.
   - Each CTE has a specific responsibility, making the query easier to read, maintain, and debug.

2. **Accurate Calculation of Average Inter-Movie Duration**:
   - The `inter_movie_durations` CTE in Option 2 carefully handles the computation of inter-movie durations by filtering out `NULL` dates and differences.
   - It ensures that only valid date differences are considered in the average calculation, which provides a more accurate result.

3. **Handling of Missing Data**:
   - Option 2 uses `COALESCE(imd.avg_inter_movie_duration, 0)` to handle cases where a director might not have enough movies to calculate an inter-movie duration.
   - This prevents `NULL` values in the final result and ensures consistency in the output.

4. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - By segregating the computations into distinct CTEs, Option 2 adheres to the best practices of SQL query writing.
   - It enhances readability and allows each part of the query to be understood independently.

5. **Equivalent and Correct Results**:
   - Both options produce identical results, but Option 2 achieves this with a clearer and more maintainable approach.
   - The use of proper aggregation and joins ensures that all required metrics are accurately computed.

6. **Better Handling of Aggregates**:
   - Option 2 explicitly names aggregates and fields, making the query more self-explanatory.
   - It avoids potential issues with ambiguous references and ensures that each calculation is transparent.

Given these considerations, **Option 2 (`2result.sql`)** is the recommended choice.
