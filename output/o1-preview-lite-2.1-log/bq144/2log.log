  - Differences are calculated as opponent's metric minus team's metric.

**Note:** The `...` indicates that there are multiple records in the dataset. Actual data values would be filled in based on the datasets for the specified seasons..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'data-to-insights': {'ncaa': ['2018_tournament_results', '2019_tournament_seeds', 'adjusted_metrics', 'feature_engineering', 'mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'metric_names', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

**Explanation:**

- **Step 1: Create `game_data` CTE**
  - Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `game_data` to restructure the tournament games data.
  - For each game, generate two records:
    - One for the winning team with `label` as `'win'`.
    - One for the losing team with `label` as `'loss'`.
  - This allows us to analyze each team's performance individually with their corresponding metrics.

- **Step 2: Join with Performance Metrics**
  - Left join `game_data` with `feature_engineering` table twice:
    - Once to get the team's metrics (`fe_team`).
    - Once to get the opponent's metrics (`fe_opp`).
  - Use `LOWER()` function to perform case-insensitive joins on team names.

- **Step 3: Calculate Differences**
  - Compute the differences between the opponent's and the team's metrics.
  - This provides insight into how each team's performance compared to their opponent in each game.

- **Columns in the Output:**

  - `season`: Year of the NCAA tournament season.
  - `label`: Outcome of the game for the team ("win" or "loss").
  - `seed`: Seed ranking of the team.
  - `school_ncaa`: NCAA school/team of the team.
  - `opponent_seed`: Seed ranking of the opponent team.
  - `opponent_school_ncaa`: NCAA school/team of the opponent.
  - `pace_rank`: Team's rank in pace.
  - `poss_40min`: Team's possessions over 40 minutes.
  - `pace_rating`: Team's pace performance rating.
  - `efficiency_rank`: Team's rank in scoring efficiency.
  - `pts_100poss`: Team's points per 100 possessions.
  - `efficiency_rating`: Team's overall efficiency rating.
  - `opp_pace_rank`: Opponent's pace rank.
  - `opp_poss_40min`: Opponent's possessions over 40 minutes.
  - `opp_pace_rating`: Opponent's pace rating.
  - `opp_efficiency_rank`: Opponent's efficiency rank.
  - `opp_pts_100poss`: Opponent's points per 100 possessions.
  - `opp_efficiency_rating`: Opponent's efficiency rating.
  - `pace_rank_diff`: Difference between opponent's and team's pace ranks.
  - `pace_stat_diff`: Difference in possessions per 40 minutes.
  - `pace_rating_diff`: Difference in pace ratings.
  - `eff_rank_diff`: Difference between opponent's and team's efficiency ranks.
  - `eff_stat_diff`: Difference in points per 100 possessions.
  - `eff_rating_diff`: Difference in efficiency ratings.

**Note:**

- This query will provide a dataset where each row represents a team's performance in a tournament game from 2014 to 2018, along with their and their opponent's pace and efficiency metrics.
- The differences calculated can help in analyzing the dynamics between teams and their opponents in terms of pace and efficiency.

Feel free to run this query in BigQuery to obtain the merged dataset for your analysis.
