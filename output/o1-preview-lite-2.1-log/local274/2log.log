These queries help us understand which products were picked for order 421 and provide the necessary data to calculate the average number of units picked per batch for each product using the FIFO method. The calculations involve:

- Identifying the products and quantities picked (`picking_line`).
- Linking products to their names (`products`).
- Finding associated inventory batches and purchase dates to apply FIFO (`inventory` and `purchases`).
- Calculating totals and averages grouped by product.

**Note:** Without precise allocation of picked quantities to specific inventory batches, the average units per batch can only be approximated. The FIFO method would require detailed transactional data showing exactly which batches were used during picking.Query:

Task: Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
product_id,product_name,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,average_units2:float
...
```

To determine which products were picked for order **421** and calculate the average number of units picked per batch for each product using the FIFO method, we:

1. **Identified the products picked for order 421** by querying the `picking_line` table where `order_id` equals 421.
2. **Applied the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method** by allocating the picked quantities to inventory batches in the order they were received (earliest first), using data from the `inventory` and `purchases` tables.
3. **Calculated the average units picked per batch** for each product by dividing the total units picked by the number of batches from which the product was picked.

The result provides the **product IDs**, their corresponding **product names**, and the **average number of units picked per batch** for each product in order 421..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 19:35:24 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
