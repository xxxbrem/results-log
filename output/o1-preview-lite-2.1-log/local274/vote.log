After comparing both SQL queries, here is my analysis:

**First SQL (0result.sql):**

```sql
SELECT pl.product_id,
       p.name AS product_name,
       ROUND(SUM(pl.qty) / COUNT(DISTINCT i.purchase_id), 4) AS average_units_picked_per_batch
FROM picking_line pl
JOIN products p ON pl.product_id = p.id
JOIN inventory i ON pl.location_id = i.location_id AND pl.product_id = i.product_id
WHERE pl.order_id = 421
GROUP BY pl.product_id, p.name;
```

- **Approach:** This query calculates the average units picked per batch by dividing the total picked quantity by the count of distinct `purchase_id`s from the `inventory` table linked via `location_id` and `product_id`.
- **Issue:** The join on `pl.location_id = i.location_id` may not accurately reflect the FIFO allocation. In a FIFO system, the allocation is based on the purchase dates of inventory batches, not necessarily on location IDs.
- **Limitation:** It assumes that all inventory at a location is used before moving to the next, which may not be accurate. It doesn't consider the cumulative quantities of inventory batches required to fulfill the picked quantity.

**Second SQL (2result.sql):**

```sql
-- Complex query using CTEs to simulate FIFO allocation
```

- **Approach:** This query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to:
  - Calculate the total picked quantity per product.
  - Gather inventory batches with their quantities and purchase dates.
  - Calculate the cumulative sum of batch quantities ordered by purchase date (FIFO).
  - Determine the minimum number of batches needed to fulfill the picked quantity per product.
  - Calculate the average units picked per batch by dividing the total picked quantity by the number of batches used.
- **Advantage:** It accurately models the FIFO method by considering the purchase dates and cumulative quantities to find out how many earliest batches are needed to fulfill the order.
- **Result:** Provides a precise average units picked per batch based on the actual batches that would be used in a FIFO system.

**Conclusion:**

The second SQL query (`2result.sql`) is the correct one for calculating the average number of units picked per product using the FIFO method. It properly accounts for the order in which inventory batches are used (based on purchase dates) and determines the exact number of batches needed to fulfill the picked quantities.
