2025-01-25 11:07:50 - root - INFO - Apologies for the error in the previous query. The issue arises because the `value` column in the `crops` table is of type `FLOAT64`, so using the `TRIM` function (which expects a `STRING`) on it causes an error.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  state_name,
  commodity_desc,
  SUM(value) AS production_bushels
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usda_nass_agriculture.crops`
WHERE
  commodity_desc IN ('CORN', 'MUSHROOMS')
  AND (
    (commodity_desc = 'CORN' AND group_desc = 'FIELD CROPS')
    OR (commodity_desc = 'MUSHROOMS' AND group_desc = 'HORTICULTURE')
  )
  AND sector_desc = 'CROPS'
  AND statisticcat_desc = 'PRODUCTION'
  AND unit_desc = 'BU'
  AND agg_level_desc = 'STATE'
  AND year = 2022
  AND value IS NOT NULL
  AND state_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  state_name,
  commodity_desc,
  state_name
ORDER BY
  state_name,
  commodity_desc;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Removed the `TRIM` Function:**
  - Since `value` is of type `FLOAT64`, applying `TRIM(value)` causes an error. The `TRIM` function is intended for `STRING` types.
  - I removed `TRIM(value) != ''` because `value` being `NOT NULL` suffices to ensure we have valid numerical data.
  
- **Removed Casting and Replacement:**
  - There's no need to use `SAFE_CAST` or `REPLACE` on `value` because it's already a numerical type (`FLOAT64`).

- **Additional Adjustments:**
  - Ensured that we have `state_name IS NOT NULL` to exclude any records without a state name.
  - Added `state_name` to the `GROUP BY` clause to group the totals by each state and commodity.
  - Ordered the results by `state_name` and `commodity_desc` for clarity.

**Final Data Output Format:**

The query will return the total 2022 production figures in bushels for corn and mushrooms from the specified groups for each U.S. state, including only records that:

- Show **"PRODUCTION"** as the statistic category.
- Are measured at the **state level** (`agg_level_desc = 'STATE'`).
- Have **no missing values** for `value` and `state_name`.

**Sample Output:**

```csv
state_name,commodity_desc,production_bushels
ALABAMA,CORN,1234567.0
CALIFORNIA,MUSHROOMS,2345678.0
IOWA,CORN,3456789.0
PENNSYLVANIA,MUSHROOMS,4567890.0
...
```

The resulting table provides the total production figures in bushels for corn and mushrooms for each state in 2022, meeting all the specified conditions.

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'usda_nass_agriculture': ['animals_products', 'census2002', 'census2007', 'census2012', 'census_2002', 'census_2007', 'census_2012', 'crops', 'demographics', 'economics', 'environmental']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
To find the total 2022 production figures in bushels for corn from the field crops category and mushrooms from the horticulture group for each U.S. state, we'll use the `crops` table from the `usda_nass_agriculture` dataset in the `bigquery-public-data` database.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.usda_nass_agriculture.crops`

**Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- `commodity_desc`: **Usage:** To filter records for 'CORN' and 'MUSHROOMS'.
- `group_desc`: **Usage:** To ensure 'FIELD CROPS' for corn and 'HORTICULTURE' for mushrooms.
- `sector_desc`: **Usage:** Should be 'CROPS' for both commodities.
- `statisticcat_desc`: **Usage:** To filter for 'PRODUCTION'.
- `unit_desc`: **Usage:** To ensure the unit is 'BU' (bushels).
- `year`: **Usage:** To filter for the year 2022.
- `agg_level_desc`: **Usage:** To ensure data is at the 'STATE' level.
- `state_name`: **Usage:** To group data by each U.S. state.
- `value`: **Usage:** To retrieve the production figures.
- `value IS NOT NULL`: **Usage:** To exclude records with missing values.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `commodity_desc IN ('CORN', 'MUSHROOMS')`
- `group_desc` corresponding to each commodity ('FIELD CROPS' for corn, 'HORTICULTURE' for mushrooms)
- `sector_desc = 'CROPS'`
- `statisticcat_desc = 'PRODUCTION'`
- `unit_desc = 'BU'` (bushels)
- `year = 2022`
- `agg_level_desc = 'STATE'`
- `value IS NOT NULL`

Task: Find the total 2022 production figures in bushels for corn from the field crops category and mushrooms from the horticulture group for each U.S. state using the USDA NASS Agriculture Crops dataset? The data should include only records that show production as the statistic category, are measured at the state level, and have no missing values.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The total 2022 production figures in bushels for corn from the field crops category and mushrooms from the horticulture group for each U.S. state are as follows:

```csv
state_name,commodity_desc,production_bushels
state_name1:str,commodity1:str,production1:float
state_name2:str,commodity2:str,production2:float
...
```

This data includes only records where the statistic category is "PRODUCTION," measured at the state level in bushels, and with no missing values. It provides a clear comparison of production figures for corn and mushrooms across different states in 2022..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'usda_nass_agriculture': ['animals_products', 'census2002', 'census2007', 'census2012', 'census_2002', 'census_2007', 'census_2012', 'crops', 'demographics', 'economics', 'environmental']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 11:15:16 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Find the total 2022 production figures in bushels for corn from the field crops category and mushrooms from the horticulture group for each U.S. state using the USDA NASS Agriculture Crops dataset? The data should include only records that show production as the statistic category, are measured at the state level, and have no missing values., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The total 2022 production figures in bushels for corn from the field crops category and mushrooms from the horticulture group for each U.S. state are as follows:

```csv
state_name,commodity_desc,production_bushels
state_name1:str,commodity1:str,production1:float
state_name2:str,commodity2:str,production2:float
...
```

This data includes only records where the statistic category is "PRODUCTION," measured at the state level in bushels, and with no missing values. It provides a clear comparison of production figures for corn and mushrooms across different states in 2022. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
