**Task:** Which single team has the fewest wins in each league?

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Match Table:**
   - `"league_id"`: Identifies the league to which the match belongs.
   - `"home_team_api_id"`: The ID of the home team.
   - `"away_team_api_id"`: The ID of the away team.
   - `"home_team_goal"`: Number of goals scored by the home team.
   - `"away_team_goal"`: Number of goals scored by the away team.
   - `"match_api_id"`: Unique identifier for each match.

2. **Team Table:**
   - `"team_api_id"`: Unique identifier for each team (used to join with Match table).
   - `"team_long_name"`: The full name of the team (for display purposes).

3. **League Table:**
   - `"id"`: Unique identifier for each league.
   - `"name"`: The name of the league (for display purposes).

**Potential Usage and Conditions:**

- **Determine Wins:**
  - A team wins if it scores more goals than the opponent.
    - For home team wins: `"home_team_goal" > "away_team_goal"`
    - For away team wins: `"away_team_goal" > "home_team_goal"`
- **Aggregate Wins:**
  - Count the total number of wins for each team in each league.
- **Identify Teams with Fewest Wins in Each League:**
  - Find the minimum number of wins per league.
  - Select the team(s) with that number of wins in each league.
- **Conditions That May Be Used:**
  - Filtering matches by league using `"league_id"`.
  - Joining tables on matching `"team_api_id"` and `"id"` for teams and leagues, respectively.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List All Leagues:**

```sql
SELECT "id", "name" FROM "League" LIMIT 100;
```

2. **List All Teams:**

```sql
SELECT "team_api_id", "team_long_name" FROM "Team" LIMIT 100;
```

3. **List All Matches with Goals and Teams:**

```sql
SELECT "match_api_id", "league_id", "home_team_api_id", "away_team_api_id", "home_team_goal", "away_team_goal"
FROM "Match" LIMIT 100;
```

4. **Get Distinct League IDs from Matches:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "league_id" FROM "Match" LIMIT 100;
```

5. **Find Matches Where Home Team Won:**

```sql
SELECT "match_api_id", "league_id", "home_team_api_id" AS "winning_team_id"
FROM "Match"
WHERE "home_team_goal" > "away_team_goal"
LIMIT 100;
```

6. **Find Matches Where Away Team Won:**

```sql
SELECT "match_api_id", "league_id", "away_team_api_id" AS "winning_team_id"
FROM "Match"
WHERE "away_team_goal" > "home_team_goal"
LIMIT 100;
```

7. **Get All Winning Teams with League IDs:**

```sql
SELECT "league_id", "winning_team_id" FROM (
  SELECT "league_id", "home_team_api_id" AS "winning_team_id"
  FROM "Match"
  WHERE "home_team_goal" > "away_team_goal"
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "league_id", "away_team_api_id" AS "winning_team_id"
  FROM "Match"
  WHERE "away_team_goal" > "home_team_goal"
) LIMIT 100;
```

8. **Count Total Wins per Team Across All Leagues:**

```sql
SELECT "winning_team_id", COUNT(*) AS "total_wins"
FROM (
  SELECT "home_team_api_id" AS "winning_team_id"
  FROM "Match"
  WHERE "home_team_goal" > "away_team_goal"
  UNION ALL

  FROM "Match"
  WHERE "away_team_goal" > "home_team_goal"
)
GROUP BY "winning_team_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

9. **Count Total Wins per Team per League:**

```sql
SELECT "league_id", "winning_team_id", COUNT(*) AS "wins"

```

12. **Include Team and League Names for Teams with Fewest Wins:**

```sql

FROM (
  SELECT "league_id", "winning_team_id", COUNT(*) AS "wins"
  FROM (
    SELECT "league_id", "home_team_api_id" AS "winning_team_id"

JOIN "Team" t ON w."winning_team_id" = t."team_api_id"
JOIN "League" l ON w."league_id" = l."id"
LIMIT 100;
```

13. **List All Teams and Their Total Wins in a Specific League (e.g., League ID 1):**

```sql
SELECT t."team_long_name", w."wins"
FROM (
  SELECT "winning_team_id", COUNT(*) AS "wins"
  FROM (
    SELECT "home_team_api_id" AS "winning_team_id"
    FROM "Match"
    WHERE "home_team_goal" > "away_team_goal" AND "league_id" = 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT "away_team_api_id" AS "winning_team_id"
    FROM "Match"
    WHERE "away_team_goal" > "home_team_goal" AND "league_id" = 1
  )
  GROUP BY "winning_team_id"
) w
JOIN "Team" t ON w."winning_team_id" = t."team_api_id"
ORDER BY w."wins" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

14. **Find Teams with Zero Wins in Each League:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l."name" AS "league_name", t."team_long_name"
FROM "Team" t
JOIN "Match" m ON t."team_api_id" = m."home_team_api_id" OR t."team_api_id" = m."away_team_api_id"
JOIN "League" l ON m."league_id" = l."id"
WHERE t."team_api_id" NOT IN (
  SELECT "winning_team_id"
  FROM (
    SELECT "home_team_api_id" AS "winning_team_id"
    FROM "Match"
    WHERE "home_team_goal" > "away_team_goal"
    UNION ALL
    SELECT "away_team_api_id" AS "winning_team_id"
    FROM "Match"
    WHERE "away_team_goal" > "home_team_goal"
  )
)
LIMIT 100;
```

15. **Calculate Win Ratios for Teams in Each League:**

```sql
SELECT l."name" AS "league_name", t."team_long_name",
       IFNULL(w."wins", 0) AS "wins", total_matches."matches_played",
       ROUND((IFNULL(w."wins", 0) * 1.0 / total_matches."matches_played") * 100, 2) AS "win_percentage"
FROM "Team" t
JOIN (
  SELECT "team_api_id", COUNT(*) AS "matches_played"
  FROM (
    SELECT "home_team_api_id" AS "team_api_id" FROM "Match"
    UNION ALL
    SELECT "away_team_api_id" AS "team_api_id" FROM "Match"
  )
  GROUP BY "team_api_id"
) total_matches ON t."team_api_id" = total_matches."team_api_id"
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT "winning_team_id", COUNT(*) AS "wins"
  FROM (
    SELECT "home_team_api_id" AS "winning_team_id"
    FROM "Match"
    WHERE "home_team_goal" > "away_team_goal"
    UNION ALL
    SELECT "away_team_api_id" AS "winning_team_id"
    FROM "Match"
    WHERE "away_team_goal" > "home_team_goal"
  )
  GROUP BY "winning_team_id"

GROUP BY l."id", t."team_api_id"
ORDER BY l."name", "win_percentage" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Which single team has the fewest wins in each league?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
league_id,league_name,team_id,team_long_name,wins
league1_id:int,league1_name:str,team1_id:int,team1_name:str,wins:int
league2_id:int,league2_name:str,team2_id:int,team2_name:str,wins:int
...
```

**Explanation:**

For each league in the database, we have identified the single team that has the fewest number of wins within that league. The columns represent the league's ID and name, the team's ID and long name, and the total number of wins the team has achieved in that league. Each row corresponds to one league and its team with the fewest wins..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

The columns represent the league's ID and name, the team's ID and long name, and the total number of wins the team has achieved in that league. Each row corresponds to one league and its team with the fewest wins. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
