**Task:** Which single team has the fewest wins in each league?

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Match Table:**
   - `"league_id"`: Used to identify the league of each match.
   - `"home_team_api_id"`: Identifies the home team in each match.
   - `"away_team_api_id"`: Identifies the away team in each match.
   - `"home_team_goal"`: Number of goals scored by the home team.
   - `"away_team_goal"`: Number of goals scored by the away team.

2. **Team Table:**
   - `"team_api_id"`: Unique identifier for each team.
   - `"team_long_name"`: Full name of the team.

3. **League Table:**
   - `"id"`: Unique identifier for each league.
   - `"name"`: Name of the league.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Determine the winner of each match based on the goals:
  - If `"home_team_goal"` > `"away_team_goal"`, the home team wins.
  - If `"home_team_goal"` < `"away_team_goal"`, the away team wins.
- Calculate total wins for each team (both home and away wins).
- Group wins by `"league_id"` to find the team with the fewest wins in each league.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all distinct league IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "league_id" FROM "Match" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all leagues with their names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name" FROM "League" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all teams with their names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "team_api_id", "team_long_name" FROM "Team" LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get sample matches with goals and team IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "match_api_id", "league_id", "home_team_api_id", "away_team_api_id", "home_team_goal", "away_team_goal"
   FROM "Match"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get number of home wins per team per league:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "league_id", "home_team_api_id" AS "team_api_id", COUNT(*) AS "home_wins"
   FROM "Match"
   WHERE "home_team_goal" > "away_team_goal"
   GROUP BY "league_id", "home_team_api_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Get number of away wins per team per league:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "league_id", "away_team_api_id" AS "team_api_id", COUNT(*) AS "away_wins"
   FROM "Match"
   WHERE "away_team_goal" > "home_team_goal"
   GROUP BY "league_id", "away_team_api_id"
   LIMIT 100;

   )
   GROUP BY "league_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List teams with the fewest wins in each league:**

   ```sql
   SELECT lw."league_id", lw."team_api_id", lw."total_wins"

       WHERE "away_team_goal" > "home_team_goal"
       GROUP BY "league_id", "away_team_api_id"
     )
     GROUP BY "league_id", "team_api_id"
   ) lw
   JOIN (
     SELECT "league_id", MIN("total_wins") AS "min_wins"
     FROM (
       SELECT "league_id", "team_api_id", SUM("wins") AS "total_wins"

       )
       GROUP BY "league_id", "team_api_id"
     )
     GROUP BY "league_id"
   ) mw ON lw."league_id" = mw."league_id" AND lw."total_wins" = mw."min_wins"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Get the team names and league names for teams with fewest wins:**

    ```sql
    SELECT lw."league_id", l."name" AS "league_name", lw."team_api_id", t."team_long_name", lw."total_wins" AS "wins"
    FROM (
      SELECT "league_id", "team_api_id", SUM("wins") AS "total_wins"

**Explanation:**

- **Queries 1-4**: These queries help us explore the basic data, such as the list of leagues, teams, and matches, along with their relevant IDs.
- **Queries 5-6**: We calculate the number of wins for each team when they played at home and away, grouped by league and team.
- **Query 7**: Combines home and away wins to calculate the total wins per team per league.
- **Query 8**: Finds the minimum number of wins in each league to identify the fewest wins.
- **Query 9**: Lists the teams that have the fewest wins in each league by joining the total wins with the minimum wins.
- **Query 10**: Enhances Query 9 by adding the league names and team names for better readability.

These queries progressively build upon each other to understand the data and ultimately determine the single team with the fewest wins in each league.Query:

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Which single team has the fewest wins in each league?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
league_id,league_name,team_id,team_long_name,wins
league1_id:int,league1_name:str,team1_id:int,team1_name:str,wins:int
league2_id:int,league2_name:str,team2_id:int,team2_name:str,wins:int
...
```

**Explanation:**

For each league in the database, we have identified the single team that has the fewest number of wins within that league. The columns represent the league's ID and name, the team's ID and long name, and the total number of wins the team has achieved in that league. Each row corresponds to one league and its team with the fewest wins..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 09:28:19 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which single team has the fewest wins in each league?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
league_id,league_name,team_id,team_long_name,wins
league1_id:int,league1_name:str,team1_id:int,team1_name:str,wins:int
league2_id:int,league2_name:str,team2_id:int,team2_name:str,wins:int
...
```

**Explanation:**

For each league in the database, we have identified the single team that has the fewest number of wins within that league. The columns represent the league's ID and name, the team's ID and long name, and the total number of wins the team has achieved in that league. Each row corresponds to one league and its team with the fewest wins. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

**Explanation:**

For each league in the database, we have identified the single team that has the fewest number of wins within that league. The columns represent the league's ID and name, the team's ID and long name, and the total number of wins the team has achieved in that league. Each row corresponds to one league and its team with the fewest wins. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
