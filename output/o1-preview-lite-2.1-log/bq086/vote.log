After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer for the following reasons:

- **Aggregation Level**: `1result.sql` uses `aggregation_level = 0`, which corresponds to country-level data in the `covid19_open_data` table. This ensures we're calculating percentages at the country level, as required.

- **Accurate Calculations**: It directly calculates the percentage of each country's population confirmed to have COVID-19 by dividing `cumulative_confirmed` cases as of June 30, 2020, by the 2019 population (`population_2019`) and multiplying by 100.

- **Comprehensive Data**: The query includes all countries with available data by ensuring `cumulative_confirmed IS NOT NULL` and `population_2019 IS NOT NULL`, providing a complete and accurate representation.

- **Correct Data Sources**: It joins the COVID-19 data with the World Bank population data using the ISO country codes (`iso_3166_1_alpha_3` and `country_code`), ensuring accurate matching between datasets.

Therefore, the correct SQL query to determine the percentage of each country's population confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020, is:
