2025-01-26 19:48:19 - root - INFO - Apologies for the inconvenience. Let's adjust the query to ensure it returns data.

It's possible that the `iso_3166_1_alpha_3` country codes in the COVID-19 data do not match the `country_code` values in the population data. Therefore, we'll join the tables using the country names, matching their lowercase versions to account for any case differences. We'll also simplify the conditions by removing the `aggregation_level` filter.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  covid.country_name,
  MAX(covid.cumulative_confirmed) AS cumulative_confirmed,
  pop.year_2019 AS population_2019,
  (MAX(covid.cumulative_confirmed) / pop.year_2019) * 100 AS covid_confirmed_percentage
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data` AS covid
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_global_population.population_by_country` AS pop
ON
  LOWER(covid.country_name) = LOWER(pop.country)
WHERE
  covid.date = '2020-06-30'
  AND covid.cumulative_confirmed IS NOT NULL
  AND pop.year_2019 IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  covid.country_name, pop.year_2019
ORDER BY
  covid_confirmed_percentage DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

This query performs the following:

- **JOIN**: Matches records from the COVID-19 data and population data where the country names match (case-insensitive).
- **WHERE**: Filters records to include only those from June 30, 2020, with non-null cumulative confirmed cases and population data.
- **MAX(cumulative_confirmed)**: Ensures that for each country, we get the highest cumulative confirmed case count on that date (in case of multiple records per country).
- **Calculation**: Computes the percentage of the population confirmed to have COVID-19.
- **ORDER BY**: Sorts the results by the highest percentage.
- **LIMIT 100**: Limits the output to 100 rows.

This should provide the desired data without yielding an empty result set.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

To answer the task, we need to determine the percentage of each country's population that was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020. We'll use the following tables and columns:

1. **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   - `country_name`: Identifies each country.
   - `date`: Used to filter records for June 30, 2020.
   - `cumulative_confirmed`: The cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases up to a specific date.

2. **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_global_population.population_by_country`
   - `country`: Name of the country.
   - `year_2019`: Population of the country in 2019.

**Potential Usage and Conditions:**

- **`country_name` / `country`**: Used to join the two tables on country names.
- **`date`**: Filter to records where `date` = '2020-06-30'.
- **`cumulative_confirmed`**: Used to get the total confirmed cases up to June 30, 2020.
- **`year_2019`**: Provides population data for percentage calculation.
- **Conditions**:
  - `date` = '2020-06-30'
  - Exclude records where `cumulative_confirmed` is NULL.
  - Exclude countries where `year_2019` population data is NULL.

Each query explores different aspects of the data:

- Queries 1-4 focus on the COVID-19 data alone.
- Queries 5-6 join COVID-19 data with population data to prepare for percentage calculation.
- Queries 7 focuses on population data alone.
- Queries 8-10 perform joins using case-insensitive matching and calculate the required percentage.

These queries collectively provide the necessary steps to determine the percentage of each country's population that was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020.Query:

Task: What percentage of each country’s population was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the percentage of each country's population that was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative number of confirmed cases by that date and the country's population for the year 2019. The percentage is calculated as:

\[
\text{COVID\_confirmed\_percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{cumulative\_confirmed\_cases\_as\_of\_June\_30,\_2020}}{\text{population\_in\_2019}} \right) \times 100
\]

Below is the table format showing the required data:

```csv
Country_name,COVID_confirmed_percentage
country1:str,percentage1:0<=float<=100
country2:str,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'covid19_open_data': ['covid19_open_data'], 'world_bank_global_population': ['population_by_country'], 'world_bank_health_population': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'health_nutrition_population', 'series_summary', 'series_times'], 'world_bank_intl_debt': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'international_debt', 'series_summary', 'series_times'], 'world_bank_intl_education': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'international_education', 'series_summary'], 'world_bank_wdi': ['country_series_definitions', 'country_summary', 'footnotes', 'indicators_data', 'series_summary', 'series_time']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

**Explanation:**

To resolve the issue of "No data found for the specified query," we need to ensure that the `country_code` fields we are joining on are compatible between the two datasets. The `country_code` in `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_wdi.indicators_data` uses the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes, so we should use the `iso_3166_1_alpha_3` field from the COVID-19 dataset for the join.

Here's the corrected query:

1. **Select Data from COVID-19 Table:**

   - Use `iso_3166_1_alpha_3` as `country_code` from the COVID-19 data.
   - Filter for records where `date` is '2020-06-30'.
   - Include only records where `aggregation_level = 0` (country-level data).
   - Exclude records where `cumulative_confirmed` or `iso_3166_1_alpha_3` is NULL.

2. **Select Population Data:**

   - Extract `country_code` and population value from the World Bank indicators data.
   - Filter for records where `indicator_code` is 'SP.POP.TOTL' (total population) and `year` is 2019.
   - Exclude records where `value` is NULL.
   - Use `MAX(value)` in case there are duplicate entries for the same `country_code`.

3. **Perform the Join:**

   - Join the two datasets on `country_code` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes).
   - This ensures that the country codes match between the two datasets.

4. **Calculate Percentage and Order Results:**

   - Calculate the percentage of the population confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020.
   - Order the results in descending order to show countries with the highest percentages first.

**Note:**

- Ensure that both datasets are using the same ISO country codes for accurate joining.
- Use `MAX(value)` or `SUM(value)` as appropriate based on the data. In this case, since we're dealing with country-level populations for 2019, `MAX(value)` suffices.
- Verify that there are no NULL values in the joining keys (`country_code`) to avoid join mismatches.

2025-01-26 19:52:26 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What percentage of each country’s population was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the percentage of each country's population that was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020, we use the cumulative number of confirmed cases by that date and the country's population for the year 2019. The percentage is calculated as:

\[
\text{COVID\_confirmed\_percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{cumulative\_confirmed\_cases\_as\_of\_June\_30,\_2020}}{\text{population\_in\_2019}} \right) \times 100
\]

Below is the table format showing the required data:

```csv
Country_name,COVID_confirmed_percentage
country1:str,percentage1:0<=float<=100
country2:str,percentage2:0<=float<=100
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
