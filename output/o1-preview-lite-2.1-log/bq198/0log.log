This query performs the following steps:

1. **Subquery (`m`)**: Finds the maximum number of wins (`max_wins`) for each `season` between 1900 and 2000, excluding entries with missing or empty team names (`market IS NOT NULL AND market != ''`).

2. **Join**: Joins the original table (`t`) with the subquery (`m`) on both `season` and `wins`, ensuring that only teams who achieved the maximum number of wins in their respective seasons are selected.

3. **Filtering**: Excludes entries with missing or empty team names in the main table (`t.market IS NOT NULL AND t.market != ''`) and ensures seasons are between 1900 and 2000.

4. **Grouping and Counting**: Groups the results by the university (`t.market`) and counts the number of seasons (`COUNT(*)`) in which each university achieved the maximum number of wins.

5. **Ordering and Limiting**: Orders the universities in descending order based on `Total_peak_seasons` and limits the results to the top 5 universities.

**Note:** This query addresses the issue of missing team names by excluding records where the `market` column is `NULL` or an empty string (`''`). This ensures that only valid team names are considered in the final results.

Task: List the top 5 universities with the most seasons where they achieved the maximum wins in their respective NCAA basketball seasons between 1900-2000, showing each team's total number of such peak-performance seasons, while excluding entries with missing team names.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
University,Total_peak_seasons
```

Unfortunately, without access to the specific data from the `mbb_historical_teams_seasons` table, I cannot provide the exact list of universities and their total number of peak-performance seasons. 

To answer this question, you would need to:

1. **Filter the data** to include only seasons between 1900 and 2000.
2. **Exclude entries with missing team names** to ensure accurate results.
3. **Identify the maximum number of wins** in each season.
4. **Find teams** that achieved this maximum number of wins in their respective seasons.
5. **Count the number of seasons** each team reached this peak performance.
6. **List the top 5 universities** based on these counts.

This process would yield the top 5 universities with the most seasons where they achieved the maximum wins between 1900 and 2000..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
