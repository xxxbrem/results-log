After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`0result.sql`** is the correct query for calculating the monthly add-to-cart and purchase conversion rates as a percentage of pageviews on product detail pages from January to March 2017.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Alignment with the Task Definition:**

   - The task requires calculating conversion rates using the number of **product detail views** as the denominator. Specifically:
     - **Add-to-Cart Conversion Rate** = (Number of add-to-cart actions) / (Number of product detail views) * 100
     - **Purchase Conversion Rate** = (Number of purchase actions) / (Number of product detail views) * 100

2. **Accuracy in Counting Actions:**

   - **`0result.sql`** counts the number of **distinct hits** (using `HitID`) where:
     - `action_type = '2'` for product detail views.
     - `action_type = '3'` for add-to-cart actions.
     - `action_type = '6'` for purchase actions.
   - By constructing a unique `HitID` combining `fullVisitorId`, `visitId`, and `hit.hitNumber`, the query ensures that each action is counted only once per hit, providing an accurate count.

3. **Exclusion of Product Impressions:**

   - The query filters out product impressions by checking:
     - `product.isImpression IS NULL OR product.isImpression = FALSE`
   - This ensures that only actual user interactions (and not passive impressions) are counted in the calculations.

4. **Consistent Denominator:**

   - The denominator used is the **number of product detail views** (`action_type = '2'`), which aligns with the task requirement.
   - This provides a consistent basis for calculating conversion rates.

5. **Comparison with Other Queries:**

   - **`1result.sql`:**
     - While it also calculates conversion rates using product detail views as the denominator, it counts **total hits** rather than **distinct hits**.
     - This may lead to inflated numbers if multiple product interactions occur within the same hit.
     - The significantly higher purchase conversion rates (e.g., 16.7837% for Jan-2017) suggest possible overcounting.
   - **`2result.sql`:**
     - Uses a different approach by counting total actions and pageviews where `h.page.pagePath LIKE '%.axd%'`.
     - It does not specifically filter for product detail views (`action_type = '2'`), which may include non-product pages.
     - Does not exclude product impressions.
     - The denominator may not accurately represent product detail views, leading to potential discrepancies.

6. **Results Consistency:**

   - The conversion rates calculated in **`0result.sql`** are reasonable and align with expected e-commerce metrics.
   - The add-to-cart conversion rates increase over the months, which could reflect normal trends.
   - The purchase conversion rates are lower than add-to-cart rates, which is typical in user behavior patterns.

**Therefore, based on the above analysis, `0result.sql` is the correct SQL query that accurately addresses the task.**
