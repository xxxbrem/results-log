Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task **"What is the highest monthly delivered orders volume in the year with the lowest annual delivered orders volume among 2016, 2017, and 2018?"**, we need to identify relevant tables, columns, and conditions.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

**Table:** `olist_orders`

- **order_id**: Used to identify each order.
- **order_status**: To filter orders based on their status (e.g., delivered).
- **order_delivered_customer_date**: To determine when an order was delivered to the customer.

**Conditions:**

- **order_status = 'delivered'**: To consider only orders that have been delivered.
- **order_delivered_customer_date IS NOT NULL**: To ensure we're only looking at orders with a delivery date.
- **Years of interest**: Extract the year from `order_delivered_customer_date` to focus on 2016, 2017, and 2018.

---

**SQL Queries to Understand Values in Related Columns:**

1. **Get distinct order statuses to understand possible values in `order_status`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "order_status" FROM "olist_orders" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **View sample delivery dates for delivered orders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "order_id", "order_delivered_customer_date" FROM "olist_orders" 
   WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered' LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get the total number of delivered orders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total_Delivered_Orders" FROM "olist_orders" 
   WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered';
   ```

4. **Check for any null delivery dates in delivered orders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Null_Delivery_Dates" FROM "olist_orders"
   WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered' AND "order_delivered_customer_date" IS NULL;
   ```

5. **Extract years from delivery dates to see the distribution of orders per year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 4) AS "Year" 
   FROM "olist_orders" 
   WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered' AND "order_delivered_customer_date" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count delivered orders per year for 2016, 2017, and 2018:**
   ```sql
   SELECT SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 4) AS "Year", 
          COUNT(*) AS "Delivered_Orders"
   FROM "olist_orders"
   WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered' 
     AND "order_delivered_customer_date" IS NOT NULL
     AND SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 4) IN ('2016', '2017', '2018')
   GROUP BY "Year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find the monthly delivered orders for each year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 7) AS "Year_Month", 
          COUNT(*) AS "Delivered_Orders"
   FROM "olist_orders"
   WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered' 
     AND "order_delivered_customer_date" IS NOT NULL
     AND SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 4) IN ('2016', '2017', '2018')
   GROUP BY "Year_Month"
   ORDER BY "Year_Month"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Identify the year with the lowest annual delivered orders volume among 2016, 2017, and 2018:**
   ```sql
   SELECT SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 4) AS "Year", 
          COUNT(*) AS "Delivered_Orders"
   FROM "olist_orders"
   WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered' 
     AND "order_delivered_customer_date" IS NOT NULL
     AND SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 4) IN ('2016', '2017', '2018')
   GROUP BY "Year"
   ORDER BY "Delivered_Orders" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Get the monthly delivered orders volume for the year with the lowest annual volume (assuming it's 2016):**
   ```sql
   SELECT SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 6, 2) AS "Month", 
          COUNT(*) AS "Delivered_Orders"
   FROM "olist_orders"
   WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
     AND "order_delivered_customer_date" IS NOT NULL
     AND SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 4) = '2016'
   GROUP BY "Month"
   ORDER BY "Delivered_Orders" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find the highest monthly delivered orders volume in 2016:**
    ```sql
    SELECT MAX(Delivered_Orders) AS "Highest_Monthly_Volume"
    FROM (
      SELECT SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 6, 2) AS "Month", 
             COUNT(*) AS "Delivered_Orders"
      FROM "olist_orders"
      WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
        AND "order_delivered_customer_date" IS NOT NULL
        AND SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 4) = '2016'
      GROUP BY "Month"
    ) AS Monthly_Volumes;
    ```

11. **List the months and their delivered order counts in 2016:**
    ```sql
    SELECT SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 6, 2) AS "Month", 
           COUNT(*) AS "Delivered_Orders"
    FROM "olist_orders"
    WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered' 
      AND "order_delivered_customer_date" IS NOT NULL
      AND SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 4) = '2016'
    GROUP BY "Month"
    ORDER BY "Month"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Identify the month with the highest delivered orders in the lowest year (2016):**
    ```sql
    SELECT SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 6, 2) AS "Month", 
           COUNT(*) AS "Delivered_Orders"
    FROM "olist_orders"
    WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
      AND "order_delivered_customer_date" IS NOT NULL
      AND SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 4) = '2016'
    GROUP BY "Month"
    ORDER BY "Delivered_Orders" DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

13. **Compare monthly volumes between 2016, 2017, and 2018:**
    ```sql
    SELECT SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 7) AS "Year_Month", 
           COUNT(*) AS "Delivered_Orders"
    FROM "olist_orders"
    WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered' 
      AND "order_delivered_customer_date" IS NOT NULL
      AND SUBSTR("order_delivered_customer_date", 1, 4) IN ('2016', '2017', '2018')
    GROUP BY "Year_Month"
    ORDER BY "Year_Month"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Check the total number of orders (delivered or not) for each year:**

      AND SUBSTR("order_purchase_timestamp", 1, 4) IN ('2016', '2017', '2018')
    GROUP BY "Year"
    ORDER BY "Year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Determine how many orders were not delivered in 2016:**
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Undelivered_Orders_2016"
    FROM "olist_orders"
    WHERE "order_status" != 'delivered'
      AND SUBSTR("order_purchase_timestamp", 1, 4) = '2016';
    ```

Task: What is the highest monthly delivered orders volume in the year with the lowest annual delivered orders volume among 2016, 2017, and 2018?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Highest_Monthly_Delivered_Orders_Volume
12
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The year with the lowest annual delivered orders volume among 2016, 2017, and 2018 is **2016**. In that year, the highest number of delivered orders in a single month was **12**, which occurred in **December 2016**..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
