- **Filtering for English Courses**:
  - `"CategoryDescription" LIKE '%English%'` to find the CategoryID for English courses.
  - Alternatively, `"SubjectName" LIKE '%English%'` to find subjects related to English.
- **Filtering for Completed Courses**:
  - `"ClassStatusDescription" = 'Completed'` to find students who have completed courses.

   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List distinct last names of students who completed English courses:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT st."StudLastName"
    FROM "Student_Schedules" AS ss
    JOIN "Student_Class_Status" AS scs ON ss."ClassStatus" = scs."ClassStatus"
    JOIN "Students" AS st ON ss."StudentID" = st."StudentID"
    JOIN "Classes" AS cl ON ss."ClassID" = cl."ClassID"
    JOIN "Subjects" AS s ON cl."SubjectID" = s."SubjectID"
    JOIN "Categories" AS c ON s."CategoryID" = c."CategoryID"
    WHERE scs."ClassStatusDescription" = 'Completed'
      AND c."CategoryDescription" LIKE '%English%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Get grade distribution for English courses:**

    ```sql
    SELECT ss."Grade", COUNT(*) AS "NumberOfStudents"
    FROM "Student_Schedules" AS ss
    JOIN "Student_Class_Status" AS scs ON ss."ClassStatus" = scs."ClassStatus"
    JOIN "Classes" AS cl ON ss."ClassID" = cl."ClassID"
    JOIN "Subjects" AS s ON cl."SubjectID" = s."SubjectID"
    JOIN "Categories" AS c ON s."CategoryID" = c."CategoryID"
    WHERE scs."ClassStatusDescription" = 'Completed'
      AND c."CategoryDescription" LIKE '%English%'
    GROUP BY ss."Grade"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Find minimum and maximum grades in English courses:**

    ```sql
    SELECT MIN(ss."Grade") AS "MinGrade", MAX(ss."Grade") AS "MaxGrade"
    FROM "Student_Schedules" AS ss
    JOIN "Student_Class_Status" AS scs ON ss."ClassStatus" = scs."ClassStatus"
    JOIN "Classes" AS cl ON ss."ClassID" = cl."ClassID"
    JOIN "Subjects" AS s ON cl."SubjectID" = s."SubjectID"
    JOIN "Categories" AS c ON s."CategoryID" = c."CategoryID"
    WHERE scs."ClassStatusDescription" = 'Completed'
      AND c."CategoryDescription" LIKE '%English%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Count the number of students who completed English courses:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ss."StudentID") AS "TotalStudents"
    FROM "Student_Schedules" AS ss
    JOIN "Student_Class_Status" AS scs ON ss."ClassStatus" = scs."ClassStatus"
    JOIN "Classes" AS cl ON ss."ClassID" = cl."ClassID"
    JOIN "Subjects" AS s ON cl."SubjectID" = s."SubjectID"
    JOIN "Categories" AS c ON s."CategoryID" = c."CategoryID"
    WHERE scs."ClassStatusDescription" = 'Completed'
      AND c."CategoryDescription" LIKE '%English%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List all students and their grades in English courses:**

    ```sql
    SELECT ss."StudentID", st."StudLastName", ss."Grade"
    FROM "Student_Schedules" AS ss
    JOIN "Student_Class_Status" AS scs ON ss."ClassStatus" = scs."ClassStatus"
    JOIN "Students" AS st ON ss."StudentID" = st."StudentID"
    JOIN "Classes" AS cl ON ss."ClassID" = cl."ClassID"
    JOIN "Subjects" AS s ON cl."SubjectID" = s."SubjectID"
    JOIN "Categories" AS c ON s."CategoryID" = c."CategoryID"
    WHERE scs."ClassStatusDescription" = 'Completed'
      AND c."CategoryDescription" LIKE '%English%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **List subjects with 'English' in their names (in case category is not sufficient):**

    ```sql
    SELECT s."SubjectID", s."SubjectName"
    FROM "Subjects" AS s
    WHERE s."SubjectName" LIKE '%English%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the data and relationships necessary to produce the final list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile.

*Note:* Since quintile calculations and sorting are more complex and may require advanced SQL features or multiple queries, they are not included here as per the instruction to write simple SELECT queries without using Common Table Expressions (CTEs).Query:

Task: Could you provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile, we combine data from several tables: `Students`, `Student_Schedules`, `Classes`, `Subjects`, and `Categories`. We identify English courses by selecting subjects under the 'English' category. We then find students who have completed these courses (with an appropriate `ClassStatus`) and calculate their grade quintiles. The final list is sorted from highest to lowest quintile.

```csv
StudLastName,QuintileRank
Lastname:str,QuintileRank:int (5 to 1)
...
```

*(Grades are divided into quintiles, with 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest. The list is sorted from highest to lowest quintile.)*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 08:36:06 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile, we combine data from several tables: `Students`, `Student_Schedules`, `Classes`, `Subjects`, and `Categories`. We identify English courses by selecting subjects under the 'English' category. We then find students who have completed these courses (with an appropriate `ClassStatus`) and calculate their grade quintiles. The final list is sorted from highest to lowest quintile.

```csv
StudLastName,QuintileRank
Lastname:str,QuintileRank:int (5 to 1)
...
```

*(Grades are divided into quintiles, with 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest. The list is sorted from highest to lowest quintile.)* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
