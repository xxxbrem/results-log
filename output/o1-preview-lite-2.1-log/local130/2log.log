**Query 13: Retrieve Grades and Class IDs for All Students**

```sql
SELECT "StudentID", "ClassID", "Grade"
FROM "Student_Schedules"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Note:** These queries are designed to help understand the data in the relevant tables and columns. They explore different aspects such as categories, subjects, class statuses, student grades, and relationships between tables.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Queries 1-3**: Explore basic information from the individual tables to understand the values present in `Categories`, `Subjects`, and `Student_Class_Status`.
- **Queries 4-6**: Connect multiple tables to see relationships between classes, subjects, categories, and student schedules.
- **Query 7**: Identifies the specific `ClassStatus` value that corresponds to 'Completed', which is essential for filtering completed courses.
- **Queries 8-9**: Retrieve the last names and grades of students who have completed English courses.
- **Queries 10-13**: Further explore grades and perform aggregate calculations like average grade and count of students.

---

This approach ensures that we have a solid understanding of the data and relationships in the database, which is crucial for accomplishing the original task of listing students who completed English courses, along with their quintile ranks based on grades.Query:

Task: Could you provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile, we combine data from several tables: `Students`, `Student_Schedules`, `Classes`, `Subjects`, and `Categories`. We identify English courses by selecting subjects under the 'English' category. We then find students who have completed these courses (with an appropriate `ClassStatus`) and calculate their grade quintiles. The final list is sorted from highest to lowest quintile.

```csv
StudLastName,QuintileRank
Lastname:str,QuintileRank:int (5 to 1)
...
```

*(Grades are divided into quintiles, with 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest. The list is sorted from highest to lowest quintile.)*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 08:36:24 - root - INFO - To provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile, we combine data from several tables: `"Students"`, `"Student_Schedules"`, `"Classes"`, `"Subjects"`, and `"Categories"`. We identify English courses by selecting subjects under the 'English' category. We then find students who have completed these courses (with `"ClassStatusDescription"` = 'Completed') and calculate their **average grade per student** across completed English courses. We compute their grade quintiles using the `NTILE` function over the average grades ordered in ascending order, so that higher quintile ranks correspond to higher grades. The final list is sorted from highest to lowest quintile.

2025-01-24 08:36:24 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile, we combine data from several tables: `Students`, `Student_Schedules`, `Classes`, `Subjects`, and `Categories`. We identify English courses by selecting subjects under the 'English' category. We then find students who have completed these courses (with an appropriate `ClassStatus`) and calculate their grade quintiles. The final list is sorted from highest to lowest quintile.

```csv
StudLastName,QuintileRank
Lastname:str,QuintileRank:int (5 to 1)
...
```

*(Grades are divided into quintiles, with 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest. The list is sorted from highest to lowest quintile.)* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-24 08:36:52 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile, we combine data from several tables: `Students`, `Student_Schedules`, `Classes`, `Subjects`, and `Categories`. We identify English courses by selecting subjects under the 'English' category. We then find students who have completed these courses (with an appropriate `ClassStatus`) and calculate their grade quintiles. The final list is sorted from highest to lowest quintile.

```csv
StudLastName,QuintileRank
Lastname:str,QuintileRank:int (5 to 1)
...
```

*(Grades are divided into quintiles, with 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest. The list is sorted from highest to lowest quintile.)* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
