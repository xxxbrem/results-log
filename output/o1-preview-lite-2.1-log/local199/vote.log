After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer for the following reasons:

**Reason:**

- **Correctness**: The query in `0result.sql` accurately computes the total rentals per store, year, and month by grouping the rentals appropriately.
- **Compatibility**: It uses standard SQL features without relying on window functions or Common Table Expressions (CTEs), ensuring broader compatibility across different database systems, including older versions that may not support newer SQL features.
- **Clarity**: The query structure is clear and straightforward, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Output**: It produces the correct results, matching the expected output for the task.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

0result.sql
