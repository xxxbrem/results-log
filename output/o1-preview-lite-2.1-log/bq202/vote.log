After comparing both SQL queries, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Structured Query:** `1result.sql` uses two Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize the query logically:
  - **`top_station`** identifies the station with the most trips in 2018.
  - **`peak_stats`** calculates the trip counts per day of the week and hour for that station.
- **Clarity and Readability:** Separating the steps enhances readability and makes the query easier to understand and maintain.
- **Explicit Selection:** `1result.sql` explicitly selects `trip_count` in the `peak_stats` CTE and uses it in the `ORDER BY` clause, which is a good practice for clarity.

Both queries produce the same result:

```
Peak_day_of_week,Peak_hour
5,18
```

But `1result.sql` is preferred due to its clearer structure and better coding practices.
