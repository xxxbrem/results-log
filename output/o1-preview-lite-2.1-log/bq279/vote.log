Between the two SQL queries provided, **`0result.sql`** is the correct choice.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Inclusion of Both Start and End Stations:**
   - **`0result.sql`** considers both `start_station_id` and `end_station_id` from trips in 2013 and 2014. This means it includes all stations that were used either as a starting point or an ending point during those years.
   - **`1result.sql`** only considers `start_station_id`, potentially missing stations that were only used as end stations in trips.

2. **Comprehensive Station Usage:**
   - Including both start and end stations provides a more accurate and complete count of active and closed stations involved in trips during 2013 and 2014.
   - By accounting for all stations used in trips, **`0result.sql`** ensures that no station is overlooked in the analysis.

3. **Correct Handling of Station IDs:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses `UNION ALL` to combine the distinct station IDs from both start and end stations, preventing the loss of any station records.
   - It correctly casts `end_station_id` to `INT64` to match the data type of `start_station_id` and `station_id`, ensuring a proper join with the stations table.

4. **Results Verification:**
   - Both queries produce the same output in terms of the number of active and closed stations for each year. However, **`0result.sql`** achieves this through a more thorough and accurate method.

5. **Limitations Acknowledged:**
   - Both queries use the current `status` from the stations table, which may not reflect the station's status in 2013 or 2014 due to a lack of historical status data.
   - Despite this limitation, **`0result.sql`** provides a better approach by considering all possible stations involved in trips.

Therefore, the correct SQL query that accurately provides the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014 is:
