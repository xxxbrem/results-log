After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, the most appropriate and correct query to answer the task "Which country has the highest percentage of population under the age of 25 in 2017?" is **1result.sql**.

**Reasoning:**

- **1result.sql** directly addresses the question by selecting only the country with the highest percentage of population under the age of 25. It orders the results in descending order based on `Percentage_Under_25` and limits the output to one record (`LIMIT 1`), which is precisely what is needed.

- **0result.sql** retrieves the top 10 countries (`LIMIT 10`), which includes unnecessary additional data beyond the scope of the question. While it does include the correct country (Uganda) at the top of the list, the extra results are not required.

- **2result.sql** is functionally identical to **1result.sql**, with a minor difference in aliasing `country_name` as `Country_Name`. Both queries return the same correct result. The choice between them is subjective; however, since the instruction is to choose one, we'll select **1result.sql**.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

1result.sql
