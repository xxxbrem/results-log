Begin Exploring Related Columns
Relevant columns and their potential usage:

- **"CLASS"**: Used to identify the class of the road.
- **"SUBCLASS"**: Used to identify the subclass of the road.
- **"LENGTH_M"**: Provides the length of road segments in meters.
- **"QUADKEY"**: Used to filter the data for specific geographical areas ('12020210' and '12020211').
- **"NAMES"**: May contain names of the locations, potentially useful for additional context.

Conditions that may be used:

- `WHERE "QUADKEY" = '12020210'` (to filter data for Amsterdam)
- `WHERE "QUADKEY" = '12020211'` (to filter data for Rotterdam)
- Alternatively, use `LIKE` operator for broader matching if necessary.

Here are the SQL queries:

1. Retrieve all classes of roads:

    ```sql
    SELECT "CLASS"
    FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. Retrieve distinct classes of roads:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "CLASS"
    FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. Retrieve classes and subclasses of roads:

    ```sql
    SELECT "CLASS", "SUBCLASS"
    FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. Retrieve distinct combinations of classes and subclasses:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "CLASS", "SUBCLASS"
    FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. Retrieve lengths and QUADKEYs of road segments:

    ```sql
    SELECT "LENGTH_M", "QUADKEY"
    FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. Retrieve lengths, classes, and subclasses for Amsterdam (QUADKEY '12020210'):

    ```sql
    SELECT "LENGTH_M", "CLASS", "SUBCLASS"
    FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
    WHERE "QUADKEY" = '12020210'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. Retrieve lengths, classes, and subclasses for Rotterdam (QUADKEY '12020211'):

    ```sql
    SELECT "LENGTH_M", "CLASS", "SUBCLASS"
    FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
    WHERE "QUADKEY" = '12020211'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. Calculate total length of roads per class in Amsterdam:

    ```sql
    SELECT "CLASS", SUM(CAST("LENGTH_M" AS FLOAT)) AS "Total_Length"
    FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
    WHERE "QUADKEY" = '12020210'
    GROUP BY "CLASS"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. Calculate total length of roads per class and subclass in Rotterdam:

    ```sql
    SELECT "CLASS", "SUBCLASS", SUM(CAST("LENGTH_M" AS FLOAT)) AS "Total_Length"
    FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
    WHERE "QUADKEY" = '12020211'
    GROUP BY "CLASS", "SUBCLASS"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. Calculate total length of roads per class and subclass for both cities:

    ```sql
    SELECT "QUADKEY", "CLASS", "SUBCLASS", SUM(CAST("LENGTH_M" AS FLOAT)) AS "Total_Length"
    FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
    WHERE "QUADKEY" IN ('12020210', '12020211')
    GROUP BY "QUADKEY", "CLASS", "SUBCLASS"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```Query:
SELECT "CLASS"
    FROM "NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA"."NETHERLANDS"."V_ROAD"
    LIMIT 100;

Task: Determine the total length of roads for each class and subclass in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, based on specific QUADKEY segments '12020210' and '12020211'? Show the class, subclass, and total road lengths for both cities

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
City,Class,Subclass,Total_Road_Length_meters
Amsterdam,class1:str,subclass1:str,length1:float
Amsterdam,class2:str,subclass2:str,length2:float
...
Rotterdam,class1:str,subclass1:str,length3:float
Rotterdam,class2:str,subclass2:str,length4:float
...
```

The table above shows the total length of roads for each class and subclass in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, based on the specific QUADKEY segments '12020210' and '12020211'. The lengths are given in meters..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NETHERLANDS_OPEN_MAP_DATA': {'NETHERLANDS': ['V_ADMINISTRATIVE', 'V_BUILDING', 'V_ROAD']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 02:38:21 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Determine the total length of roads for each class and subclass in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, based on specific QUADKEY segments '12020210' and '12020211'? Show the class, subclass, and total road lengths for both cities, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
City,Class,Subclass,Total_Road_Length_meters
Amsterdam,class1:str,subclass1:str,length1:float
Amsterdam,class2:str,subclass2:str,length2:float
...
Rotterdam,class1:str,subclass1:str,length3:float
Rotterdam,class2:str,subclass2:str,length4:float
...
```

The table above shows the total length of roads for each class and subclass in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, based on the specific QUADKEY segments '12020210' and '12020211'. The lengths are given in meters. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
