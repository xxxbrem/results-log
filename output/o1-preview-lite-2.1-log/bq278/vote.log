After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **1result.sql** is the correct answer. This is because it:

- **Improves Readability**: It rounds the average percentages to four decimal places using the `ROUND()` function, making the results cleaner and easier to interpret.
- **Consistent Column Naming**: It aliases `state_name` as `State_Name`, maintaining consistent capitalization and formatting across all columns.
- **Meets All Requirements**: It includes all the requested fields: number of buildings available for solar installations, percentage covered by Project Sunroof, percentage suitable for solar, total potential panel count, total kilowatt capacity, energy generation potential, carbon dioxide offset, and the gap in potential installations.
- **Clear Distinction Between Levels**: It distinguishes between the postal code and census tract levels by including the `Level` column with appropriate labels.

Therefore, **1result.sql** provides a more precise and user-friendly output, aligning well with the task's requirements.
