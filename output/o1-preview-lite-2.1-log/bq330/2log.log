```

**Explanation:**

The error occurs because `b.blockgroup_geom` is neither grouped nor aggregated in the `SELECT` clause, which is not allowed in SQL when using `GROUP BY`. To resolve this, we can use the `ANY_VALUE()` function to wrap the expressions involving `b.blockgroup_geom`. This function returns an arbitrary value of `b.blockgroup_geom` for each group, allowing the query to execute without grouping by the geometry column.

By applying `ANY_VALUE()` to both `ST_AREA(b.blockgroup_geom)` and `ST_AREA(ST_INTERSECTION(z.zip_code_geom, b.blockgroup_geom))`, we ensure that all selected fields are either grouped or aggregated, satisfying the SQL requirements.

    ) AS overlap_ratio
  FROM

  AVG(overlap_ratio) AS avg_overlap_ratio
FROM
  overlaps
GROUP BY
  zip_code
ORDER BY
  avg_overlap_ratio DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

The error occurs because SQL does not allow nested aggregate functions. In the original query, `AVG()` was applied over an expression containing `ANY_VALUE()`, which is an aggregate function. Specifically, the expression:

```sql
AVG(SAFE_DIVIDE(
  ST_AREA(ST_INTERSECTION(ANY_VALUE(z.zip_code_geom), ANY_VALUE(b.blockgroup_geom))),
  ST_AREA(ANY_VALUE(b.blockgroup_geom))
))
```

contains nested aggregates (`AVG` over `ANY_VALUE`), which is not permitted.

To resolve this, we can perform the calculation of the overlap ratios in a subquery (using a Common Table Expression or CTE) and then compute the average in the outer query. This eliminates the nested aggregation issue.

**Breakdown of the corrected query:**

1. **CTE (`overlaps`)**: This subquery calculates the overlap ratio between each zip code and its overlapping block groups.

    ```sql
    WITH overlaps AS (
      SELECT
        z.zip_code,
        b.geo_id,
        SAFE_DIVIDE(
          ST_AREA(ST_INTERSECTION(z.zip_code_geom, b.blockgroup_geom)),
          ST_AREA(b.blockgroup_geom)
        ) AS overlap_ratio
      FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.geo_us_boundaries.zip_codes` AS z
      INNER JOIN
        (
          SELECT geo_id, blockgroup_geom
          FROM `bigquery-public-data.geo_census_blockgroups.us_blockgroups_national`
          WHERE state_fips_code = '08' AND blockgroup_geom IS NOT NULL
        ) AS b
      ON
        ST_INTERSECTS(z.zip_code_geom, b.blockgroup_geom)
      WHERE
        z.state_code = 'CO`
        AND z.zip_code_geom IS NOT NULL
    )
    ```

    - `ST_INTERSECTION(z.zip_code_geom, b.blockgroup_geom)`: Calculates the geometric overlap between the zip code area and the block group.
    - `ST_AREA(...)`: Computes the area of the overlap and the area of the block group.
    - `SAFE_DIVIDE(...)`: Safely divides the overlap area by the block group area to get the overlap ratio. `SAFE_DIVIDE` returns `NULL` if the denominator is zero, preventing division-by-zero errors.

2. **Outer Query**: Calculates the average overlap ratio for each zip code.

    ```sql
    SELECT
      zip_code,
      AVG(overlap_ratio) AS avg_overlap_ratio
    FROM
      overlaps
    GROUP BY
      zip_code
    ORDER BY
      avg_overlap_ratio DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    - `AVG(overlap_ratio)`: Computes the average overlap ratio per zip code.
    - The `GROUP BY` clause groups the data by `zip_code`.
    - The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order of average overlap ratio.
    - The `LIMIT` restricts the output to the top 100 zip codes.

**Why This Works:**

By moving the calculation of `overlap_ratio` into the `overlaps` CTE, we remove any nested aggregate functions from the main query. The main query only performs the aggregation `AVG(overlap_ratio)` without any nested aggregates. This conforms to SQL standards and resolves the error.

**Note on Aggregations:**

- **Aggregates of Aggregates**: SQL does not allow the use of an aggregate function, like `AVG()`, over an expression that contains another aggregate function, like `ANY_VALUE()`, `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, etc.
- **ANY_VALUE()**: While `ANY_VALUE()` can be used to bypass strictness in grouping (e.g., when you have non-aggregated columns in your `SELECT` list that are not part of the `GROUP BY`), using it inside another aggregate function leads to nested aggregation, which is invalid.

By restructuring the query to compute all necessary values before performing any aggregation, we ensure compliance with SQL rules and prevent errors related to nested aggregates.

**Example Results:**

The corrected query will output the zip codes in Colorado along with their average overlap ratio with the block groups they intersect. This information can be used to identify zip codes with the highest average overlap, which may indicate areas where zip codes align closely with block groups.

---

**Final Answer:**

Please use the corrected SQL query above to compute the average overlap ratio between zip codes and block groups in Colorado. This should resolve the error and provide the desired results.

2025-01-24 03:41:11 - root - INFO - It appears that you've attempted to execute the text:

```sql
-- There are no additional SQL queries provided for correction.
```

as an SQL query. This text is not a valid SQL statement but rather a comment indicating that there are no further SQL queries to correct. In SQL, the double hyphen `--` is used to denote a single-line comment, and anything following it on the same line is ignored during execution.

Attempting to run this as an SQL query results in a syntax error:

```
400 Syntax error: Unexpected end of statement at [1:64]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unexpected end of statement at [1:64]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Syntax Error:** The error occurs because the SQL engine expects actual SQL statements to execute, but receives a comment with no executable code.
- **Unexpected End of Statement:** The SQL parser reaches the end of the input without finding a valid SQL statement to execute, hence the "Unexpected end of statement" error.

**Next Steps:**

If you have any specific SQL queries that are causing errors or need correction, please provide them, and I will be happy to help you by correcting the queries and explaining any issues.

For example, if you have an SQL query that is producing an error, you can share it like this:

```sql
-- Example of an erroneous SQL query
SELECT name, age
FROM users
WHERE name = 'John
```

And I can help correct it:

```sql
-- Corrected SQL query
SELECT name, age
FROM users
WHERE name = 'John';
```

**Alternatively**, if you need assistance with any of the previous SQL queries we've been discussing or have new ones to review, please share them, and I'll provide corrections or explanations as needed.

2025-01-24 03:41:39 - root - INFO - It appears that you've attempted to execute the following text as an SQL query:

```sql
-- There are no additional SQL queries provided for correction.
```

This text is a **comment** in SQL and not an executable SQL statement. In SQL, any text following `--` on the same line is treated as a comment and is ignored by the SQL engine. If you try to run a comment without any accompanying SQL commands, you will encounter a syntax error because the SQL parser expects valid SQL statements to execute.

The error message you received:

```
400 Syntax error: Unexpected end of statement at [1:64]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unexpected end of statement at [1:64]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Syntax Error:** The SQL parser did not find any valid SQL statements to execute and reached the end of the input unexpectedly.
- **Unexpected End of Statement:** The parser was expecting an SQL statement but found only a comment, leading to the error at position `[1:64]`, which corresponds to the end of the comment line.

**How to Resolve:**

1. **Ensure You're Executing Valid SQL Statements:**
   - Remove any standalone comments without SQL code.
   - Include actual SQL commands that you wish to execute.

2. **Provide the SQL Query for Assistance:**
   - If you intended to run an SQL query and received an error, please share the SQL code.
   - Include the specific error message you encountered.

**Example of Correct Usage:**

If you have an SQL query that needs correction or is causing an error, please provide it like this:

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM users
WHERE name = 'John';
```

**And the corresponding error message:**

```
Error: Syntax error: Unexpected end of string at [4:20]
```

**Assistance:**

# Calculation Method: Overlap Ratio and Bank Location Data

This document describes the method used to calculate the number of bank institutions per postal code area (ZIP code) by combining geospatial data and bank location data, focusing on the overlap between postal code areas and census block groups.

## 1. Geospatial Intersection of Postal Code Areas and Census Block Groups
We are using two geographical units:
- **ZIP Code Areas**: Represented by geometries from the ZIP code boundaries dataset.
- **Census Block Groups**: Represented by geometries from the national census block groups dataset.

### Key Calculation:
- The method calculates the area of overlap between each ZIP code's geometry and each block group's geometry.
- The ratio of this intersection area to the total block group area is computed as the **overlap ratio**.

This overlap ratio represents the proportion of a block group that falls within a given ZIP code.

## 2. Bank Location Distribution Based on Overlap Ratio
The next step involves distributing the number of bank locations to the overlapping census block groups based on the calculated overlap ratio.

### Key Calculation:
- For each block group, the number of bank locations is proportionally assigned based on the overlap size. The total number of bank locations in a ZIP code is distributed to the block groups using the overlap ratio.

This provides the number of bank institutions for each block group, adjusted for the overlap with ZIP code areas.

## 3. Aggregation by ZIP Code Area
Finally, the results are aggregated by ZIP code to determine which postal code has the highest number of bank institutions.

### Key Calculation:

Task: Which Colorado zip code has the highest concentration of bank locations per block group, based on the overlap between zip codes and block groups?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Zip_Code,Concentration
80202,5.5
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The Colorado ZIP code **80202**, located in downtown Denver, has the highest concentration of bank locations per block group, based on the overlap between zip codes and block groups..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'census_utility': ['fips_class_code', 'fips_codes_all', 'fips_codes_states', 'functional_status_codes', 'lsad_codes', 'mtfcc_feature_class_codes'], 'fda_food': ['food_enforcement', 'food_events'], 'fdic_banks': ['institutions', 'locations'], 'geo_census_blockgroups': ['blockgroups_01', 'blockgroups_02', 'blockgroups_04', 'blockgroups_05', 'blockgroups_06', 'blockgroups_08', 'blockgroups_09', 'blockgroups_10', 'blockgroups_11', 'blockgroups_12', 'blockgroups_13', 'blockgroups_15', 'blockgroups_16', 'blockgroups_17', 'blockgroups_18', 'blockgroups_19', 'blockgroups_20', 'blockgroups_21', 'blockgroups_22', 'blockgroups_23', 'blockgroups_24', 'blockgroups_25', 'blockgroups_26', 'blockgroups_27', 'blockgroups_28', 'blockgroups_29', 'blockgroups_30', 'blockgroups_31', 'blockgroups_32', 'blockgroups_33', 'blockgroups_34', 'blockgroups_35', 'blockgroups_36', 'blockgroups_37', 'blockgroups_38', 'blockgroups_39', 'blockgroups_40', 'blockgroups_41', 'blockgroups_42', 'blockgroups_44', 'blockgroups_45', 'blockgroups_46', 'blockgroups_47', 'blockgroups_48', 'blockgroups_49', 'blockgroups_50', 'blockgroups_51', 'blockgroups_53', 'blockgroups_54', 'blockgroups_55', 'blockgroups_56', 'blockgroups_60', 'blockgroups_66', 'blockgroups_69', 'blockgroups_72', 'blockgroups_78', 'us_blockgroups_national'], 'geo_us_boundaries': ['adjacent_counties', 'adjacent_states', 'cbsa', 'cnecta', 'coastline', 'congress_district_115', 'congress_district_116', 'counties', 'csa', 'metropolitan_divisions', 'national_outline', 'nws_forecast_regions', 'railways', 'states', 'urban_areas', 'zip_codes']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

LIMIT 1;Usage of ST_INTERSECTS: ST_INTERSECTS(geometry1, ST_GEOGFROMWKB(geometry2)) This function checks if the two geometries intersect. The first argument, geometry1, is compared with the second argument, geometry2, which is converted from its WKB (Well-Known Binary) representation to a geography type using ST_GEOGFROMWKB. If the two geometries share any portion of space, the function returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE. Usage of ST_CONTAINS: ST_CONTAINS(r1.geometry, r2.geometry) This function checks if the geometry r1.geometry completely contains the geometry r2.geometry. It returns TRUE if all points of r2.geometry are within r1.geometry and FALSE otherwise. This is useful for spatial containment queries, such as verifying whether one region is entirely within another. ARRAY_INTERSECTION(nodes1, nodes2): This function computes the intersection of the two arrays, returning a new array containing only the elements that are present in both nodes1 and nodes2. ARRAY_SIZE(...): This function then determines the size (or number of elements) in the resulting array from the intersection.
