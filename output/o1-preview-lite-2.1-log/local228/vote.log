After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Correctness**: `0result.sql` accurately identifies the top three batsmen and bowlers per season based on total runs and wickets, respectively. It adheres strictly to the requirement of excluding certain dismissal types ('run out', 'hit wicket', 'retired hurt') for bowlers.

2. **Tie-breaking Logic**: It correctly implements the tie-breaking condition by prioritizing players with lower `player_id`s in cases where players have equal total runs or wickets. This is achieved by ordering the results with `ORDER BY "total_runs" DESC, "player_id" ASC` for batsmen and similarly for bowlers.

3. **Structure and Readability**: The SQL code in `0result.sql` is well-organized, using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into understandable parts:
   - **`batsman_runs`**: Computes total runs per batsman per season.
   - **`batsman_rankings`**: Ranks batsmen within each season.
   - **`top_batsmen`**: Filters out the top three batsmen per season.
   - The same logical structure is applied to bowlers.

4. **Final Output**: It correctly pivots the data to present the top three batsmen and bowlers side by side for each season, fulfilling the requirement to display them in the same row.

5. **Consistent Results**: The output in `0result.csv` matches the expected results, and the data aligns with the top performers in each season as per known records.

Therefore, based on the above reasons, the SQL code in `0result.sql` is the most appropriate and correct solution to the problem.
