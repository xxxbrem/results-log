Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine which constructors had the top 3 combined points from their best driver and team, and the years they achieved them, we need to consider several tables and columns from the provided database schema.

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

1. **Table:** `"results"`
   - `"race_id"`: Used to join with the `"races"` table to get the year of each race.
   - `"driver_id"`: Identifies the driver in each race result.
   - `"constructor_id"`: Identifies the constructor/team associated with each result.
   - `"points"`: Points earned by the driver in that race; used to calculate totals.

2. **Table:** `"races"`
   - `"race_id"`: Used to join with the `"results"` table.
   - `"year"`: The year the race took place; used to group results by year.

3. **Table:** `"constructors"`
   - `"constructor_id"`: Used to join with the `"results"` table.
   - `"name"`: The name of the constructor; used for final output.

4. **Table:** `"drivers"`
   - `"driver_id"`: Used to join with the `"results"` table.
   - `"forename"` and `"surname"`: May be used to identify drivers (optional for this task).

### Potential Conditions and Usage:

- **Joins:** To combine data across tables using `race_id`, `constructor_id`, and `driver_id`.
- **Grouping:** Aggregate data by `constructor_id`, `driver_id`, and `year` to calculate total points.
- **Aggregate Functions:** Use `SUM("points")` to calculate total points for drivers and constructors.
- **Ordering:** Order results to find top performers.
- **Subqueries:** May be utilized to find the best driver for each constructor per year.

### Sample SQL Queries:

Here are 10 SQL queries to explore and understand the relevant data:

1. **Retrieve Distinct Years from the Races Table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM "races"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List All Constructors:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "constructor_id", "name"
   FROM "constructors"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get Total Points per Constructor per Race:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", "race_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM "results"
   GROUP BY "constructor_id", "race_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Calculate Total Points per Constructor per Year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", r."year", SUM(rs."points") AS "total_points"
   FROM "results" rs
   JOIN "races" r ON rs."race_id" = r."race_id"
   GROUP BY "constructor_id", r."year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Compute Total Points per Driver per Constructor per Year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT rs."constructor_id", rs."driver_id", r."year", SUM(rs."points") AS "driver_points"
   FROM "results" rs
   JOIN "races" r ON rs."race_id" = r."race_id"
   GROUP BY rs."constructor_id", rs."driver_id", r."year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Identify the Best Driver for Each Constructor per Year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT rs."constructor_id", rs."driver_id", r."year", SUM(rs."points") AS "driver_points"
   FROM "results" rs
   JOIN "races" r ON rs."race_id" = r."race_id"
   GROUP BY rs."constructor_id", rs."driver_id", r."year"
   ORDER BY rs."constructor_id", r."year", "driver_points" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get Constructor Names and Their Total Points per Year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c."name" AS "constructor_name", r."year", SUM(rs."points") AS "constructor_points"
   FROM "results" rs
   JOIN "races" r ON rs."race_id" = r."race_id"
   JOIN "constructors" c ON rs."constructor_id" = c."constructor_id"
   GROUP BY c."name", r."year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List Driver Names and Their Total Points per Year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT d."forename", d."surname", r."year", SUM(rs."points") AS "driver_points"
   FROM "results" rs
   JOIN "races" r ON rs."race_id" = r."race_id"
   JOIN "drivers" d ON rs."driver_id" = d."driver_id"
   GROUP BY d."driver_id", r."year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate Average Points per Constructor per Race per Year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT rs."constructor_id", r."year", AVG(rs."points") AS "avg_points_per_race"
   FROM "results" rs
   JOIN "races" r ON rs."race_id" = r."race_id"
   GROUP BY rs."constructor_id", r."year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve the Number of Races per Year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT r."year", COUNT(DISTINCT r."race_id") AS "number_of_races"
    FROM "races" r
    GROUP BY r."year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution of points among constructors and drivers across different years, which is essential for calculating the combined points needed to determine the top 3 constructors as per the task.

---

**Note:** To solve the original task completely, we would need to perform additional calculations to sum the constructor points and the points of their best driver for each year, then rank the results to find the top 3. This would typically involve more complex SQL queries that might use subqueries or Common Table Expressions (CTEs), but since the instructions specify to avoid CTEs and focus on SELECT queries only, the above queries serve as building blocks for understanding the data necessary to address the task.Query:

Task: Which constructors had the top 3 combined points from their best driver and team, and in which years did they achieve them?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Constructor_Name,Year,Combined_Points
constructor1:str,year1:int,combined_points1:float
constructor2:str,year2:int,combined_points2:float
constructor3:str,year3:int,combined_points3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

The table above lists the top 3 constructors with the highest combined points from their best driver and team, along with the years they achieved them..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 10:01:25 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which constructors had the top 3 combined points from their best driver and team, and in which years did they achieve them?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Constructor_Name,Year,Combined_Points
constructor1:str,year1:int,combined_points1:float
constructor2:str,year2:int,combined_points2:float
constructor3:str,year3:int,combined_points3:float

```

The table above lists the top 3 constructors with the highest combined points from their best driver and team, along with the years they achieved them. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
