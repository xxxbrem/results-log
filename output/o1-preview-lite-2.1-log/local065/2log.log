Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **pizza_customer_orders**

   - `"order_id"`: Identifies each customer order.
   - `"pizza_id"`: Determines the type of pizza ordered.
   - `"extras"`: Contains extra toppings added to the pizza (each extra topping is charged at $1).
   - **Conditions**: Use to retrieve orders and calculate extra toppings cost.

2. **pizza_runner_orders**

   - `"order_id"`: Matches with customer orders.
   - `"cancellation"`: Indicates if an order was canceled. Canceled orders should be excluded.
   - **Conditions**: Exclude orders where `"cancellation"` is not null or not empty.

3. **pizza_names**

   - `"pizza_id"`: Used to join with customer orders.
   - `"pizza_name"`: Identifies the pizza as 'Meat Lovers' or 'Vegetarian'.
   - **Conditions**: Filter for orders containing 'Meat Lovers' or 'Vegetarian' pizzas.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List all available pizzas and their IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "pizza_id", "pizza_name" FROM "pizza_names";
   ```

2. **View the first 100 entries in customer orders:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "pizza_customer_orders" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **View the first 100 entries in runner orders:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "pizza_runner_orders" LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find all canceled orders (to be excluded):**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "pizza_runner_orders"
   WHERE "cancellation" IS NOT NULL AND "cancellation" <> ''
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find all completed (non-canceled) orders:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "pizza_runner_orders"
   WHERE "cancellation" IS NULL OR "cancellation" = ''
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join customer orders with runner orders to get completed orders:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."order_id", c."customer_id", c."pizza_id", c."extras"
   FROM "pizza_customer_orders" AS c
   INNER JOIN "pizza_runner_orders" AS r ON c."order_id" = r."order_id"
   WHERE r."cancellation" IS NULL OR r."cancellation" = ''
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Include pizza names to identify 'Meat Lovers' and 'Vegetarian' pizzas:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."order_id", n."pizza_name", c."extras"
   FROM "pizza_customer_orders" AS c
   INNER JOIN "pizza_runner_orders" AS r ON c."order_id" = r."order_id"
   INNER JOIN "pizza_names" AS n ON c."pizza_id" = n."pizza_id"
   WHERE r."cancellation" IS NULL OR r."cancellation" = ''
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Filter orders to only include 'Meat Lovers' and 'Vegetarian' pizzas:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."order_id", n."pizza_name", c."extras"
   FROM "pizza_customer_orders" AS c
   INNER JOIN "pizza_runner_orders" AS r ON c."order_id" = r."order_id"
   INNER JOIN "pizza_names" AS n ON c."pizza_id" = n."pizza_id"
   WHERE (n."pizza_name" = 'Meat Lovers' OR n."pizza_name" = 'Vegetarian')
     AND (r."cancellation" IS NULL OR r."cancellation" = '')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **View distinct values in the 'extras' column to understand its format:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "extras" FROM "pizza_customer_orders";
   ```

10. **Calculate the number of extra toppings for each order (handling nulls and empty strings):**

    ```sql
    SELECT c."order_id", c."extras",
      CASE
        WHEN c."extras" IS NULL OR c."extras" = '' THEN 0
        ELSE LENGTH(c."extras") - LENGTH(REPLACE(c."extras", ',', '')) + 1
      END AS "extra_count"
    FROM "pizza_customer_orders" AS c
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Combine all relevant data to prepare for income calculation:**

    ```sql
    SELECT c."order_id", n."pizza_name", c."extras",
      CASE
        WHEN c."extras" IS NULL OR c."extras" = '' THEN 0
        ELSE LENGTH(c."extras") - LENGTH(REPLACE(c."extras", ',', '')) + 1
      END AS "extra_count"
    FROM "pizza_customer_orders" AS c
    INNER JOIN "pizza_runner_orders" AS r ON c."order_id" = r."order_id"
    INNER JOIN "pizza_names" AS n ON c."pizza_id" = n."pizza_id"
    WHERE (n."pizza_name" = 'Meat Lovers' OR n."pizza_name" = 'Vegetarian')
      AND (r."cancellation" IS NULL OR r."cancellation" = '')
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the structure and content of the relevant tables. By examining the data retrieved, we can determine the number of completed orders for 'Meat Lovers' and 'Vegetarian' pizzas, the number of extra toppings for each order, and ensure that canceled orders are excluded. This information is essential for calculating the total income earned by Pizza Runner.Query:

Task: Calculate the total income from Meat Lovers pizzas priced at $12 and Vegetarian pizzas at $10. Include any extra toppings charged at $1 each. Ensure that canceled orders are filtered out. How much money has Pizza Runner earned in total?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Total_Earnings
earnings:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To calculate the total income earned by Pizza Runner, sum the prices of all Meat Lovers pizzas at $12 each and Vegetarian pizzas at $10 each, add $1 for each extra topping included in the orders, and exclude any canceled orders..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 16:50:17 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Calculate the total income from Meat Lovers pizzas priced at $12 and Vegetarian pizzas at $10. Include any extra toppings charged at $1 each. Ensure that canceled orders are filtered out. How much money has Pizza Runner earned in total?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Total_Earnings

(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To calculate the total income earned by Pizza Runner, sum the prices of all Meat Lovers pizzas at $12 each and Vegetarian pizzas at $10 each, add $1 for each extra topping included in the orders, and exclude any canceled orders. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
