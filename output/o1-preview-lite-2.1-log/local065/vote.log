After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Use of Cleaned Data:** The first SQL query (`0result.sql`) uses the cleaned tables `"pizza_clean_customer_orders"` and `"pizza_clean_runner_orders"`. These tables likely contain data that has been properly formatted and cleansed of anomalies, ensuring more accurate calculations.

- **Correct Handling of Cancellations:** Both queries correctly exclude canceled orders by checking where the `"cancellation"` field is `NULL` or empty. This adheres to the requirement to exclude canceled orders from the total income calculation.

- **Inclusion of All Completed Orders:** The first query does not exclude orders based on the `"pickup_time"`. The second query (`2result.sql`) adds an extra condition to exclude orders where `"pickup_time"` is `NULL` or empty:
  
  ```sql
  AND r."pickup_time" IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(r."pickup_time") <> ''
  ```
  
  The task does not specify that orders without a `"pickup_time"` should be excluded—only that canceled orders should be filtered out. Some valid orders might not have a `"pickup_time"` recorded but were completed and should be included in the total earnings. Therefore, the first query correctly includes all non-canceled orders.

- **Adherence to Requirements:** The first query aligns precisely with the task requirements—calculating total income from Meat Lovers and Vegetarian pizzas, including extra toppings, and ensuring canceled orders are excluded.

- **Result Consistency:** Both queries yield the same total earnings of **$142**, but the first query does so without potentially omitting valid orders due to the additional `"pickup_time"` condition.

**Conclusion:**

The first SQL query (`0result.sql`) accurately computes the total income as per the given requirements and uses cleaned data for better accuracy.
