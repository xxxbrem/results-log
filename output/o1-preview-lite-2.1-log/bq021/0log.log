2025-01-22 21:46:52 - root - INFO - Apologies for the confusion.

The error in your SQL query occurs because the subqueries were placeholders and need to be replaced with the actual subqueries. When you include comments like `-- Same as previous bike subquery`, the SQL parser expects actual subqueries in those places.

Here's the corrected SQL query with the subqueries filled in:

```sql
SELECT
  bike.start_station_name,
  bike.avg_bike_duration_minutes,
  taxi.avg_taxi_duration_minutes
FROM (
  SELECT
    start_station_id,
    end_station_id,
    ROUND(start_station_latitude, 3) AS start_lat,
    ROUND(start_station_longitude, 3) AS start_lon,
    ROUND(end_station_latitude, 3) AS end_lat,
    ROUND(end_station_longitude, 3) AS end_lon,
    AVG(tripduration) / 60 AS avg_bike_duration_minutes,
    start_station_name
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM starttime) = 2016
  GROUP BY
    start_station_id,
    end_station_id,
    start_lat,
    start_lon,
    end_lat,
    end_lon,
    start_station_name
) AS bike
JOIN (
  SELECT
    pickup_lat,
    pickup_lon,
    dropoff_lat,
    dropoff_lon,
    AVG(trip_duration_minutes) AS avg_taxi_duration_minutes
  FROM (
    SELECT
      ROUND(pickup_latitude, 3) AS pickup_lat,
      ROUND(pickup_longitude, 3) AS pickup_lon,
      ROUND(dropoff_latitude, 3) AS dropoff_lat,
      ROUND(dropoff_longitude, 3) AS dropoff_lon,
      (UNIX_SECONDS(dropoff_datetime) - UNIX_SECONDS(pickup_datetime)) / 60 AS trip_duration_minutes
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2016`
    WHERE
      pickup_latitude IS NOT NULL
      AND dropoff_latitude IS NOT NULL
      AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM pickup_datetime) = 2016
  )
  GROUP BY
    pickup_lat,
    pickup_lon,
    dropoff_lat,
    dropoff_lon
) AS taxi
ON
  bike.start_lat = taxi.pickup_lat
  AND bike.start_lon = taxi.pickup_lon
  AND bike.end_lat = taxi.dropoff_lat
  AND bike.end_lon = taxi.dropoff_lon
WHERE
  bike.avg_bike_duration_minutes < taxi.avg_taxi_duration_minutes
ORDER BY
  bike.avg_bike_duration_minutes DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Explanation:**

- Replaced the placeholders in the subqueries with the actual subqueries from earlier.
- This SQL query:
  - Joins the average bike trip durations and average taxi trip durations on routes with matching rounded coordinates.
  - Filters for routes where the bike is faster than the taxi (`bike.avg_bike_duration_minutes < taxi.avg_taxi_duration_minutes`).
  - Orders the results to find the route with the longest average bike duration among these routes.
  - Limits the result to the top 1 entry.

**Answer:**

Based on the results you provided, among the top 20 Citi Bike routes in 2016 where bikes are faster than yellow taxis, the route with the longest average bike duration starts at:

```csv
start_station_name
W 56 St & 10 Ave
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Brief Explanation:**

From the data:

- Two routes where bikes are faster than taxis are:

  1. **Start Station:** W 41 St & 8 Ave
     - **Average Bike Duration:** ~12.91 minutes
     - **Average Taxi Duration:** ~14.09 minutes

  2. **Start Station:** W 56 St & 10 Ave
     - **Average Bike Duration:** ~15.23 minutes
     - **Average Taxi Duration:** ~17.26 minutes

- Among these, the route starting at **W 56 St & 10 Ave** has the longest average bike duration.

Therefore, the start station name of the required route is **W 56 St & 10 Ave**.

     AND bike.end_lon = taxi.dropoff_lon
   WHERE
     bike.avg_bike_duration_minutes < taxi.avg_taxi_duration_minutes
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Among these routes, find the one with the longest average bike duration and provide the start station name:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      bike.start_station_name,
      bike.avg_bike_duration_minutes
    FROM (
      -- Same as previous bike subquery

      bike.avg_bike_duration_minutes < taxi.avg_taxi_duration_minutes
    ORDER BY
      bike.avg_bike_duration_minutes DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

These queries step through the process of identifying the top 20 Citi Bike routes in 2016, comparing their average durations with taxi trips on similar routes, and finally finding the route that is faster by bike and has the longest average bike duration. The start station name of this route can be obtained from the last query.Query:

Task: For the top 20 Citi Bike routes in 2016, which route is faster than yellow taxis and among those, which one has the longest average bike duration? Please provide the start station name of this route. The coordinates are rounded to three decimals.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the specific start station name without access to the actual datasets..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'new_york': ['311_service_requests', 'citibike_stations', 'citibike_trips', 'nypd_mv_collisions', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2015', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2016', 'tlc_green_trips_2013', 'tlc_green_trips_2014', 'tlc_green_trips_2015', 'tlc_green_trips_2016', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2009', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2010', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2011', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2012', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2013', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2014', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2015', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2016', 'tree_census_1995', 'tree_census_2005', 'tree_census_2015', 'tree_species']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Please provide the start station name of this route. The coordinates are rounded to three decimals., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the specific start station name without access to the actual datasets. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
