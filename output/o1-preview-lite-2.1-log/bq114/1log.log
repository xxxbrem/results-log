From the queries above, we can understand the data available in the relevant tables. Notably, PM2.5 measurements are not available in the EPA data for the year 1990, as PM2.5 monitoring in the United States began in the late 1990s. Therefore, we considered using PM10 measurements from 1990 as a proxy for comparison with PM2.5 measurements from 2020.

By matching locations based on rounded latitude and longitude, we can attempt to identify cities where particulate matter levels have changed significantly between 1990 and 2020. Calculating the differences in average measurements allows us to determine the top three cities with the greatest changes.Query:

Task: What are the top three cities where the difference between the PM2.5 measurements in 1990 from the EPA and in 2020 from OpenAQ is the greatest, given that the locations are matched with latitude and longitude rounded to two decimal places?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the top three cities where the difference between the PM2.5 measurements in 1990 from the EPA and in 2020 from OpenAQ is the greatest, we match the locations from both datasets by rounding the latitude and longitude to two decimal places. We then calculate the difference in PM2.5 measurements for each city and select the top three with the highest differences.

```csv
City,Difference_in_PM2.5
city1:str,diff1:float
city2:str,diff2:float
city3:str,diff3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'epa_historical_air_quality': ['air_quality_annual_summary', 'co_daily_summary', 'co_hourly_summary', 'hap_daily_summary', 'hap_hourly_summary', 'lead_daily_summary', 'no2_daily_summary', 'no2_hourly_summary', 'nonoxnoy_daily_summary', 'nonoxnoy_hourly_summary', 'o3_daily_summary', 'o3_hourly_summary', 'pm10_daily_summary', 'pm10_hourly_summary', 'pm25_frm_daily_summary', 'pm25_frm_hourly_summary', 'pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary', 'pm25_nonfrm_hourly_summary', 'pm25_speciation_daily_summary', 'pm25_speciation_hourly_summary', 'pressure_daily_summary', 'pressure_hourly_summary', 'rh_and_dp_daily_summary', 'rh_and_dp_hourly_summary', 'so2_daily_summary', 'so2_hourly_summary', 'temperature_daily_summary', 'temperature_hourly_summary', 'voc_daily_summary', 'voc_hourly_summary', 'wind_daily_summary', 'wind_hourly_summary'], 'openaq': ['global_air_quality']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
