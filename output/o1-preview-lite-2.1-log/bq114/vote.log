After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the SQL in **1result.sql** best answers the question. This query uses PM10 data from the EPA in 1990 and compares it with PM2.5 data from OpenAQ in 2020, matching locations by rounding latitude and longitude to two decimal places. Since PM2.5 data is not available from the EPA for 1990, using PM10 as a proxy is a reasonable approach to estimate particulate matter levels for that time period.

The top three cities identified with the greatest differences are:
1. Sacramento
2. Indio
3. Visalia

They show significant changes in particulate matter measurements between 1990 and 2020.
