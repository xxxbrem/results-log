**Relevant Table:**

- **"university_faculty"**

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"FacRank"**: Used to group faculty members by their ranks.
- **"FacSalary"**: Used to calculate the average salary for each rank and compare individual salaries.
- **"FacFirstName"**: Used to retrieve faculty members' first names.
- **"FacLastName"**: Used to retrieve faculty members' last names.

Task: Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Rank,FirstName,LastName,Salary
rank1:str,first_name1:str,last_name1:str,salary1:float
rank2:str,first_name2:str,last_name2:str,salary2:float
...
```

We grouped the faculty members by their ranks, calculated the average salary for each rank, and then identified the faculty member whose salary is closest to the average salary within their respective rank. The table lists the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries of these faculty members..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 18:45:15 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Rank,FirstName,LastName,Salary
rank1:str,first_name1:str,last_name1:str,salary1:float
rank2:str,first_name2:str,last_name2:str,salary2:float
...
```

We grouped the faculty members by their ranks, calculated the average salary for each rank, and then identified the faculty member whose salary is closest to the average salary within their respective rank. The table lists the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries of these faculty members. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
