Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks, we'll need to analyze the `university_faculty` table.

**Relevant Table and Columns:**

- **Table:** `university_faculty`
  - **FacRank:** Used to group faculty members by their ranks.
  - **FacFirstName:** The first name of the faculty member.
  - **FacLastName:** The last name of the faculty member.
  - **FacSalary:** The salary of the faculty member.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Calculating the average salary for each rank using `GROUP BY` on `FacRank`.
- Computing the absolute difference between each faculty member's salary and the average salary of their rank.
- Ordering the results to find faculty members with salaries closest to the average for their rank.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all distinct faculty ranks:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "FacRank" FROM "university_faculty" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the number of faculty members in each rank:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   GROUP BY "FacRank"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Calculate the average salary for each rank:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   GROUP BY "FacRank"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List all faculty members with their ranks and salaries:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List faculty members ordered by salary descending:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   WHERE "FacSalary" IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY "FacSalary" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find the maximum and minimum salary for each rank:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacRank", MAX("FacSalary") AS "MaxSalary", MIN("FacSalary") AS "MinSalary"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   GROUP BY "FacRank"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List all Professors with their salaries:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   WHERE "FacRank" = 'Professor'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List faculty members with salaries above the overall average salary:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacSalary"
   FROM "university_faculty"
   WHERE "FacSalary" >= (SELECT AVG("FacSalary") FROM "university_faculty")
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Compute the average salary and list each faculty member's salary difference from the average of their rank:**
   ```sql
   SELECT f."FacFirstName", f."FacLastName", f."FacRank", f."FacSalary",
          AVG(f2."FacSalary") AS "AverageSalaryForRank",
          (f."FacSalary" - AVG(f2."FacSalary")) AS "SalaryDifference"
   FROM "university_faculty" f
   JOIN "university_faculty" f2 ON f."FacRank" = f2."FacRank"
   GROUP BY f."FacNo"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find the faculty member(s) whose salary is closest to the average salary for their rank:**
    ```sql
    SELECT f."FacRank", f."FacFirstName", f."FacLastName", f."FacSalary",
           ABS(f."FacSalary" - avg_salaries."AverageSalary") AS "SalaryDifference"
    FROM "university_faculty" f
    JOIN (
      SELECT "FacRank", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
      FROM "university_faculty"
      GROUP BY "FacRank"
    ) avg_salaries ON f."FacRank" = avg_salaries."FacRank"
    ORDER BY "FacRank", "SalaryDifference" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **List faculty members with their ranks and salaries, ordered by rank and salary:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "FacRank", "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacSalary"
    FROM "university_faculty"
    ORDER BY "FacRank", "FacSalary"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Find the average salary for each department within each rank:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "FacDept", "FacRank", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
    FROM "university_faculty"
    GROUP BY "FacDept", "FacRank"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List faculty members hired after a specific date:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "FacFirstName", "FacLastName", "FacRank", "FacHireDate", "FacSalary"
    FROM "university_faculty"
    WHERE "FacHireDate" > '2000-01-01'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Find the total salary expense per rank:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "FacRank", SUM("FacSalary") AS "TotalSalary"
    FROM "university_faculty"
    GROUP BY "FacRank"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find faculty members whose salary is exactly the average for their rank:**
    ```sql
    SELECT f."FacRank", f."FacFirstName", f."FacLastName", f."FacSalary"
    FROM "university_faculty" f
    JOIN (
      SELECT "FacRank", AVG("FacSalary") AS "AverageSalary"
      FROM "university_faculty"
      GROUP BY "FacRank"
    ) avg_salaries ON f."FacRank" = avg_salaries."FacRank"
    WHERE f."FacSalary" = avg_salaries."AverageSalary"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the distribution of salaries among faculty ranks and identifying the faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks.Query:

Task: Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Rank,FirstName,LastName,Salary
rank1:str,first_name1:str,last_name1:str,salary1:float
rank2:str,first_name2:str,last_name2:str,salary2:float
...
```

We grouped the faculty members by their ranks, calculated the average salary for each rank, and then identified the faculty member whose salary is closest to the average salary within their respective rank. The table lists the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries of these faculty members..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
