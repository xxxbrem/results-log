Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we'll first identify the relevant tables, columns, and potential conditions needed to retrieve the required data.

---

**Tables and Relevant Columns:**

1. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2017_1yr`
   - **`geo_id`:** Unique identifier for each county; used to extract state and county FIPS codes.
   - **`commute_45_59_mins`:** Number of employed individuals commuting between 45 to 59 minutes; used to calculate commute percentages.
   - **`employed_pop`:** Total number of employed individuals in the county; used as the denominator in calculating commute percentages.
   - **Potential Condition:** Filter counties located in Wisconsin by matching the state FIPS code (`55`) in the `geo_id`.

2. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality.county_natality`
   - **`Year`:** Date field representing the year; filter records for the year 2018.
   - **`County_of_Residence`:** Name of the county; used for display purposes.
   - **`County_of_Residence_FIPS`:** FIPS code of the county; used to join with the `geo_id` from the ACS table.
   - **`Ave_Number_of_Prenatal_Wks`:** Average number of prenatal weeks; the required metric for the task.
   - **Potential Condition:** Filter records where the `Year` is 2018 and counties are in Wisconsin (state FIPS code `55`).

These queries progressively explore the necessary data and conditions to fulfill the task, starting from simple data retrieval to more complex joins and calculations. The final required output would involve filtering and joining these datasets to list the average number of prenatal weeks in 2018 for counties in Wisconsin where more than 5% of the employed population had commutes of 45-59 minutes in 2017.Query:

Task: Please list the average number of prenatal weeks in 2018 for counties in Wisconsin where more than 5% of the employed population had commutes of 45-59 minutes in 2017.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To list the average number of prenatal weeks in 2018 for counties in Wisconsin where more than 5% of the employed population had commutes of 45-59 minutes in 2017, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Counties Meeting the Commute Criteria in 2017:**
   - **Data Source:** `county_2017_1yr` table from the `census_bureau_acs` dataset.
   - **Filter for Wisconsin Counties:**
     - Ensure the `State_Name` or equivalent field indicates Wisconsin.
   - **Calculate Commute Percentages:**
     - For each county, compute the percentage of the employed population commuting 45-59 minutes using:
       \[
       \text{Commute Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{commute\_45\_59\_mins}}{\text{employed\_pop}} \right) \times 100
       \]
   - **Filter Counties with Commute Percentage > 5%:**
     - Select counties where the calculated commute percentage exceeds 5%.

2. **Retrieve Average Number of Prenatal Weeks in 2018:**
   - **Data Source:** `county_natality` table from the `sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality` dataset.
   - **Filter for Year and Counties:**
     - Select records from 2018 (`Year` = 2018).
     - Match counties identified in step 1 using `County_of_Residence` or `County_of_Residence_FIPS`.
   - **Select Relevant Columns:**
     - Extract `County_of_Residence` and `Ave_Number_of_Prenatal_Wks`.

**Expected Output Format:**

```csv
County_of_Residence,Ave_Number_of_Prenatal_Wks
County1:str,average_weeks1:float
County2:str,average_weeks2:float
...
```
(Attention: answer in N rows, depending on the number of counties meeting the criteria.)

**Note:** The actual data values are not provided here. To obtain the exact figures, you would need to run the appropriate SQL queries on the specified datasets..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
