Begin Exploring Related Columns
First, we consider the relevant tables and columns for this task:

- **`bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries`**
  - `neighborhood`: 'Name of the neighborhood; used to group data by neighborhood.'
  - `neighborhood_geom`: 'Geographic polygon of the neighborhood boundary; used for spatial joins.'

- **`bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`**
  - `station_id`: 'Unique identifier for bike share stations.'
  - `name`: 'Name of the bike share station.'
  - `station_geom`: 'Geographic point location of the bike share station; used for spatial joins.'

- **`bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents`**
  - `unique_key`: 'Unique identifier for each crime incident.'
  - `category`: 'Category of the crime incident.'
  - `latitude` and `longitude`: 'Location of the crime incident; used to construct geographic points.'
  - `timestamp`: 'Date and time of the crime incident.'

Potential conditions that may be used include spatial joins to associate bike stations and crime incidents with neighborhoods based on their geographic locations.

Here are 12 BigQuery SQL queries to explore the data:

1. **List all neighborhoods in San Francisco**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     neighborhood
   FROM

     unique_key,
     category,
     latitude,
     longitude,
     timestamp
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents`
   LIMIT 100
   ```

4. **List neighborhoods with their geometric boundaries**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     neighborhood,
     ST_AsText(neighborhood_geom) AS geometry
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries`
   LIMIT 100
   ```

5. **Display bike share stations with their geographic points**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     station_id,
     name,
     ST_AsText(station_geom) AS station_location
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`
   LIMIT 100
   ```

6. **Associate bike share stations with neighborhoods**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     bsi.station_id,
     bsi.name,
     n.neighborhood
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info` AS bsi
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries` AS n
   ON
     ST_Contains(n.neighborhood_geom, bsi.station_geom)
   LIMIT 100
   ```

7. **Map crime incidents to neighborhoods**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     si.unique_key,
     si.category,
     n.neighborhood
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents` AS si
   JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries` AS n
   ON
     ST_Contains(n.neighborhood_geom, ST_GEOGPOINT(si.longitude, si.latitude))
   LIMIT 100
   ```

8. **Count bike share stations per neighborhood**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     n.neighborhood,
     COUNT(DISTINCT bsi.station_id) AS Number_of_Bike_Share_Stations
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries` AS n
   LEFT JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info` AS bsi
   ON
     ST_Contains(n.neighborhood_geom, bsi.station_geom)
   GROUP BY
     n.neighborhood
   LIMIT 100
   ```

9. **Count crime incidents per neighborhood**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     n.neighborhood,
     COUNT(si.unique_key) AS Total_Number_of_Crime_Incidents
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries` AS n
   LEFT JOIN
     `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents` AS si
   ON
     ST_Contains(n.neighborhood_geom, ST_GEOGPOINT(si.longitude, si.latitude))
   GROUP BY
     n.neighborhood
   LIMIT 100
   ```

10. **List crime incidents of a specific category (e.g., 'ASSAULT')**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      unique_key,
      category,
      latitude,
      longitude,
      timestamp
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents`
    WHERE
      LOWER(category) = 'assault'
    LIMIT 100
    ```

11. **Find bike share stations with capacity greater than 20**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      station_id,
      name,
      capacity
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`
    WHERE
      capacity > 20
    LIMIT 100
    ```

12. **Count crime incidents per category**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      category,
      COUNT(unique_key) AS Number_of_Incidents
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents`
    GROUP BY
      category
    LIMIT 100
    ```

These queries help in understanding the values and relationships in the relevant columns. By examining the data through these queries, we can prepare to compute, for each neighborhood, the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents.Query:

Task: For each neighborhood in San Francisco, list the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Neighborhood,Number_of_Bike_Share_Stations,Total_Number_of_Crime_Incidents
neighborhood1:str,num_stations1:int,num_incidents1:int
neighborhood2:str,num_stations2:int,num_incidents2:int
...
```

This table lists, for each neighborhood in San Francisco, the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'san_francisco_311': ['311_service_requests'], 'san_francisco_bikeshare': ['bikeshare_regions', 'bikeshare_station_info', 'bikeshare_station_status', 'bikeshare_trips'], 'san_francisco_film_locations': ['film_locations'], 'san_francisco_neighborhoods': ['boundaries'], 'san_francisco_sffd_service_calls': ['sffd_service_calls'], 'san_francisco_sfpd_incidents': ['sfpd_incidents'], 'san_francisco_transit_muni': ['calendar', 'fares', 'routes', 'shapes', 'stop_monitoring', 'stop_times', 'stops', 'trips', 'vehicle_monitoring'], 'san_francisco_trees': ['street_trees']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 06:21:56 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each neighborhood in San Francisco, list the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Neighborhood,Number_of_Bike_Share_Stations,Total_Number_of_Crime_Incidents
neighborhood1:str,num_stations1:int,num_incidents1:int
neighborhood2:str,num_stations2:int,num_incidents2:int
...
```

This table lists, for each neighborhood in San Francisco, the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-25 06:22:29 - root - INFO - I have reviewed the task and confirmed that the SQL query provided will produce the desired table, listing the number of bike share stations and the total number of crime incidents for each neighborhood in San Francisco.

Here is the final SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  n.neighborhood AS Neighborhood,
  (
    SELECT
      COUNT(DISTINCT bsi.station_id)
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info` AS bsi
    WHERE
      ST_Contains(n.neighborhood_geom, bsi.station_geom)
  ) AS Number_of_Bike_Share_Stations,
  (
    SELECT
      COUNT(si.unique_key)
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_sfpd_incidents.sfpd_incidents` AS si
    WHERE
      si.longitude IS NOT NULL AND si.latitude IS NOT NULL
      AND
      ST_Contains(n.neighborhood_geom, ST_GEOGPOINT(si.longitude, si.latitude))
  ) AS Total_Number_of_Crime_Incidents
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries` AS n
ORDER BY
  n.neighborhood;
```

This query will generate a table with the following format:

```csv
Neighborhood,Number_of_Bike_Share_Stations,Total_Number_of_Crime_Incidents
neighborhood1:str,num_stations1:int,num_incidents1:int
neighborhood2:str,num_stations2:int,num_incidents2:int
...
```

Please run this query in BigQuery to obtain the actual counts and the complete list of neighborhoods.
