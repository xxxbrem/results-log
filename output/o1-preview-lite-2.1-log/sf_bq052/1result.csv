4921024,Method and apparatus to fell a tree,1989-10-16,1,0,"This invention relates to a method and apparatus to sever a standing tree from its base, specifically the invention relates to a circular saw and a saw guard mounted on a vehicle to sever a tree by advancing the saw toward the tree. Many devices have been developed for felling trees. Some of these devices have been incorporated into self propelled mechanisms by mounting the felling head on a vehicle. The one thing all of the machines have in common is that a mechanism is provided to sever the tree from its base. Large shears, reciprocating saw blades, various configurations of chain saw blades and circular saws all have been used with some success. Generally the devices which use circular saws have a guard or housing about the circular saw blade to protect the operator and other personnel from the saw blade. An opening is usually provided in the front portion of the guard to expose a portion of the saw blade for cutting the tree. This arrangement, however, limits the diameter of the tree which can be cut. One method to cut oversize trees was to partially cut the front side of a tree, drive the felling apparatus to the back of the tree and complete the severing from the backside of the tree. This method is time consuming and often is not practical because of the density of most woodlots. Kurelek, U.S. Pat. No. 4,446,897, recognized the mobility problem and mounted the circular saw and felling head on a boom which is attached to a vehicle. Kurelek also placed a second opening in the saw guard to allow the saw blade to cut on either side. The Kurelek apparatus was thus able to cut in a straight ahead mode or in a side-swing or scything mode. Although an improvement over the prior art the Kurelek patent has the disadvantage of leaving the second portion of the saw blade exposed and unprotected. Kurelek also does not address the problem of felling an oversize tree. The present invention thus overcomes the limitations and problems in the prior art. The present invention includes a felling head mounted on a vehicle. The felling head includes a frame having an upper portion and a lower portion. A bunching arm is attached to the upper portion of the frame and a circular saw is supported by the lower portion of the frame. A guard overlays the circular saw. The guard has a first or fixed portion attached to the frame and a second or movable portion hinged to the first portion. A means to move the second portion of the guard has its first end attached to the frame and its second end attached to the second portion of the guard. An opening is provided in the fixed portion of the guard to expose a first arcuate portion of the circular saw. The second portion of the guard, when raised, exposes a second arcuate portion of the circular saw. To sever a large tree, the guard is raised and the second arcuate portion of the circular saw is advanced in a first direction to cut a first side of the tree. The vehicle is reversed, bringing the circular saw out of engagement with the tree. The vehicle is then advanced in a second direction which is at an angle to the first direction bringing the first arcuate portion of the saw into cutting engagement with the second side of the tree to completely sever the tree. It is an object of the invention to provide a mobile apparatus to fell a tree, the apparatus having a circular saw mounted thereon which can fell a tree larger in diameter than the radius of the saw. It is a further object of the invention to provide a guard about the circular saw, the guard having a movable portion which can selectively either expose or overlay a portion of the circular saw. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof and from the attached drawings."
6299663,Granulation method and apparatus therefor,1998-05-11,0,1,"The present invention is directed to a series of products formed by a pan granulation method for forming granules and more particularly, the present invention is directed to an improved fertilizer granule as well as additional granules. Generally speaking, pan granulation has been proposed in the art many times previously and with significant variations. One of the latest issued patents in the art to which the present invention relates is U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,765, issued to Derdall et al., Oct. 24, 1995. The reference teaches a process for pan granulating a particulate material. Based on the teachings of the Derdall et al. reference, a final particle size distribution that is achievable by practicing the invention is between about -5 mesh to about +10 mesh. In order to initiate the process, the Derdall et al. process is limited to the introduction of a seeding material typically between about -14 mesh and +28 mesh. This is required in order to control the granule growth and as indicated in the Derdall et al. disclosure, seed minimizes mutual agglomeration and results in high yields being obtained. The Derdall et al. reference further indicates that the proper sizing of the seed is fundamental to the operation of the process for granulation in order to have product yields exceed 90%. Reference is made in the disclosure that a seed core in the range of -14 mesh to +35 mesh is required in order to achieve a steady state and maintain uniform size distribution of between -8 mesh to +6 mesh. One of the greatest limitations existing in the granulation art is centered on the fact that known processes require a seeding agent in order to achieve the proper conditions for material accretion to result in a pellet or granule. By making use of a seed, the resulting granule is adversely affected in two key properties; roundness and cross-sectional uniformity. Typically, seeding material is not round and as the precursor particle, the result is irregular initial feedstock accretion which, in turn, forms an out-of-round particle upon which further material accretes. A further detriment from this results in terms of nonuniform particle density. Methodology is required for synthesizing a granule in the absence of seed material and which is round, tightly packed with a uniform homogeneous cross-section and capable of eliminating hazards associated with fertilizer granule production. The Derdall et al. process, although a meritorious procedure, did not recognize the limitations of employing a seeding agent or the need for controlling the dust generated during granulation which not only creates an unhealthy environment for workers, but more seriously, results in a potentially explosive environment. This is evident from the teachings of Derdall et al., particularly at column 3, beginning at line 24, wherein it is stated: It may be more difficult to keep the granulation steady or stable with fine seed, such as -35 mesh. The difficulty to which the Derdall et al. disclosure alludes is directed to cycling which is an inherent problem with pan granulation processes. If the size distribution of the seeding agent is not constant, then the process will not stabilize and effectively cycles as is known to those skilled in this art. The result of this is that larger formed granules on the pan effectively destroy the smaller particles. This, of course, defeats the purpose of the pan granulation to generate particles. Furthermore, at line 36 in column 3, the disclosure indicates that: Fine seed sizes can be used, such as +35 mesh, but a point is reached where over-seeding or nucleation occurs easily and causes the final product yield to drop down. It is also indicated at column 3, beginning at line 45 that: Seed material in the range of 20 mesh is the best single point for each of control and uniformity of product size distribution . . .  As is known, the larger the mesh numerical value the smaller the micron size of the respond to the stated micron sizes: Approximate Mesh Size Micron Size 12 1680 16 1190 20 840 30 590 40 420 100 149 200 74 Based on the teachings of the Derdall et al. disclosure, mesh sizes greater than +35 cause potential nucleation problems and result in a final product yield to decrease. With the technology disclosed infra, it has been found that by using a fine powder of between -35 mesh to +150 mesh, that a superior quality product can be formed in a high yield and typically in the range of greater than 90% yield. When the above passage regarding Derdall et al. is considered, it is clear that Derdall et al. effectively contradict what the technology set forth herein has found to be particularly successful. In the present application the size distribution of the nucleating material is between -35 mesh and +150 mesh which corresponds to micron size less than 590 .mu.m and 105 .mu.m, respectively. Nowhere in the prior is a powdered nucleating agent in this size distribution disclosed for purpose of forming a uniform granule in the size distribution of, for example, 3 mesh to about 10 mesh. Advantages have been ascribed to this process and one of the most attracttive advantages is that the granule or pellet has an enormous break strenght and a uniform cross-section, It has been found by practicing the present invention, that break strenghts in the range of 1 to 4 kg or greater have been achieved. In the Derdall et al. disclosure, at column 3, beginning at line 33 it is stated: Seed of large size forms granules of very poor strength. If one considers these teachings in light of the size of the nucleating agent provided herein, the admissions made in the Derdall et al. disclosure would clearly go against the appeal of using a seeding agent in the size range as clearly taught by Derdall et al. The instruction in Derdall et al. indicates an ideal seeding agent size is 20 mesh (supra); the instant application uses a powder having a particle size between 75-750% smaller than Derdall et al. and yet achieve very desirable results. In Statutory Invention Registration H1070, authored by Harrison et al., Jul. 7, 1992, a method for granulating potash materials is disclosed. The process involves the conversion of particulate potassium sulfate or potassium chloride by agglomeration using a conventional rotary drum granulator, pan granulator or other conventional granulating device. In the disclosure of this document, there are no specific teachings regarding the elimination of a seeding agent, feedstock size or other important factors related to process control in order to generate superior quality granules having commercial viability. Further, the process clearly is an agglomeration process. It is known that agglomeration typically involves the aggregation of colloidal particles suspended in a liquid into clusters or flocs. These clusters or flocs have varying degrees of interstice and are loosely bound (Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, eleventh edition, 1987). It would be desirable if it were possible to achieve a high yield granular product within specified mesh sizes which does not require the use of a seed in the process. The present invention is directed to satisfying the limitations in the art and more particularly those limitations in the Derdall et al. reference. One object of the present invention is to provide a granulated homogeneous fertilizer product having a uniform cross-section devoid of a seeding agent and having a break strength of at least two kilograms in a size distribution of 3 mesh to 10 mesh. A further object of the present invention is to provide a granule made in accordance with a method comprising the steps of: providing an initial feedstock having a uniform size distribution of about 99.9% particle size of -150 mesh and of said 99.9% particle size of -150 mesh about 90% comprising a particle size of -200 mesh; providing a nucleating material in a size distribution of 35 mesh to 150 mesh; providing a binder solution; contacting the binder and the feedstock in a pan granulator; and forming fertilizer granules directly in the pan granulator in the absence of a seeding agent. Advantageously, it has been found that the granulation process can be achieved in the absence of any seed material to result in a high yield product with high break strength in a single pan granulator. As an alternative the product may be formed in a two-stage method where an intermediate sized granule can be produced that is predominantly -8 mesh to +20 mesh in a first stage. This product can then be dried and screened such that the -8 to +20 portion of granules is used as a feed to the second stage. In the second stage, the -8 to +20 mesh portion may be added to a second stage granulator pan where suitable binder is added to grow the small balls into uniform sized +8 to -4 mesh granules or balls which are then dried in a dryer. The so-dried product may be then screened on -8 to +4 mesh to produce a new product in the form of a premium granular fertilizer, for example, break strength of greater than 1.0 kilograms (kg) with 3 to 4 kilograms (kg) being typical. The -8 to +20 mesh portion leaving the dryer may be recovered and recycled to the second stage pan. The +4 mesh and the -20 mesh portions may be sent to a suitable pulverizer for recycling. It has been found that the nucleation center in the size range of -35 mesh to +150 mesh may be employed as a basis for granule growth and further, that the nucleation center may comprise any suitable material known to those skilled in the art. As is known from prior art granules, the presence of a core, i.e. a seed significantly affects the quality of the final product. Since the seed is relatively large (14 mesh), such materials are often irregularly shaped which, in turn, leads to irregular feedstock accretion. This leaves the final product aspherical, loosely packed and with an irregular nonuniform cross-sectional appearance. By making use of a nucleating material which is a dust relative to the core arrangements in the prior art, the above limitations are circumvented. This feature has dramatic consequences in terms of cost savings as well as providing the user with the capacity to shell or onion-skin nucleation center with additional materials which may be similar or different from one another. This degree of freedom is obviously favorable, since multiple component homogenous granules can be readily produced. As an example, and without being limiting, the process is applicable to granule formation where the granule includes a base fertilizer material which may be surrounded by a coating having limited solubility in order that the fertilizer be a time release type compound. As a further example, the process is particularly well suited to the formation of novel water softener balls or granules for use in water softening systems. Additionally, specialty fertilizer grades may be easily formed using the process according to the present invention. Utility for the process can be realized for a plethora of particle types. As a further option, the process has applicability in other fields such as the preparation of ice melt product. As an example, for the formation of the sodium chloride granules, the process, according to one embodiment of the invention, permits the addition of Mg or CaCl2 to the sodium chloride to enhance the ice melt characteristics and make a more efficient ice melt product. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a host of additional examples may be achievable depending on the particular end use. In accordance with the further desirable features of the present invention, the provision of a plurality of pan granulators permits full control and customization of the granule characteristics. By using one or a plurality of pan granulators when the process steps are observed, the result is that the granule can be uniformly grown under stabilized conditions without continual cycling as is the limitation in the prior art where only a single pan is disclosed for use. By employing the process parameters and apparatus according to the present invention, progressive accretion of the material on the granule is possible to result in a high density packed pellet with extremely high break strength, solid, uniform cross-section and a user predetermined size. Significant additional advantages can be realized by the technology set forth herein including: i) an enhanced market value of the formed product; ii) the formation of a more user friendly product; iii) significantly improved product handleability; iv) a significantly improved uniformity index: v) no product loss or waste. vi) uniform cross-section; vii) tightly packed feedstock; viii) absence of a seed or crystal core; ix) increased break strength relative to the prior art; x) material homogeneity throughout the granule; and xi) greater quantity of feedstock material per granule The process and apparatus contribute to achieve a greater than 90% recovery of product which is on specification (spec) in the desired size range. Of the remaining 10% of the product, the same may be simply reintroduced into the pulverizer to create fines for reintroduction into the system. Accordingly, it will be readily apparent to those skilled that the process may be not only particularly useful for the user but further, results in monetary and energy savings from 100% use of the product. In view of the elegance of the technology set forth herein, the result is that the apparatus and method may be applied in a retrofit application to existing systems which cannot achieve the level of efficiency attributed to the present technology set forth in the present case; existing systems may be significantly improved by simply adding the apparatus of the present invention and the method disclosed herein to improve such systems. This is a further advantage of the present invention in that the method is interruptible and does not require any specific parameters in terms of temperature, etc. in order to operate efficiently. In this manner, the pan granulators, employed in the present invention, may be arranged in any number of ways, i.e. in series, parallel, towered, etc., and may include any number of compounds to apply any number of layers on a granule as the same is grown through the system. Having thus described the invention, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawing illustrating preferred embodiments."

7422682,"Compositions, devices, and methods for use in environmental remediation",2005-06-28,0,1,"FIELD OF THE ART The field of art disclosed herein pertains to compositions, devices, and methods suited for a variety of applications in environmental remediation. BACKGROUND The uses of structural barriers for a variety of applications in environmental remediation are generally well described. Several types of environmental remediation barriers (ERBs) are used in earth and hydraulic engineering, such exemplary structures including fiber rolls, mats, blankets, and berms. Originally, major applications of ERBs included erosion and sedimentation control, revegetation, and revetment. More recently, the potential for such structures to serve additionally in the capacity of removal of natural and manmade pollutants from residential, industrial, and agricultural sources, and remediation of eutrification has been described. As the name of one type of ERB, fiber roll, suggests, ERBs packed into a covering, such as a netted material, may be filled with fibers; typically a single natural fiber such as abaca, hemp, jute, flax, sisal, coir, or straw materials. For a major application of fiber-filled ERBs in erosion and sediment control, the purpose of the fiber filling is primarily structural. In that regard, though the natural fibers described are capable of absorbing water, one necessary attribute of the fiber filler has been to provide an effective porosity once packed that allows for the ready passage of water, while promoting the retention of mud, sediment, gravel, and the like. Other desirable attributes of natural fibers used in ERBs include ready availability in high volume and low cost, requirement to be germ, insect and weed free, free of chemical pollutants, ability to degrade after use; thereby obviating creation of harmful waste, and ease of processing into targeted devices. Materials in addition to natural fibers have been suggested as supplemental constituents in ERBs. Particularly, vegetative matter, as well as nutrients and fertilizers for revegetation and revetment have been described. Materials that have been suggested include saw dust, wood chips, bark, compost, flocculants, water absorbents, and pesticides. A major objective in the field has been to establish environmental remediation practices that are consistent with good practices for environmental protection in general. In that regard, the reuse of natural materials, such as saw dust, wood chips, bark, and compost, that would otherwise go to waste has been a motive for creating fillings for ERBs. Especially in consideration of the use of ERBs in functions where the filling has a requirement that is more than structural; moreover where the filling must perform additional multiple functions, such as clarification of runoff water and removal of pollutants, the targeted and judicious selection of materials tailored for such multifunctional use throughout the lifetime of the ERBs still remains a challenge. Accordingly, a need exists for more effective compositions of materials that are multifunctional for a variety of environmental remediation needs, and for a range of ERBs utilizing such compositions and their use."
4517006,Composite materials comprising water-soluble glass particles,1982-11-17,0,1,"This invention relates to arrangements and methods for the controlled release of active materials into solution. There is a broad range of applications wherein it is necessary to provide for the release of an active material at a controlled rate into an aqueous environment. In the biosciences, particularly, the potential for prolonging the action of numerous bioactive compounds is stimulating considerable interest. Since the early 1950's researchers have attempted to develop controlled release compounds able to store active materials and then release them at controlled rates into aqueous systems. This research has tended to concentrate on polymeric materials. Any polymers may be fabricated at relatively low temperatures to encapsulate effectively active materials thereby protecting them from unwanted interaction with the environment. Subsequent release of the active material is effected by one of four general mechanisms, i.e. diffusion, swelling, (bio) chemical action and magnetic processes. However, in most cases it has proved impractical to engineer the required degree of control, especially over long periods, and in many instances toxicity of the special polymer itself has limited exploitation. Controlled Release Glasses (CRG), such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,350,675, are inorganic glasses that may be formulated to be non-toxic. Their solution rates in aqueous media are chemically controlled and may be varied to give a high degree of precision, even over long periods. Unfortunately CRG may only be fabricated at temperatures that would, on contact, destroy or degrade many of the active materials of interest. For this reason the development of CRG has tended to be concentrated on applications requiring the release of inorganic materials. The object of this invention is to combine the most advantageous properties of both the polymer and CRG approaches, without risk of toxicity. Thus the benefits of low temperature fabrication and release control combine to provide a new means of releasing a wide range of active materials. According to the invention there is provided a coherent composite structure, comprising a composite material and an active material, said composite material comprising a matrix material and a particulate material soluble in an aqueous medium and dispersed in said matrix material, the composite material being such that, when contacted with the aqueous medium, said particulate material dissolves thereby increasing the aqueous permeability of said composite whereby in use to control the release of the active material from the structure. Typically the matrix material is a polymer. When the composite comes into contact with an aqueous medium the particulate material dissolves to provide a series of passageways through the host matrix thus permitting the ingress of water. Such a composite can be employed for the delayed and controlled release of an active material which, prior to the dissolution of the particulate material and the consequent significant increase in the water permeability of the composite, is protected by the composite itself. Advantageously the particulate material is a soluble glass composition or a mixture of such glass compositions. Water soluble glass compositions have the important property that their dissolution rate may be tailored to a desired value by composition adjustment thus providing for the manufacture of composite materials with a wide range of release characteristics. Moreover, many of these glasses are biologically inert."
5788450,Narrow self-propelled transportation apparatus,1996-07-05,0,1,"This invention relates to machinery for use by arborists in lifting and transporting tree debris from pruning and removal operations around homes and office buildings. There are many prior art large machines that are used in the logging industry to fell, delimb, cut, load and remove cut trees from wooded areas. However, for the professional arborists usually problems are encountered due to congested areas, like city homes, lawns, drives, walks, fences and narrow gates. Most of the jobs, perhaps about 80%, of tree pruning and/or removal occurs where the large pieces of machinery cannot have ready access for one or more of the problems listed above. These same problems are substantially eliminated in accord with this invention. In accord with this invention a machine be maneuvered from backyards of houses and narrow gates and is equipped with the necessary facilities to pick up large logs and branches, load them onto a narrow walled platform, and self-propelled and steered out of the congested area for eventual disposal of the logs and branches at the street curb. It is an object of this invention to provide a machine that can be operated by a single person to accomplish the above purposes. It is another object of this invention to provide a machine that makes full use of hydraulic apparatus for lifting loads and for moving the loads to a more convenient area for disposal of the waste tree portions without damage to lawns, or walks or drives. Other objects will become apparent in the more detailed descriptions which follow. This invention relates to a maneuverable, self-propelled apparatus for transporting tree debris from pruning and removal operations and fallen trees where the apparatus includes a long narrow body with high sidewalls and with the body mounted on an undercarriage having four pneumatic-tired wheels. An upright mast is mounted on the body and supports an articulated arm of several sections and ending in opposed grapple fingers powered by hydraulic cylinders so as to be capable of picking up logs and depositing them in the body. The apparatus is long and narrow so as to be maneuverable in locations where there are narrow gates of 36 inch widths. In one specific embodiment one of the sections of the articulated arm is telescopically extensible. In another specific embodiment the body is long and narrow enough to be maneuvered into narrow spaces, and the top and rear of the body are open so as to make easy loading of logs and branches. Other specific advantages and novel features will be described in the following description."
7294343,Biodegradable sorbents,2002-06-14,0,1,"The invention relates to a grain based material useful as a general sorbent. In some embodiments, the invention relates to the introduction of a material into an environment, the material being sorbed within the sorbent. These embodiments are particularly applicable to the introduction of a control agent, such as a mosquito larvicide, into an environment. In other embodiments, the invention relates to the removal of a material from an environment by sorbing the material within the sorbent. Many methods exist for removing an undesired material from an environment. For instance, numerous products are available commercially for removing spilled liquids from a surface. Some such products are used to remove oil from open water, such as when an oil spill has occurred. In this application, it is desirable to selectively remove oil from water. For such absorbents, efforts are sometimes made to increase the selectivity of oil over water. Currently available products for spill control include clay, kaolin, illite, bentonite, diatomite, hectorite, montmorillonite, attapulgite, silica, silica sand, polypropylene, sodium polyacrylate/polyacrylamides, vermiculite, gypsum, limestone, metal oxides, asphalt, fiberglass, diatomaceous earth, perlite and other materials. Such materials, while satisfactory in function, suffer from certain drawbacks. Many such products contain silica, which poses a hazard to humans. In addition, most such materials are not biodegradable, which is a factor that can limit the options for disposal of the used sorbent material. There are also several organic spill control products described in the art. Examples of such materials include natural fibers such as grass, pre-cooked cereal kernels, sawdust, cellulose, and peat. U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,881 purports to describe a cellulose based sorbent system, where the cellulose has been treated with an additive to render it both hydrophobic and oleophilic so it will selectively remove oil from water. U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,774 purports to describe the use of pre-cooked and puffed cereals for oil removal. Another document, U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,350, purports to disclose a particulate milled seed material in which the lipids have been removed through solvent extraction and wherein the material is designed to remove and disperse oil from open water and solid surfaces. The composition is a solvent-extracted proteinaceous material derived from grain products having oil sorptive properties. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,881 purports to describe the use of diatomaceous earth, clay, silica, corncob, peatmoss, perlite, polypropylene, sawdust, cellulose, polystyrene, vermiculite, peat and cork to absorb liquids. This composition is taught as a general absorbent; in this document, it is stated that materials that absorb both water and oil are undesirable. U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,937 purports to disclose the use of corn stalks, husks, cobs, and kernels as carriers. U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,323 purports to disclose the use of delignified waste from hulls, straw, stover, and shells as a carrier. Other carriers are purportedly disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,383,609 and 6,391,120. Generally, other biodegradable materials such as peat moss, sawdust, hair, feathers, cotton, cork, starch, bagasse, seeds, seed hulls, and other seed components have also been proposed. Many methods for introducing a material into an environment also are known. In many cases, it is desired to introduce the material in a delayed-release manner, by which is contemplated that at least some of the material is bound up with another material or otherwise is not immediately available to function in the environment for its intended purpose. For instance, it is often desired to introduce a control agent, i.e., a material that limits the growth or spread of a living thing, into an environment. Known control agents, such as insecticides, larvicides, rodenticides, fungicides, and so forth may be oil-based or water-based. It is desirable to provide a sorbent for such control agents, and in particular, it is desirable to provide a sorbent that allows delayed release of at least some control agents into an environment. Further, it is highly desirable to provide a sorbent that is useful in sorbing both oil- and water-based control agents. Typical control agents are provided in liquid or solid form. There are advantages and disadvantages to each product form. Liquid pesticides can be applied as a spray, which is advantages in some respect. Drift control of the spray can be a challenge, however, especially in an aerial broadcast application. Solid pesticide products are better at targeting an area for pest control, because there is less drift of the solid product. Pelleted or compacted compositions are typically used in solid pesticide products. The majority of such composition is composed of a carrier or absorbent material, and the active ingredient is usually a small percentage (<10%) of the pellet weight. Another advantage of a solid control agent composition is that the weight of the composition allows penetration into vegetative areas that are less accessible via a liquid spray. Heavier pellets often can penetrate through a tree canopy, whereas liquid droplets would tend to coat and contaminate the tree canopy. One drawback to many known solid pesticides products is that non-biodegradable carriers often are used in such products. These carriers can lead to contamination of the area of treatment. In recognition of this problem, numerous biodegradable carriers have been provided; examples include materials such as corncob, peanut hulls, and starches. Many known biodegradable carriers are unsatisfactory. In many cases, the resulting composition does not perform as well as a non-biodegradable product. In addition, many biodegradable materials such as corncob, peanut hulls, and starches do not disperse easily when in contact with water, leaving a contaminant residue. Corncob is especially poor in this regard, because it has low density as well as poor dispersibility in water. In addition, when a granular pesticide does not readily disintegrate in an aquatic environment, the active ingredient is not readily released and thus a less efficacious pest control product with residual contaminant pesticide activity is provided. In the case of mosquito larvicides, such materials ordinarily are released into standing or slowly moving water to destroy larvae growing in the water. It is particularly preferred that the carrier should release at least a portion of the larvicide within the topmost two feet of water in a standing or slowly moving water column, where most or all of the larvae are found. It is further preferred that the larvae in the water column be destroyed within 24 hours, and preferably within 8 hours of treatment. Although the prior art has provided numerous carriers for control agents, not all carriers allow for the preparation of a control agent composition that meets these preferred criteria. In a first preferred embodiment of the invention, it is a general object to provide a sorbent that is useful in conjunction with the introduction of a material into an environment. In a second preferred embodiment of the invention, it is a general object to provide a sorbent that is useful in conjunction with the removal of a material from an environment, the material being removed by sorption of the material into the sorbent and removal of the sorbed composition thus formed from the environment. THE INVENTION The invention provides a number of embodiments in which the sorbing properties of spent grain germ and seed meal are utilized. These organic, naturally derived sorbents, alone or in combination, can be used to introduce material into an environment, or to remove material from an environment. When such sorbent is used to introduce a material into an environment, the environment preferably is one in which the sorbent will biodegrade. In such instances, delayed release of the sorbed material into the environment often is possible. When the sorbent is used to remove material from an environment, the sorbed material composition can be allowed to biodegrade prior to ultimate disposal of the composition. Many of the disclosures in the prior art fail to address the fate of the sorbed composition formed upon removing a material from an environment. Generally, the volume of sorbent introduced into the environment is much greater than the volume of the liquid to be removed from the environment. Where the removed material is or contains a hazardous compound, the relatively large quantity of sorbent having the material sorbed therewithin must also be treated as a hazardous material, which can increase the ultimate disposal cost considerably. The sorbents useful in conjunction with the present invention can be biodegraded, thereby reducing the total volume of material that must be treated as hazardous. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a control agent composition is provided. The composition includes a sorbent, the sorbent being selected from the group consisting of spent grain germ, seed meal, and mixtures thereof, and a control agent sorbed within the sorbent. Most preferably, the composition is in the form of discrete plural pellets, by which is contemplated the product of a pelletizing operation in a pellet mill. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for limiting the growth of an undesired pest in an environment is provided. The method includes selecting a control agent for the pest, and introducing into the environment an amount of a control agent composition effective to limit the growth of the pest. The control agent composition includes a sorbent and control agent as described hereinabove. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for introducing a material into an environment is provided. A material for which delayed release into the environment is desirable is selected. Subsequently, a granular material composition that includes the selected material sorbed within a sorbent, the sorbent being spent grain germ, seed meal, or a mixture thereof, is introduced into the environment. The timing of the release of the material into the environment can be controlled to an extent by adjusting the integrity of the granules, whereby more durable granules generally will release the sorbed material more slowly than less durable granules. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for removing an unwanted material present in an environment is provided. The method includes selecting a sorbent for the material, introducing into the environment an amount of the sorbent effective to sorb at least a portion of the material, allowing at least some of the material to become sorbed to thereby formed a sorbed composition, and removing at least a portion of the sorbed composition from the environment. The sorbed material may be a combustible material, and, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a method for generating heat is provided, the method including providing a combustible material composition and oxidizing the combustible material composition. The combustible material composition includes a sorbent and a combustible material sorbed within the sorbent. Preferably, the combustible material is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight of the composition. The invention contemplates the use of a sorbent, by which is contemplated a material that absorbs and/or adsorbs another material. Generally, absorption is a term used in the art to refer to the penetration of one substance into the inner structure of another substance, whereas the term adsorption refer to adherence of atoms, ions, or molecules onto the surface of another material. It is believed that one or both phenomena occur in accordance with the various embodiments of the invention, but it is contemplated that the material may serve as a sorbent even if only one of the two phenomena is present. By “sorbed within” is herein contemplated the sorption of a material in or on the sorbent. The sorbent used in conjunction with the invention preferably is spent germ, which is a germ from which oil has been expelled, for instance, by pressing or extraction with an extracting liquid such as hexane or water. Spent grain germ material has numerous advantages, in that it is derived from natural, renewable resources, is biodegradable and safely incinerable, is nontoxic and safe for the environment, and is economical to produce and use. This material is able to sorb both hydrophilic and lipophilic liquids. The spent germ may be washed to render it substantially free of odor components. It is known that washing of the germ will remove substantially odor and flavor components, which may be an advantage in some instances. In other embodiments, unwashed germ may be used. Germ obtained from any suitable grain may be employed in conjunction with the invention. Grains such as corn, wheat, soy, sorghum, barley, and the like are particularly suitable for use in conjunction with the invention. The preferred sorbent is expeller-extruded corn germ. Virgin germ (i.e., germ from which oil has not been extracted) may also be used, whereby in the manufacture of the sorbent as described herein some or all oil present in the germ is extracted. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the sorbent used in conjunction with the invention may be a seed meal. Examples of such meals include linseed meal, soybean meal, sunflower meal, cottonseed meal, rapeseed meal, peanut meal, safflower seed meal, and combinations thereof. By “seed” is meant to include that part of a plant which is capable of forming a new plant upon germination, e.g., whole grains of wheat, including the fruit or fruit-like structure housing the seed. The seed meal comprises a spent oil bearing seed residue, which is a seed residue from which oil has been expelled, such as by solvent extraction or expeller extraction. The extracted residue then is ground, by which is contemplated the reduction of the residue to smaller particles, preferably to a semi-course to fine powder. It is contemplated that some seeds will include a hull that may (but need not) be removed prior to expelling oil and grinding. Thus, the meal may comprise a dehulled meal. The seed meal in some embodiments is washed to substantially remove odor components therefrom. The germ and seed meal component of the sorbent collectively should be present in the sorbent in an amount of at least 50% by dry basis weight of the sorbent. Preferably, the germ and meal are present in a greater amount, such as an amount of 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% by weight of the sorbent. Most preferably, the germ and meal collectively are present in an amount of 100% by dry basis weight of the sorbent, that is, the sorbent includes the meal and/or germ to the substantially or complete exclusion of other sorbents. With respect to one another, the germ and meal can be used in any ratio desired. For instance, expresses as a percentage, the ratio may be 100% meal, 90% meal, 80% meal, 70% meal, 60% meal, 50% meal, 40% meal, 30% meal, 20% meal, 10% meal, or 0% meal (i.e., 100% germ). Other sorbents, such as these described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,391,328, optionally may be used in conjunction with the sorbents described herein, but preferably, such other sorbents are not present. The sorbent may be used in conjunction with the introduction of a material into an environment. The environment can be any place, area, or region in which the introduction of the material is desired. Generally, the material is selected as being desirable for use in the environment. For instance, the material may be a control agent, by which is completed a material that limits the growth of unwanted pests in the environment. A control agent preferably is selected as being an agent that limits the growth of the pest, by which is contemplated checking the spread of the pest by killing, sterilizing, destroying eggs or otherwise limiting the growth of the pest. Control agents generally are toxic chemicals; in accordance with the invention, any control agent now known or otherwise found to be suitable for use in limiting the growth of a pest may be used. The pest may be present in the environment, or may not be present in the environment (in other words, it is contemplated that the environment may be treated prophylactically). The pest can be any organism whose presence in the environment is undesired. Any organism found in the Animalia, Protista, Fungi (in particular non-mold fungi), Plantae, or Monera kingdoms may be deemed a pest in particular circumstances, and the control agent may be any agent that limits the growth of such pest in the environment. With respect to animals, the pest may be mammal, for instance, a rodent such as a mouse or rat, or a non-mammal, such as a fish, bird or other animal. The invention is believed to be particularly applicable to the control of animals in the phylum Arthropoda, including especially the classes Insecta (representing insects, millipedes, and centipedes), and Cheliceramorpha, especially arachnids. The control agent in preferred embodiments may be a rodenticide, a herbicide, an insecticide, a fungicide, or a bactericide. Specific embodiments of the invention employ, for instance, a larvicide, a pupicide, an ovicide, a hormone, a growth regulator (e.g. an insect growth regulator), a biological control agent, a microbial control agent, a toxicant, a fumigant, a pheromone, a repellent, a chemosterilant, a miticide, an acarcide, a molluscicide, an avicide, a predicide, an algaecide, a nematicide, an amoebicide, a nymphicide, and the like. In preferred embodiments, the control agent is selected from among an animal control agent (which may be a control agent for any species in the kingdom Animalia), a plant control agent (any species which may be a control agent for any species in the kingdom Plantae), a non-mold fungal control agent (which may be a control agent for any species in the kingdom Fungi, excepting the molds), a protist control agent (which may be a control agent for any species in the kingdom Protista) or a monera control agent (which may be a bacterial species or any other species in the Monera kingdom). In some embodiments, the control agent may be a virus control agent. Two or more agents can be combined to increase efficacy or to achieve multifunctional performance in the same composition. Specific preferred examples of suitable control agents include insecticides such as temephos, chlorpyfifos, methyl isocyanate, methoprene, propaphos, DURSBAN® dimilin, malathien, carbaryl, and diazinon; herbicides such as 2,4-D and 2,4-D ester, ammonium sulfamate, BROMACIL®, copper salts, molinate, propanil, pyrazolate, metolachlor, and the like. Other control agents include bioactives such as Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus sphaericus ; flugicides, such as fenoxanil, iprobenfos, menopril, tricyclozole, and valdamycin, and the like. The invention is not limited to the foregoing, and indeed any material that functions as a control agent may be used in conjunction with the invention. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,911,952; 4,983,390; 5997,445; 6,159,489; 6,316,447; 6,335,027; and 6,340,656, all disclose numerous control agents, any or all which in certain embodiments may be deemed suitable for use in conjunction with the invention. The control agent or other material sorbed within the sorbent may be a lipophilic or oleogenous material, or may be a hydrophilic material or a combination thereof (such as an emulsion). The material may be present in any amount with respect to the sorbent suitable for the intended purpose of the sorbent/material composition. In some embodiments, the material is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight of the total composition, more preferably at least 7% by weight, and even more preferably, at 10% by weight. When the sorbed material is a control agent, the sorbed material preferably is present in an amount ranging from 0.001 to 50% by weight, more preferably, from 0.001 to 10% by weight, and even more preferably, from 0.005 to 5% by weight of the composition. In some embodiments, the sorbed material is present in an amount from 0.05 to 1%, or, within this range, from 0.05 to 0.5% by weight. More generally, any amount suitable for the intended purpose may be employed in conjunction with the invention. The composition optionally may include any other additives, which may be present in any amounts suitable for their intended purposes or omitted altogether. Examples of such additives include surfactants, spreading agents, adjuvants, other carriers, binders, deflocculating agents, dispersing agents, synergists, penetrants, suspending agents, baits, phagostimulants, sticking agents, stabilizers, coupling agents, foaming or antifoaming agents, diluents, waxes, oils, superabsorbents, and more generally, any other additives. The sorbents described herein are not limited to the introduction of a control agent into an environment. To the contrary, the sorbets can be used to introduce any desirable sorbable materials into an environment. It is contemplated that in some cases the sorbable material may be a solid material that is carried in or on the sorbent. In one embodiment of the invention, the sorbable material is a fertilizer. Any suitable material or synthetic fertilizer may be employed in conjunction with the invention. In one embodiment, the sorbable material is an animal nutrient, such a vitamin or mineral. These materials may be present in any amounts suitable for their intended purpose. The selection of specific ingredients, loading levels, and application rates may be made by one is skilled in the art. One embodiment of the invention encompasses a method for fertilizing an arable area by applying a fertilizer composition as described above. In another embodiment, the invention encompasses a method for providing nutrients to an animal, the method including feeding the animal an animal nutrient composition as described above. The animal may be for instance, a horse, a cow, a pig, a sheep, a bird, or even a human. The composition that includes the sorbent and sorbed material (including any additives) may be provided in any suitable form. Most preferably, the composition is provided in the form of discrete plural particles of a substantially uniform and homogenous admixture of the sorbent and the sorbed materials. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the particles are in a form of compressed or compacted particles, i.e., in the form of granules. By “granules” is meant particles that are compressed or compacted, such by a pelletizing, extrusion or similar compacting step. Such compression or compacting of the particles is preferred, inasmuch as the intraparticle cohesion of the particles will be enhanced by such compacting or compressing step. The granules may be prepared via any suitable manner. Preferably, the material to be sorbed, if not a liquid, is dissolved or suspended in a liquid and the liquid is applied to the sorbent, followed by compression of the mixture to form granules. In a highly preferred embodiment of the invention, the granules are prepared by pelletizing the sorbent in a pellet mill. The composition may be prepared by sorbing the material into pellets thus formed, or alternatively may be prepared by pelletizing a mixture of the material and the sorbent. In either case, the pellets exiting the pellet mill may be ground or crumbled to thereby reduce the granules of the composition to a desired granule size. The mixture may be pelletized under any suitable conditions. Typically, the ingredients are pre-ground and are introduced into the pellet mill with moisture. Typical moisture content ranges from 2-30%, more preferably 5-15% by total weight of the blend. The blend is pelleted through a die such as a 3/32 in×2 in die at any suitable temperature, preferably a temperature ranging from 150° F. to 220° F., more preferably from 180° F. to 200° F. Final moisture preferably is in the range from 4-20%, more preferably from 7-12% by total weight. After pelleting, the pellets may be cooled and crumbled through dry rollers to reduce the size of the granules (it is also possible to cut the pellets from the die). The final granule size may vary depending on the application. For an application such as mosquito control, the granule size preferably should be between 4 and 30 mesh (U.S. standard test sieve. ASTM E-11 specification) and more preferably should be between 6 and 20 mesh. Fines generated during the pelletizing process may be removed by screening, preferable on a 10-mesh screen to a level of less than 20% by weight and ideally less than 5%. Such fines may be recycled. In the pelletizing operation, use of a lubricity agent such as corn oil may be necessary or helpful. Other lubricants such as added corn oil or oils from soy, peanut, sunflower, rapeseed, canola, coconut, or cotton, or animal fats such as tallow, yellow grease, or white grease, may be used. Other lubricants include lecithin, waxes, fish oils, castor oil, long-chain alkyl sulphonates, alkyl poyglucosides, tall oil, stearates, and silicones. The lubricant (including any oil present in the germ) preferably is present in an amount of up to 30% by total weight of the composition (excluding moisture) more preferably, an amount of 10-15% by weight. Pelletizing is not the only manner of forming suitable granules. For instance, in another embodiment of the invention, extrusion of sorbent through a dye and grinding of the extrudate to a suitable granular size is useful in conjunction with the preparation of the composition. Once again, the extrudate may itself comprise a composition of a sorbent and the material to be sorbed, or the material may be sorbed within granules of extruded sorbent subsequent to extrusion. The granules should be sufficiently cohesive for use for their intended purpose. Especially when the granule is used as a carrier for control agent, the granule must have sufficient integrity to survive the production, transport, and application of the product. If the granule is too durable, however, it will not disintegrate easily, and may not be effective in releasing the control agent in the desired manner, for instance, when the granule is introduced into a water column. In embodiments of the invention where a delayed release of the control agent or other sorbed material is desired, the granules may be made more durable by incorporating additional binder or cohesiveness agent. The binder may comprise an extrudate of corn hulls and sodium hydroxide (as taught is copending application Ser. No. 09/901,342, filed Jul. 9, 2001), lignin, lignosulfate, hemicelluloses, celluloses, water, starch hydrolyzates, hydrogenated starch hydrolyzates, fatty acids, and clay materials such as bentonite and zeolites. In such embodiments, the binder preferably is present in an amount of about 5% by weight of the granule. In some embodiments of the invention, the granules may include a polysaccharide cohesiveness agent to enhance the cohesiveness of the granules. The cohesiveness agent is believed to provide additional hydroxyl groups, which groups enhance the bonding between grain proteins within the sorbent granules. It is further believed that the additional hydroxyl groups so function by enhancing the hydrogen bonding of proteins to starch and to other proteins. When used, the polysaccharide cohesiveness agent may be present in any amount suitable to enhance the cohesiveness of the sorbent granules. Generally, the cohesiveness agent may be present in a dry basis amount ranging up to about 45% by weight of the sorbent granules, preferably, an amount ranging from about 3% to about 35% by weight, more preferably, an amount ranging from about 5% to about 25% by weight. When the binder is or includes virgin germ, some or all of this may come from starch naturally present in the virgin germ In accordance with these embodiments of the invention, any suitable polysaccharide may be used in conjunction with the invention, and thus, for example, the cohesiveness agent may comprise one or more polysaccharides such as dextrin, maltodextrins, starches, flours, cellulosics, hemicellulosics, and the like. Preferably, the cohesiveness agent comprises a starch, and most preferably, the cohesiveness agent comprises a corn starch. When a polysaccharide cohesiveness agent is used, preferably a supplemental cohesiveness agent also is used. In accordance with the invention, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is an ionic species that is believed to enhance protein-protein and/or protein-starch interactions. Any suitable ionic salt may be used in conjunction with the invention. For example, in accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is selected from among the alkali and alkaline-earth salts of common anions, such as the halide, nitrate, nitrite, carbonate, phosphate, sulfate, and bicarbonate salts, and the like. More preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and mixtures thereof. Even more preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is selected from among sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, and mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is sodium chloride. The supplemental cohesiveness agent may be present in any amount sufficient to assist the cohesiveness agent in enhancing the cohesion of the granules. When used, the supplemental cohesiveness agent preferably is present in an amount of at least about 0.05% by dry basis weight, of the composition exclusive of the polysaccharide cohesiveness agent. More preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is present in an amount ranging from about 0.05% to about 10% by weight; more preferably, about 0.1% to about 8% by weight; and most preferably, about 1.5% to about 4% by weight. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is present in an amount of about 2% by weight of the composition. To prevent or inhibit spoilage, the sorbent composition may include a preservative. Preferably, the sorbent composition includes a mold inhibitor, which may be present in any amount sufficient to inhibit the molding of the sorbent composition. Any suitable mold inhibitor may be employed in conjunction with the invention. The mold inhibitor preferably is selected from among the propionate salts, and most preferably is selected from the group consisting of sodium propionate and calcium propionate. Other preservatives include sodium metabisulfite, citric acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, butylated hydroyxytoluene (BHT) butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and sodium benzoate. When a mold inhibitor is employed, it preferably is present in an amount ranging from about 0.02% to about 3.5% by weight. The mold inhibitor may function to some extent as agent for controlling mold if the composition is introduced into an environment; however, at the levels used herein, the mold inhibitor is intended for the purpose of retarding mold of the sorbent composition itself. The composition may be introduced into an environment via any suitable means. Where it is desired to disseminate the composition over a large area, the composition may be disseminated from an aircraft, such as plane, helicopter, blimp, balloon, or the like, or may be disseminated from a watercraft. Particularly when the control agent is a mosquito adulticide or larvicide, the environment may be a water-containing environment, by which is contemplated any environment containing standing or slowly moving water. For example, the water-containing environment may be a pond, lake, swamp, marsh, bog, area with collected rainwater, (such as a tire) and so forth. It is contemplated that in these or other embodiments of the invention the environment may be an indoor environment. The composition preferably is formulated to release at least a portion of the larvicide within the first two feet of water column. The sorbent composition also may be used to remove a material from an environment. In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, at least a portion of undesired material present in an environment may be removed by introducing a sorbent into the environment, allowing the sorbent to sorb at least a portion of the material, and removing at least a portion of the sorbed composition from the environment. The material which may be removed from the environment is not limited to the materials described herein, but to the contrary it is contemplated that any materials that is sorbable by the sorbent composition may be removed form an environment. For instance, the material may be an oleogenus or lipophilic material, or may be a hydrophilic material. In some embodiments, the material may be a gaseous material, such as ammonia. Generally, the sorbent may be prepared as described hereinabove, and may be introduced into the environment in any suitable manner, for instance, by dispersing the sorbent from an aircraft or watercraft as described above. The sorbent may be introduced into the environment in any amount effective for its intended purpose. The sorbent used in conjunction with the invention is incinerable. It is contemplated that the sorbed material may be a combustible material, and in particular a hydrophilic material such as ethanol or an oleogenous material such as oil. It is contemplated that a combustible material composition so composed may be oxidized, such as by incineration, to thereby generate heat. The heat thus generated may be used in industrial applications or may be used to generate electrical energy. The combustible material composition may include any suitable ratio of sorbent to combustible material. Preferably, the composition includes from 1-75%, by weight combustible material, more preferably, the combustible material is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight, even more preferably, the combustible material is present in an mount from 10-75% by weight. The sorbents useful in conjunction with the invention are biodegradable at 25° C. By “biodegradable” is contemplated that the sorbents are susceptible to degradation via microbial influence or other breakdown of the biological structure of the sorbent, such as by thermal or internal chemical or biochemical influence. It is further contemplated that the sorbent will be biodegradable over a wide range of other temperatures. When the sorbent is used to introduce a material into an environment, in particular an outdoor environment, the sorbent preferably is biodegradable in the environment. Such biodegradability prevents long-term contamination of the environment of the sorbent, and, in some embodiments, may effect a delayed release of the sorbed material into the environment. In embodiments of the invention where the sorbent is used to remove material from an environment, the sorbent may be allowed to biodegrade after removal of the sorbed unwanted material but before final disposal of the sorbed material compositions. The biodegradation of the sorbent will in some instances reduce the volume of the sorbed material composition, thereby reducing the disposal costs (particularly in the case of a hazardous material). The sorbed material may be stored until the volume of the material has been reduced by a desired amount preferably at least 10%, more preferably 15%, and even more preferably 20% of the original volume. The following Examples illustrate the invention, but should not be construed as limiting the invention in scope."
4521239,Coating agent for particulate materials,1982-11-29,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of providing particulate materials with a protective coating. More particularly, the invention relates to the coating of particulate fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate with the reaction product of an amine and a siloxane. 2. Description of the Prior Art In the past diatomaceous earth (DE) and treated clays have been used as a coating/conditioning agent for particulate fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate. However, for several reasons, diatomaceous earth is becoming increasingly unacceptable as a protective coating material for fertilizers. One reason is that the quality of diatomaceous earth, per se, has been declining as the better grades of the earth have been removed by mining. The inferior grades of DE have resulted in coatings which do not meet the stringent physical and chemical requirements for acceptable DE coatings. Storage and handling problems have resulted because of the inferior grades of DE which are being used. Another disadvantage of using diatomaceous earth and clays is that there is always the undesirable problem of dust generation in the handling of diatomaceous earth since it is a relatively dry, small particle size solid. Usually, from about 1-1.5% by weight of DE is coated on ammonium nitrate particles. Not all of the DE, however, adheres to the fertilizer particles. This fact results in serious problems for ammonium nitrate manufacturing plants which are the likes of additional equipment maintenance, extra clean-up costs and the like. Moreover, there are serious customer handling problems involved with DE coated ammonium nitrate. Yet another problem with diatomaceous earth is that the costs of agricultural grade diatomaceous earth have sharply increased over the past few years as the available supplies have decreased as a result of the diversion of supplies to other markets. Because diatomaceous earth suppliers no longer need the agricultural market as a consumer of their product, ammonium nitrate producers are placed in an increasingly more vulnerable and expensive position. A need, therefore, exists for a satisfactory replacement for diatomaceous earth as a fertilizer coating agent. Various types of fertilizers have been coated with different materials in the past to produce a product of improved stability. Urea is usually coated with kaolin clay or is treated with formaldehyde to alleviate caking. However, kaolin, because of its very small particle size, is dusty. On the other hand, formaldehyde treatment of urea does not yield a completely satisfactory product. Phosphate based fertilizers such as ammonium phosphate, superphosphate, homogeneous N-P-K fertilizers and the like, which when dried to very low water contents to reduce their caking tendencies, become quite dusty when handled. Fuel oil is frequently used as a surface coating material in order to suppress dust generation. While fuel oil exhibits some dust suppressing activity, it is not fully effective in this role, and is not a good use for an energy yielding substance. Organic materials have been used in the past as coating materials for particulate fertilizers. Thus, Choi in U.S. Pat. No. 4,259,102 discloses a heterocyclic polymer which can be used as a fertilizer coating agent. Iwao, U.S. Pat. No. 3,660,070, shows the use of high molecular weight polymers of the vinyl and acrylate type as a coating agent. U.S. Pat. No. 3,388,990 provides a very similar type of disclosure. Passmore, U.S. Pat. No. 3,544,297, shows polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and polyacrylonitrile as coating materials. Haruhiro, U.S. Pat. No. 3,475,154 discloses fertilizer particles coated with a multi-layered coating of a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin in order to provide a low water-soluble fertilizer. None of the above-discussed references provide any disclosure of either of the ingredients used in the coating agent of the present invention. Hansen in U.S. Pat. No. 3,223,518 discloses a technique of providing a slow-release fertilizer by providing a particulate fertilizer substrate with a multi-layer coating, the outer layer being of a hydrophobic material. The reference further discloses the use of a primer coating which may be any substance selected from an extremely broad group of organic compounds. Hansen also describes that a major characteristic of the fertilizer product is its water durability which is characterized by solids which remain in the shell-like water-insoluble exterior coatings. Any fertilizer product which does not exhibit this characteristic, which includes the product of the present invention, presumably is outside the scope of the reference. Moreover, the fertilizer product of the present invention is not a slow-release multi-layer coated product having a hydrophobic exterior coating. Still further, the product of the reference possesses a large amount of coating material, i.e., about 7% by weight, while the amount of coating material applied to the present product is in most cases less than 0.1% by weight. Bradley in U.S. Pat. No. 3,951,638, discloses a prilling process which at one point uses an organosilicon compound to prevent dust pick-up by fertilizer particles. Accordingly, the reference does not show the coating of fertilizer particles with an organic material. Assuming that the dust is an inert material, the organic material would seem to serve as a moisture barrier, which is a teaching contrary to the present invention. Hijfte in U.S. Pat. No. 4,150,965 discloses the use of an alkylamine-mineral oil combination as a coating agent for ammonium nitrate fertilizer. The reference discloses a three-step coating process, while the present process is usually a one-step coating procedure. In the reference process an ammonium nitrate containing fertilizer is treated with the alkylamine while relatively hot, i.e., at least 5.degree. C. above the melting point of the amine or mixture containing the amine. In fact, the reference discloses that prills at 50.degree. C. cannot be coated satisfactorily, while in the present invention, on the other hand, superior coatings for ammonium nitrate can be achieved at temperatures less than 38.degree. C. Another disclosure in the reference which is contrary to the present invention is that unadulterated alkylamine must be added to the fertilizer in the first process step. That is, the amine cannot be premixed with another compound if acceptable results are to be obtained. In the present process, an amine is, in fact, premixed with another reagent, i.e., a silicone fluid, before application to the fertilizer particles. Another difference between the reference disclosure and the present invention is that the reference does not disclose the coating procedure to be effective on fertilizers which do not contain a diluent. The working examples of the reference disclose fertilizers which contain a diluent. A need, therefore, continues to exist for a technique of providing particulate fertilizers, particularly ammonium nitrate, with an improved coating material. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a protective coating for fertilizer particles which suppresses dusting, minimizes caking of the fertilizer particles and prill breakdown and makes handling of particulate fertilizer much easier. Briefly, this object and other objects of the present invention as hereinafter will become more readily apparent can be attained by a particulate substrate provided with a protective coating of the reaction product of at least one amine compound and a siloxane. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the particulate substrate is prilled ammonium nitrate fertilizer."

Description of Related Art The conventional water flow timer is electronically operated and is therefore rather expensive. In addition, such electronically-operated water flow timers are generally designed for use in a large-scale irrigation of a golf course, farm, or the like. In other words, the conventional water flow timer is not suitable for use as a household item in terms of price and performance. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The primary objective of the present invention is to provide an inexpensive water flow timer. It is another objective of the present invention to provide a water flow timer which is intended for use in a small-scale irrigation. It is still another objective of the present invention to provide a mechanically-operated water flow timer. The features, functions, and advantages of the present invention will be readily understood upon a thoughtful deliberation of the following detailed description of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings."
5665822,Thermoplastic Elastomers,1993-04-14,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to thermoplastic elastomers. 2. Introduction to the Invention Thermoplastic elastomers, which are often referred to as TPE's, are well known. The TPE's in general use contain (i) polymeric blocks (usually referred to as hard blocks or A blocks) which (a) are amorphous and have a second order transition point, T.sub.gh, which is well above room temperature, or (b) have a crystalline polymer backbone and have a crystalline melting point, T.sub.mh, which is well above room temperature, and (ii) amorphous polymeric blocks (usually referred to as soft blocks or B blocks) which have a glass transition point, T.sub.gs, which is well below room temperature. Each soft block is linked to at least two hard blocks, so that at temperatures between T.sub.gs and T.sub.mh, or T.sub.gs and T.sub.gh, the amorphous B blocks are tied together, resulting in elastomeric behavior. Above T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh, melting or softening of the hard blocks permits viscous flow of the polymeric chains, resulting in thermoplastic behavior. Known TPE's are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,260,659 (Gobran), 4,361,526 (Allen), 4,483,978 (Manser), 4,551,388 (Schlademan), 4,554,324 (Husman), 4,656,213 (Schladman), 4,764,586 (Manser), 4,778,852 (Futamura), 4,806,613 (Wardle), 4,919,737 (Biddle et al.), 4,952,644 (Wardle et al.), and 4,976,794 (Biddle et al.) and in the articles in Polymer, 29 (7), 1233-1239 (1988) Kallitsis et al.; J. Appl. Poly. Sci 37 (1), 267-281 (1989) Murphy et al.; J. Poly. Sci, Part A, Poly Chem, 28 (9) 2393-2401 (1990) Talukder et al.; Makromol Chem, 190, 1069-1078 (1989) Khan et al., 191, 603-614, 615-624, and 2341-2354 (1990) Fakirov et al., and 191 2355-2365 (1990) Gogeva; and Macromolecules 18 (2), 123-127 (1985) Miyamoto et al., and 23,333-337 (1990) Chow. The disclosure of each of those patents and articles is incorporated herein by reference. It has also been proposed in the patent literature to use, as components in temperature-sensitive dispensers for pesticides, disinfectants, drugs and other active agents, block copolymers containing a side chain crystallizable (SCC) polymer and a second polymer which exhibits a glass transition or melting point higher than the SCC polymer, such that the entire mass exhibits mechanical stability above the melting point of the SCC polymer but below the transition of the second polymer. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,830,855 (Stewart), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The block copolymer undergoes a rapid change in permeability to the active agent in the region of the melting point of the SCC polymer, and the second polymer ensures that the SCC polymer remains immobilized even if its melting point is reached or exceeded. This invention relates to TPE's which comprise A blocks, or B blocks, is or both A blocks and B blocks, which are crystalline and in which at least a part of the crystallinity results from the presence of crystallizable side chains. Such crystalline blocks are referred to herein as SCC blocks. TPE's containing SCC A blocks are novel and as such form part of the present invention. The invention also includes processes, compositions, shaped articles and assemblies which make use of TPE's containing SCC A blocks. TPE's containing SCC B blocks and non-SCC A blocks are not novel as a class, but this invention includes a wide range of novel processes, compositions, shaped articles and assemblies which make use of such TPE's. TPE's Containing SCC A Blocks TPE's containing SCC A blocks have the advantage that they can exhibit a much more rapid change in viscosity in the region of the crystalline melting point of the side chains in the TPE (referred to herein as T.sub.q) than is exhibited by known TPE's in the region of T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh. This rapid change in viscosity results in a number of important advantages. One advantage is that the novel TPE's can be melt processed at temperatures not far above T.sub.q, e.g. below about (T.sub.q +10).degree. C., whereas known TPE's are typically melt processed at temperatures at least 40.degree. C. above T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh. Known TPE's are typically melt processed at temperatures above 100.degree. C., whereas the preferred TPE's of the invention can be melt processed at temperatures below 100.degree. C., for example below 75.degree. C. and even below 50.degree. C. This is particularly useful when the TPE is preferably or necessarily maintained at a temperature below a critical limit (referred to herein as T.sub.crit). Such conditions arise for example when the TPE is associated with (e.g. is contained within, surrounds, forms a layer on, or is mixed with) a thermally responsive substance which may undergo, at a temperature above T.sub.crit, a change which is undesirable during such processing. The substance may be for example in the form of (i) solid particles dispersed within the TPE, e.g. particles of an explosive solid, or a pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical, or (ii) a substrate which is contacted by the TPE, e.g. a vessel in a living animal into which the TPE has been injected or otherwise placed, or (iii) a solid or a liquid which is encapsulated by the TPE. Another advantage is that the novel TPE's can be used as carriers (including encapsulants) for substances which are at least partially protected by the TPE at temperatures substantially below and approaching T.sub.q. The protection may be against physical attack and/or against chemical attack. The hard blocks in the TPE will begin to melt at a temperature T.sub.o which is somewhat below T.sub.q, e.g. 3.degree.-12.degree. C. below T.sub.q. As the temperature is increased from T.sub.o to T.sub.q, there is a rapid change in the protection provided by the TPE, and above T.sub.q the substance may be released entirely from the TPE. For example, a mixture of the TPE and an agricultural chemical can be applied during a cold season of the year while the ambient temperature is below T.sub.q and the chemical will be released when the ambient temperature exceeds T.sub.q. Similarly a seed can be coated with a TPE and will not germinate until the ambient temperature approaches or exceeds T.sub.q. Another very important advantage of the novel TPE's containing SCC A blocks is that the value of T.sub.q can be closely controlled through selection of the crystallizable moieties in the side chains. Thus, for a given crystallizable moiety, T.sub.q is mainly dependent on the length of the crystallizable moiety, and changes by at most a few .degree. C., e.g. less than 5.degree. C., with changes in the molecular weight of the A block. In the known TPE's, by contrast, T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh changes substantially with changes in the molecular weight of the A block, because the melting point is dependent on folding of the main chain. In the TPE's containing SCC A blocks, it is possible to change the physical properties of the TPE, e.g. the elongation, modulus and tensile strength, without substantially changing T.sub.q, by changing the molecular weight of the TPE and/or the molecular weight of the A blocks and/or the relative mounts of the A and B blocks. The TPE's containing SCC A blocks also show a relatively small difference between T.sub.q (the endotherm melt peak on a DSC curve as the TPE is heated) and the crystallization peak on a DSC curve as the molten TPE is cooled. Another very important advantage of the novel TPE's containing SCC hard (A) blocks is that the presence of the SCC A blocks results in improved shear strength. Furthermore their shear strength can be yet further improved by incorporation therein of a relatively low molecular weight and low melting crystalline additive, particularly an SCC polymer. The crystalline additive must be intimately mixed with the TPE, preferably through a melt mixing process or a process which comprises mixing the TPE and the additive in a common solvent. Particularly good results are obtained when the SCC blocks in the TPE and in the additive are structurally similar, and it appears that the improved shear strength results from co-crystallization of the additive and the SCC blocks. Thus a preferred combination is a TPE containing SCC blocks comprising polyethylene or poly (substituted methylene) groups and an SCC additive comprising polymethylene or poly (substituted methylene) groups. Suitable crystalline additives include those disclosed in the Schmitt et al. Application No. 07/928,800, U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,035, incorporated by reference herein. The advantages noted above make the novel TPE's with SCC hard blocks, and mixtures thereof with crystalline additives, particularly suitable for us as pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA's) and as hot melt adhesives. The TPE, or mixture thereof with a crystalline additive, can be the sole polymeric ingredient(s) of the adhesive, or can be mixed with other polymeric ingredients. For example, a conventional PSA can be modified by addition of the TPE or mixture of TPE and additive. The adhesive preferably contains 25 to 100%, particularly 75 to 100% of the TPE, and 0 to 50%, preferably 1 to 40%, of the additive. PSA's for use in the medical field for attachment to human skin preferably contain 20 to 35% of the additive. PSA's for use in other fields preferably contain less than 15%, e.g. 1 to 5%, of the additive. The adhesive can also contain additives such as tackifiers, plasticizers, fillers, stabilizers and pigments. PSA's which contain the crystalline additive have the valuable property that they have reduced adhesive strength when heated to temperatures approaching or above the crystalline melting point of the additive, as discussed in Schmitt et al. Application No. 07/928,800, U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,035. The novel TPE's containing SCC hard blocks can also contain SCC soft blocks. We have found that such TPE's, in addition to the advantages noted above for TPE's containing SCC hard blocks, are particularly useful in the form of films and other shaped articles which are heat-sealed to other polymeric articles. The TPE will undergo a rapid change in its physical properties, including its permeability to at least some gases and vapors, e.g. O.sub.2, CO.sub.2 and water vapor, in the region of T.sub.ms, but will retain substantial strength until heated to a temperature in the region of T.sub.q, when it will again undergo a rapid change in its physical properties, including its heat sealability. The repeating units of the different SCC blocks can be selected to provide a change in permeability (or other property) over a desired temperature range, and to provide a hard block which, above T.sub.mh, will be compatible with the other polymeric material to which the TPE is to be heat sealed. In this way, it is possible to make a TPE which is sufficiently flexible at 0.degree. C., which undergoes a marked change in permeability in the range of 0.degree. C. to 40.degree. C., which retains adequate physical strength at temperatures up to T.sub.q (or close to it) and which can be melt extruded and heat sealed at temperatures not far above T.sub.q, e.g. 60.degree. to 100.degree. C. If desired, the physical strength of the TPE can be improved by crosslinking, but this is not generally necessary. Such a TPE can be particularly useful as a packaging material, e.g. for actively respiring biological material, as disclosed in the Stewart Application No. 885,915 incorporated by reference herein. TPE's Containing SCC B Blocks and Non-SCC A Blocks We have found that SCC soft (B) blocks can confer important and previously unrealized benefits on TPE's containing them, making it possible to use such TPE's in ways which are novel and surprisingly valuable, even when the A blocks are not SCC blocks and the TPE is in itself known for use in other ways. For example, such TPE's can be used to provide pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA's) with very valuable properties, to provide films and other shaped articles which can be heat-sealed to other articles, and to provide hot melt adhesives. Summary of Various Aspects of the Invention First Aspect--Novel TPE In a first aspect, this invention provides novel TPE's containing SCC hard (A) blocks. These novel TPE's preferably comprise polymeric molecules which comprise (i) polymeric A blocks which (a) are crystalline and have a melting point T.sub.q, and (b) wherein at least one of the A blocks comprises a side chain comprising crystallizable moieties which render the block crystalline; and (ii) at least one polymeric B block which is linked to at least two A blocks and which (a) is crystalline and has a melting point T.sub.ms which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C., or (b) is amorphous and has a glass transition point T.sub.gs which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C. Second Aspect--Processes for Preparing the Novel TPE's Any process can be employed to make the novel TPE's of the present invention. However, particularly useful processes, which provide the second aspect of the present invention, comprise I. reacting together (i) an A block precursor which is the A block containing at least one reactive group J, and (ii) a B block precursor which is the B block containing at least two reactive groups K, which may be the same or different, which will react with the reactive group J to form a link which is part of the polymer backbone, PAL the molar ratio of (i) to (ii) being at least 2, thus making a TPE of the ABA, A.sub.n B or (AB).sub.n type; or II. reacting together (i) a B block precursor which is the B block containing at least two reactive groups L, which may be the same or different, and (ii) (a) a monomeric component comprising at least one monomer which will react with the group L and with itself or with a reactive group resulting from reaction of the monomeric. component with the B block precursor, optionally with the aid of an initiator, to form the A block, or (b) an A block precursor which is the A block containing at least one reactive group M which will react with the group L to form the A block; or III. reacting together (i) an A block precursor which is the A block terminated by a reactive group N, and (ii) a monomeric component comprising at least one monomer which will react with the group N and with itself to form the B block with at least two A blocks pendant from the polymeric backbone of the soft block; PAL or IV. performing a living polymerization in which the monomers for the A and B blocks are polymerized separately and sequentially, using an initiator so that the growing polymer chain has a terminal group which reacts with the monomer present at that time and in turn produces a reactive terminal group on the residue of the monomer which has reacted with the growing polymer chain. In all of these reactions, other ingredients may be present in order to modify the properties of the product, for example initiators, chain transfer agents and monomers which may be chemically or physically incorporated into the resulting TPE. Third Aspect--Compositions, Shaped Articles and Assemblies Comprising the Novel TPE In a third aspect, this invention provides a composition, shaped article or assembly which comprises a novel TPE as defined above and a second component which is mixed with the TPE, or which is surrounded (e.g. encapsulated) by the TPE, or which contacts (e.g. surrounds or otherwise provides a substrate for) the TPE. In one embodiment, this aspect of the invention is particularly valuable when the second component is a thermally responsive substance which undergoes a thermally induced change at a temperature T.sub.crit which is above the temperature at which the TPE can conveniently be melt processed. Because the novel TPE's can be melt-processed at temperatures close to T.sub.q, generally below (T.sub.q +60).degree. C., often below (T.sub.q +40).degree. C., and even lower, they are superior to conventional TPE's which are usually melt processed at temperatures well above their melting point. T.sub.crit is preferably above (T.sub.q +10).degree. C., e.g. (T.sub.q +10).degree. C. to (T.sub.q +40).degree. C. or (T.sub.q +60).degree. C. In another embodiment, this aspect of the invention is particularly valuable when the second component is intimately mixed with the TPE and is a crystalline polymeric additive, preferably an SCC polymer, which (a) has a first order transition point T.sub.a in the composition of 23.degree. to 120.degree. C., preferably 30.degree. to 60.degree. C., and (b) has a heat of fusion of at least 5 Joules/g, preferably at least 20 Joules/g. PAL The presence of the crystalline additive can substantially improve the shear value of the composition. This is particularly useful when the composition is to be used as a PSA, for which purpose the composition may also contain an amorphous polymer, e.g. a conventional PSA, as well as other conventional ingredients of PSA's.

The heat may be conveyed to the TPE by convection, conduction or radiation, but is preferably conveyed by means of a stream of heated fluid, e.g. heated air or a body fluid, which also assists in removal of the second component from the TPE. Sixth Aspect--PSA's and PSA Composites Comprising TPE's Containing SCC Blocks, and Methods of Using Them In a sixth aspect, this invention provides a composition which is suitable for use as (or in the production of) a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) and which comprises a TPE in which the A blocks, or the B blocks, or both, are SCC blocks.

In this aspect, the invention includes also PSA composites comprising a backing having a coating thereon of such a composition, particularly PSA-coated articles for use in the medical field, for example an assembly which comprises (i) a flexible backing, (ii) a solvent-free layer of a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) which is secured to the backing, and which comprises a TPE or is at least partially covered by a layer comprising a TPE, said TPE comprising polymeric molecules which comprise (i) polymeric A blocks which (a) are crystalline and have a melting point T.sub.q, or (b) are amorphous and have a glass transition point T.sub.gh ; (ii) at least one polymeric B block which is linked to at least two A blocks and which (a) is crystalline and has a melting point T.sub.ms which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C. or less than (T.sub.gh -10).degree. C. or (b) is amorphous and has a glass transition point T.sub.gs which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C. or less than (T.sub.gh -10).degree. C. PAL wherein at least one block selected from the A and B blocks comprises a side chain comprising crystallizable moieties which render the block crystalline. This aspect of the invention also includes processes for preparing assemblies by joining articles together using such a composition; and processes for disassembling such assemblies which include heating the PSA to weaken it. These PSA's, PSA composites, assemblies, and processes preferably have the functional characteristics set out in the Schmitt et al. applications incorporated by reference herein, which also discloses amorphous base resins, crystalline polymer additives, methods of formulating PSA's, methods of applying PSA's to backings, backings, and methods of using PSA composites, which are generally suitable for use in this aspect of the invention. Seventh Aspect--Heat-Sealed Assemblies Comprising Articles Comprising TPE's Containing SCC Blocks In a seventh aspect, this invention provides a film or other article which comprises a TPE in which the A blocks, or the B blocks, or both, are SCC blocks, particularly an article which is suitable for use as a component of a food package and/or in a method which requires heat-sealing the film. These films preferably have the functional characteristics set out in Stewart Ser. No. 07/885,915 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,654 incorporated by reference herein, which also discloses food packages, and methods of packaging and storing foodstuffs, suitable for use in this aspect of the invention. One assembly according to this aspect of the invention comprises (1) a first film which comprises a TPE comprising polymeric molecules which comprise (i) polymeric A blocks which (a) are crystalline and have a melting point T.sub.q, or (b) are amorphous and have a glass transition point T.sub.gh ; (ii) at least one polymeric B block which is linked to at least two A blocks and which (a) is crystalline and has a melting point T.sub.ms which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree.

8065834,Two piece plant container with water reservoir,2010-02-26,0,1,"This invention concerns plant containers and more particularly plant containers which have a built-in water reservoir to reduce the need for frequent watering. Municipalities commonly maintain large numbers container plantings hanging from light poles, etc., for decorative effect, and a need for frequent watering presents a substantial burden on city resources. There have heretofore been developed containers with a built-in water reservoir which is situated to allow the planting to draw water from the reservoir in addition to the moisture in the soil in which the plant is growing. In such large scale deployment of containers, it is common to frequently switch plantings for achieving seasonal displays or to rotate out plantings which are not doing well in favor of more healthy specimens. Such practice also entails considerable labor particularly when large plants and containers are involved. In the practice of including a water reservoir defined within the container, it is important to prevent excessive water from being wicked into the soil mass as this will cause waterlogging of the soil which will cause the roots to die from disease and lack of air. If the reservoir were overfilled, this will result may occur. It is an object of the present invention to provide a plant container which includes a water reservoir which is isolated from the soil to prevent saturation of the soil, but is spaced only a very short distance therefrom so as to allow growth of roots into the reservoir space. It is another object to provide a two part container which allows easy removal of the inner container holding the soil and planting, as well as convenient lifting and handling of the outer container part. It is yet another object to provide a two part container which is sturdy enough to hold heavy plantings and which has contours which are easily molded from plastic. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The above recited objects and other objects which will be understood by those with knowledge of this art are achieved by a two part container of molded plastic, an outer tub part having a bottom region defining a reservoir space and which receives an inner holder part nested within an upper region of the outer part and which holds the soil and planting. The side wall of the outer tub part has a plurality of inwardly projecting steps formed about the perimeter defining horizontal support surfaces arranged about its interior on which a bottom wall of the inner part rests, located just above the water reservoir. At least one of the support surfaces has a localized depressed space communicating with the reservoir space such that water can flow beneath an inner part bottom wall even while resting on the step surfaces to a drain hole in the bottom of the depressed space. The drain hole establishes a maximum level of water in the reservoir space. The bottom of the inner container has a pattern of openings in a major area of its bottom wall which is located just above the maximum water level in the reservoir to allow the planting roots to quickly grow into the water in the reservoir through the openings to allow water to be absorbed by the plant in addition to moisture in the soil being absorbed without danger of waterlogging the soil by a wicking action. The planting can be thoroughly watered by pouring water into the soil mass with any excess draining into the reservoir space until the water overflows but through the drain hole with such outflow indicating to the person watering the plant that the reservoir space is filled to the maximum so that watering can be stopped. Further drainage from the soil will also flow out through the drainage hole. In order to provide a sturdy bottom wall easily capable of supporting the weight of the soil and plantings in the inner part, a series of radial ribs converging into a center connection are molded therein to stiffen the bottom wall. These ribs may continue up the side wall for large containers such that the inner container is sturdy enough to support the soil and plant independently of the outer tub part. The perimeter wall of the inner part of the container is radially indented at locations on either side thereof and open at the top to create hand grip features enabling the fingers of each hand and to be inserted therein and to be wrapped around undersurfaces, providing convenient handholds allowing easy gripping and lifting out of the inner container part from the outer part. The steps formed into the perimeter of the outer tub part also provide handholds for lifting both parts. A removable plug in a drain hole in the bottom of the reservoir allows substantially complete draining when both parts of the container is to be removed."
5004026,Felling head,1989-10-06,0,1,"This invention is directed toward an improved tree felling head. The invention is more particularly directed towards an improved tree felling head of the type that accumulates cut trees. The invention is also directed toward a method of cutting and accumulating trees with the improved felling head. Felling heads for cutting trees are well known as are felling heads that both cut and accumulate trees. One type of felling head employs means to tightly grip the tree to be cut. While the tree is tightly gripped, cutting means on the head are moved and operated to cut through the gripped tree. The gripping means then release the cut tree. Grapple means may be provided on the felling head to accumulate one or more released cut trees while cutting continues. Cutting through tightly gripped trees can result in the butt end of the tree splintering as the cut nears completion. This is due to the tree occasionally being highly stressed when tightly gripped by the felling head. A tree with a splintered butt end is not as valuable as an unpslintered tree. One way to minimize splintering of the butt ends is to cut the trees without tightly gripping them. It is known to provide felling heads that cut free standing trees. This type of felling head has a fixed cutting means, usually a large circular saw, with a butt plate over a portion of the saw. The felling head is moved to have the saw cut the free standing tree which then rests on the butt plate. Grapple means are provided on the felling head to accumulate one or more cut trees off the butt plate while cutting continues. Often however, the just cut tree on the butt plate is unstable and it can fall of the felling head before it is trapped by the accumulating arms. The problems associated with splintering in cut trees, and with tree loss off the felling head, can be minimized by improving the handling of the trees by the felling head. It is therefore the purpose of the present invention to provide an improved tree felling head having improved tree handling means. It is more particularly a purpose of the present invention to provide an improved tree felling head with improved tree handling means that minimize splintering in cut trees. It is also more particularly another purpose of the present invention to provide an improved tree felling head with improved tree handling means that minimizes both splintering in cut trees and loss of cut trees off the felling head. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a felling head with cradle means for loosely receiving a tree and with retaining means on the felling head for loosely retaining the tree in the cradle means. In one embodiment of the invention, the felling head employs movable cutting means. The felling head is manoeuvred to place the standing tree to be cut within the cradles and the retaining means is operated to loosely retain the standing tree within the cradles while the cutting means is operated and moved to cut through the tree. The loosely retained tree is free to have some movement while being cut and therefore is not as likely to splinter as a tree that is cut while tightly held. Preferably, the felling head is provided with grapple means to accumulate one or more cut trees while still being able to loosely retain the next tree being cut. In another embodiment of the invention, the felling head employs a fixed cutting means. A butt plate is provided on top of a portion of the cutting means. The felling head is manoeuvred to have the cutting means cut through a free standing tree. The cut tree ends up on the butt plate within cradle means provided on the felling head. The retaining means on the felling head are immediately operated at the conclusion of cutting to loosely retain the cut tree on the butt plate and within the cradles to prevent it from falling off the felling head. The felling head is provided with grapple means to accumulate one or more cut trees while still being able to loosely retain the next cut tree. The invention is particularly directed toward a tree felling head having a frame with tree cutting means at the bottom of the frame. Vertically spaced-apart cradles are provided on the frame for loosely receiving a tree therein. Retaining means are provided on the frame between the cradles for loosely retaining a tree within the cradles. Means are also provided on the frame for supporting a cut tree by its butt end while retained in the cradles. Preferably, the felling head includes grapple means on the frame between the cradles to accumulate cut trees against the cradles in the frame. In one embodiment, means are provided for movably mounting the tree cutting means on the frame to cut through a free-standing tree that is positioned within the cradles by manoeuvring the felling head. The movable tree cutting means support the cut tree by its butt end while it is loosely retained in the cradles. In another embodiment, the tree cutting means are fixed on the frame, and the felling head is manoeuvred to have the fixed cutting means cut through a free standing tree. The cut tree support means comprise a butt plate covering a portion of the tree cutting means. The invention is also directed toward a method for falling trees using a felling head which comprises: positioned the felling head to locate a standing tree within vertically spaced-apart tree cradles on the felling head; moving retaining means to a closed position to loosely retain the standing tree within the cradles; and cutting the standing tree while loosely retained within the cradles. The invention is further directed toward a method for felling trees using a felling head which comprises; manoeuvring the felling head to have a fixed cutting means on the head cut through a free standing tree, the cut tree resting on a butt plate and within tree receiving cradles on the felling head; and moving retaining means to a closed position to loosely retain the cut tree on the butt plate and within the cradle means. The methods preferably include the step of tightly gripping the cut tree against the cradles with grapple means to hold the cut tree while moving the head to the next standing tree to be cut."
8354852,Wireless soil sensor utilizing a RF frequency for performing soil measurements,2010-01-31,0,1,"STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is related to a wireless sub-surface sensor having a radio for performing real-time soil measurements. 2. Description of the Related Art The prior art discusses other irrigation systems and methods. Closing an underground to above ground RF communication link is a challenging task. The challenge is typically due to difficult propagation conditions perpetrated by high water content as well as high conductivity in the soil. The moisture and conductivity vary over time depending on environmental stimulus. High water content increases the rate of absorption of RF energy. Salinity and moisture both change the die-electric constant of the soil, effectively detuning the antenna element as water content changes over time. In instances, it is possible to adaptively modify the antenna tuning elements, to attempt to tune the antenna to the current state of the soil. However, in some instances it may not be possible to overcome the adverse effects of moisture in the ground by direct tuning of the RF and antenna components on board the underground wireless sensor. In other instances, certain wireless sensing devices may not be able to adapt their tuning in close to real time to match the soil conditions. The Present Invention seeks to resolve the problems of the prior art. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a solution to the problems of the prior art. The inventors of the present invention noticed the dielectric of soil, and how it changes with moisture and salinity, which led them to believe that a radiofrequency (“RF”) antenna of a wireless sub-surface soil sensor may be able to be tuned based on moisture and salinity measurements. The inventors measured soil moisture and salinity using novel sensors which also provided the electrical properties of the soil in which the wireless sub-surface soil sensor was placed. These electrical properties affect the efficient transmission and range of an antenna. The inventors realized that an antenna could be configured to optimize transmission efficiency and boost range. Components added to the antenna circuitry controlled by the processor allow for the antenna to be tuned based on the electrical properties of the soil. RF impedances (complex resistances) are often characterized on a two dimensional SMITH® Chart. A discussion of SMITH® Charts is set forth in Designing Impedance Matching Networks With the HP 8751 A , Hewlett-Packard Company, 1990, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Another discussion of SMITH® Charts is set forth in Stephen D Stearns, Mysteries of the Smith Chart , Pacificon 2001, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The inventors noticed that if the antenna is tuned in a specific and novel manner, its impedance is shifted in an arc around the ideal match (about 50 ohms) as moisture levels in the soil changed. By characterizing the arc by a radius and angle, the inventors were able to tune the radius to remain nearly constant. Only the phase angle of the impedance changed. The inventors designed the physical antenna structure, board structure, housing (air space) and tuning elements to maintain a constant impedance magnitude. This became an automatic, adaptive RF tuning which improved antenna performance across a range of soil moisture levels. One aspect of the present invention is a wireless soil sensor comprising a main body having a sensing component, a removable sleeve positioned over the sensing component, a radio, a processor configured to utilize a RF frequency for performing soil moisture measurements. Another aspect of the present invention is a wireless soil sensor comprising a sensing component integrated directly with a radio and a microcontroller. The microcontroller is configured to utilize a RF frequency for performing soil moisture measurements. Another aspect of the present invention is a method for performing soil moisture measurements utilizing radiofrequency. The method includes transmitting a radiofrequency signal through a soil material at a set frequency and power. The method also includes measuring a signal strength for the radiofrequency signal received at a receiver. The method also includes comparing the signal strength to a table of signal strength correlated with moisture values for the soil material. The method also includes determining the soil moisture measurement from the table. The radiofrequency signal is preferably transmitted from a wireless sub-surface soil sensor to an above-ground receiver. Alternatively, the radiofrequency signal is transmitted from an above ground receiver to a wireless sub-surface soil sensor. The radiofrequency signal is preferably transmitted at a frequency of 2.4 GigaHertz. Another aspect of the present invention is a wireless soil sensor. The wireless soil sensor is preferably capable of measuring soil moisture, soil salinity and soil temperature, while buried beneath the surface and also capable of wirelessly transmitting the measurements to a receiver above the surface for eventual transmission to an engine for calculations and other outputs. The wireless soil sensor preferably has a tine sleeve for placement over a portion of the sensor. The sleeve is removed when the sensor is ready to be buried beneath the surface of the soil. The sensor preferably links to a controller, is preferably associated with a watering zone which is to be controlled by a controller. At least a portion of the sensor is preferably waterproof. The tine sleeve preferably has a small patch of exposed PCB conductor which is connected to another, which allows the sensor to assume it is in a hibernation state (for power savings, suppressed communications and suppressed emissions). Essentially, while the sensor has the tine sleeve attached, it is in an inactive state. The tine sleeve further protects the sensitive components of the sensor during shipment. Removal of the tine sleeve is an intuitive indication that the sensor is to be associated and buried. The sensor assumes a period of active communication so that a controller/interrupter can learn of its presence and prompt assignment to a watering zone or zones. After a set period of time, the sensor preferably assumes a normal sensing and broadcast mode. The tine sleeve further acts a physical receipt, allowing for marking with the date, position of installation and corresponding watering zones. The tine sleeve further provides the function of enabling safe transportation of the end-of-life or return for repair of the sensor to a factory or alternative site. The wireless sensor preferably infers moisture and salinity levels by measuring the dielectric constant of the surrounding soil. A radio antenna used to relay these measurements to a central controller is affected (de-tuned) by surrounding changes in the dielectric constant. The present invention can adaptively tune the antenna impedance match via RF switches and passive components based on moisture and salinity readings. This increases the communication range and reduces power consumption. A user interface for an irrigation interrupter preferably has a default display of 128 by 64 pixel. In a limited space, the display communicates a tremendous amount of information in an extremely intuitive way. Six columns for watering zones are used in the display. Each zone shows a moisture assessment of Ok, Wet, Dry, or Cold. Next to this is a visual indication of the moisture level in the zone, as reported by one or more sensors, adapted to a soil/plant type. A bar showing moisture level preferably has two marks indicating a lower level where no watering would be interrupted, an upper level indicating that all watering would be interrupted, and in the zone in between, a sensor for how much of the normal watering period will be allowed before a mid-flow cutoff attenuates watering. A bold OFF and ON indication blinks between the view and the underlying moisture status normally shown. The blinking behavior is set to occur when a zone input is active, and indicates the action being taken by the interrupter. Above the moisture indications is a row showing the control status of each zone—whether it is controlled by one or more sensors, or has been placed in manual ON or manual OFF. The user interface allows for determination of a manual mode with only a casual view of the user interface. The top line shows the system status (Auto, Bypass, Master, Slave) and the recent average of water saving, calculated by the percentage of time normally watering has been attenuated. Master and Slave are used to enable “chaining” of multiple interrupters together to control additional zones, preferably six at a time. At the bottom of the display, icons show whether one or more than one sensor is assigned per zone. A solid square is a sensor with no performance issues. A hollow square indicates low battery. A triangle indicates RF reception issues. A hollow triangle represents RF reception and battery issues. In such conditions, where information about soil moisture and salinity conditions at the time of attempted transmission is available to the wireless sensor, for example when there are on board moisture and conductivity sensor present, the wireless transmitter will perform a simple computation to determine whether its transmission will be successful given the network activity history and the soil moisture and conductivity levels. The wireless sensor will track the moisture and conductivity levels, and based on those levels will adjust its transmission attempts. The impact of this decision making is that it will predict when the transmission will fail, and thus refrain from transmitting. This adaptive adjustment of the transmission schedule will help conservation battery life for battery operated sensor nodes. This adaptive schedule will be effective for one way as well as two way communication links. However its impact will be most evident for two-way over the air protocols. It is an object of the present invention to provide a proprietary wireless root zone intelligence system that measures real time soil moisture, temperature and salinity. It is an object of the present invention to provide an advanced wireless sensor and analytical, intuitive, fully interactive software. It is an object of the present invention to optimize turf health and playability, improve product quality, optimize resource utilization. Having briefly described the present invention, the above and further objects, features and advantages thereof will be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings."
7997826,Roller assembly,2009-05-01,0,1,"This invention relates to an improved roller assembly which may be used as a drive roller or idler roller in machines or vehicles incorporating rolling apparatus for rolling of turf or grass surfaces inclusive of golf greens and bowling greens. However this is not the only application of the roller assembly of the invention which could be employed in relation to rolling of snowfields, road surfaces during preparation of roads and rolling of other uneven surfaces such as sand. One conventional rolling apparatus is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 which has a mobile main frame and at least a pair of undercarriages attached to the main frame in side by side relationship wherein each undercarriage has one or more smoothing rollers and there is further provided a control arm or plate pivotally attached to the main frame about a horizontal axis wherein each undercarriage is pivotally attached to the control arm or plate. There was further provided a transmission interconnecting each undercarriage to an operating lever or joystick wherein actuation of the operating lever or joystick causes reciprocatable pivotal movement of each undercarriage such that in use the or each smoothing roller closely follows ground contours. It is important in rolling of golf greens or bowling greens that smoothing or idler rollers as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 closely follow ground contours. If such is not the case the smoothing rollers may leave indentation lines or unsightly marks on the greens and this was detrimental to achievement of a smooth and even grass surface. Another problem of using smoothing rollers that did not closely follow ground contours was that surface corrugations in the greens still remained after repeated roller operations. However while this objective was achieved in U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 by the use of pivotal movement of each undercarriage to closely follow surface undulations or corrugations it will be appreciated that U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 still incorporated a conventional drive roller shaft which was provided with a pair of stub axles at each end thereof which were attached to mounting plates rigidly attached to the chassis of the rolling apparatus. Each stub axle was also mounted in bearing carriers carrying bearings for each stub axle so as to enable the drive roller to rotate relative to the chassis. Another conventional arrangement was that the drive roller was rigidly mounted to a support shaft which extended through each end of the drive roller thereby providing the pair of stub axles. However these conventional drive roller mounting arrangements had disadvantages in that (i) on uneven ground there was created greater ground pressure resulting in an uneven surface finish due to lines, marks or impressions left on the ground surface after passage of the drive roller. Other disadvantages were (ii) that the drive roller had reduced width compared to each smoothing roller, (iii) that there was less driving friction on the ground than desired which created loss of traction in certain driving conditions and situations, especially on increased slopes or wet turf and (iv) the drive roller was rigidly mounted to a support shaft which meant that the style of roller to be employed was limited being relatively short which was not adapted to follow ground contours. It was also to be appreciated that in relation to each of the smoothing rollers in order to achieve an objective of each smoothing roller closely following ground contours it was necessary to mount a plurality of smoothing rollers in undercarriages as described above and this procedure was relatively complicated although it operated in a perfectly satisfactory manner. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It therefore is an object of the invention to provide a roller assembly that is adapted to follow ground contours during operation. The roller assembly of the invention includes in a first embodiment a pair of roller components having respective inner ends connected to each other by a flexible and movable primary coupling and having their respective outer ends connected to a support shaft which extends through a hollow interior of each driven roller component by a secondary coupling. In a second embodiment there may be one or more intermediate or floating roller components located between the pair of roller components, which may constitute end roller components. In this embodiment each of the end roller components are connected at their respective outer ends to the support shaft which extends through a hollow interior of each end roller component and each intermediate or floating roller component by the secondary coupling. However each of the inner ends of the end roller components are connected to an adjacent end of an adjoining intermediate or floating roller component by the flexible and movable primary coupling. In the case where there are more than one intermediate floating roller components, adjacent ends of each intermediate or floating roller components are connected to each other by additional flexible and movable primary couplings. The flexible and movable primary coupling may comprise a disc or sleeve made from natural rubber, synthetic rubber or other form of flexible or elastomeric material. In one arrangement the flexible disc may have a plurality of holes to enhance flexibility or in another arrangement may have a relatively large central aperture to enhance flexibility. Preferably the flexible disc has a peripheral flange defining a pair of adjacent shoulders for supporting an adjacent end of a roller component. In the case of the first or second embodiment the primary coupling may be provided with a plurality of spigots or sockets which engage with corresponding sockets or spigots of an adjacent end of an end or driven roller component. In the case of adjacent ends of intermediate or floating roller components each of these may be interconnected by a primary coupling having spigots or sockets engaging with corresponding sockets or spigots of each adjacent end of the intermediate or floating roller component."

STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not applicable. NAMES OF PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT Not applicable. REFERENCE TO AN APPENDIX SUBMITTED ON COMPACT DISC Not applicable. 1. Field of the Invention The present invention applies to trigger-operated portable electric tools. More specifically, it concerns the field of portable electric tools that are controlled during use by a trigger activated by at least one finger of the hand holding said tools. By pressing on this trigger, a command is given to an actuator (often consisting of an electric motor) to activate the element or moving active elements of the tool in a given direction; by letting go of said trigger, a command is given to the actuator either to stop (for tools operating in a single direction) or to activate the element or moving active elements of the tool in the opposite direction (for tools operating in two directions). 2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98. Motorized pruning shears, especially electric and electronic pruning shears, are examples of contemporary tools having a bidirectional control trigger (opening and closing the cutting elements). The applications of the invention described below apply especially to electronic pruning shears, but it is important to note that the invention can also be applied to other types of motorized pruning shears and to other types of trigger-operated tools, such as shears, drills, grinders, planes, and so on. In their most advanced versions, such tools are provided, in addition to their principal function, with at least one additional function. This second function consists of, for example, in the ability to maintain an intermediary speed or position, or to reverse the direction of the motor, or to place the tool on standby. This second function is controlled by the addition of a control device distinct and separate from the trigger, such as a pushbutton, a switch, and so on, positioned on the body of the tool, this device being intended to be activated by a finger other than the one that acts on said trigger. However, this situation has the disadvantage of being uncomfortable for the user when operating the tool, for the user must either employ two fingers from one hand at the same time or, if the distance between these two control elements is too great, use his other hand, which results in a loss of time. For example, many pruning shear models, in addition to the function of opening and closing the cutting elements controlled by a trigger activated by the user's finger, are equipped with a second function performed by an electrical or electronic system that can be used to arrest the rotation of the moving blade in a predetermined position intermediate between the closed position and the fully open position, thereby providing the ability to limit the opening of the blades, which is desirable in certain situations, for example, when cutting kindling wood, or when pruning, in order to save time and energy. This second function is controlled by a switch that is independent of the control trigger and must be activated by a finger other than the one used to activate said control trigger, and this must occur each time the operator wishes to go from the “fully open” position to the “intermediate” position and vice versa. The transition from one position to another being frequent due to the varying thicknesses of wood being cut on the same plant, it is easy to imagine the inconvenience and loss of time occasioned by such a device. An object of the invention is to correct the aforementioned drawbacks and inadequacies of portable electric tools, especially electric pruning shears. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invention, this objective is achieved by means of a portable electric tool configured to fulfill a primary function notable in that it has a double trigger having, on the one hand, a main actuator-control trigger effecting the movements of at least one moving active element of said tool and, on the other hand, an auxiliary, or secondary, trigger connected to said main trigger by means of an articulation and arranged so as to form a reentrant angle with said main trigger, wherein pivoting said auxiliary trigger activates control means of a system designed to fulfill at least one supplementary function of said tool. It is apparent that this double-trigger device can be used to control several tool functions with a single finger, which provides comfort and saves time. According to a preferred embodiment applicable to portable electric tools comprising a cutting head having at least one moving blade whose movements are controlled by an electronic control card, this latter is configured to control the complete opening of the “fully opened” blades or the stable positioning of said moving blade(s) in a partly opened “intermediate” position, and the auxiliary trigger can be used to act upon a complementary control means of said actuator via said electronic control card. By means of this arrangement, the blades of cutting tools such as electronic pruning shears can be stably positioned in a partly open “intermediate” position that allows for better adaptation of the opening of the cutting blades to the diameter of the wood (branches, vine shoots, etc.) being cut, which results in significant savings of energy and time, together with improved ease of use and greater precision. It is possible to proceed instantaneously from a predetermined partly open “intermediate” position to the “fully open” position and vice versa. The width of the intermediate angle of opening can be adjustable. According to a highly preferred embodiment, a sensor, preferably having a Hall-effect or magnetoresistive sensor, is fixedly arranged on the body of the tool, and the free end of the auxiliary trigger is equipped with a permanent magnet capable of being brought in proximity with said sensor or away from it. By means of this embodiment of the supplementary actuator control means, the auxiliary trigger of the double trigger does not make contact with any mechanical element. Therefore, there is no mechanical wear of this control means, which provides longer operating life for the latter over time."
10099947,Water treatment solution with chelating base product,2016-06-16,0,1,"BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a base product used for various water-based treatment systems. More particularly, the invention relates to a base product fluid with a chelating compound having a selected formula, water treatment applications for an end product formed from the based product fluid, and methods of making the water treatment product. 2. Description of Related Art Base products such as chelating agents have been blended with copper sulfate for various uses in water-based treatment systems. U.S. Pat. No. 4,564,504 to Sorber, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, discloses an early process (the “Sorber process”) that used water, ammonia, and sulfuric acid to produce a novel acid. The Sorber process involved a vat mixing batch process where sulfuric acid is slowly mixed to an aqueous ammonium solution. The Sorber process was performed in open vats and was dangerous due to the extremely exothermic nature of the reactions involved. The Sorber process may be termed a “cold process” as the mixing was slowed down to avoid excess heat generation and/or explosions from occurring. There have been several attempts to improve upon the “cold process” (Sorber process). Examples of these attempts are found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,595 to Cummins, U.S. Pat. No. 6,242,011 to Cummins, U.S. Pat. No. RE41,109 to Cummins, and U.S. Pat. No. 8,012,511 to Cummins, each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

8851447,Integrated control circuitry and coil assembly for irrigation control,2009-07-27,0,4,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation control devices and more specifically to multi-wire irrigation control systems including remote devices coupled to a multi-wire path and for coupling to actuator coil-controlled irrigation equipment. 2. Discussion of the Related Art In decoder-based irrigation control systems, an irrigation controller sends signaling along a wire path to which one or more decoder devices are attached. Each decoder device monitors transmissions on the wire path and decodes this signaling to determine when to cause irrigation devices coupled thereto to be activated and deactivated. The decoder module typically includes circuitry formed on a printed circuit board located within a housing. Wiring from the decoder module housing must be coupled to the wiring of the wire path as well as coupled to one or more actuator devices each controlling the opening and closing of an irrigation rotor or valve. In one form, the rotor or valve is operated by a solenoid coil as is well known in the art. Likewise, during installation, the operator must provide and electrically connect two separate devices, a decoder module and an actuator coil module, to each other and to the control wire path. FIG. 1 illustrates a separate decoder module 102 and a coil unit 104 that are conventionally coupled together. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 2 , for a solenoid activated rotor assembly 200 , the coil module 104 is coupled (in part by a bracket 212 and retainer 214 ) to the parts of a selector valve assembly 202 (including a pressure regulator) attached to a casing assembly 204 . The electrical wire inputs to the coil module 104 are then connected to the electrical wire outputs from the decoder module 102 , while the electrical wire inputs to the decoder module 102 are coupled to the control wire path from the irrigation controller. Thus, a typical installation requires the connection of six wires to install the decoder module 102 and a coil module 104 . As is well known, in operation, a portion of a plunger (not shown) of the selector valve assembly 202 is disposed within the coil unit 104 while another portion is seated against a solenoid plunge port (not shown) within the selector valve assembly 202 in a normally closed position. In this position, high pressure water flow from a main water control valve (not shown) located within a main control valve portion 206 of the device is flowed up high pressure water line 208 into the selector valve assembly 202 and its regulator and is prevented from further movement by the normally closed position of the plunger against the solenoid port in the selector valve assembly 202 . This results in a back pressure that causes the main water control valve to close. In response to signals from the decoder module 102 , the coil module 104 causes the actuation of the plunger to move it off of (or unseat from) the solenoid plunge port allowing the high pressure flow in the high pressure line 208 to flow through the selector valve assembly 202 (and its pressure regulator), which relieves the back pressure and allows water to flow through the main control valve and to a pop-up sprinkler device, i.e., the main water control valve is opened. The pop-up sprinkler device is located within the casing assembly 204 and extends upwardly due to the water pressure through a top portion of the casing assembly 204 . The high pressure flow exits the selector valve assembly 202 down through a discharge flow line 210 which terminates within the casing assembly 204 at a location downstream of the main water control valve. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Several embodiments of the invention provide an integrated valve actuator coil and control module for use in irrigation control systems. In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device comprising: a coil adapted to develop an electromagnetic flux sufficient to cause actuation of irrigation equipment; control circuitry to receive a control signals from an irrigation control unit and electrically coupled to the coil to control the flux at the coil; and a housing covering at least a portion of the coil and at least a portion of the control circuitry. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method of making an irrigation control device comprising: holding a solenoid assembly with a coil near to control circuitry having circuitry for controlling an electromagnetic flux at the coil; electrically connecting the coil to the control circuitry; placing the solenoid assembly and control circuitry into a housing; securing the solenoid assembly to the housing so that the solenoid assembly is actuated to reciprocate a valve member through an aperture in the housing to selectively engage a valve seat external to the housing; and fixing the control circuitry and coil within the housing."

8150554,Resource use management in yards and gardens,2009-04-21,0,1,"CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is related to commonly assigned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,051 entitled “A Method for Providing an Application to Plants”; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,059 entitled “Horticultural Knowledge Base for Managing Yards and Gardens”; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,043 entitled “System and Method for Managing Resource Use”; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,065, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,028,470, entitled “Robotic Watering Unit” all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention relates generally to an irrigation control system and, more particularly, to a system and method for managing resource use in yards and gardens. Horticulture is the industry and science of plant cultivation. Horticulturists work and conduct research in the disciplines of plant propagation and cultivation, crop production, plant breeding and genetic engineering, plant biochemistry, and plant physiology. The work particularly involves fruits, berries, nuts, vegetables, flowers, trees, shrubs, and turf. Horticulturists work to improve crop yield, quality, nutritional value, and resistance to insects, diseases, and environmental stresses. One aspect of horticultural management is irrigation. Irrigation is typically used to water large, homogeneous areas such as fields, lawns, and gardens. The water is assumed to be available from a single source, such as a well, canal, or municipal water system. Water from municipal water systems are often stressed during times of heat and drought, and watering restrictions are frequently implemented to provide adequate water for higher priority uses. These restrictions may start as odd-even day lawn watering and progress to complete bans on lawn watering, and finally to complete bans on garden watering. The fields and lawns typically have a single species of plant and water application is based on water sensors, evapotranspiration models, or rules. This type of irrigation system can be inadequate for yards and gardens where numerous species are growing in close proximity, particularly large water users like trees and shrubs in proximity to lesser water users. Trees, shrubs, and structures also provide shade, which impacts evapotranspiration, which is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration. An embodiment of the present invention provides a computer program product comprising a computer recordable media having computer usable program code. Resource needs are determined for each plant in a plurality of plants to form individual resource needs. Conditions are identified in an environment in which the plurality of plants are located by receiving input from a sensor system to form current conditions. A plurality of per plant prescriptions are calculated for the plurality of plants using the individual resource needs and the current conditions. The application of the resource is controlled from a mobile utility vehicle to each plant in the plurality of plants using the plurality of per plant prescriptions. The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present invention or may be combined in yet other embodiments in which further details can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings."
7584542,Trimmer,2003-11-03,0,1,"This invention relates to a grass trimming device which is capable of being switched between at least two alternative configurations which are suitable for grass trimming and edge trimming respectively. A known grass trimming device (trimmer) comprises a cutting head mounted at one end of a shaft, an operator handle being positioned at the other end of the shaft. The cutting head includes a cutter constituted by a rotatable blade or a rotatable flexible cutting line. The cutting head can be moved relative to the shaft, to position the cutter generally horizontal for grass trimming and generally vertical for edge trimming. DE-A-3 010 092 describes a known trimmer of this type, the trimmer having a handle that can be moved from a first socket on the cutting head to a second socket on the same head, in order to shift the cutting head from a configuration in which the cutter plane is horizontal for grass trimming to a configuration in which the cutter is vertical for edge trimming. In both configurations of the device, a shaft fitted to the handle is directed upwardly towards the operator. This device suffers from the drawback that changing from one function to the other is difficult, because it is necessary to release and then remove the handle from one socket, and then replace it and lock it into position in the second socket. EP-A-0 005 540 shows a similar device where the handle is pivotally adjustable in a plane which is perpendicular to the cutting plane. Changing the configuration of this device requires releasing a handle catch, turning the handle through 180°, releasing the cutting head, and then adjusting it to the required angle. Moreover, a relatively complex arrangement of parts is necessary to achieve the changeover. This results in considerable expense, and a risk that the components, which are not totally covered may be damaged by the ingress of dirt and debris. EP-A-0 296 789 describes a trimmer in which the shaft includes a coupling section to which the cutting head is pivotally attached. The cutting head includes a surface defining a parting plane at which plane the coupling section is coupled to the cutting head. The parting plane, extends laterally with respect to the shaft, so that relative movement at the parting plane between the coupling section and the cutting head is about an axis which is perpendicular to the parting plane and obliquely to the shaft, so that relative movement between the coupling section and the cutting head about the parting plane positions the cutter in grass trimming and edge trimming configurations. Each of the trimmers described above is relatively easy to operate when in the trimming configuration. However, when in the edging configuration, the user must stand at right-angles to the edge of a lawn being trimmed, and move sideways along that edge as trimming progresses. This is disadvantageous, in that it is difficult to align the cutter accurately with the edge of the lawn (owing to the eye of the user not being in alignment with the lawn edge), and this can lead to a poor edging performance. Moreover, each of the known trimmers requires a relatively complex series of operations to convert between trimming and edging configurations. The aim of the invention is to provide a trimmer having improved edging capabilities. The present invention provides a trimmer comprising a cutting head housing a cutter means, and an elongate shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being connected to the shaft by connection means permitting the cutting head to be positioned with its cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical without disconnecting the cutting head and the shaft, the shaft having a hand-grippable portion at a position remote from the cutting head, the arrangement being such that the line joining a point within the hand-grippable portion and the connection means is substantially parallel to plane of rotation of the cutter means when the cutter means is substantially vertical. Preferably, the connection means is such that the cutting head is movable between positions in which its cutter means is substantially horizontal and substantially vertical in a single movement. Advantageously, the connection means is such that the cutter means is movable between the substantially horizontal position and the substantially vertical position by an effective rotation of the cutting head relative to the handle of 120° in one direction or 240° in the other direction. Preferably, the connection means is constituted by a rotatable joint. In this case, the rotatable joint is such that the cutting head is movable between positions in which its cutter means is substantially horizontal and substantially vertical about a single axis. In a preferred embodiment, the axis of rotation of the rotatable joint lies substantially at 35.5° to the plane of rotation of the cutter means, and lies substantially at 35.5° to the horizontal when the cutting head is positioned with the cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical. Connection means of this nature enables the cutting head to be moved between a trimming mode (in which the cutter means is substantially horizontal) and an edging mode (in which the cutter means is substantially vertical) by a simple rotation of the cutting head relative to the shaft. A particular advantage of this connection means is that the elongate shaft is generally aligned with a lawn edge in the edging mode, so that the user can carry out an edging operation when positioned behind the cutting head and moving forwards (or backwards) along the edge portion of the lawn. Advantageously, the rotatable joint is constituted by a ball-and-socket joint. Preferably, the ball is fixed to the cutting head, and the socket is defined by a generally spherical socket portion formed at the end of the shaft remote from the hand-grippable portion. The trimmer may further comprise a motor for driving the cutter means. Conveniently, the cutter means is rotatable, and the drive engagement between the motor and the cutter means is a rotatable drive engagement. Preferably, the motor is housed within the ball, and is an electric motor. Preferably, a rotatable cutter line constitutes the cutter means, In a preferred embodiment, the trimmer further comprises a wheel rotatably mounted on the cutting head. The axis of rotation of the wheel may be substantially coincident with the axis of rotation of the cutter means. Advantageously, the radius of the wheel is of the order of, but slightly less than, the effective radius of the cutter means. The invention also provides a cutting head housing a cutter means, and a shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being adjustably mounted with respect to the shaft by connection means enabling the cutter means to be moved between substantially vertical and substantially horizontal positions by adjusting the position of the cutting head relative to the shaft by an effective rotation of 120° in one direction or 240° in the other direction. The invention further provides a cutting head housing a cutter means, and a shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being rotatably mounted with respect to the shaft by means of a rotatable joint whose axis of rotation lies substantially at 45° to the plane rotation of the cutter means, and lies substantially at 45° to the horizontal when the cutting head is positioned with its cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical."

The top plate is circular in shape and is made of ALMAG 35, an aluminum and magnesium alloy. This plate has a flat top side and a centerhole extending from the top side through to a bottom side. Its bottom side is characterized by the presence of a slightly elevated circular rim circumscribing its outer perimeter. Moreover, its bottom side is characterized by a cylindrically shaped downwardly directed well therefrom co-extensive with a conically inclined recession downward which is in turn co-extensive with the flooring of the bottom side, the greatest diameter of which downwardly directed well is significantly less than that of the plate. The vertical axis of symmetry of the centerhole, the downwardly directed well and the plate itself is one and the same. Extending from and co-extensive with the outer walls of the recession and the well are each of three solid rectangularly shaped abutments that are likewise co-extensive. with the flooring of the bottom side the recession and the above-mentioned circular rim. Each abutment, the vertical axes of symmetry of each of which are 120.degree. removed from the vertical axes of symmetry of the two adjacent abutments, contains one of the abovementioned top plate through holes into which, one each respectively of the cylindrical pins have been press-fitted. A first rounded concave depression in the wall of the well is found just adjacent the left side of one abutment and a second rounded concave depression in the wall of the well is found just adjacent the right side of an adjacent abutment such that the depressions are 180.degree. removed from one another. At the base of the inner wall of the well there is also flooring of the bottom side within the center of which there is the centerhole. An arrow pointing in a clockwise direction is etched into this portion of the bottom side flooring. Finally, there is also a bottom plate. This bottom plate is made of ALMAG 35 alloy material as well. It is likewise circular in shape with an outer diameter equal to that of the top plate. The bottom side of the bottom plate has a flat external surface that is slightly recessed closer to the center of the bottom plate. Closer still to the center of the bottom plate there is to be found a hollow cylindrical elevation extending from bottom to top within the center of which there is a center hole extending from the floor of the hollow cylindrical elevation through to the top side of the bottom plate and about and co-extensive with the lower portion of which hollow cylindrical elevation there is a conically shaped elevation surfacewise co-extensive with the base surface of the top side. The top side of the bottom plate is characterized by the presence of a slightly elevated circular rim that circumscribes its outer perimeter. On the top outer surface of the cylindrical elevation in the bottom plate there is etched an arrow pointed in a counterclockwise direction. The top outer surface of the previously described conically shaped elevation of the bottom plate which is co-extensive with the outer wall of the bottom plate hollow cylindrical elevation is also co-extensive with each of three solid rectangularly shaped abutments jutting therefrom and reaching to the outer rim of the top side of the bottom plate. The long vertical central axis of symmetry of each abutment is 120.degree. removed from the long vertical central axes of the two adjacent abutments. In each of these abutments near the outer rim of the top plate is a closed hole just large enough to receive the bottom portions of each one of the abovementioned pins each holding a beveled blade when the top plate and bottom plate are assembled to one another. Extending from and co-extensive with the outer surface of the hollow cylindrically shaped elevation on the top side of the bottom plate and co-extensive with the top outer surface of the concave shaped elevation of the bottom plate are each of two rounded convex ridges 180.degree. removed from one another that each fit respectively snug into one of the abovementioned concave depressions in the bottom side of the top plate when the two plates are assembled together. When the two plates with pins and blades are assembled together, they are then fitted to the rotatory head of a motorized brush cutter stem, top side of top plate first and affixed thereto by way of an appropriate nut and bolt combination depending on the type of head to be fitted to. The instant invention so affixed to a rotatory head is then ready to serve as a heavy duty vegetation cutting tool. There is a virtually never ending need for the expeditious commercial forging of ski trails, snowmobile trails, cross-country trails, horse trails and commercial clearing of power line rights-of-way and golf courses throughout the country. Such undertakings often prove to be laborious, time-consuming and relatively expensive. The instant invention however serves to greatly minimize such labor, time and cost. To begin with, one of the major problems with respect to the utilization of any currently used brushcutting device is the one wherein invariably it proves virtually impossible to cut level to ground. Consequently, after cutting, there are nevertheless vestiges of stumps still left standing that can prove to be problematic with respect to vehicular tires or to ski units after cutting. The instant invention unlike all of the prior art however permits cutting right level to ground rather than only to a level of two inches or so above ground such that therefore such problems associated with stump vestiges are totally eliminated. Additionally, the plates of the instant invention being made of ALMAG 35, an alloy of aluminum and magnesium make for a much lighter cutting tool to be fitted to the head of a brush cutting stem unit. Ease of use by a workman is thus greatly facilitated. The instant invention consisting of two plates, one with three press fitted pins and three freely rotatable beveled blades is extremely easy to assemble. This feature together with its relatively light weight as well as its facility for absorbing the shock of cutting and thereby greatly reducing any flow of cutting shock up the stem of a brush cutter renders the instant invention inherently much more user friendly than any of the various currently in vogue cutting tools utilized for such clearing. Also, the instant invention is amenable to being fitted to a counterclockwise turning rotatory head or to one that turns clockwise simply by fitting its three blade components to its pin components during assembly such that blade beveled ends face in the direction of rotation of the head. If a user cuts right to left when utilizing a cutter with a counterclockwise turning head, he or she will avoid kickback when hitting a tree, once again due to the swivel capability of each of the invention's blade components held by its press fitted pins. This feature of swivelability about pins permits a simple collapsing inward of blades upon impact with rocks thereby alleviating problems associated with rock impact shock. Also, the plate components are rust proof and shatterproof under all conditions of cutting thereby rendering the instant invention eminently more durable and inherently much safer than any of the cutting tools currently in use for such heavy brush and stump cutting purposes in areas where lots of rocks are located. Finally, unlike any other cutting tool available for clearing heavy, thick brush and small tree stumps during the course of a significant commercial undertaking, deformation with use and wear to the extent it might ever occur at all occurs only uniformly throughout the whole tool by virtue of the manner in which the two plates fit together when assembled. Also, blades of varying length and hardness can be utilized in conjunction with the plates and pins. Short, relatively thick blades are particularly useful to cut small tree stumps flush to the level of ground. Longer not quite so thick blades serve to cut heavy clumps of grass and weeks flush to the level of ground. Respectfully submitted, the instant invention in view of its above-described user and rock friendly features that enable heavy vegetation cutting and clearing to be undertaken on the average 27 percent faster on the basis of studies conducted by your inventor comparing its capabilities to other cutting heads currently in use render it indeed not only new, useful and unique but indeed virtually revolutionary in the art of brush cutting tools."
6506243,Environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends,1999-05-05,0,1,"FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the selection and use of environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends which exhibit low or reduced reactivity with respect to ozone formation. These environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends are useful in a number of applications, particularly as industrial solvents, and allow formulators an effective means to improve the environmental performance of their formulations or products. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fluid applications are broad, varied, and complex, and each application has its own set of characteristics and requirements. Proper fluid selection and fluid blend development have a large impact on the success of the operation in which the fluid is used. For instance, in a typical industrial coatings operation, a blend of several fluids is used in order to get an appropriate evaporation profile. Such a blend must also provide the appropriate solvency properties, including formulation stability, viscosity, flow/leveling, and the like. The fluid blend choice also affects the properties of the dry film, such as gloss, adhesion, and the like. Moreover, these and other properties may further vary according to the application method (e.g., spray-on), whether the substrate is original equipment (OEM), refinished, etc., and the nature of the substrate coated. Other operations involving the use of fluids and fluid blends include cleaning, printing, delivery of agricultural insecticides and pesticides, extraction processes, use in adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, and drilling muds, and countless others. The term fluid encompasses the traditional notion of a solvent, but the latter term no longer adequately describes the possible function of a fluid or blend in the countless possible operations. As used herein the term fluid includes material that may function as one or more of a carrier, a diluent, a surface tension modifier, dispersant, and the like, as well as a material functioning as a solvent, in the traditional sense of a liquid which solvates a substance (e.g., a solute). The term industrial solvent applies to a class of liquid organic compounds used on a large scale to perform one or more of the numerous functions of a fluid in a variety of industries. Relatively few of the large number of known organic compounds that could be used as fluids find use as industrial solvents. Fluids that are used in large quantities have heretofore been selected because they can be produced economically and have attractive safety and use characteristics in manufacturing, consumer and commercial environments. Examples of commercial solvents and their uses as industrial solvents are described in an article entitled Solvents, Industrial, by Don A. Sullivan, Shell Chemical, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th. ed., V. 22, pp.529-571(III) (1997). In addition to the problems with fluid and fluid blend selection mentioned at the outset, there is also the problem that, in most applications, at least some of the fluid evaporates and can escape into the environment. Although many industrial coating operations, such as in original equipment manufacturing (OEM), utilize control equipment to capture or incinerate >95% of the solvent emissions, nevertheless in a majority of applications some of the solvents inevitably enters the atmosphere. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six pollutants: ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and particulates. Of all the NAAQS standards, ozone non-attainment has the greatest impact on solvent operations. Solvents typically are volatile organic compounds (VOC), which are involved in complex photochemical atmospheric reactions, along with oxygen and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere under the influence of sunlight, to produce ozone. Ozone formation is a problem in the troposphere (low atmospheric or ground-based), particularly in an urban environment, since it leads to the phenomenon of smog. Since VOC emissions are a source of ozone formation, industrial operations and plants using solvents are heavily regulated to attain ozone compliance. As different regulations have been adopted, the various approaches to controlling pollution have evolved. Certain early regulations controlled solvent composition, while later regulations primarily concerned overall VOC reduction. According to current VOC emission regulations in the U.S.A., solvents generally belong to one of two groups depending on their reactivity toward atmospheric photochemical ozone formation: (a) Negligible reactivity organic compounds which generate about the same or less quantity of ozone as would be produced by the same weight % as ethane. These organic compounds are exempt from the definition of a VOC and are not considered to be a VOC in any solvent (fluid) composition. There are numerous such compounds exempted by the EPA from the definition of VOC. However, a majority of such exempted compounds are halogenated derivatives which can possess one or more of the following deficiencies: toxicity, ozone depletion, or waste disposal or incineration problems. Other non-halogenated, oxygenated organic compounds, such as acetone and methyl acetate, have been exempted by the EPA, but such compounds have extremely high evaporation rates and high flammability so as to reduce their applicability in numerous applications. Other such organic compounds, such as tertiary butyl acetate which is under exemption consideration by the EPA, while having a significantly improved flammability level and evaporation rate, may be too chemically and thermally unstable for many applications. (b) All other oxygenated and hydrocarbon solvents are considered to be VOC's and treated by the EPA as equally (on a weight basis) polluting. A more recent U.S. regulation has combined VOC reduction with composition constraints. While the traditional source of emission reduction is large stationary industrial facilities, the EPA and other governmental entities have turned increasingly to consumer and commercial products for reduction in their solvent usage as an additional means to lower VOC emission and therefore ozone formation. Numerous government and trade publications discuss VOC's, and information is readily available on the Internet. See, for instance, http://www.paintcoatings.net/VOCW97.html. Various measurements of reactivity with respect to ozone formation are known. For instance, reactivity can be measured in environmental smog chambers, or they may be calculated using computer airshed models. See, for instance, Dr. William P. L. Carter, Uncertainties and Research Needs in Quantifying VOC Reactivity for Stationary Source Emission Controls, presented at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Consumer Products Reactivity Subgroup Meeting, Sacramento, Calif. (Oct. 17, 1995). There has also been developed a KOH scale, which provides a relative scale of the reactivity of VOC with the OH radicals involved in the complex reactions that produce ozone. See, for instance, Picquet et al., Int. J. Chem. Kinet. 30, 839-847 (1998); Bilde et al., J. Phys. Chem. A 101, 3514-3525 (1997). Numerous other reactivity scales are known and new reactivity scales are constantly being developed. Since this is a rapidly changing area of research, the most up-to-date information is often obtained via the Internet. One example is Airsite, the Atmospheric Chemistry International Research Site for Information and Technology Exchange, sponsored by the University of North Carolina and the University of Leeds, at http://airsite.unc.edu. Another way to measure the reactivity of a chemical in ozone formation is by using a technique developed by Dr. Carter (supra) at the Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CERT), University of California at Riverside. The CERT technique measures incremental reactivities, the incremental amount of ozone that is produced when the chemical is added to an already polluted atmosphere. Two experiments are conducted to measure the incremental reactivity. A base case experiment measures the ozone produced in an environmental smog chamber under atmospheric conditions designed to represent a polluted atmosphere. The second experiment called the test case adds the chemical to the polluted smog chamber to determine how much more ozone is produced by the newly added chemical. The results of these tests under certain conditions of VOC and nitrogen oxide ratios are then used in mechanistic models to determine the Maximum Incremental Reactivities (MIR), which is a measure of ozone formation by the chemical compound in question. The State of California has adopted a reactivity program for alternative fuels based on this technique and the EPA has exempted several compounds due to studies conducted by CERT. See, for instance, Federal Register 31,633 (Jun. 16, 1995) (acetone); 59 Federal Register 50,693 (Oct. 5, 1994) (methyl siloxanes), Federal Register 17,331 (Apr. 9, 1998) (methyl acetate). CARB and EPA have uses a weight average MIR for regulatory purposes, wherein the weight average MIR of a solvent blend is calculated by summing the product of the weight percent of each solvent and its respective MIR value. A list of compounds and their MIR values is available in the Preliminary Report to California Air Resources Board, Contract No. 95-308, William P. L. Carter, Aug. 6, 1998. A table of known MIR values may be found on the internet at http://helium.ucr.edu/~carter/index.html. CERT obtains other incremental reactivities by varying the ratios of VOC and nitrogen oxides. A detailed explanation of the methods employed and the determination of incremental reactivities and MIR scale may be found in the literature. See, for instance, International Journal of Chemical Kinetics, 28, 497-530 (1996); Atmospheric Environment, 29, 2513-2527 (1995), and 29, 2499-2511 (1995); and Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 44, 881-899 (1994); Environ. Sci. Technol. 23, 864 (1989). Moreover, various computer programs to assist in calculating MIR values are available, such as the SAPRC97 model, at http://helium.ucr.edu/~carter/saprc97.htm. Any of these aforementioned scales could be used for regulatory purposes, however the MIR scale has been found to correlate best to peak ozone formation in certain urban areas having high pollution, such as the Los Angeles basin. MIR values can be reported as the absolute MIR determined by the CERT method or as a relative MIR. One common relative MIR scale uses the Reactive Organic Gas (ROG) in the base case as a benchmark. The Absolute Reactivity ROG is 3.93 g O3 per gram ROG. This value is then the divisor for the absolute MIR of other VOCs, if MIR is cited relative to ROG. Absolute reactivities related to the ROG with the above mentioned absolute reactivity 3.93 are provided in Updated Maximum Incremental Reactivity Scale for Regulatory Applications, Preliminary Report to California Air Resources Board, Contract No. 95-308, William P. Carter, Aug. 6, 1998. For the purposes of this invention and specification, unless otherwise specifically stated, all MIR values provided herein are Absolute MIR values. It is understood, however, that the Absolute MIR values can be converted to Relative MIR and back to Absolute MIR by division or multiplication of MIR by ROG. Current regulations based on VOC emissions do not take into consideration the wide difference in ozone formation among non-exempt VOC compounds. For example, two non-exempt VOC compounds can have dramatically different ozone formation characteristics. Accordingly, current regulations do not encourage end users to minimize ozone formation by using low reactivity solvent compositions. Although there are federal and state regulatory trends toward requiring the reduction of the reactivity of solvents, the number of exempt solvents is small and in no way satisfies all the other properties required for an effective solvent such as good solvency, appropriate flash point, evaporation rate, boiling temperature, chemical and thermal stability. Solvents currently viewed as essentially non-ozone producing are those which have reactivity rates in the range of ethane. Ethane has a measured reactivity based on the MIR method of 0.35. In fact, the EPA has granted a VOC exemption to certain solvents with reactivity values in this range including acetone (MIR=0.48) and methyl acetate (MIR=0.12). However, the number of known materials having reactivities of 0.50 or less based on the MIR scale is relatively small. Moreover, it is a discovery of the present inventors that many if not most of the known fluids having acceptable reactivities with respect to ozone formation have other unfavorable performance characteristics, e.g., poor solvent properties, low flash point, inappropriate evaporation rate or volatility characteristics, unacceptable toxicity, unacceptable particulate matter formation, thermal or chemical instability and as such have limited, if any, applicability in industry. For example, ethane is a gas under ambient conditions and hence is a poor choice as an industrial solvent. Methyl acetate has an excellent MIR=0.12, but a low flash point of about -12deg C.; acetone has an acceptable MIR=0.48, but is extremely flammable. As a further example, tertiary butyl acetate (t-butyl acetate) has an excellent MIR=0.21, but has limited thermal stability and is unstable to acid catalysts which may be present in an industrial operation. Regarding particulate matter, the EPA has recently proposed standards for particulate matter under 2.5 &mgr;m (microns) in diameter (PM2.5). See 61 Federal Register 65638-65713 (Dec. 13, 1996). The proposal sets an annual limit, spatially averaged across designated air quality monitors, of 15 &mgr;g/m3, and a 24-hour standard of 65 &mgr;g/m3. Numerous discussions of this proposed standard are available on the internet, such as at http://www.cnie.org/nle/air~html, which cites numerous references (such as Wolf, The Scientific Basis for a Particulate Matter Standard, Environmental Management (Oct. 26-31, 1996)). As far as the present inventors are aware, the prior art has not addressed ways of meeting these proposed requirements, much less in meeting these requirements in conjunction with ozone reduction requirements. Moreover, the present inventors have also discovered that in many applications, VOC exempt solvents cannot be used as a one-for-one replacement for conventional solvents. Rather the formulator must balance a number of performance factors to develop an acceptable solvent or solvent blend for a particular application. Some factors are more relevant than others for specific applications. Nevertheless, many performance factors are similar for a number of applications. Numerous attempts have been made to utilize the concept of environmentally friendly fluids in practical applications. For instance, there are a number of cleaning and/or stripping formulations available that are said to overcome certain prior art environmental problems. Examples include a binary azeotrope of octamethyltrisiloxane with n-propoxypropanol (U.S. Pat. No. 5,516,450), hexamethyidisiloxane and azeotropes and other mixtures thereof (U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,403), a nonazeotropic mixture including a halocarbon and an oxygenated organic solvent component having at least 3 carbons, which may be, for instance, dimethylcarbonate (U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,080), and a composition comprising an amide and a dialkyl carbonate (U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,133). In addition, there have been a number of patents and literature references to materials intended to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as, for instance, blowing agents. These efforts address stratospheric ozone depletion, which is the opposite phenomenon addressed by the present invention. Examples include the use of dimethoxymethane and cyclopentane (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,631,305; 5,665,788; and 5,723,509), cyclopentane (U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,652) and polyglycols (U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,144). Still further, a non-ozone depleting solvent comprising halogenated compounds and an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon compound having 6-20 carbon atoms is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,749,956. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,480 describes a method for reducing the levels of air pollution resulting from the combustion of diesel fuel in engines comprising blending dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with diesel fuel and combusting the blended fuel in engines. U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,144 also discusses the addition of oxygenates, including methyl pivalate (methyl 1,1,1-trimethyl acetate) to gasoline (as octane boosters). The problems addressed by these patents do not relate to the problem of industrial solvent evaporation. WO 98/42774 discloses solvent-resin compositions which do not contribute appreciably to the formation of ground based ozone. Organic solvents are selected based upon having reaction rates with hydroxyl ion slower than ethane, and generally selected from halogenated solvents such as chlorobromomethane, methyl chloride, and the like. The only non-halogenated solvents that are suggested are n-alkanes (C12 -C18), methyl and t-butyl acetate, acetone, dimethoxymethane, and mineral oils. However, heretofore there has been no general solution to the problem of ground-based ozone formation that also provides for a fluid with appropriate performance attributes for an industrial solvent. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends, their use as industrial solvents, and to a method of reducing ozone formation in a process wherein at least a portion of a fluid eventually evaporates. The fluids and fluid blends of this invention have been selected by the present inventors for their actual or potential low reactivity in the complex photochemical atmospheric reaction with molecular oxygen (O2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to create ozone. The present invention provides a means to reduce ozone formation by photochemical atmospheric reactions from a fluid solvent composition which is intended at application conditions to at least partially evaporate into the atmosphere. By properly selecting low reactive components for a fluid solvent composition, ozone formation can be reduced. For the purposes of the present invention three groups of reduced ozone reactivity fluids and their uses are described and claimed: (a) Low Polluting Potential Fluid (LPPF), (b) Very Low Polluting Potential Fluid (VLPPF), and (c) Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid (NPPF), according to the Absolute MIR numbers as follows: Fluid Solvent Designation Absolute MIR Low Polluting Potential Fluid >1.0-<=1.5 gm ozone produced/ gm fluid Very Low Polluting Potential Fluid >0.5-<=1.0 gm ozone produced/ gm fluid Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid <=0.5 gm ozone produced/gm fluid Where a composition is a blend of fluids, a weight average MIR (WAMIR) can be calculated as WAMIR=&Sgr;Wi*MIRi Where Wi is a weight fraction of solvent fluid component i and MIRi is the absolute MIR value of solvent fluid component i. For the purposes of the present invention, WAMIR will be the preferred method of measuring ozone formation potential or OFP. It is preferred that the fluids and fluid blends also provide at least one other desirable performance property such as high flash point, low particulate formation, suitable evaporation rates, suitable solvency, low toxicity, high thermal stability, and chemical inertness with respect to non-ozone producing reactions, particularly with respect to acids which may be present in coating formulations. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the fluids are used in a blend with known industrial solvents or other fluids which present an environmental problem with respect to MIR or lack one or more of the aforementioned desirable performance properties, so that the new fluid blends will have lower MIR than they would without the substituted low ozone formation reactivity fluid or have at least one of the aforementioned other desirable performance properties. The present invention is also directed to a method of reducing ozone formation from atmospheric photochemical reactions in an application wherein a fluid eventually evaporates, at least partially, into the atmosphere, comprising replacing at least a portion of a fluid having a relatively higher MIR with a fluid having a relatively lower MIR. In the case where a blend results, it is preferred that the weighted average MIR of the blend be similar to or less than the MIR of a Low Polluting Potential Fluid, and most preferably similar to the MIR of a Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid. A fluid or fluid blend according to the present invention may be used in any process, e.g., any process using a fluid as a carrier, diluent, dispersant, solvent, and the like, on any scale, e.g., pilot plant scale, or industrial scale. It is preferred that the process be a stationary industrial process and it is preferred that the process is a non-combustion process. The present invention offers its greatest benefit from the standpoint of safety and health in large-scale industrial or commercial processes, particularly industrial coating processes or in formulations used in large quantities overall, albeit on a small scale for each individual use, e.g., by a consumer, such as in household paints, cosmetics, and the like. The ordinary artisan can readily differentiate between what is an industrial scale, pilot plant scale, and laboratory scale processes. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to identify liquid organic compounds not heretofore identified as low reactivity solvent fluids and have not been used on a large scale commercial basis to reduce ozone formation. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of selecting fluids and/or fluid blends for applications which release fluids into the air and wherein there is a need to reduce ozone formation due to low atmospheric or ground-based (tropospheric) photochemical reactivity, in order to replace conventional solvents and/or solvent blends currently used in various compositions or processes. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of optimizing compositions comprising an evaporative fluid by selecting a fluid and/or fluid blend providing a reduced MIR as well as at least one additional performance attribute selected from high flash point, low particulate formation, suitable evaporation rates, suitable solvency, low toxicity, high thermal and chemical stability. Still another object of the present invention includes the selection of fluids and/or fluid blends providing low reactivity in ozone formation having compatibility with a wide range of organic compounds of different polarity and molecular weights to make the fluids and/or fluid blends suitable for a wide range of compositions. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of reducing ozone formation caused by the release into the troposphere of a fluid or fluid blend in a process utilizing the fluid or fluid blend, comprising replacing at least a portion of the fluid with another fluid having a lower MIR. A further object is to provide a method of reducing ground-based ozone formation due to fluid evaporation without resorting to expensive control equipment to capture all fluid emission into the environment. Another object is to provide solvents that reduce ground base ozone formation without the use of halogenated solvents and their associated toxicity, incineration, and waste disposal issues. These and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent as reference is made below to a detailed description, preferred embodiments, and specific examples of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The fluids used in accordance with this invention have been selected for their low or reduced ozone formation potential (as reflected in their low or reduced MIR). The ozone formation potential of a composition or fluid solvent may be determined by any scientifically recognized or peer reviewed method including but not limited to, the MIR scale, the KOH scale, smog chamber studies, and modeling studies such as those performed by Dr. William P. L. Carter. Most references in the description of the present invention will be to the Absolute MIR scale measured in grams ozone produced/gram of fluid solvent. By low MIR is meant that the fluids have an MIR similar to or less than 1.5 gram of ozone per gram of the solvent fluid. By reduced MIR is meant that, in a process according to the present invention, a first fluid is replaced, in whole or in part, by a second fluid, the second fluid having an MIR lower than the first fluid. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine ozone reactivity of a material according to methods in numerous literature sources and tabulated data published in the open literature. It is mentioned that the terms replace, replacement, replacing and the like used herein are not to be taken as implying only the act of substituting a second fluid (having acceptable MIR as described herein) in a formulation for a first fluid that may have been previously used in that and similar formulation(s), with such first fluid has undesirable MIR as described herein. Rather, the terms are intended to include the formulations themselves comprising a mixture of the first and second fluids, or one or more such second fluid(s) without any of said first fluid(s), as the fluid system of the formulation. In the case where no such first fluid(s) are present, the concept of replacement is intended to refer to corresponding formulations that have only such first fluid(s) present instead of such second fluid(s) and therefore have a lower OFP. The MIR is preferably determined by smog chamber studies, modeling studies, or a combination thereof, but is more preferably determined by incremental reactivity, and still more preferably by the Absolute MIR, as discussed above. The MIR of a fluid used in this invention is preferably less than or equal to 1.5 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid, more preferably less than or equal to 1.0 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid, and most preferably less than or equal to 0.5 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid, but the benefits of the present invention are realized if ozone formation is reduced by replacing a first fluid with a second fluid, in whole or in part, wherein the MIR of the second fluid is reduced from that of the first fluid, even if the second fluid has an MIR greater than 1.5 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid. Therefore, it is preferred that the fluid according to the present invention have an MIR less than or equal to 1.50 and more preferably less than or equal to 1.00, still more preferably less than or equal to 0.50. In an even more preferred embodiment, the reactivity in ozone formation is preferably equal to or less than that of acetone and even more preferably equal to or less than that of ethane, by whatever scale or method is used, but most preferably by the MIR scale. Thus, in a more preferred embodiment, the fluid used in a composition according to the present invention will have an MIR less than or equal to 0.50, even more preferably less than or equal to 0.35. Specifically preferred fluids according to the present invention include: dialkyl carbonates, such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl ethyl carbonate, methyl isopropyl carbonate, methyl sec-butyl carbonate, methyl t-butyl carbonate, methyl neopentyl carbonate, and diisopropyl carbonate; alkyl acetates, such as neopentyl acetate, ethylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-butylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-butylene glycol diacetate, 2,3-butylene glycol diacetate, neopentyl glycol diacetate; dioxolanes such as 2,2-dimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4-trimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4,5-tetra methyl dioxolane; pivalates such as methyl pivalate (methyl 1,1,1-trimethyl acetate), ethyl pivalate, isopropyl pivalate, t-butyl pivalate (TBP), neopentyl pivalate (NPP), 1,2-propylene glycol bis-pivalate (PGBP), ethylene glycol bis-pivalate, ethylene glycol monopivalate, 1,2-butylene glycol mono-pivalate (1,2-BGMP), 2,3-butylene glycol monopivalate (2,3-BGMP), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 2,3-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (2,3-BGPA), ethylene glycol pivalate acetate, 1,2 propylene glycol monopivalate, neopentyl glycol mono pivalate, and 1,2-propylene glycol pivalate acetate; isobutyrate compounds such as isopropyl isobutyrate, neopentyl isobutyrate, and neopentyl glycol mono isobutyrate; and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanonitrile (TMPN); isopropyl neononanoate; pivalonitrile; methyl 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanoate (methyl neononanoate) and methyl 3,5,5 trimethyl hexanoate. Other preferred fluids are oxygenated (oxygen containing) organic compounds substantially free of moieties containing unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds or aromatic groups. In the case of a blend, the weighted average MIR of the fluids in a composition according to the present invention will also have the perferred, more preferred, and most preferred MIR levels as discussed above. In another preferred embodiment, wherein the blend results from replacing part of a first fluid with a second fluid and thereby reducing the weight average MIR, it is preferred that the weight average MIR be reduced 10%, more preferably 25%, still more preferably 50%, from the MIR calculated prior to the fluid replacement. In yet another preferred embodiment, the Low Polluting Potential Fluids (LPPF), Very Low Polluting Potential Fluids (VLPPF), and Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluids (NPPF), as described herein will provide at least one other desirable performance property such as high flash point low particulate formation, suitable evaporation rates, suitable solvency, low toxicity, high thermal stability, and chemical inertness. Of course, it is more preferable that the fluid or blends have two or more of these performance attributes, and so on, so that the most preferred fluid or fluid blend has all of these performance attributes. In the case of a process of reducing ozone formation, wherein a fluid according to the present invention replaces a fluid, at least in part, having a higher MIR, described in more detail below, it is preferred that this fluid replacement process, in addition to reducing ozone formation does not negatively impact any other desirable performance attributes of the composition as described above. The flash point of a fluid according to the present invention is preferably at least -6.1deg C. or higher, more preferably greater than +6.0deg C., even more preferably greater than 15deg C., still more preferably greater than 25deg C., yet even more preferably greater than 37.8deg C., and most preferably greater than 60deg C. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine the flash point of a fluid or blend (e.g., ASTM D92-78). In the case of a blend, the flash point of the blend may be the flash point of the more volatile component, in the instance where the flash points of the individual components differ markedly or where the more volatile component is the predominant component. The flash point of the blend may be in between the flash points of the individual components. As used herein, the term flash point will refer to the flash point experimentally determined for a single fluid or a blend, as applicable. The fluid or blend thereof, according to the present invention, should preferably not contribute measurably to particulate formation of particulates having a size diameter below 2.5 &mgr;m--referred to as 2.5PM herein--in the atmosphere. In a preferred embodiment of a process of reducing ozone formation, the fluid selected to replace a previously-used solvent will be one that also reduces particulate matter to less than or equal to 65 &mgr;g/m3, and more preferably less than or equal to 50 &mgr;g/m3, when measured over a 24-hour period, preferably spatially averaged over all monitors in a given geographic area. The evaporation rate should be suitable for the intended purpose. In many if not most applications, the fluid according to the present invention will be used to replace, at least in part, a fluid which is environmentally disadvantaged, meaning it has a reactivity in ozone formation greater than 1.5 in Absolute MIR units. The fluid selected preferably will have a similar evaporation rate to the disadvantaged fluid being replaced, particularly in the case where a fluid blend is used and an acceptable evaporation profile is desired. It is convenient for the fluid selected to have an evaporation rate less than 12 times the evaporation rate of n-butyl acetate. Evaporation rates may also be given relative to n-butyl acetate at 1.0 (ASTM D3539-87). Ranges of evaporation rates important for different applications are 5-3, 3-2, 2-1, 1.0-0.3, 0.3-0.1, and 25% of the fluid is evaporated, more preferably when >50% of the fluid is evaporated, more preferably when >80% of the fluid is evaporated, more preferably when >95% of the fluid is evaporated, and most preferably when >99% of the fluid is evaporated. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention wherein, in a method of reducing ozone formation, a fluid according to the present invention replaces, at least in part, another fluid not according to the present invention, the fluid replaced has an evaporative rate ranging from that of MEK (methyl ethyl ketone) to less than that of n-butyl acetate. The fluid or fluid blend according to the present invention may act in the traditional manner of a solvent by dissolving completely the intended solute or it may act to disperse the solute, or it may act otherwise as a fluid defined above. It is important that the solvency of the fluid be adequate for the intended purpose. In addition to the required solvency, the formulated product must be of a viscosity to enable facile application. Thus, the fluid or fluid blend must have the appropriate viscosities along with other performance attributes. One of ordinary skill in the art, in possession of the present disclosure, can determine appropriate solvent properties, including viscosity. Toxicity relates to the adverse effect that chemicals have on living organisms. One way to measure the toxic effects of a chemical is to measure the dose-effect relationship; the dose is usually measured in mg of chemical per kg of body mass. This is typically done experimentally by administering the chemical to mice or rats at several doses in the lethal range and plotting the logarithm of the dose versus the percentage of the population killed by the chemical. The dose lethal to 50% of the test population is called the median lethal dose (LD50) and is typically used as a guide for the toxicity of a chemical. See, for instance, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth Edition, Vol. 24, pp. 456-490. Currently an LD50 of >500 mg/kg qualifies as not classified for oral toxicity under OSHA rules. EU (European Union) uses a cutoff of >2,000 mg/kg. It is preferred that the fluid or fluid blend according to the present invention have an oral rat LD50 of >500 mg/kg, more preferably >1000 mg/kg, still more preferably >2,000 mg/kg, even more preferably >3,000 mg/kg, and most preferably >5,000 mg/kg. Likewise, the fluid or blend should also cause no toxicity problems by dermal or inhalation routes and should also not be an eye or skin irritant, as measured by OSHA or European Union (EU) standards. As described above, the present invention is related to fluid solvents and fluid solvent blends which produce reduced ozone formation due to atmospheric photochemical reactions and which avoid the deficiencies associated with halogenated organic compounds, particularly toxicity, ozone depletion, incineration by-products and waste disposal problems. In this aspect, the volatile components of the preferred fluid solvents and fluid solvent blends preferably do not have more than 2.0 wt. % of halogen and more preferably less than 0.5 wt. %, and most preferably less than 0.1 wt. %. The fluid according to the present invention should be thermally stable so that it does not break down. For instance, the material should not break down into reactive species. In a preferred embodiment, the fluid is more thermally stable than t-butyl acetate. Inertness, as used herein, refers to the lack of a tendency to undergo decomposition with other materials in the fluid system. It may include, for example, inertness towards acids or bases, but particularly to acid catalysts, which are typically present in coating compositions. It is preferred that the fluid being replaced have an MIR greater than that of acetone. In another embodiment, the incremental reactivity, based on the MIR scale, of the fluid being replaced is preferably >0.50, still more preferably >0.1.00, and most preferably >1.50. In another embodiment, it is critical that in a process of reducing tropospheric ozone formation according to the present invention, the fluid replaced have a greater MIR than the fluid added, that is, the fluid according to the present invention. Of course it is to be recognized that only a portion of the higher MIR fluid need be replaced, thus obtaining a blend, in order to achieve the ozone formation reduction. However, in another embodiment of the present invention, the fluid being replaced may have an acceptable MIR, but be unacceptable with respect to one or more of the aforementioned performance attributes of flash point or flammability, particulate formation, evaporation rate, solvency, toxicity, thermal stability, or inertness. Examples of a given blend of DMC and MEK will be provided wherein the appropriate addition of DMC (or replacement of acetone) provided for an improvement in at least one of these attributes. Examples of fluids which are replaced by fluids according to the present invention include aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon fluids such as: branched C6-C9 alkanes, straight chain alkanes, cycloaliphatic C6-C10 hydrocarbons, natural hydrocarbons (alpha or beta pinenes, or turpentines, etc.), ethanol, propanol and higher nontertiary alcohols, C3 and higher ethers, ether alcohols, ether alcohol acetates, ethyl ethoxy propionate, C5 and higher ketones, cyclic ketones, etc., C7+aromatic hydrocarbons; halocarbons, particularly chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons; and ethers such as cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF),. Examples of other common industrial solvents which may be replaced by fluids according to the present invention are those listed in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth Edition, Vol. 22, p. 536-548. Some particularly preferred replacements, i.e., a fluid according to the present invention for a currently used industrial solvent, include: in any application, but particularly coatings applications, DMC or methyl pivalate for toluene, xylene, or t-butyl acetate; methyl isopropyl carbonate (MIPC) for xylene or methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK); and diisopropyl carbonate (DIPC) for methyl amyl ketone (MAK), propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMAc), or ethyl ethoxy propionate (EEP); in any application, but particularly consumer product applications DMC, MIPC, or DIPC for hydrocarbons; in any application but particularly agricultural applications, DIPC for aromatic fluids; in any application but particularly cleaning applications, DIPC or methyl sec-butyl carbonate (MSBC) for chlorinated solvents; in any application, but particularly inks, substitute DMC or methyl pivalate for MEK and light acetates. The fluids and blends according to the present invention may be used in any process using a fluid, and particularly those process wherein at least a portion of the fluid evaporates and even more particularly wherein at least a portion evaporates into the atmosphere. Preferred processes are those utilizing the fluid as one or more of a carrier, diluent, dispersant, solvent, and the like, include processes wherein the fluid functions as an inert reaction medium in which other compounds react; as a heat-transfer fluid removing heat of reaction; to improve workability of a manufacturing process; as a viscosity reducer to thin coatings to application viscosity; as an extraction fluid to separate one material from another by selective dissolution; as a tackifier or to improve adhesion to a substrate for better bonding; as a dissolving medium to prepare solutions of polymers, resins, and other substances; to suspend or disperse pigments and other particulates; and the like. It is preferred that the process be a stationary process and also preferred that the process be a non-combustion process. It is particularly beneficial if the fluid according to the present invention be used to replace at least a portion of a traditional industrial solvent in a process using a large amount of fluid, e.g., a process using 1000 lb/year (500 kg/year), even more preferably 5 tons/year (5000 kg/yr), still more preferably 50 tons/year (50,000 kg/yr), and most preferably one million lbs/year (500,000 kg/yr). In a preferred embodiment, the process wherein the aforementioned fluid replacement occurs is on the scale of at least pilot plant-scale or greater. It is also preferred that the process in which a fluid or blend according to the present invention is used or in which at least one fluid according to the present invention replaces, at least partially, a fluid having a higher MIR, be a process in which the fluid is intended to evaporate, such as in a coating process. In such a process were the fluid is intended to evaporate, it is preferred that at least 10% of the fluid or fluids evaporate, more preferably 20% of the fluids, and so on, so that it is most preferable if >99% of the fluid or fluids present in the coating evaporate. Furthermore, one of the greatest environmental benefits of replacing a currently-used industrial solvent with a solvent according to the present invention will be realized if performed in a geographic area where monitoring for ozone and particulate matter formation occurs, and more particularly in geographic areas defined by a city and its contiguous area populated by at least 500,000 persons, and wherein the replacement of at least a portion of the currently-used industrial solvent with a fluid according to the present invention causes at least one of: (i) a reduction in the ozone formation, as measured by either monitoring devices or by a calculation of the reduction using the MIR of the industrial solvent replaced and the fluid added according to the present formation; or (ii) a reduction in particulate formation of particles having a diameter less than 2.5 &mgr;m (2.5 PM), preferably measured as a 24 hour standard, more preferably wherein that reduction is from greater than 65 &mgr;g/m3 to less than that amount in a 24 hour period, still more preferably from greater than 65 &mgr;g/m3 to less than or equal to 50 &mgr;g/m3 in a 24 hour period; and more preferably both (i) and (ii). In another embodiment, there is a method of selecting a fluid for use in a process wherein at least a portion of the fluid eventually evaporates into the atmosphere, comprising selecting as the fluid a blend of: (a) at least one fluid A having a low MIR, preferably similar to or less than or equal to 1.50, more preferably less than or equal to 1.00, yet still more preferably wherein the MIR is less than or equal to 0.50 and still even more preferably less than or equal to 0.35; and (b) at least one fluid B characterized by having at least one unsuitable attribute selected from: (i) high MIR, preferably measured by the MIR scale, e.g., having an MIR>0.50, more preferably >1.00, and yet even more preferably >1.50; (ii) low flash point, preferably less than or equal to 37.8deg C., more preferably less than or equal to 25deg C., even more preferably less than or equal to 15deg C., yet even more preferably less than or equal to 6.0deg C., and most preferably less than -6.1deg C.; (iii) formation of 2.5 PM particulates (e.g., wherein said process, using fluid B, produces 2.5 PM greater than 65 micrograms per cubic meter or greater, as measured in a 24-hour period); (iv) toxicity, preferably those having an oral rat LD50 less than or equal to 1,000 mg/kg, and most preferably less than or equal to 500 mg/kg; (vi) thermal stability, preferably having a thermal stability equal to or less than (more unstable) than t-butyl acetate; and (vii) inertness in the fluid or fluid blend, particularly with respect to any acids or bases present in the fluid or blend. Preferred examples of fluid A include: dialkyl carbonates, such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl ethyl carbonate, methyl isopropyl carbonate, methyl sec-butyl carbonate, methyl t-butyl carbonate, methyl neopentyl carbonate, and diisopropyl carbonate; alkyl acetates, such as neopentyl acetate, ethylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-butylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-butylene glycol diacetate, 2,3-butylene glycol diacetate, neopentyl glycol diacetate; dioxolanes such as 2,2-dimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4-trimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4,5-tetra methyl dioxolane; pivalates (trimethyl acetates) such as methyl pivalate (MP), isopropyl pivalate, t-butyl pivalate (TBP), neopentyl pivalate (NPP), 1,2-propylene glycol bis-pivalate (PGBP), ethylene glycol bis-pivalate, ethylene glycol monopivalate, 1,2-butylene glycol mono-pivalate (1,2-BGMP), 2,3-butylene glycol monopivalate (2,3-BGMP), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 2,3-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (2,3-BGPA), ethylene glycol pivalate acetate, 1,2 propylene glycol monopivalate, neopentyl glycol mono pivalate, and 1,2-propylene glycol pivalate acetate; isobutyrate compounds such as isopropyl isobutyrate, neopentyl isobutyrate, and neopentyl glycol mono isobutyrate; and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanonitrile (TMPN); isopropyl neononanoate; pivalonitrile; methyl 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanoate (methyl neononanoate); and methyl 3,5,5 trimethyl hexanoate. Preferred examples of fluid B include aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon fluids such as toluene and xylenes; alcohols such as ethanol, n-butyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, and sec-butanol; esters such as ethyl ethoxy propionate propylene glycol methyl ether acetate; ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), C5-C10 linear ketones, cyclic ketones; halocarbons, particularly chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons; cyclic ethers such as THF, and non-cyclic ethers such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The present invention also concerns mixtures or blends of at least one fluid according to the present invention and fluids which are known to have acceptable low OFP, e.g., acetone (MIR=0.48), methyl acetate (MIR=0.12), tert-butyl acetate (MIR=0.21), tertiary butanol (MIR=0.40), dimethyl succinate (MIR=0.20), dimethyl glutarate (MIR=0.40), and propylene carbonate (MIR=0.43). Such blends can have some important advantages, for example, blends of DMC and MEK, or DMC and methyl acetate, as previously mentioned. These blends are also considered to be part of the present invention. In combination with fluids having an MIR higher than 0.50, the fluids still can provide significant reduction in ozone formation for blended fluid compositions with other important properties for the particular application. Therefore, fluid compositions with low or reduced OFP comprising solvents selected from the list above are important goals of the present invention, even if their weighted OFP is above 0.50 in the MIR scale. The fluids listed above are recommended to be used in solvent compositions intended for release into air and are required to provide low reactivity in ozone formation. The solvents selected according to the present invention can be used in blends with each other as well as in blends with other solvents (e.g., solvents B, above), different from the solvents of the present invention. When all solvents included in the blend have MIR reactivity~0.50 or less, the solvent blends also will have low atmospheric photochemical reactivity with MIR of about 0.50 and less. The present inventors have found that many solvent blends can have an MIR in the range of ethane or acetone, even though one component may exceed that range, and therefore in terms of reactivity toward ozone formation behave as exempt solvents. The range of reactivities in exempt solvents allows a selection of fluids with extremely low reactivity, with MIR number in range of &lE;0.35 and more suitably &lE;0.24. These fluids can be blended not only with fluids with reactivity based on MIR of ~0.50 or less but, with appropriately selected fluids with MIR numbers >0.50 and at certain ratios still form fluid compositions with weighted reactivity about 0.50 or less. These blends can significantly expand the range of properties of solvent compositions and provide formulators with necessary flexibility for different applications. The selection of fluids with MIRs >0.50 can be relatively wide, however, to achieve significant reduction in weighted reactivity to ~0.50 or less, it is recommended to choose solvent with MIR <1.5, suitably <1.2, and more suitably <1.0. The conception of blends demonstrating MIR of about 0.50 or less can be applied to other solvents with known extremely low reactivities. For example, methyl acetate has an MIR 0.12 but flash point ~-12deg C. Thus, methyl acetate can be blended with butyl acetate (MIR=1.00 and flash point 27deg C.) in weight ratio of 57:43 forming a blend with MIR=0.50, providing reactivity similar to exempt solvents. This blend would have a better flash point and lower evaporation rate, making it useful for many applications which methyl acetate could not satisfy due to very low flash point. Butyl acetate which is not an exempt solvent, would become part of a mixture which by its weighted reactivity would behave similar to exempt solvent and, therefore, constitute preferred solvent composition. This special case of blends comprising at least one solvent with MIR reactivity 0.50 which have their weighted reactivity about 0.50 or less is one very important part of the present invention. Among known solvents with extremely low MIR, suitable components for the preferred blended solvents are methyl acetate (MIR=0.12), t-butyl acetate (MIR=0.21), dimethyl succinate (MIR=0.20) and methyl siloxanes including cyclomethylsiloxanes. Blends of these solvents with other solvents with MIR >0.50 resulting in weighted MIR of about 0.50 or less for the blend are preferred solvents according to the present invention. However, some of the most interesting blends are the blends of at least one solvent with MIR reactivity 0.50, which can be generated with the solvents from the list of the present invention. The present invention offers fluids and fluid blends for use in a variety of industrial applications such as paints and other coatings, adhesives, sealants, agricultural chemicals, cleaning solution, consumer products such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, drilling muds, extraction, reaction diluents, inks, metalworking fluids, etc. Among the most preferred fluids according to the present invention are dimethyl carbonate and methyl pivalate. Table 1 demonstrates the extremely low relative reactivities--significantly lower than both acetone and ethane--of dimethyl carbonate and methyl pivalate. This data shows that these two compounds satisfy the EPA requirements for exempt solvents in accordance with current VOC regulations and demonstrating extremely low reactivity for the possible future reactivity based rules. Additionally, DMC is shown to be one of the lowest reactivity compounds among all currently known oxygenated compounds. TABLE 1 Summary of calculated incremental reactivites (gram basis) for ethane, acetone, dimethyl carbonate, and methyl pivalate, relative to the average of all VOC emissions. Ozone Yield Relative Reactivities Max. 8 Hour Avg.

As seen from Table 2, Absolute Ozone Formation for different levels of NOx in ROG is highest for highest level of NOx scenario (MIR) and lowest for lowest level of NOx scenario (EBIR). As a result, Absolute Reactivity in atmospheric photochemical ozone formation for tested compounds is highest for MIR scenario and lowest for EBIR scenario. This data demonstrates the outstanding value as Low Polluting Potential Fluids (LPPF), Very Low Polluting Potential Fluid (VLPPF), and Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid (NPPF). Additionally Table 2b shows both compounds as having acceptable flash points, boiling temperatures, evaporation rates, low toxicity, good solvency and overall outstanding performance as versatile environmentally preferred exempt, extremely low ozone formation fluids (solvents) for a very wide range of applications.

DMC blended with another organic solvent would also exhibit other desirable environmental properties because DMC has a relatively high flash point and low toxicity. Again, heretofore unrecognized as a low OFP fluid, the Relative MIR of DMC is calculated to be 0.02, using the SAPRC97 model. The compounds presented in Tables 3-5 show calculated Absolute MIR reactivities for compounds useful as Low Polluting Potential Fluids (LPPF), Very Low Polluting Potential Fluids (VLPPF), and Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluids (NPPF) or as part of a fluid solvent blend.

The most preferred use of the fluids according to the present invention is with any process wherein the reduction of ozone formation is desired, and more particularly in consumer products, and coatings such as auto refinishing, architectural and industrial coatings and paints. Paints and coatings comprise the largest single category of traditional solvent consumption, accounting for nearly half the solvents used. Fluids serve multiple functions in paints and coatings, including solubility, wetting, viscosity reduction, adhesion promotion, and gloss enhancement. Fluids dissolve the resins, dyes and pigments used in the coating formulations. Also, prior to application, it is common practice to add solvent thinner to attain the desired viscosity for the particular application. Solvents begin to evaporate as soon as the coating materials are applied. As the solvent evaporates, film formation occurs and a continuous, compact film develops. Single solvents are sometimes used in coatings formulations, but most formulations are blends of several solvents. In many coatings applications, the solvent system includes a slow-evaporating active solvent that remains in the film for an extended period to enhance the film's gloss and smoothness. Because of evaporation and the large amounts of solvents used in coatings, there is a significant amount of VOC emissions into the atmosphere. Resins which may be incorporated into compositions comprising fluids according to the present invention include acrylic, alkyd, polyester, epoxy, silicone, cellulosic and derivatives thereof (e.g., nitrocellulosic and cellulosic esters), PVC, and isocyanate-based resins. Numerous pigments may also be incorporated into compositions according to the present invention, and it is within the skill of the ordinary artisan to determine proper selection of the resin and pigment, depending on the end use of the coating. One of the cleaning applications is cold solvent cleaning which is used to degrease metal parts and other objects in many operations. Mineral spirits have been popular in cold cleaning, but are being supplanted by higher flash point hydrocarbon solvents due to emissions and flammability concerns. Efforts to eliminate organic solvents entirely from cleaning compositions have not been successful because aqueous cleaners do not have the performance properties that make organic solvent based cleaners so desirable. This invention allows formulators the option to seek the use of solvents with very low reactivity as environmentally preferred products meeting environmental concerns and customer performance concerns. A cleaning solution application which uses evaporation to clean is called vapor degreasing. In vapor degreasing, the solvents vaporize and the cold part is suspended in the vapor stream. The solvent condenses on the part, and the liquid dissolves and flushes dirt, grease, and other contaminants off the surface. The part remains in the vapor until it is heated to the vapor temperature. Drying is almost immediate when the part is removed and solvent residues are not a problem. The most common solvent used in vapor degreasing operations has been 1,1,1-trichloroethane. However, since 1,1,1-trichloroethane is being phased out due to ozone depletion in the stratosphere, alternatives are needed. Moreover, chlorine-based solvents have toxicity concerns. Thus, some of the low reactivity, high flash point solvents in this invention can be used in place of 1,1,1-trichloroethane and other halogenated solvents. An application that is similar to coatings is printing inks. In printing inks, the resin is dissolved in the solvent to produce the ink. Most printing operations use fast evaporating solvents for best production speeds, but the currently used solvents are highly reactive. Some of the previously described fast evaporation, high flash point, low reactivity in ozone formation fluids according to the present invention are suitable for printing inks. An application that is suitable to the low toxicity, high flash point and low reactivity in ozone formation fluids according to the present invention is agricultural products. Pesticides are frequently applied as emulsifiable concentrates. The active insecticide or herbicide is dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent which also contains an emulsifier. Hydrocarbon solvent selection is critical for this application. It can seriously impact the efficiency of the formulation. The solvent should have adequate solvency for the pesticide, promote good dispersion when diluted with water, have low toxicity and a flash point high enough to minimize flammability hazards. Extraction processes, used for separating one substance from another, are commonly employed in the pharmaceutical and food processing industries. Oilseed extraction is a widely used extraction process. Extraction-grade hexane is a common solvent used to extract oil from soybeans, cottonseed, corn, peanuts, and other oil seeds to produce edible oils and meal used for animal feed supplements. Low toxicity, high flash point, low MIR fluids and fluid blends of the present invention can be useful in such industries. In addition to the above-mentioned applications, other applications that can use high flash point, low toxicity, low reactivity in ozone formation fluids are adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, drilling muds, reaction diluents, metal working fluids, and consumer products, such as pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. The invention is further described in the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting. One of skill in the art will recognize that numerous variations are possible within the scope of the appendaged claims. Examples of Fluid Blends Having Negligible Reactivity Tables A and B below demonstrate fluid solvent blends may be created using (a) negligibly low reactivity fluid solvents and (b) low to very low reactivity fluid solvent in ratios which provide Weight Average MIR reactivity for the total solvent blend of <0.45 and therefore providing ozone formation similar to individual fluid solvents with negligibly low reactivity in atmospheric ozone formation. However, the blends shown in Tables A and B possess characteristics such as better evaporation profiles, flash points, as compared to the individual fluids. Table A demonstrates negligibly reactive blends based on a known negligibly reactive solvent--methyl acetate and other very low reactivity fluids previously known and from the present invention. In Table A the column with methyl acetate shows the minimum methyl acetate content that will provide negligible reactivity to the blend. As shown, all blends with increased methyl acetate content will result in reduced reactivity in ozone formation. However, a main interest in blends with reduced methyl acetate content that maintain negligible reactivity is in an increased flash point of the blend. As seen from Table A, especially advantageous are the two blends with the very low reactivity fluid solvents from the present invention, diisopropyl carbonate and ethyl pivalate which require the lowest levels of methyl acetate. This concept of blending the negligible reactivity compounds with low and very low reactivity secondary fluids that can provide Weight Average MIR less than 0.5 is also subject of this invention. Although it is not necessary that every component of the blend be selected from the list of compounds of the present invention, it should be noted that components selected from the list of the present invention provide especially desireable attributes to a finished solvent blend with reduced or negligible reactivity in atmospheric photochemical ozone formation. Advantages of the blends created with at least one compound of the present invention is further demonstrated in Table B which utilizes blends"
8260465,Data communication in a multi-wire irrigation control system,2009-07-17,1,0,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation devices, and more particularly to the communication of data using an alternating power signal to be supplied to irrigation devices. 2. Discussion of the Related Art Typical irrigation control systems cooperate with water valves and pumps to control the flow of irrigation water through a variety of water dispensing devices, including sprinklers, rotors, drip-lines, and other water delivery devices. These control systems are used in a wide variety of irrigation applications, from residential and commercial landscapes to golf course and agricultural irrigation. Many irrigation systems and electronics are powered by 50/60 Hz AC voltage signals. Some systems further modulate this power source to provide data communication, for example, by selectively clipping the positive half of the AC voltage signal. Data and power sent in this manner are often over a two-wire transmission line and are often referred to as a two-wire interface. Irrigation devices variously located in the field couple to the two-wire interface and derive their operational power therefrom. The irrigation devices demodulate the data monitoring the received power signal for a missing negative half of a cycle, then taking eight voltage samples at a predetermined time thereafter during the positive half to detect whether the signal is clipped or unclipped. Such systems are well known in the art and described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,395 to Evelyn-Veere. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for providing power and data to an irrigation device. The method includes modulating data onto an alternating power signal by distorting an amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, permitting effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and applying the alternating power signal to a multi-wire interface configured to couple with a plurality of irrigation devices. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system. The method includes receiving an alternating power signal comprising cycles each having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and demodulating data represented by the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device having a modulator configured to modulate data onto an alternating power signal by distorting amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, and permit effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal. The irrigation controller further includes an interface configured to couple the modulator to a multi-wire interface coupled to a plurality of irrigation devices to permit the alternating power signal to be applied to the multi-wire interface. In still yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation device having an input configured to receive an alternating power signal comprising cycles having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and a demodulator configured to provide data by demodulating the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In a further embodiment, the invention may be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system, the method comprising: receiving, at an irrigation device, an alternating power signal comprising cycles, where an amplitude of a portion of each cycle is selectively distorted to modulate data on the alternating power signal; determining a slope of the portion of each cycle; and demodulating the data based upon the determining the slope"
5566500,Surfaces coated with fluorocarbon resins upon which insects cannot climb or alight and methods and means for their establishment,1994-11-08,0,1,"2. Field of the Invention This invention relates coated surfaces upon which insects can neither climb nor alight and methods and means for applying the coatings. More particularly, the invention relates to surfaces coated with non-toxic, non-debilitating fluorocarbon resin films which are effective to discourage crawling insects from infesting a site where they are not wanted, to cause crawling insects to abandon a site they have infested, to confine crawling insects within a given enclosure and to prevent insects from alighting, climbing or building nests or webs on selected surfaces. 3. Discussion of the Prior Art The crawling insects with which this invention is concerned are those which are pests or nuisances to man. These include, for example, gypsy moths that crawl from the ground up into trees and devour the leaves of the trees; cockroaches, spiders, scales and palm aphids which are often offensive in appearance and may carry and spread disease; and, perhaps the most widespread and annoying of the general group, the ubiquitous ant. The ant exists in many forms including the leaf eater, Argentine, carpenter and pharaoh ants, the termites and, of course, the militant and destructive fire ant. It is the primary concern of this invention to restrict the movement and colonization of these insects. Many pesticides and insecticides are available which will kill or disrupt the life cycle of crawling insects, but essentially all of them are environmentally objectionable because of their toxicity. The toxicity of pesticides can endanger the health of animals and humans and curtail their use when food is present as in dinning rooms, kitchens, picnic tables, pet food dishes and the like. It is also well recognized that insects develop strains which are resistent to the effect of a given insecticide over a period of time. As an alternative to insecticides, it has been proposed to control insects with traps. One common type of trap is built with downwardly and inwardly sloping side walls that are covered with a loosely adhering powdered material, such as talcum powder. The loosely adhering particles are dislodged when an insect attempts to crawl over them and the insect falls with the powder into a trap. This technique is relied on in U.S. Pat. No 4,263,740 which teaches the application of particulate organic and inorganic materials to a vertical or sloping surface. The particulate materials are applied by coating a surface with a liquid dispersion of polytetrafluoroethylene, sand, clay, ground pyrophyllite-aluminum silicate, cellulosics, talc, sand, and flour. When the liquid content of the dispersion is evaporated, a dry, loosely adherent layer of powder remains on the surface. The size of the particles is not critical since patentee teaches that the particulate material of the dispersions may vary from less than 1 micron to more that 1000 microns in diameter, although his preferred range is from 100 to 300 microns. In use, patentee relates, when an insect first crawls over a coated surface at the entrance to a trap, its sticky pads (pulvilli) are coated with the loosely adhered powders and the ability of the pulvilli to adhere to a smooth surface is rendered ineffective. If and when the insect reverses its direction in an attempt to crawl up a smooth slanting sidewall and escape from the trap, its pulvilli are no longer sticky and the insect must grip the particulate material with its tarsal claws to gain a purchase. At this point, the weight of the insect grasping the particulate matter dislodges the powder and causes an avalanche of the loosely held particles carrying the insect down with them into the trap. The powdery coatings taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,740 have a limited useful life. They are consumed in use when one or more avalanche occurs and they will break loose and flake away if the coated surface is impacted as by bumping or shaking or is exposed to the elements such as wind and rain. A less obvious defect in the powdery coatings is that loose powder can suffocate the insects and destroy their value to a hobbyist or an entomologist. Entomologists have discovered that they can nondestructively confine crawling insects in tub shaped containers by painting circumferential, horizontal bands of a water dispersion of finely divided polytetrafluoroethylene, generally about 0.05 to 0.5 microns in diameter, on the inside walls of the container. Perhaps because of their extremely small size, the particles making up the dried coating, unlike the coatings of U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,740, adhere sufficiently well to the side walls of the container to prevent them from being pulled loose when traversed by an insect. It was discovered that the insects could not climb these dried films of sub micron resin polytetrafluoroethylene particles. Since the insects appear to slide down the coated surfaces when they try to climb them, it seemed reasonable to assume, even though it has now been proven false, that the phenomenum was due to the slippery surface characteristics (low coefficient of friction) of polytetrafluoroethylene. The dispersions that the entomologists have used are commercial formulations that typically contain about 60%, by total weight, of 0.05 to 0.5 micron sized polytetrafluoroethylene particles suspended in water along with from about 5% to 8%, by weight of polytetrafluoroethylene, of a wetting agent and stabilizer. At room temperatures (20.degree.-25.degree. C.) the dispersions have viscosities of from about 20 to 27 centipoise. An example of the method used by entomologists, can be found in a trap for flying insects disclosed in European patent application 0 160 712 A1 to Montedison S.p.A. Here flying insects are prevented from crawling out of a trap having a funnel shaped (30.degree.-60.degree. cone angle) entrance by coating the interior surface of the funnel with dispersions of polytetrafluoroethylene. The dispersions are the same as those described above as used by entomologists which are commercially available formulations of aqueous dispersions of polytetrafluoroethylene. They are described in the patent application as being comprised of a granulometric dispersion of between 0.2 and 0.4 microns of 50-61% by weight polytetrafluoroethylene and 2.5-4% by weight of a non-ionic dispersant, the rest being water. It is further taught that the coatings of these dispersions can be applied by spraying or brushing. The European patent application acknowledges that the prior art has made use of sticky substances to entrap insects and powdered substances, such as kaolin or talc, to reduce an insects ability to cling to a surface. The patent application states that the powdered substances of the prior art are not useful over prolonged periods since the powders are easily removed by the mechanical action of wind, rain and humidity. The coatings of the entomologists and those disclosed in the European patent application improved over the prior powdered coatings, but they too have their deficiencies both with respect to the methods by which they are applied and to the characteristics of the applied coatings. Considering the coatings themselves the following is a listing of some of their failings. 1. While the coatings adhere to their substrates somewhat better than do the powdered coatings, the polytetrafluoroethylene coatings are so loosely bound to their substrates that they can be removed by running tap water over the surface, by lightly brushing the surface, by flexing the substrate or by applying and removing ordinary transparent adhesive tape. 2. The coatings are effective only for relatively short periods of time. In discussions with entomologists who use these coatings, it has been uniformly reported that the effective life of the coatings range from as short as several weeks to a maximum of about two, or, at most, three months. The mechanisms of the failures are not understood as often there is no apparent or observable change in the appearance of the coating. 3. The effectiveness of the coating is adversely effected if more than a single layer is applied to a surface. Care is required to avoid overcoating when the dispersion is applied for, otherwise, multiple coating layers will crack or flake off rendering the coating ineffective to prevent insects from crawling on a surface. It follows that it is necessary to remove all of an old coating which has lost its effectiveness before a new coating is applied. The difficulty of thoroughly removing all of an old coating is enough of a chore to make it common practice among entomologists to discard used insect containers after they have lost their effectiveness rather than to clean and recoat the old containers. 4. The effectiveness of the coatings are temperature sensitive. When exposed to ambient temperatures over about 30.degree.-35.degree. C., insects begin climbing over surfaces that they could not climb at lower ambient temperatures. 5. Depending on the dispersing agent used in making up the polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions, most coatings loose their effectiveness when they become damp or wet. This limits the utility of the coatings to protected environments where they can be sheltered from the effects of rain, snow, dew and other surface moisture. 6. The relatively poor adhesion of the coatings makes it impractical to clean the coated surfaces. For example, if a coating is applied to a dog dish, the coating will not survive even one dish washer cycle. The method of application of coatings from polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions as taught by the prior art, also raises a number of problems. 1. The effectiveness of the coating is influenced by the thickness of the coating. It has now been discovered that better coatings are obtained if the thickness of the dried coating is preferably 1 mil or less. This desired thickness has not been obtained in the prior art for a number of reasons including the viscosity of the available polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions, the means by which the coatings are applied as by brushing or dipping, and the dependency of the thickness on the angle the substrate makes to the horizontal as it dries. In this latter regard it may be understood that if a freshly coated surface is allowed to dry while in a vertical position, the dispersion will flow by gravity down the plate, run-off will be maximized and the coating thickness will be minimized. If, on the other hand, the surface is oriented horizontally, the run-off will be minimized and the thickness of the coating maximized. 2. The viscosity of commercially available polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions increases rapidly at higher temperatures. As a result, the coating thickness is a function of the ambient temperatures at the time the coating is applied. 3. Polytetrafluoroethylene resins are soft and subject to fibrillation when exposed to shear forces. The effect is so pronounced that fibrillation occurs when polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions are forced through an orifice as in spraying. For this reason the dispersions are difficult to handle and, for practical reasons, cannot be sprayed unto a substrate. They can not be pumped through feed lines and care must be taken to avoid fibrillation if the dispersions are shaken, stirred or pumped. 4. The high viscosity (about 20 centipoise and over) of the polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions of the prior art make it difficult to form a smooth. coating because of the relatively high viscosity and poor flow-out. 5. The polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions of the prior art are unstable and coagulate during prolonged storage. Temperatures above 25.degree. C. accelerate the coagulation of the dispersions and temperatures below the freezing point of the liquids destroy the dispersion. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to apply surface coatings to substrates which coatings prevent crawling insects from climbing on the surfaces and discourage crawling insects from infesting defined certain areas. Another object of this invention is to protect areas from infestation from crawling insects without using insecticides or toxic substances that are harmful to the environment. Another object of this invention is selectively to control the type or size of crawling insects which enter or leave an area. Another object of this invention is to prevent flying or hopping insects from alighting on or clinging to surfaces such as walls or ceilings. Another object of this invention is to provide a device for trapping insects. Another object of this invention is to create an environment which is not hospitable to crawling insects and will cause them to leave and establish their nests elsewhere. Another object of this invention is to provide wearing apparel such as shoes and boots, ankle protectors, outer garments and the like which will prevent crawling insects from climbing onto the human body. Another object of this invention is to prevent insects from crawling up the legs of furniture. Another object of this invention is to provide methods and means for controlling the movement of crawling insects which methods are simple and effective, remain effective over prolonged periods of time, withstand moderate abuse, and remain effective at elevated temperatures and when wet. Another object of this invention is the provision of methods and means to control the movement of crawling insects that retain their effectiveness for long periods of time even when used in outdoor environments and exposed to all weather conditions. Another object of this invention is to provide coatings of polytetrafluoroethylene which can withstand washing under running tap water or in a dishwasher. Another object of this invention is to provide dispersions of a polytetrafluoroethylene resins having a particle size between about 0.05 and 0.5 microns which have improved storage life, less sensitivity to higher temperatures, mixing and forces of shear and reduced tendencies to fibrillation. These and other objects of this invention are achieved by coating a surface with an aqueous dispersion of polytetrafluoroethylene particles, preferably less than 0.5 microns in size as measured along their major axis, and drying the dispersion to form a coherent film free from bubbles and other visible surface imperfections, characterized in that the viscosity of the dispersion is less than 16 centipoise. Insects cannot climb on the surfaces in accordance with the foregoing if the surfaces are at an angle to the horizontal. The minimum angle required to impede the progress of an insect over a surface coated in accordance with this invention will vary with the characteristics of the insect such as its size, whether it has any sticky substances on its legs, whether its tarsi have claws, and in the case of crawling pests such as caterpillars, how many legs it has. Nonetheless, as a generality, it may reasonably be estimated that surfaces treated in accordance with this invention should be skewed at least about 20 degrees to a horizontal axis to be effective. In the case of flying insects such as flies, gnats, or mosquitoes, and hopping insects, such as fleas, surfaces treated in accordance with this invention will prevent these pests from alighting or resting on steeply slanting surfaces, such as walls or ceilings. It has been observed that the surface characteristics of the film forming materials of this invention may change when the film becomes wet with water when a surface which has been prepared in accordance with this invention is exposed to the outdoor elements like snow, rain or high humidity, it may re-wet and lose its effectiveness in preventing insects from crawling on its surface. It is believed that the tendency of the film to re-wet is largely a function of the surfactant. Used in preparing the dispersion and it has been established that the problem can be overcome either by utilizing a surfactant that does not re-wet, or by removing the surfactant after the film has been formed. In this latter instance, it noted that some surfactants are naturally destroyed by exposure to an outdoor environment and UV light and other surfactants can be leached from a film by washing the film with a solvent which, depending upon the surfactant, may include water, alcohols, acids, bases and the like. However, when surfactants are removed by leaching, it is a sine qua non that the coatings must adhere to the substrate well enough to prevent the coatings from being washed away during the leaching process. In the preferred practice of this invention, aqueous dispersions are stabilized from the harmful effects of freeze/thaw cycles to permit their transportation and storage during colder times of the year. Suitable stabilizers for use in the dispersions of this invention include monohydric alcohols of less than five carbon atoms that form clathrates with water, polyhydric compounds, and the amine analogs of the alcohols and polyhydric compounds. These stabilizers are disclosed PCT patent application filed Apr. 30, 1992 serial number PCT/US92/03630 in the name of Thomas H. Eberlein and PCT patent application filed Apr. 30, 1992 serial number PCT/US92/03647 in the names of Thomas H. Eberlein and Allan H. Olsen both entitled Aqueous Dispersions Stabilized from Freeze/Thaw Cycles which are incorporated herein by reference. The solids which are used to form the dispersions of this invention average less than 0.5 microns when measured along their major axis. The small size of the particles is responsible for making a surface difficult for an insect to climb and it is suspected the small particle size contributes to the formation of a more adherent film. Here and elsewhere in the specification and claims, the dried residue that remains after a dispersion of the invention has been applied to a surface is referred to as a film since it appears to the naked eye to be continuous and since it is known that it will be effective to control the movement of insects only if it is free from discontinuities and other anomalies that will enable an insect to grip the surface of a film, On the other hand, the film has little or no tear strength and, unless applied to an adhesive substance as is discussed below, the dried coating cannot be peeled away from a surface without destroying the film. For this reason, and since a better term does not suggest itself, it should be understood that the term film as used herein may not be entirely consistent with some definitions of the term. The fluorocarbon resins that are of utility in the practice of the present invention are fluorocarbon polymers prepared by dispersion polymerizations and include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP) and perfluoroalkoxy (PFA). The dispersion grades of these resins are commercially available in particle sizes ranging from about 0.05 to about 0.5 microns, at solids concentrations of about 60 wt % dispersing agents, balance water, and in viscosities of from about 20 to about 27 centipoise. Since polytetrafluoroethylene resins are the most widely available, known and used of the fluorocarbon resins, the specification and claims refer specifically to this member of the group although it is to be understood that the term polytetrafluoroethylene as used in the specification and appended claims is meant to include other dispersion grade fluorocarbon resins."

In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may exist as one or more stereoisomers. Thus, certain molecules can be produced as racemic mixtures. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that one stereoisomer may be more active than the other stereoisomers. Individual stereoisomers may be obtained by known selective synthetic procedures, by conventional synthetic procedures using resolved starting materials, or by conventional resolution procedures. Certain molecules disclosed in this document can exist as two or more isomers. The various isomers include geometric isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers. Thus, the molecules disclosed in this document include geometric isomers, racemic mixtures, individual stereoisomers, and optically active mixtures. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that one isomer may be more active than the others. The structures disclosed in the present disclosure are drawn in only one geometric form for clarity, but are intended to represent all geometric forms of the molecule.

Biopesticides The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may also be used in combination (such as in a compositional mixture, or a simultaneous or sequential application) with one or more biopesticides. The term “biopesticide” is used for microbial biological pest control agents that are applied in a similar manner to chemical pesticides. Commonly these are bacterial, but there are also examples of fungal control agents, including Trichoderma spp. and Ampelomyces quisqualis (a control agent for grape powdery mildew). Bacillus subtilis are used to control plant pathogens. Weeds and rodents have also been controlled with microbial agents. One well-known insecticide example is Bacillus thuringiensis , a bacterial disease of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera , and Diptera . Because it has little effect on other organisms, it is considered more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides. Biological insecticides include products based on: 1. entomopathogenic fungi (e.g. Metarhizium anisopliae ); 2. entomopathogenic nematodes (e.g. Steinernema feltiae ); and 3. entomopathogenic viruses (e.g. Cydia pomonella granulovirus). Other examples of entomopathogenic organisms include, but are not limited to, baculoviruses, bacteria and other prokaryotic organisms, fungi, protozoa and Microsproridia. Biologically derived insecticides include, but not limited to, rotenone, veratridine, as well as microbial toxins; insect tolerant or resistant plant varieties; and organisms modified by recombinant DNA technology to either produce insecticides or to convey an insect resistant property to the genetically modified organism. In one embodiment, the molecules of Formula One may be used with one or more biopesticides in the area of seed treatments and soil amendments.

Formulations A pesticide is rarely suitable for application in its pure form. It is usually necessary to add other substances so that the pesticide can be used at the required concentration and in an appropriate form, permitting ease of application, handling, transportation, storage, and maximum pesticide activity. Thus, pesticides are formulated into, for example, baits, concentrated emulsions, dusts, emulsifiable concentrates, fumigants, gels, granules, microencapsulations, seed treatments, suspension concentrates, suspoemulsions, tablets, water soluble liquids, water dispersible granules or dry flowables, wettable powders, and ultra low volume solutions. For further information on formulation types see “Catalogue of Pesticide Formulation Types and International Coding System” Technical Monograph no. 2, 5th Edition by CropLife International (2002). Pesticides are applied most often as aqueous suspensions or emulsions prepared from concentrated formulations of such pesticides. Such water-soluble, water-suspendable, or emulsifiable formulations are either solids, usually known as wettable powders, or water dispersible granules, or liquids usually known as emulsifiable concentrates, or aqueous suspensions. Wettable powders, which may be compacted to form water dispersible granules, comprise an intimate mixture of the pesticide, a carrier, and surfactants. The concentration of the pesticide is usually from about 10% to about 90% by weight. The carrier is usually selected from among the attapulgite clays, the montmorillonite clays, the diatomaceous earths, or the purified silicates. Effective surfactants, comprising from about 0.5% to about 10% of the wettable powder, are found among sulfonated lignins, condensed naphthalenesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkyl sulfates, and non-ionic surfactants such as ethylene oxide adducts of alkyl phenols. Emulsifiable concentrates of pesticides comprise a convenient concentration of a pesticide, such as from about 50 to about 500 grams per liter of liquid dissolved in a carrier that is either a water miscible solvent or a mixture of water-immiscible organic solvent and emulsifiers. Useful organic solvents include aromatics, especially xylenes and petroleum fractions, especially the high-boiling naphthalenic and olefinic portions of petroleum such as heavy aromatic naphtha. Other organic solvents may also be used, such as the terpenic solvents including rosin derivatives, aliphatic ketones such as cyclohexanone, and complex alcohols such as 2-ethoxyethanol. Suitable emulsifiers for emulsifiable concentrates are selected from conventional anionic and non-ionic surfactants. Aqueous suspensions comprise suspensions of water-insoluble pesticides dispersed in an aqueous carrier at a concentration in the range from about 5% to about 50% by weight. Suspensions are prepared by finely grinding the pesticide and vigorously mixing it into a carrier comprised of water and surfactants. Ingredients, such as inorganic salts and synthetic or natural gums may also be added, to increase the density and viscosity of the aqueous carrier. It is often most effective to grind and mix the pesticide at the same time by preparing the aqueous mixture and homogenizing it in an implement such as a sand mill, ball mill, or piston-type homogenizer. Pesticides may also be applied as granular compositions that are particularly useful for applications to the soil. Granular compositions usually contain from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the pesticide, dispersed in a carrier that comprises clay or a similar substance. Such compositions are usually prepared by dissolving the pesticide in a suitable solvent and applying it to a granular carrier which has been pre-formed to the appropriate particle size, in the range of from about 0.5 to about 3 mm. Such compositions may also be formulated by making a dough or paste of the carrier and compound and crushing and drying to obtain the desired granular particle size. Dusts containing a pesticide are prepared by intimately mixing the pesticide in powdered form with a suitable dusty agricultural carrier, such as kaolin clay, ground volcanic rock, and the like. Dusts can suitably contain from about 1% to about 10% of the pesticide. They can be applied as a seed dressing or as a foliage application with a dust blower machine. It is equally practical to apply a pesticide in the form of a solution in an appropriate organic solvent, usually petroleum oil, such as the spray oils, which are widely used in agricultural chemistry. Pesticides can also be applied in the form of an aerosol composition. In such compositions the pesticide is dissolved or dispersed in a carrier, which is a pressure-generating propellant mixture. The aerosol composition is packaged in a container from which the mixture is dispensed through an atomizing valve. Pesticide baits are formed when the pesticide is mixed with food or an attractant or both. When the pests eat the bait they also consume the pesticide. Baits may take the form of granules, gels, flowable powders, liquids, or solids. They can be used in pest harborages. Fumigants are pesticides that have a relatively high vapor pressure and hence can exist as a gas in sufficient concentrations to kill pests in soil or enclosed spaces. The toxicity of the fumigant is proportional to its concentration and the exposure time. They are characterized by a good capacity for diffusion and act by penetrating the pest's respiratory system or being absorbed through the pest's cuticle. Fumigants are applied to control stored product pests under gas proof sheets, in gas sealed rooms or buildings or in special chambers. Pesticides can be microencapsulated by suspending the pesticide particles or droplets in plastic polymers of various types. By altering the chemistry of the polymer or by changing factors in the processing, microcapsules can be formed of various sizes, solubility, wall thicknesses, and degrees of penetrability. These factors govern the speed with which the active ingredient within is released, which in turn, affects the residual performance, speed of action, and odor of the product. Oil solution concentrates are made by dissolving pesticide in a solvent that will hold the pesticide in solution. Oil solutions of a pesticide usually provide faster knockdown and kill of pests than other formulations due to the solvents themselves having pesticidal action and the dissolution of the waxy covering of the integument increasing the speed of uptake of the pesticide. Other advantages of oil solutions include better storage stability, better penetration of crevices, and better adhesion to greasy surfaces. Another embodiment is an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the emulsion comprises oily globules which are each provided with a lamellar liquid crystal coating and are dispersed in an aqueous phase, wherein each oily globule comprises at least one compound which is agriculturally active, and is individually coated with a monolamellar or oligolamellar layer comprising: (1) at least one non-ionic lipophilic surface-active agent, (2) at least one non-ionic hydrophilic surface-active agent and (3) at least one ionic surface-active agent, wherein the globules having a mean particle diameter of less than 800 nanometers. Further information on the embodiment is disclosed in U.S. patent publication 20070027034 published Feb. 1, 2007, having patent application Ser. No. 11/495,228. For ease of use, this embodiment will be referred to as “OIWE.” For further information consult “Insect Pest Management” 2nd Edition by D. Dent, copyright CAB International (2000).

Other Formulation Components Generally, when the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III are used in a formulation, such formulation can also contain other components. These components include, but are not limited to, (this is a non-exhaustive and non-mutually exclusive list) wetters, spreaders, stickers, penetrants, buffers, sequestering agents, drift reduction agents, compatibility agents, anti-foam agents, cleaning agents, and emulsifiers. A few components are described forthwith. A wetting agent is a substance that when added to a liquid increases the spreading or penetration power of the liquid by reducing the interfacial tension between the liquid and the surface on which it is spreading. Wetting agents are used for two main functions in agrochemical formulations: during processing and manufacture to increase the rate of wetting of powders in water to make concentrates for soluble liquids or suspension concentrates; and during mixing of a product with water in a spray tank to reduce the wetting time of wettable powders and to improve the penetration of water into water-dispersible granules. Examples of wetting agents used in wettable powder, suspension concentrate, and water-dispersible granule formulations are: sodium lauryl sulfate; sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate; alkyl phenol ethoxylates; and aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates. A dispersing agent is a substance which adsorbs onto the surface of particles and helps to preserve the state of dispersion of the particles and prevents them from reaggregating. Dispersing agents are added to agrochemical formulations to facilitate dispersion and suspension during manufacture, and to ensure the particles redisperse into water in a spray tank. They are widely used in wettable powders, suspension concentrates and water-dispersible granules. Surfactants that are used as dispersing agents have the ability to adsorb strongly onto a particle surface and provide a charged or steric barrier to reaggregation of particles. The most commonly used surfactants are anionic, non-ionic, or mixtures of the two types. For wettable powder formulations, the most common dispersing agents are sodium lignosulfonates. For suspension concentrates, very good adsorption and stabilization are obtained using polyelectrolytes, such as sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates. Tristyrylphenol ethoxylate phosphate esters are also used. Non-ionics such as alkylarylethylene oxide condensates and EO-PO block copolymers are sometimes combined with anionics as dispersing agents for suspension concentrates. In recent years, new types of very high molecular weight polymeric surfactants have been developed as dispersing agents. These have very long hydrophobic “backbones” and a large number of ethylene oxide chains forming the “teeth” of a “comb” surfactant. These high molecular weight polymers can give very good long-term stability to suspension concentrates because the hydrophobic backbones have many anchoring points onto the particle surfaces. Examples of dispersing agents used in agrochemical formulations are: sodium lignosulfonates; sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates; tristyrylphenol ethoxylate phosphate esters; aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates; alkyl ethoxylates; EO-PO block copolymers; and graft copolymers. An emulsifying agent is a substance which stabilizes a suspension of droplets of one liquid phase in another liquid phase. Without the emulsifying agent the two liquids would separate into two immiscible liquid phases. The most commonly used emulsifier blends contain alkylphenol or aliphatic alcohol with twelve or more ethylene oxide units and the oil-soluble calcium salt of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid. A range of hydrophile-lipophile balance (“HLB”) values from 8 to 18 will normally provide good stable emulsions. Emulsion stability can sometimes be improved by the addition of a small amount of an EO-PO block copolymer surfactant. A solubilizing agent is a surfactant which will form micelles in water at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration. The micelles are then able to dissolve or solubilize water-insoluble materials inside the hydrophobic part of the micelle. The types of surfactants usually used for solubilization are non-ionics, sorbitan monooleates, sorbitan monooleate ethoxylates, and methyl oleate esters. Surfactants are sometimes used, either alone or with other additives such as mineral or vegetable oils as adjuvants to spray-tank mixes to improve the biological performance of the pesticide on the target. The types of surfactants used for bioenhancement depend generally on the nature and mode of action of the pesticide. However, they are often non-ionics such as: alkyl ethoxylates; linear aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates; aliphatic amine ethoxylates. A carrier or diluent in an agricultural formulation is a material added to the pesticide to give a product of the required strength. Carriers are usually materials with high absorptive capacities, while diluents are usually materials with low absorptive capacities. Carriers and diluents are used in the formulation of dusts, wettable powders, granules and water-dispersible granules. Organic solvents are used mainly in the formulation of emulsifiable concentrates, oil-in-water emulsions, suspoemulsions, and ultra low volume formulations, and to a lesser extent, granular formulations. Sometimes mixtures of solvents are used. The first main groups of solvents are aliphatic paraffinic oils such as kerosene or refined paraffins. The second main group (and the most common) comprises the aromatic solvents such as xylene and higher molecular weight fractions of C9 and C10 aromatic solvents. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are useful as cosolvents to prevent crystallization of pesticides when the formulation is emulsified into water. Alcohols are sometimes used as cosolvents to increase solvent power. Other solvents may include vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters of vegetable and seed oils. Thickeners or gelling agents are used mainly in the formulation of suspension concentrates, emulsions and suspoemulsions to modify the rheology or flow properties of the liquid and to prevent separation and settling of the dispersed particles or droplets. Thickening, gelling, and anti-settling agents generally fall into two categories, namely water-insoluble particulates and water-soluble polymers. It is possible to produce suspension concentrate formulations using clays and silicas. Examples of these types of materials, include, but are not limited to, montmorillonite, bentonite, magnesium aluminum silicate, and attapulgite. Water-soluble polysaccharides have been used as thickening-gelling agents for many years. The types of polysaccharides most commonly used are natural extracts of seeds and seaweeds or are synthetic derivatives of cellulose. Examples of these types of materials include, but are not limited to, guar gum; locust bean gum; carrageenam; alginates; methyl cellulose; sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC); hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). Other types of anti-settling agents are based on modified starches, polyacrylates, polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene oxide. Another good anti-settling agent is xanthan gum. Microorganisms can cause spoilage of formulated products. Therefore preservation agents are used to eliminate or reduce their effect. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to: propionic acid and its sodium salt; sorbic acid and its sodium or potassium salts; benzoic acid and its sodium salt; p-hydroxybenzoic acid sodium salt; methyl p-hydroxybenzoate; and 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT). The presence of surfactants often causes water-based formulations to foam during mixing operations in production and in application through a spray tank. In order to reduce the tendency to foam, anti-foam agents are often added either during the production stage or before filling into bottles. Generally, there are two types of anti-foam agents, namely silicones and non-silicones. Silicones are usually aqueous emulsions of dimethyl polysiloxane, while the non-silicone anti-foam agents are water-insoluble oils, such as octanol and nonanol, or silica. In both cases, the function of the anti-foam agent is to displace the surfactant from the air-water interface. “Green” agents (e.g., adjuvants, surfactants, solvents) can reduce the overall environmental footprint of crop protection formulations. Green agents are biodegradable and generally derived from natural and/or sustainable sources, e.g. plant and animal sources. Specific examples are: vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters thereof, also alkoxylated alkyl polyglucosides.

Pesticidal Activities The disclosed pesticidal compositions may be used, for example, as nematicides, acaricides, pesticides, insecticides, miticides, and/or molluscicides. In one particular embodiment, a method of controlling pests comprises applying a pesticidal composition comprising a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III near a population of pests. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III are generally used in amounts from about 0.01 grams per hectare to about 5000 grams per hectare to provide control. Amounts from about 0.1 grams per hectare to about 500 grams per hectare are generally preferred, and amounts from about 1 gram per hectare to about 50 grams per hectare are generally more preferred. The area to which a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III is applied can be any area inhabited (or maybe inhabited, or traversed by) a pest, for example: where crops, trees, fruits, cereals, fodder species, vines, turf and ornamental plants, are growing; where domesticated animals are residing; the interior or exterior surfaces of buildings (such as places where grains are stored), the materials of construction used in building (such as impregnated wood), and the soil around buildings. Particular crop areas to use a molecule of Formula One include areas where apples, corn, sunflowers, cotton, soybeans, canola, wheat, rice, sorghum, barley, oats, potatoes, oranges, alfalfa, lettuce, strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, crucifers, pears, tobacco, almonds, sugar beets, beans and other valuable crops are growing or the seeds thereof are going to be planted. It is also advantageous to use ammonium sulfate with a 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound when growing various plants. Controlling pests generally means that pest populations, pest activity, or both, are reduced in an area. This can come about when: pest populations are repulsed from an area; when pests are incapacitated in or around an area; or pests are exterminated, in whole, or in part, in or around an area. Of course, a combination of these results can occur. Generally, pest populations, activity, or both are desirably reduced more than fifty percent, preferably more than 90 percent. Generally, the area is not in or on a human; consequently, the locus is generally a non-human area. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used in mixtures, applied simultaneously or sequentially, alone or with other compounds to enhance plant vigor (e.g. to grow a better root system, to better withstand stressful growing conditions). Such other compounds are, for example, compounds that modulate plant ethylene receptors, most notably 1-methylcyclopropene (also known as 1-MCP). Furthermore, such molecules may be used during times when pest activity is low, such as before the plants that are growing begin to produce valuable agricultural commodities. Such times include the early planting season when pest pressure is usually low. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be applied to the foliar and fruiting portions of plants to control pests. The molecules will either come in direct contact with the pest, or the pest will consume the pesticide when eating leaf, fruit mass, or extracting sap, that contains the pesticide. The 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound can also be applied to the soil, and when applied in this manner, root and stem feeding pests can be controlled. The roots can absorb a molecule taking it up into the foliar portions of the plant to control above ground chewing and sap feeding pests. Generally, with baits, the baits are placed in the ground where, for example, termites can come into contact with, and/or be attracted to, the bait. Baits can also be applied to a surface of a building, (horizontal, vertical, or slant surface) where, for example, ants, termites, cockroaches, and flies, can come into contact with, and/or be attracted to, the bait. Baits can comprise a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be encapsulated inside, or placed on the surface of a capsule. The size of the capsules can range from nanometer size (about 100-900 nanometers in diameter) to micrometer size (about 10-900 microns in diameter). Because of the unique ability of the eggs of some pests to resist certain pesticides, repeated applications of the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be desirable to control newly emerged larvae. Systemic movement of pesticides in plants may be utilized to control pests on one portion of the plant by applying (for example by spraying an area) the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III to a different portion of the plant. For example, control of foliar-feeding insects can be achieved by drip irrigation or furrow application, by treating the soil with for example pre- or post-planting soil drench, or by treating the seeds of a plant before planting. Seed treatment can be applied to all types of seeds, including those from which plants genetically modified to express specialized traits will germinate. Representative examples include those expressing proteins toxic to invertebrate pests, such as Bacillus thuringiensis or other insecticidal toxins, those expressing herbicide resistance, such as “Roundup Ready” seed, or those with “stacked” foreign genes expressing insecticidal toxins, herbicide resistance, nutrition-enhancement, drought resistance, or any other beneficial traits. Furthermore, such seed treatments with the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may further enhance the ability of a plant to better withstand stressful growing conditions. This results in a healthier, more vigorous plant, which can lead to higher yields at harvest time. Generally, about 1 gram of the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III to about 500 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide good benefits, amounts from about 10 grams to about 100 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide better benefits, and amounts from about 25 grams to about 75 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide even better benefits. It should be readily apparent that the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used on, in, or around plants genetically modified to express specialized traits, such as Bacillus thuringiensis or other insecticidal toxins, or those expressing herbicide resistance, or those with “stacked” foreign genes expressing insecticidal toxins, herbicide resistance, nutrition-enhancement, or any other beneficial traits. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used for controlling endoparasites and ectoparasites in the veterinary medicine sector or in the field of non-human animal keeping. The 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound are applied, such as by oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, granules, by dermal application in the form of, for example, dipping, spraying, pouring on, spotting on, and dusting, and by parenteral administration in the form of, for example, an injection. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be employed advantageously in livestock keeping, for example, cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, and geese. They may also be employed advantageously in pets such as, horses, dogs, and cats. Particular pests to control would be fleas and ticks that are bothersome to such animals. Suitable formulations are administered orally to the animals with the drinking water or feed. The dosages and formulations that are suitable depend on the species. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used for controlling parasitic worms, especially of the intestine, in the animals listed above. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be employed in therapeutic methods for human health care. Such methods include, but are limited to, oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, granules, and by dermal application. Pests around the world have been migrating to new environments (for such pest) and thereafter becoming a new invasive species in such new environment. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used on such new invasive species to control them in such new environment. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used in an area where plants, such as crops, are growing (e.g. pre-planting, planting, pre-harvesting) and where there are low levels (even no actual presence) of pests that can commercially damage such plants. The use of such molecules in such area is to benefit the plants being grown in the area. Such benefits, may include, but are not limited to, improving the health of a plant, improving the yield of a plant (e.g. increased biomass and/or increased content of valuable ingredients), improving the vigor of a plant (e.g. improved plant growth and/or greener leaves), improving the quality of a plant (e.g. improved content or composition of certain ingredients), and improving the tolerance to abiotic and/or biotic stress of the plant. Before a pesticide can be used or sold commercially, such pesticide undergoes lengthy evaluation processes by various governmental authorities (local, regional, state, national, and international). Voluminous data requirements are specified by regulatory authorities and must be addressed through data generation and submission by the product registrant or by a third party on the product registrant's behalf, often using a computer with a connection to the World Wide Web. These governmental authorities then review such data and if a determination of safety is concluded, provide the potential user or seller with product registration approval. Thereafter, in that locality where the product registration is granted and supported, such user or seller may use or sell such pesticide.
