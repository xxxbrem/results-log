**Columns and Potential Usage:**

1. **player.player_id**: Used to uniquely identify each player; will be used to join with other tables.
2. **player.player_name**: To retrieve the name of each player.
3. **player.batting_hand**: To get the batting style (e.g., right-hand, left-hand) of the player.
4. **player.bowling_skill**: To get the bowling skill (e.g., fast, spin) of the player.
5. **player_match.player_id**: Used to associate players with the matches they've played.
6. **player_match.role**: To determine the role (e.g., batsman, bowler, all-rounder) of the player in each match.
7. **batsman_scored.match_id**, **over_id**, **ball_id**, **innings_no**: To link with **ball_by_ball** table for detailed analysis of runs scored per delivery.
8. **batsman_scored.runs_scored**: To calculate total runs scored by each player.
9. **ball_by_ball.match_id**, **over_id**, **ball_id**, **innings_no**: To join with other tables and get detailed delivery information.
10. **ball_by_ball.striker**: To identify the batsman on strike for each delivery.
11. **ball_by_ball.bowler**: To identify the bowler for each delivery.
12. **wicket_taken.match_id**, **over_id**, **ball_id**, **innings_no**: To link with **ball_by_ball** and identify dismissals.
13. **wicket_taken.player_out**: To count the total dismissals of each player.
14. **wicket_taken.kind_out**: To understand the nature of each dismissal.
15. **Conditions**:
    - Joining tables on **match_id**, **over_id**, **ball_id**, and **innings_no** to align delivery-level data.
    - Grouping by **player_id** or **striker** to aggregate statistics per player.
    - Filtering runs to find matches where players scored over certain thresholds (e.g., 30, 50, 100 runs).

Task: For each player, list their ID, name, most frequent role across all matches, batting hand, bowling skill, total runs scored, total matches played, total dismissals, batting average, highest score in a single match, number of matches where their score exceeded 30, 50, and 100, total balls faced in their career, strike rate, total wickets taken, economy rate, and their best performance in a single match (most wickets taken, in the format "wickets taken-runs given"). Ignore the extra runs data.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv

In this table, each row represents a player with their statistical performance across all matches. The columns include identifiers, personal attributes, batting and bowling statistics, and career highlights, formatted according to the specified data types..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 05:40:20 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each player, list their ID, name, most frequent role across all matches, batting hand, bowling skill, total runs scored, total matches played, total dismissals, batting average, highest score in a single match, number of matches where their score exceeded 30, 50, and 100, total balls faced in their career, strike rate, total wickets taken, economy rate, and their best performance in a single match (most wickets taken, in the format "wickets taken-runs given"). Ignore the extra runs data., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

In this table, each row represents a player with their statistical performance across all matches. The columns include identifiers, personal attributes, batting and bowling statistics, and career highlights, formatted according to the specified data types. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:40:56 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each player, list their ID, name, most frequent role across all matches, batting hand, bowling skill, total runs scored, total matches played, total dismissals, batting average, highest score in a single match, number of matches where their score exceeded 30, 50, and 100, total balls faced in their career, strike rate, total wickets taken, economy rate, and their best performance in a single match (most wickets taken, in the format "wickets taken-runs given"). Ignore the extra runs data., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

In this table, each row represents a player with their statistical performance across all matches. The columns include identifiers, personal attributes, batting and bowling statistics, and career highlights, formatted according to the specified data types. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
