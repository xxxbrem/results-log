The SQL script in `2result.sql` is the correct one for the following reasons:

**1. Correct Handling of Duplicate User-Question Pairs:**

- The task requires calculating the total view count per user, considering questions associated with users based on multiple criteria (owning a question, providing an accepted answer, etc.).
- It is crucial to avoid double-counting the same question for a user who meets multiple criteria for the same question.
- In `2result.sql`, when combining user-question pairs from different criteria, it uses `UNION DISTINCT`, which ensures that each user-question pair is unique and eliminates duplicates across all criteria. This approach prevents overcounting view counts for questions associated with users through multiple criteria.

**2. Accurate Aggregation of View Counts:**

- By ensuring that each `(user_id, question_id)` pair is unique, the SQL script accurately aggregates the view counts without inflating the totals due to duplicates.
- The final aggregation sums the `view_count` for each user only once per question, aligning with the task's requirement.

**3. Logic Alignment with Task Requirements:**

- The script systematically builds separate Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for each criterion, identifying the user-question associations per the specified conditions.
- It carefully combines these CTEs using `UNION DISTINCT`, which aligns with the logical need to consider each relevant association once per user-question pair.
- This method respects the task's emphasis on including questions based on the specified criteria without duplication.

**4. Comparison with Other Scripts:**

- **`0result.sql` and `1result.sql`**:
  - Both scripts use `UNION ALL` to combine user-question pairs from different criteria.
  - They attempt to remove duplicates later by selecting distinct pairs, but there is a risk of residual duplicates due to the way duplicates are handled within and across the CTEs.
  - Minor differences in total view counts in their results suggest potential overcounting.
- **`2result.sql`**:
  - By using `UNION DISTINCT` upfront, it eliminates duplicates effectively at the point of combining the user-question pairs.
  - The resulting total view counts are slightly lower than the other scripts, indicating a more accurate count without inflation from duplicates.

**5. Consistency in Results:**

- The `2result.sql` script produces consistent and slightly lower total view counts compared to the other scripts, which is expected when correctly handling duplicates.
- This consistency suggests that it accurately reflects the genuine association between users and questions per the criteria without double-counting.

**Conclusion:**

The `2result.sql` script correctly implements the required logic, accurately handles duplicates, and provides the precise total view counts per user as per the task's specifications. It ensures that each question's view count is counted only once per user, even if the user meets multiple criteria for the same question.
