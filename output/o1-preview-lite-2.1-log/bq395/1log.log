This revised query addresses the issue of missing data and potential division by zero:

- **Use of `IFNULL`**: Replaced `Unsheltered_Homeless_Individuals` with `IFNULL(Unsheltered_Homeless_Individuals, 0)` to treat `NULL` values as zero during summation.

- **Changed `INNER JOIN` to `FULL OUTER JOIN`**: Ensures all states are included, even if data for one of the years is missing.

- **Added a `WHERE` Clause**: Included `t2015.Total_Unsheltered_2015 > 0` to avoid division by zero errors when calculating the percentage change.

This should yield results without empty datasets and correctly calculate the percentage changes.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_hud_pit_homelessness.hud_pit_by_coc`

  - **CoC_Number**: Identifies the Continuum of Care (CoC) regions. The first two characters correspond to the state abbreviation. *Potential usage:* To determine the state associated with each CoC.

  - **CoC_Name**: Name of the CoC region.

  - **Unsheltered_Homeless_Individuals**: Number of unsheltered homeless individuals in a given CoC and year. *Potential usage:* To calculate totals and changes over years.

  - **Count_Year**: The year when the count was recorded. *Potential usage:* To filter data for the years 2015 and 2018.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Filter by years:** `Count_Year = 2015` or `Count_Year = 2018` to select data from the specific years.

- **Extract state abbreviation:** `SUBSTR(CoC_Number, 1, 2)` to get the state abbreviation from the CoC_Number.

- **Handle division by zero:** Use `SAFE_DIVIDE` to avoid errors when calculating percentage changes if the 2015 value is zero.

Task: Which 5 states' percentage change in unsheltered homeless individuals from 2015 to 2018 were top 5 closest to the national average? Please provide the state abbreviation.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
State_Abbreviation
state1:str
state2:str
state3:str
state4:str
state5:str
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

**Explanation:**

To identify the 5 states whose percentage change in unsheltered homeless individuals from 2015 to 2018 were closest to the national average, the following steps were undertaken:

1. **Data Extraction**: Retrieved data on unsheltered homeless individuals for each state for the years 2015 and 2018 from the `hud_pit_by_coc` table in the `sdoh_hud_pit_homelessness` schema.

2. **State Grouping**: Mapped each Continuum of Care (CoC) to its corresponding state using the first two letters of the `CoC_Number`, which represent the state abbreviation.

3. **Calculating State Totals**: Summed the `Unsheltered_Homeless_Individuals` counts for all CoCs within each state for both 2015 and 2018.

4. **Percentage Change Calculation**: For each state, calculated the percentage change using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Count}_{2018} - \text{Count}_{2015}}{\text{Count}_{2015}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   - Handled cases where the 2015 count was zero to avoid division by zero errors.

5. **National Average Computation**: Calculated the national average percentage change by summing the counts of all states and applying the same formula.

6. **Difference Assessment**: Determined the absolute difference between each state's percentage change and the national average.

7. **Selection of States**: Ranked the states based on the smallest absolute differences and selected the top 5 closest to the national average.

**Note**: Since the specific data is not provided, placeholder state abbreviations are used in the answer..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 10:48:55 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which 5 states' percentage change in unsheltered homeless individuals from 2015 to 2018 were top 5 closest to the national average? Please provide the state abbreviation., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
State_Abbreviation
state1:str
state2:str
state3:str
state4:str
state5:str
(Attention: answer in 5 rows)
```

**Explanation:**

To identify the 5 states whose percentage change in unsheltered homeless individuals from 2015 to 2018 were closest to the national average, the following steps were undertaken:

1. **Data Extraction**: Retrieved data on unsheltered homeless individuals for each state for the years 2015 and 2018 from the `hud_pit_by_coc` table in the `sdoh_hud_pit_homelessness` schema.

2. **State Grouping**: Mapped each Continuum of Care (CoC) to its corresponding state using the first two letters of the `CoC_Number`, which represent the state abbreviation.

3. **Calculating State Totals**: Summed the `Unsheltered_Homeless_Individuals` counts for all CoCs within each state for both 2015 and 2018.

4. **Percentage Change Calculation**: For each state, calculated the percentage change using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Count}_{2018} - \text{Count}_{2015}}{\text{Count}_{2015}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   - Handled cases where the 2015 count was zero to avoid division by zero errors.

5. **National Average Computation**: Calculated the national average percentage change by summing the counts of all states and applying the same formula.

6. **Difference Assessment**: Determined the absolute difference between each state's percentage change and the national average.

7. **Selection of States**: Ranked the states based on the smallest absolute differences and selected the top 5 closest to the national average.

**Note**: Since the specific data is not provided, placeholder state abbreviations are used in the answer. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
