Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Columns and potential usage:**

- `payment.payment_id`: Unique identifier for each payment transaction.
- `payment.customer_id`: Links each payment to a specific customer.
- `payment.amount`: The amount paid in each transaction; used to calculate total payments.
- `payment.payment_date`: Date and time of payment; used to extract month and year for monthly grouping.
- `customer.customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer; used to join with payments.
- `customer.first_name` and `customer.last_name`: Customer's name; used for identification and display.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Limit to the top 10 customers based on total payment amounts.
- Group payments by customer and by month to calculate monthly totals.
- Calculate the differences between monthly payment totals for each customer.
- Extract month and year from `payment_date` for grouping.
- Order results to identify the highest payment differences.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all customers and their IDs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", "first_name", "last_name"
   FROM "customer"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve all payment transactions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "payment_id", "customer_id", "amount", "payment_date"
   FROM "payment"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Calculate total payment amount per customer:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_payments"
   FROM "payment"
   GROUP BY "customer_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Identify the top 10 paying customers:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_payments"
   FROM "payment"
   GROUP BY "customer_id"
   ORDER BY "total_payments" DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

5. **Extract month and year from payment dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "payment_id", "customer_id", "amount", STRFTIME('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "payment_month"
   FROM "payment"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate monthly total payments per customer:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", STRFTIME('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "payment_month", SUM("amount") AS "monthly_total"
   FROM "payment"
   GROUP BY "customer_id", "payment_month"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List all months in which each customer made payments:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "customer_id", STRFTIME('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "payment_month"
   FROM "payment"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Determine the maximum monthly payment per customer:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", MAX("monthly_total") AS "max_monthly_payment"
   FROM (
     SELECT "customer_id", STRFTIME('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "payment_month", SUM("amount") AS "monthly_total"
     FROM "payment"
     GROUP BY "customer_id", "payment_month"
   )
   GROUP BY "customer_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Determine the minimum monthly payment per customer:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", MIN("monthly_total") AS "min_monthly_payment"
   FROM (
     SELECT "customer_id", STRFTIME('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "payment_month", SUM("amount") AS "monthly_total"
     FROM "payment"
     GROUP BY "customer_id", "payment_month"
   )
   GROUP BY "customer_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate the payment difference per customer (max - min monthly payments):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "customer_id", MAX("monthly_total") - MIN("monthly_total") AS "payment_difference"
    FROM (
      SELECT "customer_id", STRFTIME('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "payment_month", SUM("amount") AS "monthly_total"
      FROM "payment"
      GROUP BY "customer_id", "payment_month"
    )
    GROUP BY "customer_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Identify the customer with the highest payment difference among the top 10 paying customers:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "customer_id", MAX("monthly_total") - MIN("monthly_total") AS "payment_difference"
    FROM (
      SELECT "customer_id", STRFTIME('%Y-%m', "payment_date") AS "payment_month", SUM("amount") AS "monthly_total"
      FROM "payment"
      WHERE "customer_id" IN (
        SELECT "customer_id"
        FROM "payment"
        GROUP BY "customer_id"
        ORDER BY SUM("amount") DESC
        LIMIT 10
      )
      GROUP BY "customer_id", "payment_month"
    )
    GROUP BY "customer_id"
    ORDER BY "payment_difference" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Retrieve the names of the top 10 paying customers:**
    ```sql
    SELECT c."customer_id", c."first_name", c."last_name", p."total_payments"
    FROM "customer" c
    JOIN (
      SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_payments"
      FROM "payment"
      GROUP BY "customer_id"
      ORDER BY "total_payments" DESC
      LIMIT 10
    ) p ON c."customer_id" = p."customer_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively build upon each other to explore the data necessary to solve the task. They start from listing basic customer and payment information, then move on to aggregate payments per customer and per month, and finally calculate the payment differences needed to determine the customer with the highest monthly payment difference among the top 10 paying customers.Query:
SELECT "customer_id", "first_name", "last_name"
   FROM "customer"
   LIMIT 100;
Answer:
customer_id,first_name,last_name

Task: Can you determine which of our top 10 paying customers had the highest payment difference in any given month? I’d like to know the highest payment difference for this customer, with the result rounded to two decimal places.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
customer_id,customer_name,highest_payment_difference
customer_id:int,customer_name:str,highest_payment_difference:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

Among the top 10 paying customers, we identified the customer who had the highest difference in payments between any two months. This customer is represented by `customer_id` and `customer_name`. The `highest_payment_difference` is the maximum difference in total payments made by this customer between any two months, rounded to two decimal places..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

I’d like to know the highest payment difference for this customer, with the result rounded to two decimal places., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
customer_id,customer_name,highest_payment_difference
customer_id:int,customer_name:str,highest_payment_difference:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

The `highest_payment_difference` is the maximum difference in total payments made by this customer between any two months, rounded to two decimal places. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
