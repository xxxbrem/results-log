After comparing both SQL queries, **`0result.sql`** is the correct and preferred solution.

**Reason:**

- **Efficiency:** The query in `0result.sql` filters the `payment` table to include only the top 10 paying customers **before** calculating the monthly totals. This reduces the amount of data processed in subsequent steps, making the query more efficient.
  
- **Data Processing:** In contrast, `2result.sql` calculates monthly totals for **all** customers and then filters for the top 10 customers. This approach processes unnecessary data for customers who are not in the top 10, leading to inefficient use of resources.

- **Result Consistency:** Both queries produce the same correct result, identifying customer **ELEANOR HUNT (customer_id 148)** with the highest payment difference of **95.79**.

**Conclusion:**

Since `0result.sql` achieves the desired outcome more efficiently by reducing data early in the query, it is the better choice.
