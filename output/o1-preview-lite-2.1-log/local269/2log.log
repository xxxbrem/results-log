      - *Potential usage*: Identifies each packaging item.
    - `name`: Name of the packaging item.
      - *Potential usage*: Provides a human-readable name for packaging items.

- **Table:** `packaging_relations`
  - **Columns:**
    - `packaging_id`: ID of the packaging item that contains other items.
      - *Potential usage*: Identifies parent packaging items.
    - `contains_id`: ID of the item or packaging contained within the parent packaging.
      - *Potential usage*: Identifies child items or packaging.
    - `qty`: Quantity of the contained item within the parent packaging.
      - *Potential usage*: Specifies how many units of the contained item are included.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Identifying Final Packaging Combinations:**
  - Packaging items that are not contained within any other packaging items.
  - Condition: `packaging.id NOT IN (SELECT contains_id FROM packaging_relations)`

- **Calculating Total Quantities:**
  - Summing quantities of all items contained within each packaging, including nested items.
  - Requires aggregating quantities across all levels of containment.

These queries help in understanding the structure of the packaging hierarchy, the relationships between packaging items, and the quantities involved. By analyzing the results of these queries, we can gain insights into how packaging items are nested and how quantities accumulate across different levels.

**Note:** While recursive queries (CTEs) are typically used to calculate totals across all levels of nesting, the above queries provide a starting point for understanding the data. Calculating the exact average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering all nested items, would require recursive processing or multiple query iterations.Query:

Task: What is the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering all items contained within each combination?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering all items contained within each combination, we need to calculate the total quantity of items in each final packaging (including all nested items) and then compute the average of these totals.

```csv
average_total_quantity
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 04:00:50 - root - INFO - To determine the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering all items contained within each combination, we can use a recursive common table expression (CTE) to calculate the total quantity of items for each final packaging, including all nested levels. Then, we compute the average of these total quantities.
