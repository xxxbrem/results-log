Begin Exploring Related Columns
Column names and their potential usage:

- **orderlines.order_id**: To select the order lines for order 423.
- **orderlines.product_id**: To identify the products required for order 423.
- **orderlines.qty**: Quantity needed for each product in order 423.
- **inventory.product_id**: To match inventory records with the products needed.
- **inventory.qty**: Quantity available at each inventory location.
- **inventory.location_id**: To get location details from the locations table.
- **inventory.purchase_id**: To retrieve purchase dates from the purchases table for prioritization.
- **locations.id**: To join with `inventory.location_id`.
- **locations.warehouse**: To filter inventory in warehouse 1.
- **locations.aisle**: Required for output; indicates the aisle where the product is located.
- **locations.position**: Required for output; specifies the position within the aisle.
- **purchases.id**: To join with `inventory.purchase_id`.
- **purchases.purchased**: Purchase date used to prioritize earlier dates.

Conditions that may be used:

- `orderlines.order_id = 423`: To select the specific order.
- `inventory.product_id = orderlines.product_id`: To match inventory with needed products.
- `locations.warehouse = 1`: To ensure inventory is from warehouse 1.
- Prioritize by earlier `purchases.purchased` dates and smaller `inventory.qty`.
- Ensure that picked quantities do not exceed available inventory.

Task: Which product ID, aisle, and position should be selected to pick the highest quantity for order 423, ensuring the picked quantity does not exceed the available inventory in warehouse 1, and calculate the quantity to be picked while prioritizing locations with earlier dates and smaller quantities?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
product_id,aisle,position,quantity_to_pick
product_id:int,aisle:str,position:int,quantity:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```
To fulfill order 423, we have selected the product ID, aisle, and position that allow us to pick the highest possible quantity without exceeding the available inventory in warehouse 1. We prioritized locations with earlier purchase dates and smaller quantities to ensure efficient stock rotation and optimal inventory management..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
