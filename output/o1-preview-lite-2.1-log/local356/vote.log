After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct query.

**Reasoning:**

- **Comprehensive Results:** The second query (`2result.sql`) returns a broader set of drivers who have been overtaken more times than they have performed overtakes, aligning better with the task. It includes drivers like Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell, Niki Lauda, and others, not just the two drivers from the first query.
  
- **Accurate Logic Implementation:**
  - Both queries aim to calculate the number of times each driver has been overtaken (`times_lost`) and the number of times they have overtaken others (`times_gained`).
  - The second query correctly compares these counts and selects drivers where `times_lost > times_gained`.
  - The first query (`1result.sql`) might be too restrictive or possibly contains an error in data aggregation, as it only returns two drivers.

- **Data Validation:** The results from `2result.sql` seem more plausible given the nature of racing data and the number of drivers who could meet the criteria over multiple races and seasons.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

2result.sql
