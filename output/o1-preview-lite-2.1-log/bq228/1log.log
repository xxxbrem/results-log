2025-01-23 09:22:12 - root - INFO - Apologies for the error. There was a mismatch in quotation marks in the SQL queries where a backtick (\`) was used instead of a closing single quote (') at the end of the string literals. Here are the corrected SQL queries:

---

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

1. **Select all data for Barking and Dagenham:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   WHERE borough = 'Barking and Dagenham'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve distinct major crime categories in Barking and Dagenham:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT major_category
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   WHERE borough = 'Barking and Dagenham'

   ```

3. **List incidents by major category in Barking and Dagenham:**

   SELECT major_category, COUNT(*) AS number_of_incidents
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   WHERE borough = 'Barking and Dagenham'
   GROUP BY major_category
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Calculate the total number of incidents in Barking and Dagenham:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_incidents
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   WHERE borough = 'Barking and Dagenham';
   ```

5. **Sum incidents per major category in Barking and Dagenham:**
   ```sql
   SELECT major_category, COUNT(*) AS total_incidents
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   WHERE borough = 'Barking and Dagenham'
   GROUP BY major_category
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve incidents for the year 2015 in Barking and Dagenham:**
   ```sql
   SELECT major_category, year, month
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   WHERE borough = 'Barking and Dagenham' AND year = 2015
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List distinct years available in the dataset:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT year
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Total incidents per year in Barking and Dagenham:**
   ```sql
   SELECT year, COUNT(*) AS total_incidents
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`

   ```sql
   SELECT major_category, COUNT(*) AS number_of_incidents
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
   WHERE borough = 'Barking and Dagenham'
   GROUP BY major_category
   ORDER BY number_of_incidents DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

10. **Monthly incidents per major category for the latest year in Barking and Dagenham:**
    ```sql
    SELECT major_category, month, COUNT(*) AS total_incidents
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
    WHERE borough = 'Barking and Dagenham' AND year = 2016
    GROUP BY major_category, month
    ORDER BY major_category, month
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Explanation:**

- In each corrected query, I've ensured that:
  - String literals like `'Barking and Dagenham'` are properly enclosed with single quotes `'...'`.
  - Backticks `` `...` `` are used only to enclose table and column names, as per BigQuery syntax.
  - Any mismatched or misplaced quotation marks have been fixed to prevent syntax errors.

This should resolve the syntax error you encountered and allow the queries to run successfully.

Task: Please provide a list of the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Major_Category,Number_of_Incidents
category1:str,num1:int
category2:str,num2:int
category3:str,num3:int
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

The table above lists the top three major crime categories in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, along with the number of incidents in each category..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'london_crime': ['crime_by_lsoa'], 'london_fire_brigade': ['fire_brigade_service_calls']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
