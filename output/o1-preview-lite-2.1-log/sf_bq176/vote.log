1result.sql

I chose `1result.sql` as the correct SQL because it accurately computes the weighted average copy number in cytoband 15q11 by considering both the length of overlap between each segment and the cytoband, and the number of probes (`"num_probes"`) in each segment. This approach provides a more precise weighting of the `segment_mean` values, ensuring that segments with more probes and greater overlap contribute appropriately to the average. Additionally, it ensures that only cases from the TCGA-LAML study are included by explicitly filtering using the clinical data.
