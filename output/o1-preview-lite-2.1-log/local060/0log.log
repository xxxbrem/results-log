**Relevant Tables, Columns, and Potential Usage:**

- **sales**
  - `"prod_id"`: Identifies the product sold.
  - `"cust_id"`: Identifies the customer who made the purchase.
  - `"time_id"`: Links the sale to a specific date.
  - `"promo_id"`: Indicates if a promotion was applied; used to exclude sales with promotions.
  - `"quantity_sold"`: Quantity of the product sold; used to calculate total units sold.
  - `"amount_sold"`: Monetary amount of the sale; used to calculate total sales revenue.

- **products**
  - `"prod_id"`: Product identifier.
  - `"prod_name"`: Name of the product; used for reporting.

- **customers**
  - `"cust_id"`: Customer identifier.
  - `"country_id"`: Links the customer to a country.

- **countries**
  - `"country_id"`: Country identifier.
  - `"country_iso_code"`: Used to filter customers from the US (`'US'`).

- **times**
  - `"time_id"`: Date identifier.
  - `"calendar_year"`: Used to filter the years 2019 and 2020.
  - `"calendar_quarter_number"`: Used to filter for Q4 (quarter 4).

- **promotions**
  - `"promo_id"`: Promotion identifier; used to identify promotions applied.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Filter by Country (US):**
  - `countries.country_iso_code = 'US'`

- **Filter by Year and Quarter:**
  - For Q4 2019: `times.calendar_year = 2019 AND times.calendar_quarter_number = 4`
  - For Q4 2020: `times.calendar_year = 2020 AND times.calendar_quarter_number = 4`

- **Exclude Sales with Promotions:**
  - `sales.promo_id IS NULL` or `sales.promo_id = 0`

- **Calculate Total Sales per Product:**
  - Summing `sales.amount_sold` grouped by `sales.prod_id`

- **Select Top 20% Products by Sales:**
  - Ordering products by total sales and selecting the top 20%

Task: What is the change in each product’s share of total sales in the top 20% of products (by sales), between Q4 of 2019 and 2020, in the US? Include only products with no promotions in Q4 2019 or Q4 2020, and provide results in decreasing order of the change in sales share.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_ID,Product_Name,Q4_2019_Sales_Share,Q4_2020_Sales_Share,Change_in_Sales_Share
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,share2019:float,share2020:float,change_in_share:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,share2019:float,share2020:float,change_in_share:float
...
(Attention: results are provided in decreasing order of the change in sales share)
```

This table lists the products in the top 20% of products by sales (excluding products with any promotions in Q4 2019 or Q4 2020) in the US. It shows each product's share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, as well as the change in sales share between these periods. The results are sorted in decreasing order of the change in sales share. The `Change_in_Sales_Share` is calculated as `Q4_2020_Sales_Share` minus `Q4_2019_Sales_Share`..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
