**Answer:**

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

After carefully reviewing and comparing the three provided SQL scripts (`0result.sql`, `1result.sql`, and `2result.sql`) and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** best fulfills the task's requirements.

**Key Points:**

1. **Selection of Products with No Promotions:**
   - All three SQL scripts correctly identify products that had no promotions in both Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 in the United States by excluding any products that appeared with a promotion during these periods.

2. **Calculation of Total Sales and Sales Shares:**
   - Each script calculates the total sales for Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 for these products.
   - They then compute each product's share of the total sales for both years.

3. **Determination of Top 20% Products:**
   - The primary difference lies in how the top 20% of products are selected:
     - **`0result.sql`:** Selects the top 20% of products based on total sales in **Q4 2020 only**.
     - **`1result.sql`:** Selects the top 20% of products based on combined total sales from **both Q4 2019 and Q4 2020**.
     - **`2result.sql`:** Also selects the top 20% based on combined sales but calculates sales shares differently.

4. **Calculation of Sales Shares:**
   - In **`1result.sql`**, the sales shares are calculated based on the total sales of **all products with no promotions** in the respective quarters, providing a more accurate reflection of each product's market share among the non-promoted products.
   - **`2result.sql`** calculates the sales shares based on the total sales of only the **top 20% of products**, which inflates the sales share percentages and does not accurately represent the products' shares relative to the entire market segment of interest.

5. **Alignment with Task Requirements:**
   - The task requests the change in each product's share of total sales **in the top 20% of products by sales**, between Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, including only products with no promotions, and to provide results in decreasing order of the change in sales share.
   - **`1result.sql`** effectively fulfills this by:
     - Identifying the correct products (those with no promotions in both periods).
     - Calculating the sales shares based on total sales of all non-promoted products.
     - Selecting the top 20% of products based on combined sales over both years, which ensures that products consistently performing well are considered.
     - Ordering the results appropriately.

6. **Accuracy of Results:**
   - The results in **`1result.csv`** show reasonable sales share percentages that accurately reflect the products' performances relative to the total non-promoted sales.
   - The inclusion of an additional product (Product ID 127) provides a more comprehensive analysis.

**Conclusion:**

**`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script because it most accurately and completely addresses the task's requirements by properly selecting the top 20% of products based on combined sales, calculating sales shares relative to the total non-promoted sales, and presenting the results in the required order.
