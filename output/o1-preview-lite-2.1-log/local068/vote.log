I choose `1result.sql` as the correct SQL script. Both `1result.sql` and `2result.sql` produce the same correct output, meeting the requirements of calculating the number of new cities inserted each April, May, and June from 2021 to 2023, along with the year-over-year growth percentages.

However, `1result.sql` uses more precise casting of year and month values to integers, which ensures accurate numerical comparisons and calculations. It also organizes the data with clear CTE names like `monthly_totals`, `cumulative_totals`, and `prev_year_totals`, making the query easier to read and understand. The use of `PARTITION BY` in the window function for calculating running totals is explicit and aligns closely with the task's requirements.
