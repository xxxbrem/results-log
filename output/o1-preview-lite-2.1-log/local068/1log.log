This query calculates the number of new cities inserted each April, May, and June for the years 2022 and 2023, along with the year-over-year growth percentages for both the monthly totals and the running cumulative totals compared to 2021 (which is used as the baseline but not included in the final output).

**Explanation:**

- **monthly_totals**: Calculates the total cities added per month for April, May, and June from 2021 to 2023.
- **cumulative_totals**: Computes the running cumulative total of cities added for each year.
- **prev_year_totals**: Prepares the previous year's data to calculate the year-over-year growth by shifting the year by +1 to align with the current year's data.
- The main `SELECT` statement joins the current year data with the previous year's data on the month to calculate the growth percentages.
- **ROUND** functions are used to calculate the growth percentages to two decimal places, and `'%'` is appended as requested.
- The final output includes only data for 2022 and 2023, as specified.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table**: `"cities"`
  - **"insert_date"**: Used to determine when each city was added.
  - **"city_id"**: Unique identifier for each city; used to count new cities.
  - **"city_name"**: Name of the city; for reference or verification.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter records where `"insert_date"` falls in April, May, or June of the years 2021 to 2023.
- Extract the year and month from `"insert_date"` to group and aggregate data.
- Use `strftime` function to manipulate date strings.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **View distinct insert dates to understand the date format:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "insert_date" FROM "cities" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the total number of cities in the table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_cities FROM "cities";
   ```

3. **List the number of cities added each year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT strftime('%Y', "insert_date") AS year, COUNT(*) AS cities_added
   FROM "cities"
   GROUP BY year
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List the number of cities added each month:**

   ```sql
   SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', "insert_date") AS year_month, COUNT(*) AS cities_added
   FROM "cities"
   GROUP BY year_month
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get the number of cities added in each month from 2021 to 2023:**

   ```sql
   SELECT strftime('%Y', "insert_date") AS year, strftime('%m', "insert_date") AS month, COUNT(*) AS cities_added
   FROM "cities"
   WHERE strftime('%Y', "insert_date") BETWEEN '2021' AND '2023'
   GROUP BY year, month
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Filter cities added in April, May, June from 2021 to 2023:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "city_id", "city_name", "insert_date"
   FROM "cities"
   WHERE strftime('%Y', "insert_date") BETWEEN '2021' AND '2023'
     AND strftime('%m', "insert_date") IN ('04', '05', '06')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

    ) prev ON curr.month = prev.month AND curr.year = CAST(prev.year AS INTEGER) + 1
    ORDER BY curr.year, curr.month
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **List city names added in the specified months and years for verification:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "city_name", "insert_date"
    FROM "cities"
    WHERE strftime('%Y', "insert_date") BETWEEN '2021' AND '2023'
      AND strftime('%m', "insert_date") IN ('04', '05', '06')
    ORDER BY "insert_date"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Find total cities added up to each year for April to June:**

    ```sql
    SELECT strftime('%Y', "insert_date") AS year, COUNT(*) AS total_cities_added
    FROM "cities"
    WHERE strftime('%m', "insert_date") IN ('04', '05', '06')
      AND strftime('%Y', "insert_date") <= '2023'
    GROUP BY year
    ORDER BY year
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Check the earliest and latest insert dates in the dataset:**

    ```sql
    SELECT MIN("insert_date") AS earliest_date, MAX("insert_date") AS latest_date
    FROM "cities";
    ```

14. **List all cities added in June 2022:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "city_id", "city_name", "insert_date"
    FROM "cities"
    WHERE strftime('%Y', "insert_date") = '2022'
      AND strftime('%m', "insert_date") = '06'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Count total cities added each month across all years:**

    ```sql
    SELECT strftime('%m', "insert_date") AS month, COUNT(*) AS cities_added
    FROM "cities"
    GROUP BY month
    ORDER BY month
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries explore the relevant data needed to calculate the number of new cities inserted each April, May, and June from 2021 to 2023, along with the year-over-year growth percentages for each month and running totals. The queries incrementally build up from simple data retrieval to more complex aggregations and calculations required for the task.Query:

Task: Calculate the number of new cities inserted each April, May, and June, along with the year-over-year growth percentage for each month from 2021-2023. List the year, month, the total number of cities added, the running cumulative total, and the year-over-year growth percentage (including "%") for both the monthly total and the running total. Ensure that 2021 data is used only as a baseline for calculating growth rates, and exclude it from the final output.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Month,Total Cities Added,Running Cumulative Total,Year-over-Year Growth Percentage (Monthly),Year-over-Year Growth Percentage (Running Total)
2022,April,total_added:int,run_total:int,monthly_growth:0<=float<=100,running_growth:0<=float<=100
2022,May,total_added:int,run_total:int,monthly_growth:0<=float<=100,running_growth:0<=float<=100
2022,June,total_added:int,run_total:int,monthly_growth:0<=float<=100,running_growth:0<=float<=100
2023,April,total_added:int,run_total:int,monthly_growth:0<=float<=100,running_growth:0<=float<=100
2023,May,total_added:int,run_total:int,monthly_growth:0<=float<=100,running_growth:0<=float<=100
2023,June,total_added:int,run_total:int,monthly_growth:0<=float<=100,running_growth:0<=float<=100
```

This table displays the number of new cities added in April, May, and June for the years 2022 and 2023. It includes:

- **Year**: The year of the data (2022 or 2023).
- **Month**: The month when the cities were added (April, May, June).
- **Total Cities Added**: The number of cities added in that month (`int` data type).
- **Running Cumulative Total**: The cumulative total number of cities added up to that month (`int` data type).
- **Year-over-Year Growth Percentage (Monthly)**: The percentage growth of the monthly total compared to the same month in the previous year (a float between 0 and 100).
- **Year-over-Year Growth Percentage (Running Total)**: The percentage growth of the running cumulative total compared to the same month in the previous year (a float between 0 and 100).

Note: The percentages are calculated using 2021 data as the baseline but 2021 data is not included in the output as per the instructions..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 08:21:36 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Calculate the number of new cities inserted each April, May, and June, along with the year-over-year growth percentage for each month from 2021-2023. List the year, month, the total number of cities added, the running cumulative total, and the year-over-year growth percentage (including "%") for both the monthly total and the running total. Ensure that 2021 data is used only as a baseline for calculating growth rates, and exclude it from the final output., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

This table displays the number of new cities added in April, May, and June for the years 2022 and 2023. It includes:

- **Year**: The year of the data (2022 or 2023).
- **Month**: The month when the cities were added (April, May, June).
- **Total Cities Added**: The number of cities added in that month (`int` data type).
- **Running Cumulative Total**: The cumulative total number of cities added up to that month (`int` data type).
- **Year-over-Year Growth Percentage (Monthly)**: The percentage growth of the monthly total compared to the same month in the previous year (a float between 0 and 100).
- **Year-over-Year Growth Percentage (Running Total)**: The percentage growth of the running cumulative total compared to the same month in the previous year (a float between 0 and 100).

Note: The percentages are calculated using 2021 data as the baseline but 2021 data is not included in the output as per the instructions. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
