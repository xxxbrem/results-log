       AND DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP(TRY_TO_NUMBER("created_at") / 1e6)) = '2023-01-18'
   LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

The error occurs because the `"created_at"` column contains values that are not purely numeric; some entries are JSON objects like `{"bytes":7167,"name":"Ruby"}`. To address this:

- **Use `TRY_TO_NUMBER("created_at")`**: This function attempts to convert `"created_at"` to a number. If it fails (due to non-numeric content), it returns `NULL` instead of throwing an error.
  
- **Filter out non-numeric entries**: By adding `TRY_TO_NUMBER("created_at") IS NOT NULL` to the `WHERE` clause, we ensure that only rows where `"created_at"` is numeric are processed.
  
- **Adjust the timestamp conversion**: We use `TO_TIMESTAMP(TRY_TO_NUMBER("created_at") / 1e6)` to convert the microsecond timestamp to a proper timestamp.
  
- **Filter by the desired date**: We compare the date part of the timestamp to `'2023-01-18'` using the `DATE()` function.

This query simplifies the conditions by focusing on the specific date and event type while handling potential data inconsistencies in the `"created_at"` column.

      LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "language") f
 WHERE TRY_TO_NUMBER(f.value::VARCHAR) IS NOT NULL
 LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

The error occurs because `TRY_TO_NUMBER` cannot directly convert a `VARIANT` type to a `NUMBER`. The `f.value` in the `LATERAL FLATTEN` operation is of type `VARIANT`. To use `TRY_TO_NUMBER`, we need to first cast `f.value` to a `VARCHAR`:

- **Cast `f.value` to `VARCHAR` before conversion:**
  ```sql
  TRY_TO_NUMBER(f.value::VARCHAR) AS "bytes"
  ```

- **Update the `WHERE` clause accordingly:**
  ```sql
  WHERE TRY_TO_NUMBER(f.value::VARCHAR) IS NOT NULL
  ```

This ensures that any non-numeric values are safely handled, and only numeric byte counts are processed.

**Note:** This corrected query should now execute without the specified error, allowing you to retrieve the repository names, languages, and byte counts.

- Filter events occurring on **January 18, 2023**, using the **"created_at"** column.
- Extract repository names from the **"repo"** VARIANT column.
- Determine the primary programming language (the one with the highest byte count) for each repository using the **"language"** VARIANT column.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve a sample of events from the `_2023` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."YEAR"."_2023"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get distinct event types to understand available events:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "type"
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."YEAR"."_2023"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select events of type 'PullRequestEvent':**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."YEAR"."_2023"
   WHERE "type" = 'PullRequestEvent'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Examine the format of the "created_at" timestamps:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "created_at"
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."YEAR"."_2023"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve events that occurred on January 18, 2023:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."YEAR"."_2023"
   WHERE DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) = '2023-01-18'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Get pull request events on January 18, 2023:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."YEAR"."_2023"
   WHERE "type" = 'PullRequestEvent'
     AND DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) = '2023-01-18'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Extract repository names from the "repo" VARIANT column:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     "repo"::VARIANT:"name"::STRING AS "repo_name"
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."YEAR"."_2023"
   WHERE "type" = 'PullRequestEvent'
     AND DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) = '2023-01-18'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count pull request events per repository on January 18, 2023:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     "repo"::VARIANT:"name"::STRING AS "repo_name",
     COUNT(*) AS "pull_request_count"
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."YEAR"."_2023"
   WHERE "type" = 'PullRequestEvent'
     AND DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) = '2023-01-18'
   GROUP BY "repo_name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Inspect the "language" VARIANT column in the LANGUAGES table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."GITHUB_REPOS"."LANGUAGES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Flatten the "language" VARIANT column to view languages and byte counts:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      "repo_name",
      f.key AS "language",
      f.value::NUMBER AS "bytes"
    FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."GITHUB_REPOS"."LANGUAGES",
         LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "language") f
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Determine the primary language (highest byte count) for each repository:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      "repo_name",
      "language",
      "bytes"
    FROM (
      SELECT
        "repo_name",
        f.key AS "language",
        f.value::NUMBER AS "bytes",
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "repo_name" ORDER BY f.value::NUMBER DESC) AS rn
      FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."GITHUB_REPOS"."LANGUAGES",
           LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "language") f
    )
    WHERE rn = 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Combine pull request counts with primary languages for repositories:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      pr."repo_name",
      pr."pull_request_count",
      pl."language",
      pl."bytes"
    FROM (

        COUNT(*) AS "pull_request_count"
      FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."YEAR"."_2023"
      WHERE "type" = 'PullRequestEvent'
        AND DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) = '2023-01-18'
      GROUP BY "repo_name"
    ) pr
    JOIN (
      SELECT
        "repo_name",
        "language",
        "bytes"
      FROM (
        SELECT
          "repo_name",
          f.key AS "language",
          f.value::NUMBER AS "bytes",
          ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "repo_name" ORDER BY f.value::NUMBER DESC) AS rn
        FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."GITHUB_REPOS"."LANGUAGES",
             LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "language") f
      )
      WHERE rn = 1
    ) pl ON pr."repo_name" = pl."repo_name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Calculate total pull requests per language on January 18, 2023:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      pl."language",
      SUM(pr."pull_request_count") AS "total_pull_requests"
    FROM (
      SELECT
        "repo_name",
        "language",
        "bytes"
      FROM (
        SELECT
          "repo_name",
          f.key AS "language",
          f.value::NUMBER AS "bytes",

             LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "language") f
      )
      WHERE rn = 1
    ) pl
    JOIN (
      SELECT
        "repo"::VARIANT:"name"::STRING AS "repo_name",
        COUNT(*) AS "pull_request_count"
      FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."YEAR"."_2023"

        AND DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) = '2023-01-18'
      GROUP BY "repo_name"
    ) pr ON pr."repo_name" = pl."repo_name"
    GROUP BY pl."language"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Filter languages with total pull requests exceeding 5:**
    ```sql

      pl."language",
      SUM(pr."pull_request_count") AS "total_pull_requests"
    FROM (
      SELECT
        "repo_name",
        "language",
        "bytes"
      FROM (
        SELECT
          "repo_name",
          f.key AS "language",
          f.value::NUMBER AS "bytes",
          ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "repo_name" ORDER BY f.value::NUMBER DESC) AS rn
        FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."GITHUB_REPOS"."LANGUAGES",
             LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "language") f
      )
      WHERE rn = 1
    ) pl
    JOIN (
      SELECT
        "repo"::VARIANT:"name"::STRING AS "repo_name",
        COUNT(*) AS "pull_request_count"
      FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."YEAR"."_2023"
      WHERE "type" = 'PullRequestEvent'
        AND DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) = '2023-01-18'
      GROUP BY "repo_name"
    ) pr ON pr."repo_name" = pl."repo_name"
    GROUP BY pl."language"
    HAVING SUM(pr."pull_request_count") > 5
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Inspect the structure of the "payload" column for pull request events:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      "payload"
    FROM "GITHUB_REPOS_DATE"."YEAR"."_2023"
    WHERE "type" = 'PullRequestEvent'
      AND DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_at")) = '2023-01-18'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Note:** The above queries are designed to explore the data and understand the structure of the relevant tables and columns. They aim to extract the necessary information to answer the task by:

- Identifying pull request events on a specific date.
- Extracting repository names associated with those events.
- Determining the primary programming language for each repository based on the highest byte count.
- Calculating the total number of pull requests per programming language.
- Filtering programming languages that have a sum of over 5 pull requests on January 18, 2023.

Task: Which primary programming languages, determined by the highest number of bytes in each repository, have the sum of over 5 pull requests on January 18, 2023 in all its repositories?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The primary programming languages determined by the highest number of bytes in each repository, that have a sum of over 5 pull requests on January 18, 2023 in all their repositories, are as follows:

```csv
primary_language,total_pull_requests
language1:str,number_of_pull_requests1:int
language2:str,number_of_pull_requests2:int
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GITHUB_REPOS_DATE': {'DAY': ['_20110731', '_20121228', '_20140302', '_20170416', '_20170508', '_20171026', '_20180116', '_20181201', '_20191129', '_20210612'], 'GITHUB_REPOS': ['LANGUAGES', 'LICENSES', 'SAMPLE_COMMITS', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS', 'SAMPLE_FILES', 'SAMPLE_REPOS', 'LANGUAGES', 'LICENSES', 'SAMPLE_COMMITS', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS', 'SAMPLE_FILES', 'SAMPLE_REPOS'], 'MONTH': ['_201110', '_201211', '_201307', '_201409', '_201601', '_201706', '_201904', '_202008', '_202312', '_202406'], 'YEAR': ['_2011', '_2012', '_2013', '_2015', '_2016', '_2017', '_2018', '_2019', '_2020', '_2023']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
