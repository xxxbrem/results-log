This simplified query removes the additional conditions and functions on the `Gender` field to ensure that we accurately capture the counts of male and female actors based on the values 'Male' and 'Female'. It also handles cases where the gender is `NULL` or not specified.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant tables, columns, and their potential usage:**

- **"Movie"."MID"**: Movie ID, used to uniquely identify each movie and join with other tables.
- **"Movie"."year"**: The year the movie was released, used to group films by year.
- **"M_Cast"."MID"**: Movie ID, used to link cast members to movies.
- **"M_Cast"."PID"**: Person ID, used to identify actors in each movie and join with the "Person" table.
- **"Person"."PID"**: Person ID, used to uniquely identify each person and join with other tables.
- **"Person"."Gender"**: The gender of the person, used to determine if an actor is female.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter cast members by gender to identify female actors (`"Person"."Gender" = 'F'`).
- Identify movies where all cast members are female.
- Group data by movie and year to calculate totals and proportions.
- Use aggregates to count the number of movies and actors.

These queries help in understanding the distribution of movies, cast members, and genders across the dataset. They range from simple retrievals of data to more complex aggregations needed to compute the proportion of films with exclusively female actors for each year.Query:

Task: I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,FemaleOnlyFilmProportion,TotalFilms
year1:int,proportion1:float,total1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float,total2:int
...
```

This table displays, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors (`FemaleOnlyFilmProportion`) and the total number of all films released in that year (`TotalFilms`)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 09:45:23 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,FemaleOnlyFilmProportion,TotalFilms
year1:int,proportion1:float,total1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float,total2:int
...
```

This table displays, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors (`FemaleOnlyFilmProportion`) and the total number of all films released in that year (`TotalFilms`). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 09:47:17 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,FemaleOnlyFilmProportion,TotalFilms
year1:int,proportion1:float,total1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float,total2:int
...
```

This table displays, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors (`FemaleOnlyFilmProportion`) and the total number of all films released in that year (`TotalFilms`). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
