This query calculates, for each year, the total number of films (`TotalFilms`) and the number of films that have no male actors (`FemaleOnlyFilms`). By left joining the subquery `male_cast`, which identifies movies with male actors, we can find movies where `male_cast."MID"` is `NULL`, indicating there are no male actors in those movies.

This simplified query calculates, for each year, the total number of films (`TotalFilms`) and the number of films that had at least one female actor (`FilmsWithAtLeastOneFemaleActor`). It joins the "Movie", "M_Cast", and "Person" tables to associate movies with their actors and filters actors whose "Gender" is 'Female'.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** "Movie"
  - **"MID"**: Movie ID – identifies each movie.
  - **"year"**: Release year – used to group films by year.

- **Table:** "M_Cast"
  - **"MID"**: Movie ID – links actors to movies.
  - **"PID"**: Person ID – identifies actors in each movie.

- **Table:** "Person"
  - **"PID"**: Person ID – links to actor details.
  - **"Gender"**: Gender of the person – used to determine if an actor is female.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Joins:**
  - Join "Movie" and "M_Cast" on "MID" to associate movies with their casts.
  - Join "M_Cast" and "Person" on "PID" to get the gender of each actor.

- **Filters:**
  - Filter actors where "Gender" = 'Female'.
  - Identify movies where all actors are female.

- **Aggregations:**
  - Count total actors per movie.
  - Determine if the count of female actors equals the total actors in a movie.

- **Grouping:**
  - Group by "MID" to analyze each movie.
  - Group by "year" to calculate yearly statistics.

   SELECT mc."MID", p."Gender"
   FROM "M_Cast" AS mc
   JOIN "Person" AS p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Identify movies with only female actors:**
   ```sql
   SELECT mc."MID"
   FROM "M_Cast" AS mc
   JOIN "Person" AS p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
   GROUP BY mc."MID"
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p."Gender") = 1 AND MIN(p."Gender") = 'Female'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count total films per year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "year", COUNT("MID") AS "TotalFilms"
   FROM "Movie"
   GROUP BY "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count female-only films per year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT m."year", COUNT(DISTINCT m."MID") AS "FemaleOnlyFilms"
    FROM "Movie" AS m
    JOIN (

    ) AS female_movies ON m."MID" = female_movies."MID"
    GROUP BY m."year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Calculate proportion of female-only films per year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      total_per_year."year",
      CAST(female_per_year."FemaleOnlyFilms" AS FLOAT) / total_per_year."TotalFilms" AS "FemaleOnlyFilmProportion",

    WHERE p."Gender" = 'Female'
    GROUP BY mc."MID"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,FemaleOnlyFilmProportion,TotalFilms
year1:int,proportion1:float,total1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float,total2:int
...
```

This table displays, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors (`FemaleOnlyFilmProportion`) and the total number of all films released in that year (`TotalFilms`)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 09:36:37 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,FemaleOnlyFilmProportion,TotalFilms
year1:int,proportion1:float,total1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float,total2:int
...
```

This table displays, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors (`FemaleOnlyFilmProportion`) and the total number of all films released in that year (`TotalFilms`). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Year,FemaleOnlyFilmProportion,TotalFilms
year1:int,proportion1:float,total1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float,total2:int
...
```

This table displays, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors (`FemaleOnlyFilmProportion`) and the total number of all films released in that year (`TotalFilms`). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

This table displays, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors (`FemaleOnlyFilmProportion`) and the total number of all films released in that year (`TotalFilms`). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 09:42:34 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,FemaleOnlyFilmProportion,TotalFilms
year1:int,proportion1:float,total1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float,total2:int
...
```

This table displays, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors (`FemaleOnlyFilmProportion`) and the total number of all films released in that year (`TotalFilms`). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
