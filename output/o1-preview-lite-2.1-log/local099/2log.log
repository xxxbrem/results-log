This query counts the number of actors who have acted in more films directed by Yash Chopra (`'nm0007181'`) than with any other director. It simplifies previous conditions by focusing on actors who have appeared in films directed by Yash Chopra and comparing their collaboration count with their maximum collaborations with other directors.

This query calculates the number of actors who have made more films with Yash Chopra (`'nm0007181'`) than with any other director.

**Explanation:**

1. **Actor-Director Movie Counts:**
   - The subquery `ActorDirectorCounts` calculates the number of movies (`Director_Movie_Count`) each actor (`A."PID"`) has worked with each director (`D."PID"`).
   - It groups the results by actor and director.

2. **Aggregate Counts for Each Actor:**
   - The outer query aggregates these counts for each actor.
   - It calculates:
     - `"Yash_Count"`: Total movies the actor has done with Yash Chopra.
     - `"Max_Other_Count"`: Maximum number of movies the actor has done with any other director.
   - The `COUNT(CASE WHEN D."PID" = 'nm0007181' THEN 1 END)` counts the number of movies with Yash Chopra.
   - The `MAX(CASE WHEN D."PID" != 'nm0007181' THEN Director_Movie_Count ELSE 0 END)` finds the highest movie count with any other director.

3. **Filtering Actors:**
   - The `HAVING` clause ensures we only consider actors where `"Yash_Count"` is greater than `"Max_Other_Count"`.
   - This means the actor has worked more times with Yash Chopra than with any other director.

4. **Final Count:**
   - The outermost `SELECT COUNT(*)` counts the number of such actors.

**Note:** This query simplifies previous conditions and avoids errors by correctly aggregating and comparing the actors' collaboration counts with Yash Chopra versus other directors.

This query calculates the number of actors who have made **more films with Yash Chopra than with any other director** by:

1. **Counting Films per Actor-Director Pair**: It first calculates the number of films each actor has done with each director.
2. **Finding Maximum Films per Actor**: Then, for each actor, it determines the maximum number of films they've done with any director.
3. **Identifying Actors Who Collaborated Most with Yash Chopra**: It selects actors whose maximum number of films is with Yash Chopra (`'nm0007181'`).
4. **Counting Such Actors**: Finally, it counts the number of these actors.

**Note**: This simplified query addresses previous errors by ensuring that all table aliases and column references are correctly defined and accessible. It avoids complex subqueries and focuses on the core logic needed to obtain the desired count.

    GROUP BY "Director"."Name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively build an understanding of the relationships between actors, directors, and movies in the database. By analyzing these relationships, we can determine how many actors have collaborated more frequently with Yash Chopra than with any other director.

**Note:** To complete the original task, we would need to:

- For each actor:
  - Count the number of movies they've acted in directed by Yash Chopra.
  - Count the number of movies they've acted in directed by other directors.
  - Compare these counts to determine if Yash Chopra is the director they've collaborated with the most.
- Then, count the number of actors for whom this is true.

However, due to the constraints, we're not to write that final query explicitly here.Query:

Task: I need you to look into the actor collaborations and tell me how many actors have made more films with Yash Chopra than with any other director. This will help us understand his influence on the industry better.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_Actors
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This number represents the total actors who have collaborated with Yash Chopra in more films than they have with any other director, highlighting his significant influence and frequent collaborations in the industry..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 18:34:38 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I need you to look into the actor collaborations and tell me how many actors have made more films with Yash Chopra than with any other director. This will help us understand his influence on the industry better., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Number_of_Actors
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This number represents the total actors who have collaborated with Yash Chopra in more films than they have with any other director, highlighting his significant influence and frequent collaborations in the industry. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
