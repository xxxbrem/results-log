After comparing the two SQL statements and their results, I conclude that **1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Regex Expression:** The SQL query in `1result.sql` uses the regular expression `^import(\s+static)?\s+([a-zA-Z0-9_\.]+)`, which matches both `import` and `import static` statements, capturing the package name. This ensures that all import statements are considered, including static imports.

- **Capture Group:** It extracts the package name using capture group 2, focusing on the actual package being imported. This makes the extraction more precise.

- **Comprehensive Results:** The counts in `1result.csv` are slightly higher in some cases compared to `0result.csv`, indicating that the query captures more instances of import statements. For example, `java.util.ArrayList` has a count of 240 in the second result, compared to 239 in the first.

- **Improved Accuracy:** By handling both regular and static imports and using a more precise regex, `1result.sql` provides a more accurate count of the most frequently imported packages in Java source files.

**Output:**
