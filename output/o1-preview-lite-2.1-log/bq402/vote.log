After reviewing the SQL queries and their results, **2result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Calculations:** The SQL query in **2result.sql** accurately calculates both the conversion rate and the average number of transactions per purchaser. It does this by:

  - Counting the number of unique visitors (`COUNT(*)`).
  - Counting the number of purchasers (`COUNTIF(total_transactions > 0)`), where a purchaser is defined as a visitor with at least one transaction.
  - Calculating the conversion rate as `(Number of Purchasers / Total Unique Visitors) * 100`.
  - Calculating the average number of transactions per purchaser by summing all transactions made by purchasers and dividing by the number of purchasers.

- **Concise and Clear Query:** The query is concise and clearly implements the required computations without unnecessary complexity.

- **Precise Results:** The results provided by **2result.sql** are precise and match the expected values for both metrics.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:
