After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I recommend using `2result.sql` for the following reasons:

1. **Use of `SAFE_DIVIDE` Function:**
   - `2result.sql` utilizes the `SAFE_DIVIDE` function to safely perform division and handle any potential division by zero errors. This ensures that the query doesn't fail if `cumulative_confirmed` is zero for any record.
   - In contrast, `1result.sql` performs direct division, which could result in an error if `cumulative_confirmed` is zero for any country (even though unlikely with confirmed cases over 50,000).

2. **Accurate Filtering of Recovery Rates:**
   - `2result.sql` includes a condition `AND cumulative_recovered <= cumulative_confirmed`, which logically ensures that the number of recovered cases does not exceed the number of confirmed cases.
   - `1result.sql` filters based on the calculated recovery rate being less than or equal to 100%, but directly comparing the counts (as in `2result.sql`) is more precise and prevents any anomalies due to data inaccuracies.

3. **Inclusive Threshold for Confirmed Cases:**
   - `2result.sql` uses `cumulative_confirmed >= 50000`, which includes countries with exactly 50,000 confirmed cases.
   - `1result.sql` uses `cumulative_confirmed > 50000`, potentially excluding any country that has exactly 50,000 confirmed cases on the specified date.

Both queries yield the same top three countries and recovery rates, but `2result.sql` is more robust and precise due to the reasons above.

Therefore, the recommended SQL query is:
