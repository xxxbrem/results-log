After comparing both SQL queries and their outputs, I recommend using **`1result.sql`** for the following reasons:

1. **Data Type Precision**: In `1result.sql`, the numerical values for counts (number of customers, number of orders, number of 5-star ratings) are explicitly cast to integers using `CAST(... AS INTEGER)`. This ensures that the count values are represented as whole numbers, which is appropriate for count data.

   ```sql
   CAST(num_customers AS INTEGER) AS Value
   ```

2. **Consistency in Rounding**: For the total profit calculation, `1result.sql` performs the rounding operation in the outer `SELECT` statement. This separation enhances clarity by first computing the sum and then applying formatting:

   ```sql
   ROUND(total_profit, 4) AS Value
   ```

   In contrast, `0result.sql` performs rounding within the CTE, which can be less readable.

3. **Query Structure**: `1result.sql` uses subqueries within the `UNION ALL` statements rather than Common Table Expressions (CTEs). This structure can make the query more straightforward to read and understand, as each metric calculation is self-contained within its `SELECT` statement.

4. **Clarity and Readability**: By assigning clear aliases like `num_customers`, `total_profit`, `num_orders`, and `num_5_star_ratings`, `1result.sql` makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. The use of descriptive variable names aids in understanding what each part of the query is computing.

5. **Consistency in Formatting**: Casting and rounding are applied consistently across all metrics where appropriate, ensuring that the output data types align with the expected formats for these values.

**Conclusion**: While both queries aim to accomplish the same task and produce similar results, `1result.sql` provides clearer data type handling and a more readable structure, making it the better choice for accurate and maintainable code.
