**Explanation:**

This SQL query calculates the required statistics for each of the six equal quantile groups based on trip duration, considering only trips between 0 and 60 minutes.

**Steps:**

1. **valid_trips CTE:**
   - Filters trips where `trip_seconds` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3600 (0 to 60 minutes).
   - Excludes rows where `trip_seconds` or `fare` is NULL or zero.
   - Calculates `trip_minutes` by rounding `trip_seconds / 60` to the nearest whole number.

2. **quantiles CTE:**
   - Uses `APPROX_QUANTILES` to compute the quantile boundaries for dividing the data into six equal groups (which requires specifying 7 quantiles).
   - The quantile boundaries are stored in the array `quantile_bounds`.

3. **trips_with_quantiles CTE:**
   - Extracts each quantile boundary (q0 to q6) from the `quantile_bounds` array.
   - Assigns each trip to a `quantile_group` based on its `trip_minutes` and the quantile boundaries.

4. **final CTE:**
   - Groups the trips by `quantile_group`.
   - Calculates the minimum and maximum trip durations in minutes for each group.
   - Counts the total number of trips in each group.
   - Calculates the average fare for each group, rounded to two decimal places.

5. **Final SELECT:**
   - Selects and formats the required columns for output.

**Note:**

- The query ensures that trips with NULL or zero values in `trip_seconds` or `fare` are excluded.
- It handles empty columns by filtering them out in the `valid_trips` CTE.
- The use of `APPROX_QUANTILES` divides the dataset into approximately equal-sized groups based on trip duration.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `trip_seconds`: Used to calculate trip duration in minutes by dividing by 60. Important for determining trip durations between 0 and 60 minutes.
- `fare`: Used to calculate the average fare for each quantile group.
- `unique_key`: Used to identify individual trips and count the total number of trips.
- `trip_start_timestamp` and `trip_end_timestamp`: Timestamp of trip start and end; could be used for additional validations or calculations if needed.
- `trip_miles`: May provide context on trip distances, but not directly required for the task.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Only consider trips where `trip_seconds` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3600 (which corresponds to 60 minutes).
- Exclude trips with `trip_seconds` as NULL or negative values.
- Exclude trips where `fare` is NULL or zero (if relevant for average fare calculations).
- Use `ROUND(trip_seconds / 60)` to get trip duration in minutes rounded to the nearest whole number.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **View Sample Trip Durations and Fares:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `unique_key`, `trip_seconds`, `fare`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get Distinct Payment Types:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `payment_type`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **View Trips with Positive Duration (Sorted by Duration):**

   ```sql
   SELECT `unique_key`, `trip_seconds`, `fare`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE `trip_seconds` > 0
   ORDER BY `trip_seconds` ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find Trips with Zero Duration:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `unique_key`, `trip_seconds`, `fare`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE `trip_seconds` = 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Check for Trips with NULL Duration:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `unique_key`, `trip_seconds`, `fare`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE `trip_seconds` IS NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Select Trips Between 0 and 60 Minutes (in Seconds):**

   ```sql
   SELECT `unique_key`, `trip_seconds`, `fare`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE `trip_seconds` > 0 AND `trip_seconds` <= 3600
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate Trip Duration in Minutes (Rounded):**

   ```sql
   SELECT `unique_key`, `trip_seconds`, ROUND(`trip_seconds` / 60) AS `trip_minutes`, `fare`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE `trip_seconds` > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get Distinct Rounded Trip Durations in Minutes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT ROUND(`trip_seconds` / 60) AS `trip_minutes`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE `trip_seconds` > 0
   ORDER BY `trip_minutes` ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **View Fares for Trips with Valid Durations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `fare`, `trip_seconds`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
   WHERE `fare` IS NOT NULL AND `trip_seconds` > 0
   ORDER BY `fare` DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count Trips by Rounded Duration in Minutes:**

    ```sql
    SELECT ROUND(`trip_seconds` / 60) AS `trip_minutes`, COUNT(*) AS `trip_count`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    WHERE `trip_seconds` > 0 AND `trip_seconds` <= 3600
    GROUP BY `trip_minutes`
    ORDER BY `trip_minutes` ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Explanation:**

These queries explore the relevant columns and data needed for the task:

- Queries 1-3 fetch sample data to understand `trip_seconds`, `fare`, and ensure positive durations.
- Queries 4-5 identify any anomalies with zero or NULL durations.
- Query 6 filters trips between 0 and 60 minutes (in seconds).
- Query 7 calculates trip duration in minutes, rounding to the nearest whole number.
- Query 8 finds distinct rounded trip durations to see the range of durations.
- Query 9 examines the fares associated with valid trip durations.
- Query 10 counts the number of trips for each rounded trip duration, which is helpful for quantile calculations.

These queries help in understanding the data distribution and verifying that the necessary data is available and valid for performing the required calculations.Query:
SELECT `unique_key`, `trip_seconds`, `fare`

Task: Calculate the minimum and maximum trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number), total number of trips, and average fare for each of six equal quantile groups based on trip duration, considering only trips between 0 and 60 minutes.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Quantile_Group,Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Total_Number_of_Trips,Average_Fare
1,min_duration1:int,max_duration1:int,total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float
2,min_duration2:int,max_duration2:int,total_trips2:int,average_fare2:float
3,min_duration3:int,max_duration3:int,total_trips3:int,average_fare3:float
4,min_duration4:int,max_duration4:int,total_trips4:int,average_fare4:float
5,min_duration5:int,max_duration5:int,total_trips5:int,average_fare5:float
6,min_duration6:int,max_duration6:int,total_trips6:int,average_fare6:float
```

**Explanation:**

The table above represents six equal quantile groups based on trip duration for taxi trips between 0 and 60 minutes. For each quantile group, it displays:

- **Quantile_Group**: The group number (from 1 to 6).
- **Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes**: The minimum trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number) within the quantile.
- **Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes**: The maximum trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number) within the quantile.
- **Total_Number_of_Trips**: The total number of trips within the quantile.
- **Average_Fare**: The average fare for trips within the quantile..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'chicago_crime': ['crime'], 'chicago_taxi_trips': ['taxi_trips']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-29 19:24:47 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Calculate the minimum and maximum trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number), total number of trips, and average fare for each of six equal quantile groups based on trip duration, considering only trips between 0 and 60 minutes., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Quantile_Group,Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes,Total_Number_of_Trips,Average_Fare
1,min_duration1:int,max_duration1:int,total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float

```

**Explanation:**

The table above represents six equal quantile groups based on trip duration for taxi trips between 0 and 60 minutes. For each quantile group, it displays:

- **Quantile_Group**: The group number (from 1 to 6).
- **Min_Trip_Duration_Minutes**: The minimum trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number) within the quantile.
- **Max_Trip_Duration_Minutes**: The maximum trip duration in minutes (rounded to the nearest whole number) within the quantile.
- **Total_Number_of_Trips**: The total number of trips within the quantile.
- **Average_Fare**: The average fare for trips within the quantile. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
