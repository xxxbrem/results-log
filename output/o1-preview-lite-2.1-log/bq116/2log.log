2025-01-27 03:21:19 - root - INFO - I apologize for the confusion. It appears that some column names in my previous queries were incorrect. Let's correct them based on the table schemas provided.

**Corrections:**

- In the `submission` table:
  - `adsh` should be `submission_number`.
  - `fy` should be `fiscal_year`.

- In the `numbers` table, the columns are correct.

Let's revisit the relevant tables and columns and update the SQL queries accordingly.

---

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`submission` table**: Contains information about company filings, including their business addresses.
   - `submission_number`: Submission number (used to join with `numbers.submission_number`).
   - `stprba`: State or province of the business address (state code).
   - `fiscal_year`: Fiscal year.
   - `fiscal_period_focus`: Fiscal period focus (e.g., Q1, Q2, Q3, FY).
   - `form`: Submission type (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q).
   - `countryba`: Country of the business address (should be 'US' for U.S. states).
   - `company_name`: Name of the registrant.

2. **`numbers` table**: Contains financial data reported by companies.
   - `submission_number`: Submission number (used to join with `submission.submission_number`).
   - `measure_tag`: Financial measure tag (e.g., "Revenues").
   - `value`: Reported financial value.
   - `period_end_date`: End date for the data value.
   - `number_of_quarters`: Number of quarters the data represents (should be 4 for annual data).
   - `units`: Units of the value (e.g., USD).

3. **`measure_tag` table**: Provides definitions for the measure tags.
   - `measure_tag`: Tag identifier.
   - `tag_label`: Human-readable label for the tag.
   - `i_or_d`: Indicates if the tag represents a point in time ('I') or duration ('D').
   - `datatype`: Data type (e.g., 'monetary').

**Conditions to Apply:**

- Filter for fiscal year 2016: `submission.fiscal_year = 2016`.
- Filter for annual reports covering four quarters: `numbers.number_of_quarters = 4`.
- Focus on U.S. companies: `submission.countryba = 'US'`.
- Relevant financial measures: Revenue-related tags.
  - Common revenue tags may include 'Revenues', 'SalesRevenueNet', 'RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax', etc.
- Ensure values are in USD: `numbers.units = 'USD'`.

---

**Updated SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct state codes from the `submission` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `stprba`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission`
   WHERE `countryba` = 'US'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct revenue-related measure tags from the `measure_tag` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `measure_tag`, `tag_label`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.measure_tag`
   WHERE LOWER(`tag_label`) LIKE '%revenue%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve company submissions for fiscal year 2016 with form type '10-K' (annual reports):**

   ```sql
   SELECT `submission_number`, `company_name`, `stprba`, `fiscal_year`, `form`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission`
   WHERE `fiscal_year` = 2016 AND `form` = '10-K' AND `countryba` = 'US'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get reported revenues from the `numbers` table for 2016 annual reports:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `submission_number`, `measure_tag`, `value`, `units`, `number_of_quarters`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers`
   WHERE `number_of_quarters` = 4 AND `units` = 'USD'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Join `numbers` and `submission` tables to get revenues with state information:**

   ```sql
   SELECT n.`submission_number`, s.`stprba`, n.`measure_tag`, n.`value`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers` AS n
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` AS s
   ON n.`submission_number` = s.`submission_number`
   WHERE s.`fiscal_year` = 2016 AND s.`form` = '10-K' AND s.`countryba` = 'US' AND n.`number_of_quarters` = 4
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Filter the joined data for revenue-related tags:**

   ```sql
   SELECT n.`submission_number`, s.`stprba`, n.`measure_tag`, n.`value`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers` AS n
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` AS s
   ON n.`submission_number` = s.`submission_number`
   WHERE s.`fiscal_year` = 2016 AND s.`form` = '10-K' AND s.`countryba` = 'US'
     AND n.`number_of_quarters` = 4 AND n.`measure_tag` = 'Revenues'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find total revenues per state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s.`stprba`, SUM(n.`value`) AS total_revenue
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers` AS n
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` AS s
   ON n.`submission_number` = s.`submission_number`
   WHERE s.`fiscal_year` = 2016 AND s.`form` = '10-K' AND s.`countryba` = 'US'
     AND n.`number_of_quarters` = 4 AND n.`measure_tag` = 'Revenues'
     AND n.`units` = 'USD'
   GROUP BY s.`stprba`
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get the highest total revenue among all states:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s.`stprba`, SUM(n.`value`) AS total_revenue
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers` AS n
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` AS s
   ON n.`submission_number` = s.`submission_number`
   WHERE s.`fiscal_year` = 2016 AND s.`form` = '10-K' AND s.`countryba` = 'US'
     AND n.`number_of_quarters` = 4 AND n.`measure_tag` = 'Revenues'
     AND n.`units` = 'USD'
   GROUP BY s.`stprba`
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

9. **List companies with their revenues and states for 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s.`company_name`, s.`stprba`, n.`value` AS revenue
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers` AS n
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` AS s
   ON n.`submission_number` = s.`submission_number`
   WHERE s.`fiscal_year` = 2016 AND s.`form` = '10-K' AND s.`countryba` = 'US'
     AND n.`number_of_quarters` = 4 AND n.`measure_tag` = 'Revenues'
     AND n.`units` = 'USD'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Aggregate revenues across main revenue categories per state:**

    ```sql
    SELECT s.`stprba`, SUM(n.`value`) AS total_revenue
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers` AS n
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` AS s
    ON n.`submission_number` = s.`submission_number`
    WHERE s.`fiscal_year` = 2016 AND s.`form` = '10-K' AND s.`countryba` = 'US'
      AND n.`number_of_quarters` = 4
      AND n.`measure_tag` IN (
        'Revenues',
        'SalesRevenueNet',
        'RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax'
      )
      AND n.`units` = 'USD'
    GROUP BY s.`stprba`
    ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- Replaced `adsh` with `submission_number`.
- Replaced `fy` with `fiscal_year`.
- Ensured that the column names match those provided in the table schemas.

---

**Additional Notes:**

- When running these queries, please ensure that the column names exactly match those in the dataset.
- If you encounter any other errors, please verify that all column names are spelled correctly and exist in the respective tables.
- The queries above should help you explore the data and answer the task question.

**Results from Corrected Query:**

Using the corrected query from Query 3:

```sql
SELECT `submission_number`, `company_name`, `stprba`, `fiscal_year`, `form`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission`
WHERE `fiscal_year` = 2016 AND `form` = '10-K' AND `countryba` = 'US'
LIMIT 100;
```

You should now be able to retrieve the data without errors.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

To address the task, we'll need to examine financial data reported by companies and associate it with U.S. states. Here are the relevant tables and columns:

1. **`submission` table**: Contains information about company filings, including their business addresses.
   - `adsh`: Submission number (used to join with `numbers.submission_number`).
   - `stprba`: State or province of the business address (state code).
   - `fy`: Fiscal year.
   - `fp`: Fiscal period focus (e.g., Q1, Q2, Q3, FY).
   - `form`: Submission type (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q).
   - `countryba`: Country of the business address (should be 'US' for U.S. states).
  
2. **`numbers` table**: Contains financial data reported by companies.
   - `submission_number`: Submission number (used to join with `submission.adsh`).
   - `measure_tag`: Financial measure tag (e.g., "Revenues").
   - `value`: Reported financial value.
   - `period_end_date`: End date for the data value.
   - `number_of_quarters`: Number of quarters the data represents (should be 4 for annual data).
   - `units`: Units of the value (e.g., USD).
  
3. **`measure_tag` table**: Provides definitions for the measure tags.
   - `measure_tag`: Tag identifier.
   - `tag_label`: Human-readable label for the tag.
   - `i_or_d`: Indicates if the tag represents a point in time ('I') or duration ('D').
   - `datatype`: Data type (e.g., 'monetary').

**Conditions to Apply:**

- Filter for fiscal year 2016: `submission.fy = 2016`.
- Filter for annual reports covering four quarters: `numbers.number_of_quarters = 4`.
- Focus on U.S. companies: `submission.countryba = 'US'`.
- Relevant financial measures: Revenue-related tags.
  - Common revenue tags may include 'Revenues', 'SalesRevenueNet', 'RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax', etc.
- Ensure values are in USD: `numbers.units = 'USD'`.

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct state codes from the `submission` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `stprba`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission`
   WHERE `countryba` = 'US'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct revenue-related measure tags from the `measure_tag` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `measure_tag`, `tag_label`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.measure_tag`
   WHERE LOWER(`tag_label`) LIKE '%revenue%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve company submissions for fiscal year 2016 with form type '10-K' (annual reports):**
   ```sql
   SELECT `adsh`, `company_name`, `stprba`, `fy`, `form`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission`
   WHERE `fy` = 2016 AND `form` = '10-K' AND `countryba` = 'US'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get reported revenues from the `numbers` table for 2016 annual reports:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `submission_number`, `measure_tag`, `value`, `units`, `number_of_quarters`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers`
   WHERE `number_of_quarters` = 4 AND `units` = 'USD'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Join `numbers` and `submission` tables to get revenues with state information:**
   ```sql
   SELECT n.`submission_number`, s.`stprba`, n.`measure_tag`, n.`value`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers` AS n
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` AS s
   ON n.`submission_number` = s.`adsh`
   WHERE s.`fy` = 2016 AND s.`form` = '10-K' AND s.`countryba` = 'US' AND n.`number_of_quarters` = 4
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Filter the joined data for revenue-related tags:**
   ```sql
   SELECT n.`submission_number`, s.`stprba`, n.`measure_tag`, n.`value`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers` AS n
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` AS s
   ON n.`submission_number` = s.`adsh`
   WHERE s.`fy` = 2016 AND s.`form` = '10-K' AND s.`countryba` = 'US'
     AND n.`number_of_quarters` = 4 AND n.`measure_tag` = 'Revenues'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find total revenues per state:**
   ```sql
   SELECT s.`stprba`, SUM(n.`value`) AS total_revenue
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers` AS n
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` AS s
   ON n.`submission_number` = s.`adsh`
   WHERE s.`fy` = 2016 AND s.`form` = '10-K' AND s.`countryba` = 'US'
     AND n.`number_of_quarters` = 4 AND n.`measure_tag` = 'Revenues'
     AND n.`units` = 'USD'
   GROUP BY s.`stprba`
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get the highest total revenue among all states:**
   ```sql
   SELECT s.`stprba`, SUM(n.`value`) AS total_revenue
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers` AS n
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` AS s
   ON n.`submission_number` = s.`adsh`
   WHERE s.`fy` = 2016 AND s.`form` = '10-K' AND s.`countryba` = 'US'
     AND n.`number_of_quarters` = 4 AND n.`measure_tag` = 'Revenues'
     AND n.`units` = 'USD'
   GROUP BY s.`stprba`
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

9. **List companies with their revenues and states for 2016:**
   ```sql
   SELECT s.`company_name`, s.`stprba`, n.`value` AS revenue
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers` AS n
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` AS s
   ON n.`submission_number` = s.`adsh`
   WHERE s.`fy` = 2016 AND s.`form` = '10-K' AND s.`countryba` = 'US'
     AND n.`number_of_quarters` = 4 AND n.`measure_tag` = 'Revenues'
     AND n.`units` = 'USD'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Aggregate revenues across main revenue categories per state:**
    ```sql
    SELECT s.`stprba`, SUM(n.`value`) AS total_revenue
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.numbers` AS n
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` AS s
    ON n.`submission_number` = s.`adsh`
    WHERE s.`fy` = 2016 AND s.`form` = '10-K' AND s.`countryba` = 'US'
      AND n.`number_of_quarters` = 4 AND n.`measure_tag` IN ('Revenues', 'SalesRevenueNet', 'RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax')
      AND n.`units` = 'USD'
    GROUP BY s.`stprba`
    ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Note:** The above queries aim to explore the data to understand the reported revenues by companies, associated with their business addresses in U.S. states for the fiscal year 2016. Since the available dataset contains company financials rather than state government revenues, the results would reflect the aggregate revenues reported by companies located in each state, not the revenues reported by the state governments themselves.Query:

Task: What was the highest annual revenue in billions of dollars reported by a U.S. state in 2016, across the main revenue categories and covering all four quarters?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
State,Highest_Annual_Revenue_Billions
state_code:str,revenue_in_billions:float > 0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The table above presents the highest annual revenue in billions of dollars reported by a U.S. state in 2016, aggregated across the main revenue categories and covering all four quarters..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'sec_quarterly_financials': ['calculation', 'dimension', 'measure_tag', 'numbers', 'presentation', 'quick_summary', 'rendering', 'sic_codes', 'submission', 'txt']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
