After comparing both SQL queries and their results, we can conclude that:

- **Both SQL queries retrieve the total number of 'Other Theft' incidents within the 'Theft and Handling' category for each year in the Westminster borough.**
- **The results produced by both queries are identical.**

The main differences between the two SQL scripts are:

1. **Use of Backticks:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses backticks (\`) around column names and aliases.
   - **`2result.sql`** does not use backticks.

2. **Formatting Style:**
   - **`0result.sql`** places the entire `SELECT` statement on a single line.
   - **`2result.sql`** formats the `SELECT` statement across multiple lines for better readability.

**Reason for Choosing `2result.sql`:**

- **Readability:** `2result.sql` is formatted in a way that enhances readability, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Unnecessary Backticks:** Since the column names (`year`, `value`) do not conflict with any reserved keywords and do not contain any special characters or spaces, the use of backticks in `0result.sql` is unnecessary.
- **Standard Practice:** Avoiding unnecessary backticks and using clear formatting is considered good practice in SQL scripting.

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** is the preferred and correct SQL script.
