2025-01-25 00:59:42 - root - INFO - Certainly! The error in your SQL query is due to mismatched quotation marks around your string literals in the `WHERE` clause. In SQL:

- **String literals** (like `'Westminster'`, `'Theft and Handling'`, `'Other Theft'`) should be enclosed in **single quotes** `' '`.
- **Identifiers** (like table names and column names) can be enclosed in **backticks** `` ` `` if they contain special characters or reserved words.

In your query, you started the string literals with a single quote `'` but ended them with a backtick `` ` ``, resulting in unclosed string literals.

**Here's the corrected SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
WHERE `borough` = 'Westminster'
  AND `major_category` = 'Theft and Handling'
  AND `minor_category` = 'Other Theft'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- Ensured that all string literals are enclosed with **single quotes** `' '`.
- Kept the column names and table identifiers enclosed with **backticks** `` ` ``.
- This corrects the unclosed string literal errors and should allow the query to run successfully.

**Next Steps:**

- Running this corrected query will fetch the records of 'Other Theft' incidents within the 'Theft and Handling' category for the borough of 'Westminster'.
- You can then proceed to aggregate the data to find the total number of incidents per year.

**For example, to get the total number of 'Other Theft' incidents for each year:**

```sql
SELECT `year`, SUM(`value`) AS `Total_Incidents`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
WHERE `borough` = 'Westminster'
  AND `major_category` = 'Theft and Handling'
  AND `minor_category` = 'Other Theft'
GROUP BY `year`
ORDER BY `year` ASC;
```

**This query:**

- Selects the `year` and calculates the total number of incidents (`SUM(value)`) for each year.
- Filters records to include only those matching the specified borough and crime categories.
- Groups the results by `year` and orders them in ascending order.

**The expected output format would be:**

```csv
Year,Total_Incidents
2008,total_incidents1:int
2009,total_incidents2:int
2010,total_incidents3:int
...
```

Each row represents a year and the corresponding total number of 'Other Theft' incidents in Westminster. This aligns with your original task of providing the total number of 'Other Theft' incidents within the 'Theft and Handling' category for each year in the Westminster borough.

Task: Could you provide the total number of 'Other Theft' incidents within the 'Theft and Handling' category for each year in the Westminster borough?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Certainly! Here is the total number of 'Other Theft' incidents within the 'Theft and Handling' category for each year in the Westminster borough:

```csv
Year,Total_Incidents
year1:int,incidents1:int
year2:int,incidents2:int
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: The year in which the incidents occurred.
- **Total_Incidents**: The total number of 'Other Theft' incidents in the Westminster borough for that year.

Each row represents a specific year and the corresponding total number of 'Other Theft' incidents recorded under the 'Theft and Handling' category in Westminster..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'london_crime': ['crime_by_lsoa'], 'london_fire_brigade': ['fire_brigade_service_calls']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
