After reviewing the SQL queries and their corresponding results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL that fulfills the task requirements.

**Reasoning:**

- **Excludes the First Month:** The query explicitly excludes the first month from the final output by selecting months greater than the minimum transaction month.
  
  ```sql
  WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', "txn_date") > (
    SELECT MIN(strftime('%Y-%m', "txn_date")) FROM "customer_transactions"
  )
  ```
  
- **Calculates Previous Month's End Date:** It accurately calculates the end date of the previous month for each month.
  
  ```sql
  date("month" || '-01', '-1 day') AS "previous_month_end"
  ```
  
- **Sums Transactions Up to Previous Month's End Date:** The query sums up each customer's transaction amounts up to the end of the previous month.
  
  ```sql
  SUM(ct."txn_amount") AS "balance"
  ```
  
- **Replaces Negative Balances with Zero:** It replaces any negative balances with zero when calculating the total balance.
  
  ```sql
  SUM(CASE WHEN "balance" < 0 THEN 0 ELSE "balance" END) AS "total_balance"
  ```
  
- **Final Output Sorted by Month:** The results are ordered in ascending order by month, as required.
  
  ```sql
  ORDER BY "Month" ASC;
  ```

**Therefore, the correct SQL file is:**

```plaintext
1result.sql
