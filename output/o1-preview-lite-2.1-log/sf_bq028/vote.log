After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for the given task.

**Reason:**

- **Latest Release Versions:** `2result.sql` accurately selects the latest release version of each NPM package by identifying the maximum `"UpstreamPublishedAt"` date per package. This ensures that only the most recent versions are considered.
  
- **Popularity Based on GitHub Stars:** It joins the latest package versions with the `PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT` and `PROJECTS` tables to associate each package with its corresponding GitHub repository. By aggregating the `"StarsCount"` from the `PROJECTS` table, it determines the popularity of each package.
  
- **Correct Ordering and Limiting:** The query orders the packages by `"GitHubStars"` in descending order to list the most popular packages first. It then limits the results to the top 8 packages, as per the task requirement.
  
- **Accurate Results:** The output in `2result.csv` shows NPM packages with their versions that are plausibly popular based on GitHub star counts, indicating that the query successfully fulfills the task.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**
