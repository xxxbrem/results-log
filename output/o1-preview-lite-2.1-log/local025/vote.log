After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

1. **Use of Standard SQL Functions:**
   - `2result.sql` uses `COALESCE`, which is a standard SQL function recognized across different SQL dialects. In contrast, `1result.sql` uses `IFNULL`, which is specific to certain SQL dialects like MySQL. Using `COALESCE` ensures better compatibility and adherence to SQL standards.

2. **Precision of Results:**
   - `2result.sql` calculates the average without rounding, providing a more precise result (`19.086267605633804`). In contrast, `1result.sql` rounds the average to four decimal places (`19.0863`). Since the problem does not specify any rounding requirements, presenting the unrounded, precise average is more appropriate.

3. **Clarity and Consistency:**
   - The structure of `2result.sql` aligns closely with standard SQL practices demonstrated in earlier queries. It uses clear and consistent aliasing and grouping, making the query easier to read and understand.

4. **Accuracy and Correctness:**
   - Both queries aim to calculate the average of the highest runs conceded in a single over for each match. However, `2result.sql` implements this calculation accurately by first determining the total runs per over, then finding the maximum runs conceded in a single over per match, and finally calculating the average of these maximums across all matches.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above reasons, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that accurately answers the question.
