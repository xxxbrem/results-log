2025-01-27 13:15:54 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering an error because the SQL query is starting with a `WHERE` clause. In SQL, every query must begin with a `SELECT` statement, followed by a `FROM` clause specifying the table you're querying. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records after specifying the columns and the table.

Here's why you're seeing the error:

- **Error Message:** `Syntax error: Unexpected keyword WHERE at [1:1]`
- **Reason:** The SQL engine expects a `SELECT` clause at the beginning of the query, but it encountered `WHERE` instead.

### How to Fix the Error

To fix this error, you need to include the `SELECT` and `FROM` clauses in your SQL query before the `WHERE` clause. Here's the correct structure:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM `database.schema.table`
WHERE conditions;
```

### Example Correction

If you're trying to select all columns from the `users` table where the `creation_date` is between '2021-01-01' and '2021-12-31', your query should look like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31';
```

### Explanation

- **`SELECT *`**: Selects all columns.
- **`FROM`**: Specifies the table to select data from.
- **`WHERE`**: Filters the records based on the condition provided.

### Applying This to Your Queries

Here are corrected versions of some of the queries:

1. **List new users created in 2021:**

   ```sql
   SELECT id, creation_date
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
   WHERE creation_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the total number of new users created in 2021:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
   WHERE creation_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31';
   ```

3. **List new users who asked at least one question within 30 days of account creation:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT u.id
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users` AS u
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` AS pq
     ON u.id = pq.owner_user_id
   WHERE u.creation_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
     AND pq.creation_date BETWEEN u.creation_date AND TIMESTAMP_ADD(u.creation_date, INTERVAL 30 DAY)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

### Tips for Writing SQL Queries

- **Start with `SELECT`:** Every SQL query should start with the `SELECT` keyword.
- **Specify the Table with `FROM`:** Use the `FROM` clause to indicate which table you're querying.
- **Use `WHERE` for Conditions:** Apply conditions using the `WHERE` clause after specifying the table.
- **Check for Correct Syntax:** Ensure all keywords are in the correct order and properly spelled.

### General Structure of a Query

```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY column_names]
[HAVING condition]
[ORDER BY column_names]
[LIMIT number];
```

### Conclusion

By ensuring that your SQL queries begin with a `SELECT` statement and follow the proper syntax, you should be able to execute your queries without encountering syntax errors. If you have any more questions or need further assistance with your queries, feel free to ask!
2025-01-27 13:16:37 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-27 13:16:37 - root - INFO - It looks like you're encountering a syntax error when trying to run your SQL query:

```sql
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
```

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Expected end of input but got "." at [1:26]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Expected end of input but got "." at [1:26]
```

### Explanation of the Error

The error occurs because:

1. **Incomplete SQL Statement:** SQL queries cannot start with a `WHERE` clause. The `WHERE` clause must follow a `SELECT` statement that specifies which columns to retrieve and a `FROM` clause that specifies the table to query.

2. **Unexpected Character ('.') at Position 26:** The error message indicates that at character position 26, the SQL parser found an unexpected period `.`. Given the query you provided, this suggests there might be additional text or formatting in your actual query that's not shown here.

### How to Fix the Error

To resolve the error, you need to:

1. **Begin the Query with `SELECT` and `FROM`:** Include the necessary `SELECT` and `FROM` clauses before the `WHERE` clause.

2. **Check for Unintended Characters:** Ensure there are no unintended characters, such as extra periods or special symbols, in your query.

### Corrected Query Example

If you're trying to select data from the `users` table for users created in 2021, your query should look like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31';
```

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Include the `SELECT` Clause:**

   Specify the columns you want to retrieve. If you want all columns:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   ```

   Or specify specific columns:

   ```sql
   SELECT id, creation_date
   ```

2. **Include the `FROM` Clause:**

   Specify the table you're querying:

   ```sql
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
   ```

3. **Use the `WHERE` Clause:**

   Filter the records based on your condition:

   ```sql
   WHERE creation_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
   ```

4. **Check for Unintended Characters:**

   Ensure there are no extra periods `.` or other characters in your query. Sometimes, copying and pasting code can introduce hidden characters.

### Complete Query Example

Here's the full query combining all the above:

```sql
SELECT id, creation_date
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

### Additional Tips

- **Check for Hidden Characters:**

  If you're copying code from a document or a website, there might be hidden characters. Try typing out the query manually to ensure it's clean.

- **Use Backticks for Table Names:**

  In BigQuery, it's a good practice to enclose table identifiers within backticks, especially if they contain special characters or are fully qualified.

- **Verify Table Exists and Is Accessible:**

  Ensure that you have access to the table `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users` and that it's correctly spelled.

### Testing the Query

Try running the corrected query in your BigQuery console to see if it resolves the error. If you continue to encounter issues, please provide the full query you're using so I can help pinpoint the problem more precisely.

### Example of Potential Unintended Characters

Given the error message:

```
Syntax error: Expected end of input but got "." at [1:26]
```

This suggests that at position 26 in your query, there's an unexpected period `.`.

- **Position 26:** In the string `WHERE creation_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'`, position 26 is the character `'` in `'2021-01-01'`. This indicates that the actual query you're running might differ from what you've provided.

- **Possible Issue:** You might have mistakenly included a period in the date string or elsewhere in the query.

### Double-Check Your Query

Please double-check your actual query for any typos or unintended periods. For instance:

```sql
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN '2021.01.01' AND '2021.12.31'
```

In this example, the dates have periods instead of hyphens, which would cause a syntax error.

### Conclusion

Ensure your SQL queries follow the correct syntax, starting with `SELECT` and including `FROM` before the `WHERE` clause. Double-check for any unintended characters or typos that might cause syntax errors.

If you need further assistance or if the issue persists, feel free to share the complete query you're using (excluding any sensitive information), and I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot it.

    ORDER BY month
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

These queries are designed to help understand and compute the monthly statistics for new StackOverflow users created in 2021, as per your task description. Each query starts with a `SELECT` statement and includes necessary `FROM` and `WHERE` clauses to be valid SQL queries.

**Note:** In SQL, and specifically in BigQuery, you cannot execute a `WHERE` clause on its own. A `WHERE` clause must be part of a complete SQL statement that includes at least a `SELECT` and a `FROM` clause. Executing a standalone `WHERE` clause will result in a syntax error, as you've experienced.

**Example of Correct Query Structure:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM `database.schema.table`
WHERE condition;
```

**Incorrect Query Structure:**

```sql
WHERE condition;  -- This will produce a syntax error.
```

This query selects specific columns from both the `posts_questions` and `users` tables, properly aliasing columns to avoid name conflicts and ensure clarity. It also ensures that only users created in 2021 are considered.

- **Issue Addressed:** By specifying the columns explicitly and using table aliases, we prevent columns from being overwritten due to identical names from both tables. This can help resolve the issue of empty values appearing in some columns.
- **Additional Condition:** Added a condition to the `WHERE` clause to filter users created between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021, aligning with your analysis period.

<li>Download in local working folder a csv file, identified by its own name among the many in an online repository (a OneDrive folder), for which I have the corresponding URL (for the OneDrive folder, not directly the file).</li>

<p>I'm having some issues with the identification and download of the csv files.
I've seen some approaches using 'request' module but they were more related to downloading directly a file corresponding to a given URL, not looking for it and taking it from an online repository. For this reason I'm not even sure about how to start here.
What I'm looking for is something like:</p>

2025-01-27 13:27:10 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering a syntax error due to an unclosed string literal in your SQL query.

---

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:66]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:66]
```

**Explanation:**

The error indicates that on line 3, character 66, there is an unclosed string literal. In your query, the string `'2021-12-31 23:59:59`' is not properly closed because of a mismatched quote.

Here's your query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59`
```

**Issue:**

- **Mismatched Quote:** The closing quote for the timestamp `'2021-12-31 23:59:59\`` is a backtick (\`) instead of a single quote ('). This causes the string literal to be unclosed.
- **Missing Semicolon (Optional):** While BigQuery doesn't require a semicolon at the end, including it is good practice.

**Correction:**

Replace the backtick with a single quote to properly close the string literal.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59'
```

**Or, with a semicolon:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59';
```

**Explanation of the Correction:**

- **Proper Quotation:** Ensure that all string and timestamp literals are enclosed with single quotes `'...'`.
- **Use Backticks for Identifiers Only:** Backticks \`...\` are used to enclose database and table identifiers, not string literals.

**Final Query Ready to Run:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59';
```

---

**Additional Tips:**

- **Consistent Quotation Marks:** Always use matching quotation marks for strings and timestamps. In SQL, single quotes `'...'` are standard for string literals.
- **Avoid Mixing Quotes:** Do not mix backticks and single quotes. Backticks are for identifiers (like table or column names); single quotes are for string values.
- **Semicolon Usage:** While BigQuery allows queries without a semicolon, adding it at the end can prevent issues if you run multiple queries together.

**If You Continue to Have Issues:**

- Double-check your query for any other mismatched quotes or typos.
- Ensure there are no hidden characters or formatting issues, especially if copying and pasting the query.
- Run the query incrementally to isolate any other potential errors.

---

By correcting the quotation mark, your query should run successfully and return the total number of new users created in 2021.

2025-01-27 13:27:44 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering the same syntax error due to an unclosed string literal in your SQL query.

---

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:66]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:66]
```

**Explanation:**

The error indicates that there's an unclosed string literal at character position 66 on line 3 of your query. Specifically, the closing quote for the timestamp `'2021-12-31 23:59:59`' is incorrect.

**Your Current Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59`
```

**Issue:**

- **Mismatched Quote:** The closing quote for `'2021-12-31 23:59:59`' is a backtick (\`) instead of a single quote (').

**Correction:**

Replace the backtick at the end of `'2021-12-31 23:59:59\`` with a single quote `'` to properly close the string literal.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59';
```

---

### **Details and Steps to Resolve the Error**

1. **Identify the Error Location:**

   - The error message points to character position **[3:66]**, which refers to line 3, character 66.
   - In your query, line 3 is:
     ```sql
     WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59`
     ```
   - Counting characters, the issue is at the backtick after `'2021-12-31 23:59:59\``

2. **Understand the Use of Quotes:**

   - **Single Quotes `'...'`:** Used for string and timestamp literals in SQL.
   - **Backticks \`...\`:** Used to enclose identifiers like table names, column names, or databases that might conflict with SQL keywords or contain special characters.

3. **Make the Correction:**

   - Replace the backtick with a single quote to properly close the timestamp literal.
   - Also, add a semicolon at the end of the statement (optional but recommended).

**Final Corrected Query (Copy and Paste This):**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59';
```

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Check for Other Typos:**

  - Ensure there are no other mismatched quotes or typos in your query.
  - Be careful when typing quotes; it's easy to accidentally use similar but incorrect characters.

- **Copy-Paste Issues:**

  - When copying the query from a document or webpage, invisible characters or formatting might cause issues.
  - It's a good practice to type the quotes manually in your SQL editor to ensure they are correct.

- **SQL Editors and IDEs:**

  - If you're using an SQL editor or IDE, syntax highlighting can help you spot unmatched quotes or other syntax errors.
  - The editor might highlight strings differently when quotes are properly closed.

- **Test the Query Incrementally:**

  - If issues persist, test your query in smaller parts to isolate the problem.
  - For example, you can first run:
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
    LIMIT 1;
    ```
  - Then add the `WHERE` clause back in.

---

### **Explanation of the Corrected Query**

- **SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users:**

  - Counts all the users in the result set and labels the count as `total_new_users`.

- **FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`:**

  - Specifies the table from which to retrieve data.

- **WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59':**

  - Filters the records to include only those where `creation_date` falls within the specified date and time range.
  - Note that both dates are properly enclosed in single quotes.

---

### **Summary**

- **Issue:** An unclosed string literal due to a mismatched quote in your SQL query.
- **Solution:** Replace the incorrect backtick with a single quote to close the string literal properly.
- **Corrected Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
  WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59';
  ```

---

### **If You Continue to Experience Issues**

- **Ensure Quotes Are Correct:**

  - Manually retype the quotes in your SQL editor to ensure they are standard single quotes.

- **Check for Hidden Characters:**

  - Sometimes, copying text from certain sources introduces hidden characters that cause syntax errors.
  - Typing the query manually can help avoid this.

- **Verify the Data Types:**

  - Ensure that the `creation_date` column is of type `TIMESTAMP` or compatible with the `TIMESTAMP` literals you're using.
  - If it's of type `DATE`, you can adjust your query accordingly:
    ```sql
    WHERE DATE(creation_date) BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31';
    ```

- **Consult Documentation:**

  - For more information on BigQuery SQL syntax, refer to the [BigQuery Standard SQL Reference](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/lexical).

2025-01-27 13:28:06 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering the same syntax error due to an unclosed string literal in your SQL query.

---

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:66]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [3:66]
```

**Explanation:**

The error indicates that there's an **unclosed string literal** at **line 3, character 66** in your query. Specifically, in your `WHERE` clause, the closing quote for the timestamp `'2021-12-31 23:59:59`' is incorrect.

**Your Current Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59`
```

**Issue:**

- **Mismatched Quotation Marks:** The string `'2021-12-31 23:59:59\`` is not properly closed with a single quote `'`. Instead, it ends with a **backtick** \` character.
- SQL uses **single quotes `' '`** to enclose string and timestamp literals. Backticks \` \` are used to enclose identifiers like database names, table names, or column names.

**How to Fix It:**

Replace the backtick (\`) at the end of `'2021-12-31 23:59:59\`` with a single quote `'` to properly close the string.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59';
```

**Explanation of the Correction:**

- **Use Single Quotes for Strings:** Ensure that the timestamp literals are enclosed in single quotes `' '`.
- **Properly Close the String Literal:** Replace the incorrect backtick with a closing single quote to match the opening single quote.

---

**Tips to Avoid This Error:**

1. **Check All Quotes:**

   - **Opening and Closing Quotes:** Ensure that every opening quote `'` has a corresponding closing quote `'`.
   - **Consistent Quote Types:** Use single quotes `' '` for string literals, and backticks \` \` for identifiers.

2. **Copy and Paste Carefully:**

   - When copying queries, invisible characters or formatting issues might introduce errors.
   - Manually retype the quotes if necessary to ensure they are correct.

3. **Use Query Editors with Syntax Highlighting:**

   - Tools like the BigQuery editor highlight strings and identifiers differently, which can help detect mismatched quotes.

4. **Test Incrementally:**

   - Run parts of your query to ensure each section works before combining them.

---

**Final Corrected Query (Ready to Use):**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59';
```

---

**Additional Notes:**

- **Double-Check Your Query:**

  - Ensure there are no other typos or mismatched quotes.

- **Understanding the Use of Quotes:**

  - **Single Quotes `' '`:** Used for string and timestamp literals.
  - **Backticks \` \`:** Used for identifiers (e.g., database names, table names).

- **Run the Query:**

  - Copy the corrected query above and execute it in your BigQuery console.

---

**If the Issue Persists:**

- **Ensure Correct Data Types:**

  - Verify that `creation_date` is of type `TIMESTAMP`. If it's a different type, you may need to adjust your query.

- **Alternative Approach Using DATE():**

  - If `creation_date` is a date without a time component, you can cast the timestamps to dates:

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
    WHERE DATE(creation_date) BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31';
    ```

- **Check for Hidden Characters:**

  - Sometimes, copying from certain tools or documents introduces hidden characters. Typing the query manually can help.

---

**Summary:**

- **Issue:** Unclosed string literal due to mismatched quotation marks.
- **Solution:** Replace the incorrect backtick with a single quote in your timestamp string.
- **Action:** Use the corrected query provided above.

2025-01-27 13:29:04 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of `'YEAR_MONTH'` in the `EXTRACT` function. In BigQuery Standard SQL, `'YEAR_MONTH'` is not a valid date part name for the `EXTRACT` function.

---

**Error Message:**

```
400 A valid date part name is required but found YEAR_MONTH at [4:18]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: A valid date part name is required but found YEAR_MONTH at [4:18]
```

**Explanation:**

In BigQuery, the `EXTRACT` function supports individual date parts such as `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `DATE`, etc. Combining date parts like `YEAR_MONTH` is not allowed directly in the `EXTRACT` function.

**Solution:**

To fix this error, modify your query to extract the year and month separately or use the `TIMESTAMP_TRUNC` function to truncate the timestamp to the month level. Here’s the corrected query using `TIMESTAMP_TRUNC` and `FORMAT_TIMESTAMP`:

---

```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%B %Y', month_start) AS Month,
  total_new_users
FROM (
  SELECT
    TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(creation_date, MONTH) AS month_start,
    COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
  WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59'
  GROUP BY month_start
)
ORDER BY month_start
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(creation_date, MONTH) AS month_start:** This function truncates the `creation_date` to the first day of the month, effectively grouping all dates within the same month together.

- **FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%B %Y', month_start) AS Month:** This formats the truncated timestamp into a string like `'January 2021'` for easy reading.

- **GROUP BY month_start:** Groups the counts by each month.

- **ORDER BY month_start:** Ensures the results are ordered chronologically by month.

---

**Alternative Solution:**

If you prefer to extract the year and month separately and then combine them, you can modify your query as follows:

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(FORMAT_DATE('%B', DATE(creation_date)), ' ', EXTRACT(YEAR FROM creation_date)) AS Month,
  COUNT(*) AS total_new_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
WHERE creation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01' AND TIMESTAMP '2021-12-31 23:59:59'
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY PARSE_DATE('%B %Y', Month)
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:** The alternative solution may require additional parsing for correct chronological ordering due to the string manipulation.

---

**Summary:**

- The `EXTRACT` function does not support combined date parts like `'YEAR_MONTH'`. Only individual parts like `YEAR` or `MONTH` are valid.

- Use `TIMESTAMP_TRUNC` to truncate the timestamp to the desired date part (e.g., month).

- Use `FORMAT_TIMESTAMP` to format the timestamp into a readable string.

---

By updating your query as shown, you should be able to run it successfully and obtain the monthly statistics for new StackOverflow users created in 2021.

69831680,Python - How to download a file with given name from online repository (given its URL),"<p>I currently have a main python script which is working by analyzing a given csv file present in its own local working folder. With the aim of automatizing the process of analyzing more than one csv file, I'm currently trying to build another script which is performing the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download in local working folder a csv file, identified by its own name among the many in an online repository (a OneDrive folder), for which I have the corresponding URL (for the OneDrive folder, not directly the file).</li>
<li>Run the main script and analyze it.</li>
<li>Remove the analyzed csv file from local folder and repeat the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm having some issues with the identification and download of the csv files.
I've seen some approaches using 'request' module but they were more related to downloading directly a file corresponding to a given URL, not looking for it and taking it from an online repository. For this reason I'm not even sure about how to start here.
What I'm looking for is something like:</p>
<pre><code>url = 'https://1drv.ms/xxxxxxxxx'
file_name = 'title.csv'
# -&gt; Download(link = url, file = file_name)
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in advance to anyone who'll take some time to read this! :)</p>",,0,5,,2021-11-03 21:02:22.417000+00:00,,2021-11-04 18:08:03.913000+00:00,2021-11-04 18:08:03.913000+00:00,,17322459.0,,17322459,,1,0,python|url|download,54,17322459,Macs,,,2021-11-03 20:38:54.747000+00:00,2022-04-17 13:45:55.983000+00:00,,1,0,0,9,https://i.stack.imgur.com/D4Bot.jpg,

Task: What are the monthly statistics for new StackOverflow users created in 2021, including the percentage of new users who asked questions and the percentage of those who asked questions and then answered questions within their first 30 days?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Month,Total_new_users,Percentage_asked_questions,Percentage_asked_and_answered_within_30_days
January 2021,total_users1:int,percent_asked1:0<=float<=100,percent_answered_in_30_days1:0<=float<=100
February 2021,total_users2:int,percent_asked2:0<=float<=100,percent_answered_in_30_days2:0<=float<=100
March 2021,total_users3:int,percent_asked3:0<=float<=100,percent_answered_in_30_days3:0<=float<=100
April 2021,total_users4:int,percent_asked4:0<=float<=100,percent_answered_in_30_days4:0<=float<=100
May 2021,total_users5:int,percent_asked5:0<=float<=100,percent_answered_in_30_days5:0<=float<=100
June 2021,total_users6:int,percent_asked6:0<=float<=100,percent_answered_in_30_days6:0<=float<=100
July 2021,total_users7:int,percent_asked7:0<=float<=100,percent_answered_in_30_days7:0<=float<=100
August 2021,total_users8:int,percent_asked8:0<=float<=100,percent_answered_in_30_days8:0<=float<=100
September 2021,total_users9:int,percent_asked9:0<=float<=100,percent_answered_in_30_days9:0<=float<=100
October 2021,total_users10:int,percent_asked10:0<=float<=100,percent_answered_in_30_days10:0<=float<=100
November 2021,total_users11:int,percent_asked11:0<=float<=100,percent_answered_in_30_days11:0<=float<=100
December 2021,total_users12:int,percent_asked12:0<=float<=100,percent_answered_in_30_days12:0<=float<=100
```

This table provides the monthly statistics for new StackOverflow users created in 2021. For each month, it includes:
- **Total_new_users**: The total number of new users registered (integer).
- **Percentage_asked_questions**: The percentage of new users who asked at least one question (float between 0 and 100).
- **Percentage_asked_and_answered_within_30_days**: The percentage of new users who asked a question and then answered a question within their first 30 days (float between 0 and 100)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'stackoverflow': ['badges', 'comments', 'post_history', 'post_links', 'posts_answers', 'posts_moderator_nomination', 'posts_orphaned_tag_wiki', 'posts_privilege_wiki', 'posts_questions', 'posts_tag_wiki', 'posts_tag_wiki_excerpt', 'posts_wiki_placeholder', 'stackoverflow_posts', 'tags', 'users', 'votes']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 14:14:14 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the monthly statistics for new StackOverflow users created in 2021, including the percentage of new users who asked questions and the percentage of those who asked questions and then answered questions within their first 30 days?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

This table provides the monthly statistics for new StackOverflow users created in 2021. For each month, it includes:
- **Total_new_users**: The total number of new users registered (integer).
- **Percentage_asked_questions**: The percentage of new users who asked at least one question (float between 0 and 100).
- **Percentage_asked_and_answered_within_30_days**: The percentage of new users who asked a question and then answered a question within their first 30 days (float between 0 and 100). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
