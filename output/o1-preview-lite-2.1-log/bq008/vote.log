After carefully comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for the task. Here's the reasoning:

---

**1. Duration Calculation:**

- **`0result.sql`**:

  - The duration between consecutive page hits is calculated in **seconds** by dividing the time difference by 1000:
    ```sql
    ((LEAD(h.time) OVER (PARTITION BY s.fullVisitorId, s.visitId ORDER BY h.hitNumber) - h.time)/1000) AS duration_seconds
    ```
  - This ensures that the `Maximum_duration_seconds` output is in **seconds**, which aligns with the task requirement.

- **`1result.sql`**:

  - The duration is calculated without converting milliseconds to seconds:
    ```sql
    LEAD(h.time) OVER (PARTITION BY t.fullVisitorId, t.visitId ORDER BY h.hitNumber) - h.time AS duration
    ```
  - As a result, the `Maximum_duration_seconds` output is in **milliseconds**, not seconds, which does not meet the requirement.

**2. Output Values:**

- **`0result.sql`**:

  - Outputs `Maximum_duration_seconds` as **2450.761** seconds (approximately 40 minutes and 50 seconds), which is a reasonable duration for a page visit.

- **`1result.sql`**:

  - Outputs `Maximum_duration_seconds` as **2450761**, which suggests a duration of over **680 hours** if interpreted as seconds. This indicates that the value is actually in milliseconds.

**3. Alignment with Task Requirements:**

- **`0result.sql`** accurately computes:

  - The **most common next page** after visitors access pages starting with '/home' from the "Data Share" campaign, which is `/home`.
  
  - The **maximum duration time in seconds** spent on the '/home' page.

- **`1result.sql`** correctly identifies the most common next page but fails to convert the duration to seconds, resulting in an incorrect unit for `Maximum_duration_seconds`.

---

**Therefore, `0result.sql` is the correct SQL query because it correctly calculates the maximum duration in seconds as required by the task.**
