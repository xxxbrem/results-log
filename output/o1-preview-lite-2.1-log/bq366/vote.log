After reviewing both SQL queries and their corresponding results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that accurately fulfills the task's requirements.

**Reason:**

- **Global Label Filter:** `1result.sql` first identifies labels that are linked to **50 or more artworks in total across all periods**. This is achieved using the `labels_over_50` common table expression (CTE), which ensures only labels meeting this criterion are considered in subsequent calculations.

- **Top Three Labels per Period:** The query then calculates the number of artworks associated with each of these labels within each period. It ranks the labels for each period based on their counts and selects the **top three labels per period**. This is done in the `ranked_labels` CTE using the `ROW_NUMBER()` function partitioned by `period`.

- **Alignment with Task Requirements:** This approach aligns perfectly with the task, which is to find the top three most frequently associated labels with artworks from each historical period, **only considering labels linked to 50 or more artworks** (in total, not within each period).

In contrast, **`0result.sql`** filters labels based on the count of artworks **within each period** (using `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 50` after grouping by `o.period` and `label.description`). This means it only considers labels that are linked to 50 or more artworks **in that specific period**, which does not align with the task's requirement to consider labels linked to 50 or more artworks **in total**.

Therefore, the correct SQL file that meets the task's requirements is:

1result.sql
