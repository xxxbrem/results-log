Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`

  **Columns:**
  - `start_station_id`: ID of the station where the trip started; **Potential Usage:** Identify trips starting at each station.
  - `end_station_id`: ID of the station where the trip ended; **Potential Usage:** Check if the trip ended at the same station.
  - `tripduration`: Duration of the trip in seconds; **Potential Usage:** Determine if the trip was within 2 minutes (<= 120 seconds).
  - `starttime`: Start time of the trip; **Potential Usage:** Analyze trip times if needed.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `start_station_id = end_station_id`: To find trips that start and end at the same station.
- `tripduration <= 120`: To find trips with a duration of 2 minutes or less (group rides).
- Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`) and calculations to compute proportions.

ORDER BY proportion DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

These queries progressively explore the data from basic retrieval to calculating the proportion of group rides per station, ultimately identifying the top 10 stations with the highest proportion of group rides.Query:
-- 1. Retrieve basic trip data
SELECT `start_station_id`, `end_station_id`, `tripduration`, `starttime`, `stoptime`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
LIMIT 100
Answer:

Task: Can you list the top 10 station id with the highest proportion of group rides? The group rides are trips that start and end at the same station within a 2-minute window.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the top 10 station IDs with the highest proportion of group rides, we calculate the proportion of group rides for each station. A group ride is defined as a trip that starts and ends at the same station within a 2-minute window. The proportion is the number of group rides divided by the total number of trips starting at that station.

```csv
station_id,proportion
station_id1:int,proportion1:float<1
station_id2:int,proportion2:float<1
station_id3:int,proportion3:float<1
station_id4:int,proportion4:float<1

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'new_york': ['311_service_requests', 'citibike_stations', 'citibike_trips', 'nypd_mv_collisions', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2015', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2016', 'tlc_green_trips_2013', 'tlc_green_trips_2014', 'tlc_green_trips_2015', 'tlc_green_trips_2016', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2009', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2010', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2011', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2012', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2013', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2014', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2015', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2016', 'tree_census_1995', 'tree_census_2005', 'tree_census_2015', 'tree_species']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 21:31:17 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you list the top 10 station id with the highest proportion of group rides? The group rides are trips that start and end at the same station within a 2-minute window., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
