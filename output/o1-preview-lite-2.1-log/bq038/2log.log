Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve this task, we'll utilize the `citibike_trips` table from the `bigquery-public-data.new_york` dataset. Below are the relevant columns and their potential usage:

- `start_station_id`: Identifies the starting station of the trip.
- `end_station_id`: Identifies the ending station of the trip.
- `tripduration`: Duration of the trip in seconds.
- `starttime`: Start time of the trip.
- `stoptime`: End time of the trip.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Group Rides Condition:**
  - Trips where `start_station_id = end_station_id`.
  - Trips with `tripduration <= 120` seconds (2 minutes).

---

Below are 10 SQL queries ranging from simple to complex to help understand the data and solve the task.

1. **Retrieve a sample of trips:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the total number of trips per starting station:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     start_station_id,
     COUNT(*) AS total_trips
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
   GROUP BY start_station_id
   ORDER BY total_trips DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find trips where the start and end stations are the same:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
   WHERE start_station_id = end_station_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count trips where start and end stations are the same per station:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     start_station_id,
     COUNT(*) AS same_station_trips
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
   WHERE start_station_id = end_station_id
   GROUP BY start_station_id
   ORDER BY same_station_trips DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find trips with a duration of 2 minutes or less:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
   WHERE tripduration <= 120
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find trips that are potential group rides (start and end at the same station within 2 minutes):**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
   WHERE start_station_id = end_station_id AND tripduration <= 120
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count potential group rides per starting station:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     start_station_id,
     COUNT(*) AS group_ride_trips
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
   WHERE start_station_id = end_station_id AND tripduration <= 120
   GROUP BY start_station_id
   ORDER BY group_ride_trips DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate the total trips and group rides per station:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     total_trips.start_station_id,
     total_trips.total_trips,
     group_rides.group_ride_trips
   FROM (
     SELECT
       start_station_id,
       COUNT(*) AS total_trips
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
     GROUP BY start_station_id
   ) AS total_trips
   LEFT JOIN (
     SELECT
       start_station_id,
       COUNT(*) AS group_ride_trips
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
     WHERE start_station_id = end_station_id AND tripduration <= 120
     GROUP BY start_station_id
   ) AS group_rides
   ON total_trips.start_station_id = group_rides.start_station_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate the proportion of group rides per station:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     total_trips.start_station_id,
     group_rides.group_ride_trips,
     total_trips.total_trips,
     SAFE_DIVIDE(group_rides.group_ride_trips, total_trips.total_trips) AS proportion
   FROM (
     SELECT
       start_station_id,
       COUNT(*) AS total_trips
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
     GROUP BY start_station_id
   ) AS total_trips
   LEFT JOIN (
     SELECT
       start_station_id,
       COUNT(*) AS group_ride_trips
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
     WHERE start_station_id = end_station_id AND tripduration <= 120
     GROUP BY start_station_id
   ) AS group_rides
   ON total_trips.start_station_id = group_rides.start_station_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List the top 10 station IDs with the highest proportion of group rides:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      total_trips.start_station_id,
      group_rides.group_ride_trips,
      total_trips.total_trips,
      SAFE_DIVIDE(group_rides.group_ride_trips, total_trips.total_trips) AS proportion
    FROM (
      SELECT
        start_station_id,
        COUNT(*) AS total_trips
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
      GROUP BY start_station_id
    ) AS total_trips
    LEFT JOIN (
      SELECT
        start_station_id,
        COUNT(*) AS group_ride_trips
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
      WHERE start_station_id = end_station_id AND tripduration <= 120
      GROUP BY start_station_id
    ) AS group_rides
    ON total_trips.start_station_id = group_rides.start_station_id
    ORDER BY proportion DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

Task: Can you list the top 10 station id with the highest proportion of group rides? The group rides are trips that start and end at the same station within a 2-minute window.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the top 10 station IDs with the highest proportion of group rides, we calculate the proportion of group rides for each station. A group ride is defined as a trip that starts and ends at the same station within a 2-minute window. The proportion is the number of group rides divided by the total number of trips starting at that station.

```csv
station_id,proportion

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'new_york': ['311_service_requests', 'citibike_stations', 'citibike_trips', 'nypd_mv_collisions', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2015', 'tlc_fhv_trips_2016', 'tlc_green_trips_2013', 'tlc_green_trips_2014', 'tlc_green_trips_2015', 'tlc_green_trips_2016', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2009', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2010', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2011', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2012', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2013', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2014', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2015', 'tlc_yellow_trips_2016', 'tree_census_1995', 'tree_census_2005', 'tree_census_2015', 'tree_species']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

The group rides are trips that start and end at the same station within a 2-minute window., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
