Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `model`

  - **`L1_model`**: Represents the model category, either `"regression"` or `"tree"`. **Potential usage**: Primary column of interest to determine which model category appears most frequently.
  - **`step`**: Indicates the modeling step (`1`, `2`, or `3`). **Potential usage**: Used to distinguish between traditional models and the Stack model.
    - **Condition**: Traditional models may correspond to `step IN (1, 2)`, while the Stack model corresponds to `step = 3`.
  - **`name`**: Identifies the model name. **Potential usage**: Used for grouping or filtering models.
  - **`version`**: Model version number. **Potential usage**: Differentiates between different iterations of models.
  
- **Possible Conditions:**

  - Filter models by `step` to compare traditional models versus the Stack model.
  - Group models by `L1_model` to count occurrences.
  - Use `version` to analyze model category frequencies across different versions.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all distinct model categories (`L1_model`).**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "L1_model"
   FROM "model"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count the total occurrences of each `L1_model` category across all steps and versions.**
   ```sql
   SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS Total_Count
   FROM "model"
   GROUP BY "L1_model"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get the count of each `L1_model` category for traditional models (`step` 1 and 2).**
   ```sql
   SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS Traditional_Count
   FROM "model"
   WHERE "step" IN (1, 2)
   GROUP BY "L1_model"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get the count of each `L1_model` category for the Stack model (`step` 3).**
   ```sql
   SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS Stack_Count
   FROM "model"
   WHERE "step" = 3
   GROUP BY "L1_model"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **View the distribution of `L1_model` categories across all steps.**
   ```sql
   SELECT "step", "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS Count
   FROM "model"
   GROUP BY "step", "L1_model"
   ORDER BY "step", Count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List all models with their names, versions, steps, and `L1_model` categories.**
   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "step", "L1_model"
   FROM "model"
   ORDER BY "name", "version", "step"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find the total number of models for each `step` and `L1_model` category.**
   ```sql
   SELECT "L1_model", "step", COUNT(*) AS Model_Count
   FROM "model"
   GROUP BY "L1_model", "step"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Identify versions with the highest number of models for each `L1_model` category.**
   ```sql
   SELECT "version", "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS Model_Count
   FROM "model"
   GROUP BY "version", "L1_model"
   ORDER BY Model_Count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List the counts of `L1_model` categories for each version.**
   ```sql
   SELECT "version", "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS Count
   FROM "model"
   GROUP BY "version", "L1_model"
   ORDER BY "version", Count DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Determine the most frequent `L1_model` category across all steps and versions.**
    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS Total_Count
    FROM "model"
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    ORDER BY Total_Count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Compare the counts of `L1_model` categories between traditional models and the Stack model.**
    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model",
           SUM(CASE WHEN "step" IN (1, 2) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Traditional_Count,
           SUM(CASE WHEN "step" = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Stack_Count,
           COUNT(*) AS Total_Count
    FROM "model"
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Find the `L1_model` category with the maximum total count.**
    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS Total_Count
    FROM "model"
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    ORDER BY Total_Count DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

13. **Count the number of unique model names for each `L1_model` category.**
    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(DISTINCT "name") AS Unique_Model_Names
    FROM "model"
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List the models where `L1_model` is 'regression' and step is for traditional models.**
    ```sql
    SELECT "name", "version", "step"
    FROM "model"
    WHERE "L1_model" = 'regression' AND "step" IN (1, 2)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **List the models where `L1_model` is 'tree' and step corresponds to the Stack model.**
    ```sql
    SELECT "name", "version", "step"
    FROM "model"
    WHERE "L1_model" = 'tree' AND "step" = 3
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These SQL queries help analyze the `model` table to determine which `L1_model` category appears most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model. By exploring the data with these queries, we can gain insights into the distribution and frequency of model categories in different modeling steps.Query:

Task: Which model category (L1_model) appears the most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, and what is the total count of its occurrences?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
L1_model,Total_count
model_category:str,count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The model category (`L1_model`) that appears the most frequently across all steps and versions is represented as `model_category:str`, with a total count of `count:int` occurrences..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 09:46:06 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which model category (L1_model) appears the most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, and what is the total count of its occurrences?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
L1_model,Total_count
model_category:str,count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The model category (`L1_model`) that appears the most frequently across all steps and versions is represented as `model_category:str`, with a total count of `count:int` occurrences. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
