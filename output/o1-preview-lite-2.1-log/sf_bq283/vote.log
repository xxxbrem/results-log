After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer for the task. Here is the reasoning:

**Comparison of SQL Queries:**

1. **`0result.sql`**:

   - **Syntax**: Uses `COUNT(t."trip_id")` to count total trips.
   - **Schema and Table Referencing**: References tables without enclosing schema and table names in double quotes.
   - **Column Referencing**: Encloses column names in double quotes.
   - **Calculation of Total Trips from Active Stations**: Uses a subquery within the `ROUND` function to calculate the total number of trips from active stations.
   - **Order and Limit**: Orders the results by `"Total_Trips"` in descending order and limits to 15.

2. **`1result.sql`**:

   - **Syntax**: Uses `COUNT(*)` to count total trips, which is appropriate since we're counting rows regardless of nulls in any specific column.
   - **Schema and Table Referencing**: Fully qualifies schema, table, and column names, and encloses them in double quotes (e.g., `"AUSTIN"."AUSTIN_BIKESHARE"."BIKESHARE_TRIPS"`), following the conventions specified in the observations.
   - **Column Referencing**: Consistently encloses all column names in double quotes.
   - **Calculation of Total Trips from Active Stations**: Similar to `0result.sql`, uses a subquery within the `ROUND` function to calculate the total number of trips from active stations.
   - **Order and Limit**: Orders the results by `"Total_Trips"` in descending order and limits to 15.

3. **`2result.sql`**:

   - **Syntax**: Uses a `CROSS JOIN` with a subquery to get the total number of trips from active stations.
   - **Schema and Table Referencing**: Does not fully qualify the schema and table names with double quotes, which might lead to ambiguity or errors if the default schema is not set correctly.
   - **Column Referencing**: Encloses column names in double quotes.
   - **Calculation of Total Trips from Active Stations**: Uses a `CROSS JOIN` subquery, which can be less efficient than using a scalar subquery in the `SELECT` clause or within the `ROUND` function.
   - **Order and Limit**: Orders the results by `COUNT(*)` and limits to 15.

**Reasons for Choosing `1result.sql` as the Correct Answer:**

- **Adherence to Conventions**: `1result.sql` follows the conventions specified in the observations, such as fully qualifying schema and table names with double quotes. This ensures clarity and avoids potential conflicts with default schemas or reserved keywords.
- **Consistency**: It consistently encloses all table and column names in double quotes, which aligns with the SQL standards and the observed practices in the database.
- **Simplicity and Efficiency**: By using `COUNT(*)`, the query counts all rows, which is sufficient since we are interested in the total number of trips per station. It avoids unnecessary specification of columns when counting rows.
- **Accuracy**: The results produced match the task requirements precisely, providing the station ID, total trips, percentage of total trips from active stations, and average duration.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above analysis, **`1result.sql`** is the most appropriate and accurate query to fulfill the task requirements.
