Begin Exploring Related Columns
First, consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task.

**Tables and Columns:**

- **AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS**
  - `"start_station_id"`: Identifies the station where each trip starts; used to count trips per station.
  - `"duration_minutes"`: Duration of each trip; used to calculate the average duration of trips starting from each station.

- **AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS**
  - `"station_id"`: Unique identifier for each station; used to join with `"start_station_id"` from the trips table.
  - `"status"`: Indicates whether a station is active; used to filter for active stations.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter trips to include only those starting from stations where `"status"` = 'Active'.
- Group data by `"start_station_id"` to aggregate trip counts and average durations.
- Calculate the percentage of trips from each station out of the total trips from active stations.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Query to list all station statuses:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "status"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Query to get a list of active stations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "station_id", "name", "status"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS
   WHERE "status" = 'Active'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Query to count total trips in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "total_trips"

   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Query to find the number of trips starting from each station:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "start_station_id", COUNT(*) AS "trip_count"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
   GROUP BY "start_station_id"
   ORDER BY "trip_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;

Task: Identify the top 15 active stations based on the number of trip starts. For each of these stations, provide the station ID, the total number of trips that start there, the percentage this represents out of all trips from active stations, and the average duration of trips starting from the station.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv

(Attention: answer in 15 rows)
```

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the top 15 active stations based on the number of trip starts. Each row represents a station with the following information:

- **Station_ID**: The unique identifier of the station (integer).
- **Total_Trips**: The total number of trips that started at the station (integer).
- **Percentage_of_Total_Trips**: The percentage of trips from this station out of all trips from active stations (floating-point number between 0 and 100).
- **Average_Duration**: The average duration of trips starting from the station (floating-point number representing minutes).

This data helps identify the most frequently used stations and provides insights into trip durations and station popularity among riders..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'AUSTIN': {'AUSTIN_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'AUSTIN_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATIONS', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'AUSTIN_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'AUSTIN_INCIDENTS': ['INCIDENTS_2008', 'INCIDENTS_2009', 'INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2011', 'INCIDENTS_2016'], 'AUSTIN_WASTE': ['WASTE_AND_DIVERSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
