Begin Exploring Related Columns
To provide a detailed web sales report for each region, including the number of orders, total sales amount, and the name and sales amount of the top-selling sales representative in each region, we need to consider the relevant tables and columns that contain this information.

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

1. **web_orders**
   - `"id"`: Order ID (unique identifier for each order)
   - `"account_id"`: Links the order to an account in `web_accounts`
   - `"total_amt_usd"`: Total sales amount of the order in USD
   - `"occurred_at"`: Date and time when the order occurred (can be used for date filters)

2. **web_accounts**
   - `"id"`: Account ID (links to `web_orders.account_id`)
   - `"name"`: Name of the account
   - `"sales_rep_id"`: Links the account to a sales representative in `web_sales_reps`

3. **web_sales_reps**
   - `"id"`: Sales representative ID (links to `web_accounts.sales_rep_id`)
   - `"name"`: Name of the sales representative
   - `"region_id"`: Links the sales representative to a region in `web_region`

4. **web_region**
   - `"id"`: Region ID (links to `web_sales_reps.region_id`)
   - `"name"`: Name of the region

### Possible Conditions:
- **Joins between tables**:
  - `web_orders.account_id = web_accounts.id`
  - `web_accounts.sales_rep_id = web_sales_reps.id`
  - `web_sales_reps.region_id = web_region.id`
- **Grouping and aggregations**:
  - Group by region to get per-region summaries
  - Group by sales representative within each region to find top performers

---

### SQL Queries to Understand Values in Related Columns:

1. **List of all regions**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name" AS region_name
   FROM "web_region"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List of all sales representatives with their associated region IDs**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "id" AS sales_rep_id, "name" AS sales_rep_name, "region_id"
   FROM "web_sales_reps"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Accounts and their associated sales representative IDs**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "id" AS account_id, "name" AS account_name, "sales_rep_id"
   FROM "web_accounts"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Orders with their total amounts and account IDs**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "id" AS order_id, "account_id", "total_amt_usd"
   FROM "web_orders"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Orders joined with accounts to get account names**:

   ```sql
   SELECT o."id" AS order_id, a."name" AS account_name, o."total_amt_usd"
   FROM "web_orders" AS o
   JOIN "web_accounts" AS a ON o."account_id" = a."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Sales representatives and their regions**:

   ```sql
   SELECT s."name" AS sales_rep_name, r."name" AS region_name
   FROM "web_sales_reps" AS s
   JOIN "web_region" AS r ON s."region_id" = r."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Accounts with their sales representatives and regions**:

   ```sql
   SELECT a."name" AS account_name, s."name" AS sales_rep_name, r."name" AS region_name
   FROM "web_accounts" AS a
   JOIN "web_sales_reps" AS s ON a."sales_rep_id" = s."id"
   JOIN "web_region" AS r ON s."region_id" = r."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Orders with accounts, sales representatives, and regions**:

   ```sql
   SELECT o."id" AS order_id, o."total_amt_usd", a."name" AS account_name,
          s."name" AS sales_rep_name, r."name" AS region_name
   FROM "web_orders" AS o
   JOIN "web_accounts" AS a ON o."account_id" = a."id"
   JOIN "web_sales_reps" AS s ON a."sales_rep_id" = s."id"
   JOIN "web_region" AS r ON s."region_id" = r."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Number of orders per region**:

   ```sql
   SELECT r."name" AS region_name, COUNT(o."id") AS number_of_orders
   FROM "web_orders" AS o
   JOIN "web_accounts" AS a ON o."account_id" = a."id"
   JOIN "web_sales_reps" AS s ON a."sales_rep_id" = s."id"
   JOIN "web_region" AS r ON s."region_id" = r."id"
   GROUP BY r."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Total sales amount per region**:

    ```sql
    SELECT r."name" AS region_name, SUM(o."total_amt_usd") AS total_sales_amount
    FROM "web_orders" AS o
    JOIN "web_accounts" AS a ON o."account_id" = a."id"
    JOIN "web_sales_reps" AS s ON a."sales_rep_id" = s."id"
    JOIN "web_region" AS r ON s."region_id" = r."id"
    GROUP BY r."name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Total sales amount per sales representative**:

    ```sql
    SELECT s."name" AS sales_rep_name, SUM(o."total_amt_usd") AS sales_rep_total_sales
    FROM "web_orders" AS o
    JOIN "web_accounts" AS a ON o."account_id" = a."id"
    JOIN "web_sales_reps" AS s ON a."sales_rep_id" = s."id"
    GROUP BY s."id", s."name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Sales representatives and their total sales amounts within each region (ordered by total sales)**:

    ```sql
    SELECT r."name" AS region_name, s."name" AS sales_rep_name, SUM(o."total_amt_usd") AS total_sales_amount
    FROM "web_orders" AS o
    JOIN "web_accounts" AS a ON o."account_id" = a."id"
    JOIN "web_sales_reps" AS s ON a."sales_rep_id" = s."id"
    JOIN "web_region" AS r ON s."region_id" = r."id"
    GROUP BY r."id", s."id"
    ORDER BY r."name", total_sales_amount DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Find the top-selling sales representative in each region**:

    Since we are limited to SELECT statements without subqueries or CTEs, we'll list all sales representatives with their total sales in each region and then manually identify the top seller per region:

    ```sql
    SELECT r."name" AS region_name, s."name" AS sales_rep_name, SUM(o."total_amt_usd") AS total_sales_amount
    FROM "web_orders" AS o
    JOIN "web_accounts" AS a ON o."account_id" = a."id"
    JOIN "web_sales_reps" AS s ON a."sales_rep_id" = s."id"
    JOIN "web_region" AS r ON s."region_id" = r."id"
    GROUP BY r."id", s."id"
    ORDER BY r."name", total_sales_amount DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Detailed report combining number of orders and total sales per region**:

    ```sql
    SELECT r."name" AS region_name, COUNT(o."id") AS number_of_orders, SUM(o."total_amt_usd") AS total_sales_amount
    FROM "web_orders" AS o
    JOIN "web_accounts" AS a ON o."account_id" = a."id"
    JOIN "web_sales_reps" AS s ON a."sales_rep_id" = s."id"
    JOIN "web_region" AS r ON s."region_id" = r."id"
    GROUP BY r."id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **List of orders with their corresponding region and sales representative**:

    ```sql
    SELECT o."id" AS order_id, r."name" AS region_name, s."name" AS sales_rep_name, o."total_amt_usd"
    FROM "web_orders" AS o
    JOIN "web_accounts" AS a ON o."account_id" = a."id"
    JOIN "web_sales_reps" AS s ON a."sales_rep_id" = s."id"
    JOIN "web_region" AS r ON s."region_id" = r."id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Provide a detailed web sales report for each region, including the number of orders, total sales amount, and the name and sales amount of the top-selling sales representative in each region

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: The following table provides a detailed web sales report for each region, including the number of orders, total sales amount, and the name and sales amount of the top-selling sales representative in each region.

```csv
Region,Number_of_Orders,Total_Sales_Amount,Top_Sales_Rep_Name,Top_Sales_Rep_Sales_Amount
region1:str,num_orders1:int,total_sales1:float,top_sales_rep1:str,rep_sales1:float
region2:str,num_orders2:int,total_sales2:float,top_sales_rep2:str,rep_sales2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
