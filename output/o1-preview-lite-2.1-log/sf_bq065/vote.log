After reviewing both SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that fulfills the task requirements.

### **Reasoning:**

#### **Understanding the Task:**

- **Objective:** Provide the **most recent 10 results** of symbols and their corresponding **adjusted rates** from oracle requests with the **script ID 3**.
- **Requirements:**
  - Extract data from oracle requests where `oracle_script_id = 3`.
  - Retrieve symbols and their rates, adjusted by the multiplier.
  - Ensure results are from the most recent oracle requests.

#### **Analysis of `1result.sql`:**

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    s.value::STRING AS "Symbol",
    ROUND(
        r.value::FLOAT / TRY_TO_NUMBER(PARSE_JSON(PARSE_JSON("decoded_result")['calldata'])['multiplier']::STRING),
        4
    ) AS "Rate"
FROM
    "CRYPTO"."CRYPTO_BAND"."ORACLE_REQUESTS",
    LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => PARSE_JSON(PARSE_JSON("decoded_result")['calldata'])['symbols']) s,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => PARSE_JSON(PARSE_JSON("decoded_result")['result'])['rates']) r
WHERE
    s.seq = r.seq
    AND TRY_TO_NUMBER(PARSE_JSON("request")['oracle_script_id']::VARCHAR) = 3
ORDER BY
    TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("block_timestamp") DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 10;
```

**Result:**

```
Symbol,Rate
NXM,172.9841
NXM,6.9225
NXM,149.0798
NXM,1.0
NXM,0.9435
NXM,10.71
NXM,1.0
NXM,10.5083
NXM,0.9463
NXM,0.9996
```

**Issues Identified:**

- **Limited Symbols:** The result only shows the symbol **"NXM"** repeated multiple times.
- **Data Scope:** It appears to be pulling multiple rates for a single symbol from different timestamps rather than various symbols from the most recent data.
- **Order of Data:** While the query orders by `block_timestamp`, it may include older data due to the lack of filtering for the most recent oracle request.
- **Outcome:** Does not fulfill the requirement of providing the most recent 10 symbols and their adjusted rates.

#### **Analysis of `2result.sql`:**

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT s.VALUE::STRING AS "Symbol",
       ROUND((r.VALUE::NUMBER / t.calldata_json['multiplier']::NUMBER), 4) AS "Rate"
FROM (
  SELECT
    t.*,
    PARSE_JSON(t."decoded_result") AS dr,
    PARSE_JSON(t."request") AS req,
    PARSE_JSON(dr['calldata']) AS calldata_json,
    PARSE_JSON(dr['result']) AS result_json
  FROM "CRYPTO"."CRYPTO_BAND"."ORACLE_REQUESTS" t
  WHERE CAST(req['oracle_script_id'] AS NUMBER) = 3
  ORDER BY t."block_timestamp" DESC NULLS LAST
  LIMIT 1
) t,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t.calldata_json['symbols']) s,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t.result_json['rates']) r
WHERE s.INDEX = r.INDEX
ORDER BY s.INDEX ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Result:**

```
Symbol,Rate
HT,16.2450
MIOTA,1.7994
SNX,12.9289
COMP,510.8567
OMG,8.8200
MKR,3720.1157
KSM,402.2872
DGB,0.0711
```

**Strengths Identified:**

- **Correct Filtering:**
  - **Oracle Script ID:** Filters requests where `oracle_script_id = 3`.
  - **Most Recent Request:** The inner query uses `LIMIT 1` after sorting by `block_timestamp` in descending order, ensuring only the **most recent oracle request** is considered.
- **Data Extraction:**
  - Parses `decoded_result` and `request` columns properly to extract necessary fields.
  - Uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` to explode the arrays of symbols and rates.
  - Ensures symbols and rates are matched correctly using `s.INDEX = r.INDEX`.
- **Adjusted Rates:**
  - Calculates the adjusted rate by dividing the rate by the multiplier.
  - Rounds the adjusted rate to four decimal places for readability.
- **Result Accuracy:**
  - Returns a variety of symbols with their corresponding adjusted rates from the most recent oracle request.
  - **Symbols:** HT, MIOTA, SNX, COMP, OMG, MKR, KSM, DGB.
  - **Aligns with Task:** Provides the most recent symbols and their adjusted rates, fulfilling the task requirements.

#### **Conclusion:**

- **`2result.sql`** correctly addresses the task by:
  - Filtering for oracle requests with `oracle_script_id = 3`.
  - Retrieving data from the **most recent oracle request**.
  - Extracting symbols and their corresponding adjusted rates.
  - Providing a list of symbols, meeting the requirement of the **most recent 10 results**.

- **`1result.sql`** does not meet the task requirements effectively because:
  - It returns multiple entries for the same symbol ("NXM").
  - It does not ensure that the data is from the most recent oracle request.
  - It lacks diversity in symbols and therefore does not provide the **most recent 10 symbols**.
