2025-01-26 22:33:02 - root - INFO - Understood. Here is a simplified SQL query that should return data:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT mc2."PID") AS "Number_of_actors_with_Shahrukh_number_2"
FROM "M_Cast" mc2
JOIN "M_Cast" mc1 ON mc2."MID" = mc1."MID"
WHERE mc1."PID" IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT mc0."PID"
  FROM "M_Cast" mc0
  WHERE mc0."MID" IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
    FROM "M_Cast"
    WHERE "PID" = (
      SELECT "PID"
      FROM "Person"
      WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan'
    )
  )
  AND mc0."PID" != (
    SELECT "PID"
    FROM "Person"
    WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan'
  )
)
AND mc2."PID" NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
  FROM "M_Cast"
  WHERE "MID" IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
    FROM "M_Cast"
    WHERE "PID" = (
      SELECT "PID"
      FROM "Person"
      WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan'
    )
  )
)
AND mc2."PID" != (
  SELECT "PID"
  FROM "Person"
  WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan'
);
```

This query performs the following steps:

1. **Find Shahrukh Khan's `PID`:**
   - `SELECT "PID" FROM "Person" WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan'`

2. **Find actors who have acted directly with Shahrukh Khan (excluding Shahrukh Khan himself):**
   - They are in movies where Shahrukh Khan acted.
   - `mc0."PID"` represents these actors.

3. **Find actors who have acted with those actors (potential 'Shahrukh number' of 2):**
   - `mc2."PID"` represents these actors.
   - They acted in the same movies (`mc2."MID" = mc1."MID"`) as actors who acted with Shahrukh Khan.

4. **Exclude actors who have acted directly with Shahrukh Khan and Shahrukh Khan himself:**
   - Using the `NOT IN` clauses to exclude their `PID`s.

5. **Count the distinct actors at 'Shahrukh number' of 2:**
   - `COUNT(DISTINCT mc2."PID") AS "Number_of_actors_with_Shahrukh_number_2"`

This simplified query should return the number of actors who have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2, avoiding overly restrictive conditions that might lead to no data being found.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Consider the tables and columns relevant to the task:**

- **Table:** `"Person"`
  - **Columns:**
    - `"PID"`: Actor's unique identifier.
      - **Potential usage:** To uniquely identify actors.
    - `"Name"`: Actor's name.
      - **Potential usage:** To find Shahrukh Khan's `PID` by matching his name.

- **Table:** `"M_Cast"`
  - **Columns:**
    - `"MID"`: Movie's unique identifier.
      - **Potential usage:** To find movies in which actors have acted.
    - `"PID"`: Actor's unique identifier.
      - **Potential usage:** To link actors to movies.

- **Table:** `"Movie"`
  - **Columns:**
    - `"MID"`: Movie's unique identifier.
      - **Potential usage:** To obtain movie details if needed (e.g., titles).

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Find Shahrukh Khan's `PID` by searching for `"Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan'` in the `"Person"` table.
- Find all movies (`"MID"`) that Shahrukh Khan has acted in using the `"M_Cast"` table.
- Find all actors (`"PID"`) who have acted in those movies (these actors have a 'Shahrukh number' of 1).
- Find all movies that these actors have acted in.
- Find all actors who have acted in these movies.
- Exclude Shahrukh Khan and actors who have acted directly with him to get actors with a 'Shahrukh number' of 2.

---

**SQL Queries to explore the data:**

1. **Find the `PID` of Shahrukh Khan:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "PID", "Name"
   FROM "Person"
   WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all movies (`"MID"`) that Shahrukh Khan has acted in:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
   FROM "M_Cast"
   WHERE "PID" = 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *(Replace `'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'` with the actual `PID` obtained from query 1.)*

3. **List all actors (`"PID"`) who have acted in movies with Shahrukh Khan (including Shahrukh Khan):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
   FROM "M_Cast"
   WHERE "MID" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
     FROM "M_Cast"
     WHERE "PID" = 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List all actors who have acted with Shahrukh Khan (excluding Shahrukh Khan himself):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
   FROM "M_Cast"
   WHERE "MID" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
     FROM "M_Cast"
     WHERE "PID" = 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
   )
   AND "PID" != 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List all movies that actors who have acted with Shahrukh Khan have acted in (second-degree movies):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
   FROM "M_Cast"
   WHERE "PID" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
     FROM "M_Cast"
     WHERE "MID" IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
       FROM "M_Cast"
       WHERE "PID" = 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
     )
     AND "PID" != 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List all actors who have acted in those second-degree movies:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
   FROM "M_Cast"
   WHERE "MID" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
     FROM "M_Cast"
     WHERE "PID" IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
       FROM "M_Cast"
       WHERE "MID" IN (
         SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
         FROM "M_Cast"
         WHERE "PID" = 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
       )
       AND "PID" != 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
     )
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Exclude actors with a 'Shahrukh number' of 0 or 1 to find actors with a 'Shahrukh number' of 2:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
   FROM "M_Cast"
   WHERE "MID" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
     FROM "M_Cast"
     WHERE "PID" IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
       FROM "M_Cast"
       WHERE "MID" IN (
         SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
         FROM "M_Cast"
         WHERE "PID" = 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
       )
       AND "PID" != 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
     )
   )
   AND "PID" NOT IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
     FROM "M_Cast"
     WHERE "MID" IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
       FROM "M_Cast"
       WHERE "PID" = 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
     )
   )
   AND "PID" != 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get the names of actors with a 'Shahrukh number' of 2:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p."PID", p."Name"
   FROM "Person" p
   WHERE p."PID" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
     FROM "M_Cast"
     WHERE "MID" IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
       FROM "M_Cast"
       WHERE "PID" IN (
         SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
         FROM "M_Cast"
         WHERE "MID" IN (
           SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
           FROM "M_Cast"
           WHERE "PID" = 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
         )
         AND "PID" != 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
       )
     )
     AND "PID" NOT IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
       FROM "M_Cast"
       WHERE "MID" IN (
         SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
         FROM "M_Cast"
         WHERE "PID" = 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
       )
     )
     AND "PID" != 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List the number of actors who have acted directly with Shahrukh Khan ('Shahrukh number' of 1):**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "PID") AS "Number_of_actors_with_Shahrukh_number_1"
   FROM "M_Cast"
   WHERE "MID" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
     FROM "M_Cast"
     WHERE "PID" = 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
   )
   AND "PID" != 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID';
   ```

10. **Count the number of actors with a 'Shahrukh number' of 2:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "PID") AS "Number_of_actors_with_Shahrukh_number_2"
    FROM "M_Cast"
    WHERE "MID" IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
      FROM "M_Cast"
      WHERE "PID" IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
        FROM "M_Cast"
        WHERE "MID" IN (
          SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
          FROM "M_Cast"
          WHERE "PID" = 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
        )
        AND "PID" != 'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'
      )

*Note:* In all the queries above, replace `'Shahrukh_Khan_PID'` with the actual `PID` of Shahrukh Khan obtained from the first query.

*Also,* since we are instructed not to use Common Table Expressions (CTEs), the queries have been written without them, even though using CTEs might simplify the query structures.Query:

Task: Find out how many actors have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2? This means they acted in a film with someone who acted with Shahrukh Khan, but not directly with him.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of actors who have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2, we need to find all actors who have acted in a film with someone who has acted directly with Shahrukh Khan, excluding those who have acted directly with him.

```csv
Number_of_actors_with_Shahrukh_number_2
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 22:47:30 - root - INFO - To determine the number of actors who have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2, we need to:

- Find the `PID` of Shah Rukh Khan.
- Find actors who have acted directly with Shah Rukh Khan (Shahrukh number 1).
- Find actors who have acted with those actors, but not with Shah Rukh Khan himself (Shahrukh number 2).
- Exclude Shah Rukh Khan and actors who have acted directly with him.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT

        -- Actors who acted directly with Shah Rukh Khan
        SELECT DISTINCT mc1."PID"

            SELECT "PID" FROM "Person" WHERE "Name" = 'Shah Rukh Khan'

```

This query counts the number of unique actors (`mc3."PID"`) who have acted in movies (`mc3."MID"`) with actors who have acted directly with Shah Rukh Khan, excluding Shah Rukh Khan himself and those who have acted directly with him.
