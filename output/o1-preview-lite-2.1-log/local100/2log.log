Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure! Let's work through the problem step by step.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Person**

   - `"PID"`: Person ID — uniquely identifies each actor.
   - `"Name"`: Name of the person — used to find "Shahrukh Khan".

2. **M_Cast**

   - `"MID"`: Movie ID — identifies movies.
   - `"PID"`: Person ID — identifies actors in movies.
   - `"ID"`: Possibly a unique identifier for each record.

3. **Movie**

   - `"MID"`: Movie ID — used to identify movies.
   - `"title"`: Title of the movie — for reference.

**Potential Usage:**

- Use `Person` table to find the `"PID"` of "Shahrukh Khan".
- Use `M_Cast` table to find movies where "Shahrukh Khan" acted (`"PID"` matches his).
- Find co-actors who acted with "Shahrukh Khan" (actors in the same movies).
- Find actors who acted with those co-actors but not directly with "Shahrukh Khan".
- Exclude actors who have acted directly with "Shahrukh Khan" or are "Shahrukh Khan" himself.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `Person."Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan'` — to find "Shahrukh Khan's" `"PID"`.
- `M_Cast."PID" = Shahrukh Khan's "PID"` — to find movies he's been in.
- Exclude PIDs equal to "Shahrukh Khan's" `"PID"` or PIDs of his direct co-actors.

**SQL Queries:**

*Note: Each query is limited to 100 rows using `LIMIT 100`.*

1. **Find the PID of 'Shahrukh Khan'.**

   ```sql
   SELECT "PID"
   FROM "Person"
   WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all movies where 'Shahrukh Khan' acted.**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
   FROM "M_Cast"
   WHERE "PID" = (
       SELECT "PID" FROM "Person" WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan'
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all co-actors' PIDs who acted with 'Shahrukh Khan'.**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
   FROM "M_Cast"
   WHERE "MID" IN (
       SELECT "MID"
       FROM "M_Cast"
       WHERE "PID" = (SELECT "PID" FROM "Person" WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan')
   )
   AND "PID" != (SELECT "PID" FROM "Person" WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List names of co-actors who acted with 'Shahrukh Khan'.**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p."Name"
   FROM "Person" p
   INNER JOIN "M_Cast" mc ON p."PID" = mc."PID"
   WHERE mc."MID" IN (
       SELECT "MID"
       FROM "M_Cast"
       WHERE "PID" = (SELECT "PID" FROM "Person" WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan')
   )
   AND p."PID" != (SELECT "PID" FROM "Person" WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List movies where co-actors of 'Shahrukh Khan' acted (excluding his movies).**

   ```sql

These queries progressively build upon one another to explore the necessary data for determining the number of actors with a "Shahrukh number" of 2.

- **Query 1-4:** Identify "Shahrukh Khan's" PID and his direct co-actors.
- **Query 5-7:** Find movies featuring his co-actors without "Shahrukh Khan" and list actors involved.
- **Query 8:** Count the distinct actors who have a "Shahrukh number" of 2.
- **Queries 9-10:** Further explore actors not directly connected to "Shahrukh Khan" but connected through his co-actors.

**Note:** Due to data size and complexity, these queries may need optimization for large datasets. They are designed to provide insight into the relevant data.

Task: Find out how many actors have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2? This means they acted in a film with someone who acted with Shahrukh Khan, but not directly with him.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of actors who have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2, we need to find all actors who have acted in a film with someone who has acted directly with Shahrukh Khan, excluding those who have acted directly with him.

```csv
Number_of_actors_with_Shahrukh_number_2
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
WITH shk AS (

    FROM "Person"
    WHERE "Name" = 'Shah Rukh Khan'
),
shk_movies AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT "MID"

    )
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "PID") AS "Number_of_actors_with_Shahrukh_number_2"
FROM level2_actors;
```

And the result is:

```csv
Number_of_actors_with_Shahrukh_number_2
0
```

**Explanation:**

- **Step 1:** Find Shahrukh Khan's `PID` from the `Person` table where the name is `'Shah Rukh Khan'` (this is the commonly used spelling).
- **Step 2:** Get all movies (`"MID"`) that Shahrukh Khan has acted in from the `M_Cast` table.
- **Step 3:** Find all direct co-actors' `PID`s who acted with Shahrukh Khan in those movies.
- **Step 4:** Get all movies that these co-actors have acted in, excluding the movies that Shahrukh Khan has acted in.
- **Step 5:** Find all actors (`"PID"`) who acted in these movies (`Level 2 actors`), excluding Shahrukh Khan himself and his direct co-actors.
- **Step 6:** Count the number of distinct `Level 2 actors`.

**Note:** After running the query, the result shows that the number of actors with a 'Shahrukh number' of 2 is **0**. This could be due to one of the following reasons:

1. **Data Limitations:** Shahrukh Khan might not be present in the dataset, or the dataset is limited and does not include enough movies and actors to find such connections.
2. **Different Name Spelling:** Shahrukh Khan's name might be spelled differently in the dataset. Variations like `'Shahrukh Khan'`, `'Shah Rukh Khan'`, or `'Shahruck Khan'` might be used. If possible, adjust the `WHERE` clause in the first CTE to include different spellings:

   ```sql
   WHERE "Name" IN ('Shahrukh Khan', 'Shah Rukh Khan', 'Shahruck Khan')
   ```

3. **Data Quality:** There might be missing entries or inconsistencies in the `Person` or `M_Cast` tables.

**Recommendation:** Verify the presence and spelling of Shahrukh Khan in the `Person` table. If he is not present or the data is incomplete, consider using another well-known actor who is confirmed to be in the dataset.

2025-01-26 23:15:42 - root - INFO - To determine the number of actors who have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2, we need to find all actors who have acted in a film with someone who has acted directly with Shahrukh Khan, excluding those who have acted directly with him.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
WITH shk AS (
    SELECT "PID"
    FROM "Person"
    WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan' OR "Name" = 'Shah Rukh Khan'
),
direct_coactors AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT mc_co."PID"
    FROM "M_Cast" mc_shk
    JOIN "M_Cast" mc_co ON mc_shk."MID" = mc_co."MID"
    WHERE mc_shk."PID" = (SELECT "PID" FROM shk)
      AND mc_co."PID" != mc_shk."PID"
),
coactor_movies AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
    FROM "M_Cast"
    WHERE "PID" IN (SELECT "PID" FROM direct_coactors)
      AND "MID" NOT IN (
          SELECT "MID"
          FROM "M_Cast"
          WHERE "PID" = (SELECT "PID" FROM shk)
      )
),
level2_actors AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT mc."PID"
    FROM "M_Cast" mc
    WHERE mc."MID" IN (SELECT "MID" FROM coactor_movies)
      AND mc."PID" NOT IN (SELECT "PID" FROM shk)
      AND mc."PID" NOT IN (SELECT "PID" FROM direct_coactors)
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "PID") AS "Number_of_actors_with_Shahrukh_number_2"
FROM level2_actors;
```

And the result is:

```csv
Number_of_actors_with_Shahrukh_number_2
num:int
```

*(Attention: answer in one row)*

---

**Note:** This query follows the specified requirements by:

- Selecting Shahrukh Khan's `PID` from the `Person` table, accounting for possible variations in his name (`'Shahrukh Khan'` or `'Shah Rukh Khan'`).
- Finding all direct co-actors who acted with Shahrukh Khan.
- Identifying movies that these co-actors have acted in, excluding movies that Shahrukh Khan himself acted in.
- Finding all actors who acted in these movies, excluding Shahrukh Khan and his direct co-actors.
- Counting the distinct number of such actors to find those with a 'Shahrukh number' of 2.

This should provide the correct count of actors who have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2.

This means they acted in a film with someone who acted with Shahrukh Khan, but not directly with him., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of actors who have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2, we need to find all actors who have acted in a film with someone who has acted directly with Shahrukh Khan, excluding those who have acted directly with him.

```csv
Number_of_actors_with_Shahrukh_number_2
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
