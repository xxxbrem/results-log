This simplified query counts the number of actors (`mc2."PID"`) who have acted with actors (`mc1."PID"`) who have acted directly with Shah Rukh Khan (`mc0."PID"`), excluding Shah Rukh Khan himself and his direct co-actors.

- **Explanation:**
  - `mc0` represents movies featuring Shah Rukh Khan.
  - `mc1` finds co-actors who acted with Shah Rukh Khan.
  - `mc2` finds actors who acted with those co-actors in other movies.
  - The conditions `mc0."PID" != mc1."PID"`, `mc1."PID" != mc2."PID"`, and `mc2."PID" != mc0."PID"` ensure we exclude Shah Rukh Khan and his direct co-actors.
  
This adjustment simplifies previous conditions and aims to retrieve any available data matching the criteria.

This adjusted query accounts for possible empty values and attempts to match any variation of "Shahrukh Khan" in the `"Name"` column. It performs the following steps:

1. **Find Shahrukh Khan's PID**:
   - Joins `"Person"` (`p0`) with `"M_Cast"` (`mc0`) where the actor's name matches variations of 'Shahrukh Khan'.

2. **Find Actors Who Acted with Shahrukh Khan (Shahrukh Number 1)**:
   - Joins `"M_Cast"` (`mc1`) on movies (`"MID"`) where `mc0` and `mc1` share the same movie but have different actors.

3. **Find Actors Who Acted with Those Actors (Potential Shahrukh Number 2)**:
   - Joins `"M_Cast"` (`mc2`) on movies (`"MID"`) where `mc1` and `mc2` share the same movie but have different actors, excluding Shahrukh Khan and his direct co-actors.

4. **Exclude Direct Co-Actors and Shahrukh Khan Himself**:
   - Uses a subquery to exclude any actors (`mc2."PID"`) who have acted directly with Shahrukh Khan.
   - Ensures that `mc2."PID"` is not Shahrukh Khan's PID.

5. **Handle NULL Values**:
   - Adds `IS NOT NULL` conditions for all `"PID"` and `"MID"` fields to exclude any records with empty values.

This query aims to retrieve the number of actors with a 'Shahrukh number' of 2 by carefully handling potential empty values and variations in Shahrukh Khan's name.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Person**
   - `"PID"`: Person ID. Used to uniquely identify actors.
   - `"Name"`: Actor's name. Used to find the PID of Shahrukh Khan.

2. **M_Cast**
   - `"MID"`: Movie ID. Used to identify movies.
   - `"PID"`: Person ID. Shows which actors acted in which movies.

**Conditions and Potential Usage:**

- **Find Shahrukh Khan's PID**: Use the `"Name"` column in the `Person` table where `"Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan'`.
- **Movies featuring Shahrukh Khan**: Use the `M_Cast` table to find `"MID"` where `"PID"` is Shahrukh Khan's PID.
- **Actors who acted with Shahrukh Khan**: Find `"PID"` in `M_Cast` where `"MID"` is in Shahrukh Khan's movies, excluding Shahrukh Khan.
- **Actors with 'Shahrukh number' 2**: Find actors who acted with actors who acted with Shahrukh Khan, but did not act directly with Shahrukh Khan.
- **Exclude direct co-actors**: Ensure that actors who acted directly with Shahrukh Khan are excluded when finding actors with a 'Shahrukh number' of 2.

    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the necessary data to determine how many actors have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2 by:

- Identifying Shahrukh Khan's unique person ID (`"PID"`).
- Finding all actors who have acted directly with him.
- Locating movies featuring those actors, excluding movies with Shahrukh Khan.
- Identifying actors who acted in those movies but did not act directly with Shahrukh Khan.
- Excluding any actors who have acted with Shahrukh Khan to isolate those with a 'Shahrukh number' of 2.

This approach ensures we accurately count the number of actors who are two steps away from Shahrukh Khan in terms of co-acting relationships.Query:

Task: Find out how many actors have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2? This means they acted in a film with someone who acted with Shahrukh Khan, but not directly with him.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of actors who have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2, we need to find all actors who have acted in a film with someone who has acted directly with Shahrukh Khan, excluding those who have acted directly with him.

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

```sql
WITH
shahrukh_pid AS (

    FROM "Person"
    WHERE "Name" = 'Shahrukh Khan'
),

    SELECT "MID"

FROM degree_2_actors;
```

This query calculates the number of actors who have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2 by:

1. **Finding Shahrukh Khan's `PID`** in the `Person` table.
2. **Identifying all movies (`MID`)** Shahrukh Khan acted in (`shahrukh_movies`).
3. **Finding all actors (`PID`)** who acted in those movies, excluding Shahrukh Khan himself (`degree_1_actors`).
4. **Selecting movies (`MID`)** that these actors have acted in, excluding movies that feature Shahrukh Khan (`degree_1_movies_not_shahrukh`).
5. **Finding all actors (`PID`)** who acted in these movies, excluding Shahrukh Khan and his direct co-actors (`degree_2_actors`).
6. **Counting the distinct actors** in `degree_2_actors` to get the final number.

This ensures we count only those actors who are two steps away from Shahrukh Khan in terms of co-acting relationships.

2. **Identifying movies Shahrukh Khan acted in** (`shahrukh_movies`).
3. **Finding all actors who acted in those movies**, excluding Shahrukh Khan himself (`degree_1_actors`).
4. **Selecting movies that these actors have acted in**, excluding movies that feature Shahrukh Khan (`degree_1_movies_not_shahrukh`).
5. **Finding all actors who acted in these movies**, excluding Shahrukh Khan and his direct co-actors (`degree_2_actors`).
6. **Counting the distinct actors** in `degree_2_actors` to get the final number.

```

This query follows these steps:

1. **Find Shahrukh Khan's `PID`** in the `Person` table, accounting for possible variations in his name.
2. **Identify all movies** Shahrukh Khan acted in (`shahrukh_movies`).
3. **Find all actors** who acted in those movies, excluding Shahrukh Khan himself (`co_actors`).
4. **Select movies that these actors have acted in**, excluding movies that feature Shahrukh Khan (`coactor_movies`).
5. **Find all actors** who acted in these movies, excluding Shahrukh Khan and his direct co-actors (`degree_2_actors`).
6. **Count the distinct actors** in `degree_2_actors` to get the final number.

This ensures we accurately compute the number of actors who acted with someone who acted with Shahrukh Khan, but did not act directly with him.

This query calculates the number of actors who have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2 by performing the following steps:

1. **Find Shahrukh Khan's PID**: Matching any person whose name includes 'Shah' and 'Khan' to account for variations.
2. **Identify all actors who acted directly with Shahrukh Khan** (`degree_1_actors`): Actors who appeared in the same movies as Shahrukh Khan.
3. **Find actors who acted with those direct co-actors but not with Shahrukh Khan** (`degree_2_actors`): These actors acted with someone who acted with Shahrukh Khan but did not act directly with him.
4. **Exclude any actor who has acted directly with Shahrukh Khan** in any movie to ensure they truly have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2.
5. **Count the distinct actors** in `degree_2_actors` to get the final number.

This ensures we accurately compute the number of actors who acted with someone who acted with Shahrukh Khan, but did not act directly with him.

2025-01-26 23:01:11 - root - INFO - To determine the number of actors who have a 'Shahrukh number' of 2, we need to ensure we correctly identify Shahrukh Khan in the dataset. It's possible that his name is stored differently in the `Person` table. Let's first find all names that could match Shahrukh Khan.

Here is the final SQL query:

```sql
WITH
shahrukh_pids AS (
    SELECT "PID"
    FROM "Person"
    WHERE "Name" LIKE '%Shah%Khan%' OR "Name" LIKE '%Shahrukh%'
),
shahrukh_movies AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
    FROM "M_Cast"
    WHERE "PID" IN (SELECT "PID" FROM shahrukh_pids)
),
direct_coactors AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
    FROM "M_Cast"
    WHERE "MID" IN (SELECT "MID" FROM shahrukh_movies)
    AND "PID" NOT IN (SELECT "PID" FROM shahrukh_pids)
),
movies_with_direct_coactors_excl_shahrukh AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT "MID"
    FROM "M_Cast"
    WHERE "PID" IN (SELECT "PID" FROM direct_coactors)
    AND "MID" NOT IN (SELECT "MID" FROM shahrukh_movies)
),
second_degree_actors AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT "PID"
    FROM "M_Cast"
    WHERE "MID" IN (SELECT "MID" FROM movies_with_direct_coactors_excl_shahrukh)
    AND "PID" NOT IN (SELECT "PID" FROM shahrukh_pids)
    AND "PID" NOT IN (SELECT "PID" FROM direct_coactors)
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Number_of_actors_with_Shahrukh_number_2"
FROM second_degree_actors;
```

This query follows these steps:

1. **Identify Shahrukh Khan's `PID`**: Search for any person whose name contains 'Shah' and 'Khan' together or 'Shahrukh' to account for variations in how his name might be stored.

2. **Find all movies Shahrukh Khan acted in** (`shahrukh_movies`).

3. **Find all actors who acted directly with Shahrukh Khan** (`direct_coactors`): Actors who appeared in the same movies.

4. **Select movies that these direct co-actors acted in, excluding movies with Shahrukh Khan** (`movies_with_direct_coactors_excl_shahrukh`).

5. **Identify actors who acted in these movies, excluding Shahrukh Khan and his direct co-actors** (`second_degree_actors`).

6. **Count the distinct actors** in `second_degree_actors` to get the final number.

This ensures we accurately compute the number of actors who acted with someone who acted with Shahrukh Khan but did not act directly with him.

If the query still returns zero, it may indicate that Shahrukh Khan is not present in the dataset under the names we've tried or that there are no actors meeting the criteria in the data provided.
