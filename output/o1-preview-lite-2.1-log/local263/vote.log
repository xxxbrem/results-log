After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for the following reasons:

1. **Comprehensive Count**: The counts in `0result.csv` are higher (`soft: 102`, `strong: 186`) compared to the counts in `1result.csv` and `2result.csv`. This indicates that `0result.sql` includes all relevant records without omitting any data.

2. **Accurate Grouping**: The SQL in `0result.sql` correctly joins the `model_score` and `model` tables, and appropriately groups by both `status` and `L1_model`.

3. **Proper Status Calculation**: The query accurately computes the `status` by comparing the `test_score` of 'Stack' models with the maximum `test_score` of non-'Stack' models for each `(name, version)`.

4. **Consistent Logic**: The logic used in `0result.sql` aligns with the defined conditions for determining 'strong' and 'soft' statuses and correctly aggregates the counts per `L1_model`.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

0result.sql
