Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`model_score`** table:
   - **`name`**: Identifies the model or problem instance.
   - **`version`**: Version number of the model.
   - **`model`**: Name of the model ('Stack' or other models).
   - **`test_score`**: Test score of the model.

2. **`model`** table:
   - **`name`**: Identifies the model or problem instance.
   - **`version`**: Version number of the model.
   - **`L1_model`**: Type of the first-level model ('regression' or 'tree').

**Conditions to be Used:**

- **Identify 'Stack' and non-'Stack' models** using the `"model"` column in the `model_score` table.
- **Compute the maximum test score** for non-'Stack' models for each `"name"` and `"version"`.
- **Compare** the maximum non-'Stack' test score with the 'Stack' model's test score to determine the **status** ('strong' or 'soft'):
  - **Strong**: Non-'Stack' max score < 'Stack' score.
  - **Soft**: Non-'Stack' max score = 'Stack' score.
- **Join** the results with the `model` table on `"name"` and `"version"` to get the corresponding `"L1_model"`.
- **Count occurrences** of each `"L1_model"` for each status.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct models from the `model_score` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "model" FROM "model_score" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct `L1_model` types from the `model` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "L1_model" FROM "model" LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve all test scores for 'Stack' models:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "test_score" FROM "model_score" WHERE "model" = 'Stack' LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve all test scores for non-'Stack' models:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "model", "test_score" FROM "model_score" WHERE "model" != 'Stack' LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Compute maximum test scores for non-'Stack' models per `name` and `version`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
   FROM "model_score"
   WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
   GROUP BY "name", "version"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve test scores for 'Stack' models per `name` and `version`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "version", "test_score" AS "stack_score"
   FROM "model_score"
   WHERE "model" = 'Stack'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Identify 'strong' status cases where non-'Stack' max score is less than 'Stack' score:**

   ```sql
   SELECT m1."name", m1."version"
   FROM (
       SELECT "name", "version", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
       FROM "model_score"
       WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
       GROUP BY "name", "version"
   ) AS m1
   JOIN (
       SELECT "name", "version", "test_score" AS "stack_score"
       FROM "model_score"
       WHERE "model" = 'Stack'
   ) AS m2
   ON m1."name" = m2."name" AND m1."version" = m2."version"
   WHERE m1."max_non_stack_score" < m2."stack_score"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Identify 'soft' status cases where non-'Stack' max score equals 'Stack' score:**

   ```sql
   SELECT m1."name", m1."version"
   FROM (
       SELECT "name", "version", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
       FROM "model_score"
       WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
       GROUP BY "name", "version"
   ) AS m1
   JOIN (
       SELECT "name", "version", "test_score" AS "stack_score"
       FROM "model_score"
       WHERE "model" = 'Stack'
   ) AS m2
   ON m1."name" = m2."name" AND m1."version" = m2."version"
   WHERE m1."max_non_stack_score" = m2."stack_score"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count occurrences of `L1_model` in 'strong' status:**

   ```sql
   SELECT mo."L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "count"
   FROM (
       SELECT m1."name", m1."version"
       FROM (
           SELECT "name", "version", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
           FROM "model_score"
           WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
           GROUP BY "name", "version"
       ) AS m1
       JOIN (
           SELECT "name", "version", "test_score" AS "stack_score"
           FROM "model_score"
           WHERE "model" = 'Stack'
       ) AS m2
       ON m1."name" = m2."name" AND m1."version" = m2."version"
       WHERE m1."max_non_stack_score" < m2."stack_score"
   ) AS s
   JOIN "model" AS mo ON s."name" = mo."name" AND s."version" = mo."version"
   GROUP BY mo."L1_model"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count occurrences of `L1_model` in 'soft' status:**

    ```sql
    SELECT mo."L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM (
        SELECT m1."name", m1."version"
        FROM (
            SELECT "name", "version", MAX("test_score") AS "max_non_stack_score"
            FROM "model_score"
            WHERE "model" != 'Stack'
            GROUP BY "name", "version"
        ) AS m1
        JOIN (
            SELECT "name", "version", "test_score" AS "stack_score"
            FROM "model_score"
            WHERE "model" = 'Stack'
        ) AS m2
        ON m1."name" = m2."name" AND m1."version" = m2."version"
        WHERE m1."max_non_stack_score" = m2."stack_score"
    ) AS s
    JOIN "model" AS mo ON s."name" = mo."name" AND s."version" = mo."version"
    GROUP BY mo."L1_model"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Final Answer:**

```csv

strong,L1_model1:str,count1:int
soft,L1_model2:str,count2:int
```

For each status ('strong' and 'soft'), the `L1_model` with the highest occurrence is listed along with the number of times it occurs.Query:

Task: Which L1_model has the highest occurrence for each status ('strong,' where the maximum test score for non-'Stack' models is less than the 'Stack' score, and 'soft,' where it equals the 'Stack' score), and how many times does it occur?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
status,L1_model,count
strong,L1_model_name1:str,count1:int
soft,L1_model_name2:str,count2:int
```

For each status ('strong' and 'soft'), the L1_model with the highest occurrence is listed along with the number of times it occurs..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 01:50:31 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which L1_model has the highest occurrence for each status ('strong,' where the maximum test score for non-'Stack' models is less than the 'Stack' score, and 'soft,' where it equals the 'Stack' score), and how many times does it occur?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
status,L1_model,count
strong,L1_model_name1:str,count1:int
soft,L1_model_name2:str,count2:int
```

For each status ('strong' and 'soft'), the L1_model with the highest occurrence is listed along with the number of times it occurs. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
