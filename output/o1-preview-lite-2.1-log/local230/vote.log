After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I recommend using **`2result.sql`**.

**Reason:**

- **Clarity and Readability**: `2result.sql` utilizes a Common Table Expression (CTE) with the `WITH` clause to define `top_genres`. This separates the computation of top genres from the main query, making it more readable and maintainable.
  
  ```sql
  WITH top_genres AS (
      SELECT g."genre"
      FROM "ratings" r
      JOIN "genre" g ON r."movie_id" = g."movie_id"
      WHERE r."avg_rating" > 8
      GROUP BY g."genre"
      ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
      LIMIT 3
  )
  ```
  
- **Reusability**: By defining `top_genres` once, the main query can easily reference it without repeating the subquery, enhancing reusability.
  
- **Efficiency**: Using a CTE can improve performance by computing the `top_genres` only once, which is beneficial if the dataset is large.
  
- **Correctness**: All three queries yield the correct result, but `2result.sql` achieves this with a clean and structured approach.
