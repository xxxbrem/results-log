After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

---

**Reasoning:**

1. **Direct Use of `team_batting`:** The query in `2result.sql` utilizes the `team_batting` column from the `ball_by_ball` table to determine the striker's team during the match. This is a more accurate and direct method since `team_batting` represents the batting team for each delivery, ensuring that we are associating the striker with the correct team without ambiguity.

2. **Avoiding Unnecessary Joins:** By using `team_batting`, the query avoids joining with the `player_match` table to find the striker's team. This reduces the complexity of the query and improves performance by eliminating an extra join operation.

3. **Handling Innings Separately:** The query groups the data by `match_id`, `striker`, and `innings_no`, ensuring that runs scored in different innings are not combined. This is important because a player might bat in multiple innings in matches that have super overs or are replayed.

4. **Ensuring Accurate Match Results:** By joining with the `match` table and comparing `team_batting` with `match_winner`, the query accurately identifies cases where the striker's team lost the match.

5. **Results Integrity:** The results produced by `2result.sql` match the expected outcome and are consistent with the task requirement, showing only the names of strikers who scored no less than 100 runs in a match where their team lost.
