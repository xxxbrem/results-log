Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Table and Columns:**

**Table Name:** `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **`trip_seconds`**: Used to calculate trip duration in minutes by dividing by 60 and rounding. This helps in filtering trips with durations between 1 and 50 minutes and grouping them into quantiles.

- **`fare`**: Used to calculate the average fare for each quantile group.

- **`trip_miles`**: May be used to analyze the relationship between trip duration and distance traveled.

- **`trip_start_timestamp`**, **`trip_end_timestamp`**: Could be used to cross-verify trip durations or analyze time-based patterns, though not directly necessary since `trip_seconds` is provided.

- **`payment_type`**: May be relevant if analyzing fare variations based on payment method.

- **`company`**: Could be used to see if trip durations or fares vary by taxi company.

- **`pickup_latitude`**, **`pickup_longitude`**, **`dropoff_latitude`**, **`dropoff_longitude`**: May be useful for spatial analysis or mapping, though not directly required for this task.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Trip Duration Between 1 and 50 Minutes**: Filtering trips where the rounded trip duration in minutes is between 1 and 50.

- **Valid Trip Durations and Fares**: Ensuring `trip_seconds` and `fare` are not null and greater than zero.

- **Data Cleanup**: Exclude trips with anomalous or missing data.

Task: Calculate the total number of trips and average fare (formatted to two decimal places) for ten equal quantile groups of taxi trips based on rounded minute durations between 1-50 minutes, displaying each group's formatted time range (XXm to XXm) sorted chronologically, where quantile groups are created from ordered trip durations and time ranges represent the minimum/maximum values within each quantile partition

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To calculate the total number of trips and the average fare for ten equal quantile groups of taxi trips based on rounded minute durations between 1 and 50 minutes, follow these steps:

1. **Filter Trips**: Select trips where the `trip_seconds` converted to minutes (by dividing by 60 and rounding appropriately) result in durations between 1 and 50 minutes.

2. **Calculate Trip Durations**: Round each trip's duration to the nearest whole minute.

3. **Create Quantile Groups**: Order the trips by their rounded durations and divide them into ten equal quantile groups.

4. **Determine Time Ranges**: For each quantile group, find the minimum and maximum trip durations to define the time range (formatted as `XXm to XXm`).

5. **Calculate Aggregates**: For each quantile group, compute:
   - **Total Number of Trips**: Count the number of trips in the group.
   - **Average Fare**: Calculate the average fare of the trips in the group, formatted to two decimal places.

6. **Sort Chronologically**: Ensure the groups are ordered by their time ranges in ascending order.

Here is the expected format of the result:

```csv
Time_range,Total_trips,Average_fare
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips1:int,AverageFare1:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips2:int,AverageFare2:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips3:int,AverageFare3:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips4:int,AverageFare4:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips5:int,AverageFare5:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips6:int,AverageFare6:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips7:int,AverageFare7:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips8:int,AverageFare8:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips9:int,AverageFare9:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips10:int,AverageFare10:float
```

**(Attention: answer in 10 rows)**

* **Time_range**: The formatted time range for each quantile group (e.g., `5m to 7m`), representing the minimum and maximum trip durations within the group.
* **Total_trips**: An integer indicating the total number of trips in each group.
* **Average_fare**: A float formatted to two decimal places showing the average fare for trips in each group.

**Explanation:**

This table summarizes the total number of taxi trips and the average fare for each of the ten quantile groups based on trip durations between 1 and 50 minutes. The trips are grouped such that each quantile contains an equal portion of the data, and the time ranges represent the span of trip durations within each quantile. The results are sorted chronologically by the time ranges..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'chicago_crime': ['crime'], 'chicago_taxi_trips': ['taxi_trips']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

* **Total_trips**: An integer indicating the total number of trips in each group.
* **Average_fare**: A float formatted to two decimal places showing the average fare for trips in each group.

**Explanation:**

This table summarizes the total number of taxi trips and the average fare for each of the ten quantile groups based on trip durations between 1 and 50 minutes. The trips are grouped such that each quantile contains an equal portion of the data, and the time ranges represent the span of trip durations within each quantile. The results are sorted chronologically by the time ranges. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-29 19:54:35 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Calculate the total number of trips and average fare (formatted to two decimal places) for ten equal quantile groups of taxi trips based on rounded minute durations between 1-50 minutes, displaying each group's formatted time range (XXm to XXm) sorted chronologically, where quantile groups are created from ordered trip durations and time ranges represent the minimum/maximum values within each quantile partition, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To calculate the total number of trips and the average fare for ten equal quantile groups of taxi trips based on rounded minute durations between 1 and 50 minutes, follow these steps:

1. **Filter Trips**: Select trips where the `trip_seconds` converted to minutes (by dividing by 60 and rounding appropriately) result in durations between 1 and 50 minutes.

2. **Calculate Trip Durations**: Round each trip's duration to the nearest whole minute.

3. **Create Quantile Groups**: Order the trips by their rounded durations and divide them into ten equal quantile groups.

4. **Determine Time Ranges**: For each quantile group, find the minimum and maximum trip durations to define the time range (formatted as `XXm to XXm`).

5. **Calculate Aggregates**: For each quantile group, compute:
   - **Total Number of Trips**: Count the number of trips in the group.
   - **Average Fare**: Calculate the average fare of the trips in the group, formatted to two decimal places.

6. **Sort Chronologically**: Ensure the groups are ordered by their time ranges in ascending order.

Here is the expected format of the result:

```csv
Time_range,Total_trips,Average_fare
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips1:int,AverageFare1:float
XXm to XXm,TotalTrips2:int,AverageFare2:float

2025-01-29 19:54:59 - root - INFO - To calculate the total number of trips and the average fare for ten equal quantile groups of taxi trips based on rounded minute durations between 1 and 50 minutes, follow these steps:

1. **Filter Trips**: Select trips where the `trip_seconds` converted to minutes (by dividing by 60 and rounding appropriately) result in durations between 1 and 50 minutes. Ensure that both `trip_seconds` and `fare` are greater than zero.

2. **Calculate Trip Durations**: Round each trip's duration to the nearest whole minute using `ROUND(trip_seconds / 60.0)`.

3. **Create Quantile Groups**: Order the trips by their rounded durations and divide them into ten equal quantile groups using `NTILE(10)` window function.

4. **Determine Time Ranges**: For each quantile group, find the minimum and maximum trip durations to define the time range (formatted as `XXm to XXm`) using `MIN(trip_minutes)` and `MAX(trip_minutes)`.

5. **Calculate Aggregates**: For each quantile group, compute:
   - **Total Number of Trips**: Count the number of trips in the group using `COUNT(*)`.
   - **Average Fare**: Calculate the average fare of the trips in the group, formatted to two decimal places using `ROUND(AVG(fare), 2)`.

6. **Sort Chronologically**: Order the results by the minimum trip duration in ascending order to display the time ranges in chronological order.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
WITH trips AS (
  SELECT
    ROUND(trip_seconds / 60.0) AS trip_minutes,
    fare
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`

  COUNT(*) AS Total_trips,
  ROUND(AVG(fare), 2) AS Average_fare
FROM trip_groups
GROUP BY quantile_group
ORDER BY MIN(trip_minutes);
```

**Explanation:**

This query first filters the data to include only trips with rounded durations between 1 and 50 minutes and positive fares. It calculates the rounded trip durations and divides the trips into ten quantile groups based on these durations. For each group, it determines the time range by finding the minimum and maximum trip durations and calculates the total number of trips and the average fare, formatted to two decimal places. Finally, it orders the results chronologically by the time ranges.
