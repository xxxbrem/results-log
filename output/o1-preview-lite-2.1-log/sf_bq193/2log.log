This Microsoft Azure template deploys a single Emercoin client which will connect to the public Emercoin network.

[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Femercoin-ubuntu%2Fazuredeploy.json)
<a href=""http://armviz.io/#/?load=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Femercoin-ubuntu%2Fazuredeploy.json"" target=""_blank"">
    <img src=""http://armviz.io/visualizebutton.png""/>
</a>

Once your deployment is complete you will be able to connect to the Emercoin public network.

![Emercoin-Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/emercoin-ubuntu/images/emercoin.png)

# Template Parameters
When you launch the installation of the VM, you need to specify the following parameters:
* `vmDnsPrefix`: this is the public DNS name for the VM that you will use interact with your console. You just need to specify an unique name.
* `adminUsername`: self-explanatory. This is the account you will use for connecting to the node
* `adminPassword`: self-explanatory. Be aware that Azure requires passwords to have One upper case, one lower case, a special character, and a number
* `vmSize`: The type of VM that you want to use for the node. The default size is D1_v2 but you can change that if you expect to run workloads that require more RAM or CPU resources.

# Emercoin Deployment Walkthrough
1. Get your node's IP
 1. browse to https://portal.azure.com

 2. then click browse all, followed by ""resource groups"", and choose your resource group

 3. then expand your resources, and public ip address of your node.

2. Connect to your node
 1. SSH to the public ip of your node as the user you specified for `adminUsername`, enter your `adminPassword`
 2. Try to use the cli-client by `emc help` or `emc getinfo`
 3. Point your browser to the public ip of your node, sign in with `adminUsername` and `adminPassword` specified before (note that browser may show you a warning of bad certificate - it's OK, you may replace the self-signed certificates by yours at /etc/ssl/emc/emcweb*)

http://ckeditor.com - See LICENSE.md for license information.

CKEditor is a text editor to be used inside web pages. It's not a replacement
for desktop text editors like Word or OpenOffice, but a component to be used as
part of web applications and websites.

## Documentation

The full editor documentation is available online at the following address:
http://docs.ckeditor.com

## Installation

Installing CKEditor is an easy task. Just follow these simple steps:

 1. **Download** the latest version from the CKEditor website:
    http://ckeditor.com. You should have already completed this step, but be
    sure you have the very latest version.
 2. **Extract** (decompress) the downloaded file into the root of your website.

**Note:** CKEditor is by default installed in the `ckeditor` folder. You can
place the files in whichever you want though.

## Checking Your Installation

The editor comes with a few sample pages that can be used to verify that
installation proceeded properly. Take a look at the `samples` directory.

To test your installation, just call the following page at your website:

	http://<your site>/<CKEditor installation path>/samples/index.html

For example:

2025-01-26 19:58:11 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the casing of the column name returned by the `FLATTEN` function in Snowflake. In Snowflake, the `FLATTEN` function outputs columns with uppercase names by default, unless aliasing or specific naming conventions are applied.

The columns returned by `FLATTEN` include:

- `SEQ`
- `KEY`
- `PATH`
- `INDEX`
- `VALUE`
- `THIS`

In your query, you're referencing `k."key"`, which doesn't match the actual column name `KEY` due to case sensitivity when using double quotes (`""`). In Snowflake, identifiers enclosed in double quotes are case-sensitive.

**Here's how you can fix the query:**

1. **Change** `"key"` **to** `"KEY"` **in your SELECT statement.**
2. **Ensure you're referencing the correct alias for the table `l` in the SELECT clause.**

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT l."repo_name", k."KEY" AS "language_name"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES l,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => l."language") k
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`k."KEY"`**: This correctly references the `KEY` column output by the `FLATTEN` function.
- **Case Sensitivity**: By using double quotes and uppercase letters, we match the exact column name.

**Alternatively**, you can use unquoted identifiers, which are case-insensitive in Snowflake:

```sql
SELECT l."repo_name", k.KEY AS "language_name"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES l,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => l."language") k
LIMIT 100;
```

**Additional Notes:**

- **Why the Error Occurred**: 
  - When you used `k."key"`, Snowflake looked for a column named exactly `key` (lowercase) due to the double quotes making it case-sensitive.
  - Since the `FLATTEN` function outputs `KEY` in uppercase, the column `key` (lowercase) doesn't exist, causing the `invalid identifier` error.

- **Understanding `FLATTEN` Output Columns**:
  - The `FLATTEN` function outputs several columns you can reference:
    - **`KEY`**: The key of the element if parsing a JSON object.
    - **`VALUE`**: The value of the flattened element.
    - **`INDEX`**, **`PATH`**, **`THIS`**, **`SEQ`**: Other useful metadata about the flattened element.

**Verifying the Corrected Query**

You can run the corrected query to retrieve the `repo_name` and associated programming languages:

```sql
SELECT l."repo_name", k."KEY" AS "language_name"
FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES l,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => l."language") k
LIMIT 100;
```

**Sample Results:**

| repo_name                         | language_name |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| rgardler/azure-quickstart-templates | JavaScript    |
| waydelyle/openfund                  | Python        |
| DaMSL/K3                            | Haskell       |
| ...                                 | ...           |

This should resolve the error and provide you with the expected results, listing the repositories along with their programming languages.

"When you launch the installation of the VM, you need to specify the following parameters:"
* `vmDnsPrefix`: this is the public DNS name for the VM that you will use interact with your console. You just need to specify an unique name.
* `adminUsername`: self-explanatory. This is the account you will use for connecting to the node
"* `adminPassword`: self-explanatory. Be aware that Azure requires passwords to have One upper case, one lower case, a special character, and a number"

CKEditor 4
==========
"Copyright (c) 2003-2015, CKSource - Frederico Knabben. All rights reserved."
http://ckeditor.com - See LICENSE.md for license information.
CKEditor is a text editor to be used inside web pages. It's not a replacement
"for desktop text editors like Word or OpenOffice, but a component to be used as"
part of web applications and websites.
The full editor documentation is available online at the following address:
http://docs.ckeditor.com
Installing CKEditor is an easy task. Just follow these simple steps:
 1. **Download** the latest version from the CKEditor website:
"    http://ckeditor.com. You should have already completed this step, but be"
    sure you have the very latest version.
 2. **Extract** (decompress) the downloaded file into the root of your website.
**Note:** CKEditor is by default installed in the `ckeditor` folder. You can
place the files in whichever you want though.
The editor comes with a few sample pages that can be used to verify that
installation proceeded properly. Take a look at the `samples` directory.
"To test your installation, just call the following page at your website:"
	http://<your site>/<CKEditor installation path>/samples/index.html
For example:
	http://www.example.com/ckeditor/samples/index.html
K3 Dockerfiles
==========
Dockerfiles are updated for three images:
1. **k3-app** -- (~250MB) light-weight image to run a K3 program. Based on debian:jessie. It contains only the necessary dependency libraries.
2. **k3-compiler** -- (~2 GB) Image containing the GHC and GCC tool chains to compile a K3 program to binary. Based on debian:jessie
"3. **k3-dev** (~2.5 GB)  -- Larger container with additional library and application support (e.g. clang, ruby, vim, and others). It is based on debian:sid"
To build an image use the following command:
```
docker build -f k3-dev -t damsl/k3-dev:<your_tag> .
```
"(Note: Docker build now has the -f option, so you don't have to call all docker files, ""Dockerfile"")"
"The image ```damsl/k3-dev:vanilla``` which is pushed to the repo contains the K3 source built with no options. Feel free to pull, use, & re-build K3 with whatever options necessary (and re-push with a new tag if needed)."

7a1d7e6dd76a2070e2d86826391468edc33bb6d6,"tpm: TPM 2.0 baseline support

TPM 2.0 devices are separated by adding a field 'flags' to struct
tpm_chip and defining a flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 for tagging them.

This patch adds the following internal functions:

- tpm2_get_random()
- tpm2_get_tpm_pt()
- tpm2_pcr_extend()
- tpm2_pcr_read()
- tpm2_startup()

Additionally, the following exported functions are implemented for
implementing TPM 2.0 device drivers:

- tpm2_do_selftest()
- tpm2_calc_ordinal_durations()
- tpm2_gen_interrupt()

The existing functions that are exported for the use for existing
subsystems have been changed to check the flags field in struct
tpm_chip and use appropriate TPM 2.0 counterpart if
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is est.

The code for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration() and tpm2_startup() were
originally written by Will Arthur.

313d21eeab9282e01fdcecd40e9ca87e0953627f,"tpm: device class for tpm

Added own device class for TPM. Uses MISC_MAJOR:TPM_MINOR for the
first character device in order to retain backwards compatibility.
Added tpm_dev_release() back attached to the character device.

I've been running this code now for a while on my laptop (Lenovo
T430S) TrouSerS works perfectly without modifications. I don't
believe it breaks anything significantly.

The sysfs attributes that have been placed under the wrong place
and are against sysfs-rules.txt should be probably left to
stagnate under platform device directory and start defining
new sysfs attributes to the char device directory.

Guidelines for future TPM sysfs attributes should be probably
along the lines of

- Single flat set of mandatory sysfs attributes. For example,
  current PPI interface is way way too rich when you only want
  to use it to clear and activate the TPM.

- Define sysfs attribute if and only if there's no way to get
  the value from ring-3. No attributes for TPM properties. It's
  just unnecessary maintenance hurdle that we don't want.

60ecd86c4d985750efa0ea3d8610972b09951715,"vTPM: fix memory allocation flag for rtce buffer at kernel boot

At ibm vtpm initialzation, tpm_ibmvtpm_probe() registers its interrupt
handler, ibmvtpm_interrupt, which calls ibmvtpm_crq_process to allocate
memory for rtce buffer.  The current code uses 'GFP_KERNEL' as the
type of kernel memory allocation, which resulted a warning at
kernel/lockdep.c.  This patch uses 'GFP_ATOMIC' instead so that the
allocation is high-priority and does not sleep.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Tables and Columns Relevant to the Task:**

1. **SAMPLE_FILES**
   - `"repo_name"`: Identifies the repository containing each file. Useful for linking files to repositories.
   - `"path"`: The file path within the repository. We can use this to locate `readme.md` files.
   - `"id"`: A unique identifier for each file. This can be used to join with `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` to retrieve the file contents.
   - **Conditions**:
     - `"path"` ILIKE '%readme.md' to find all `readme.md` files, case-insensitive.

2. **SAMPLE_CONTENTS**
   - `"id"`: Matches with `SAMPLE_FILES."id"` to get the content of specific files.
   - `"content"`: The actual content of the file. We can extract lines of text from this column.
   - `"binary"`: Indicates whether the file is binary (`TRUE`) or text (`FALSE`). We can use this to exclude binary files.
   - **Conditions**:
     - `"binary"` = FALSE to include only text files.

3. **LANGUAGES**
   - `"repo_name"`: Identifies the repository. Used to link programming languages to repositories.
   - `"language"`: A `VARIANT` type containing programming languages used in the repository. We can extract languages from this column.
   - **Conditions**:
     - Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to extract individual languages from the `VARIANT` column.

4. **LICENSES** (Potentially irrelevant for this task)
   - Not directly useful for extracting lines from `readme.md` files.

5. **SAMPLE_REPOS** (Potentially useful for additional repository information)
   - `"repo_name"`: Identifies the repository.
   - `"watch_count"`: Might be used to prioritize repositories by popularity, if needed.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filter files where `"path"` ILIKE '%readme.md' to locate `readme.md` files.
- Exclude binary files using `"binary"` = FALSE.
- Join `SAMPLE_FILES` and `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` on `"id"` to get the content of `readme.md` files.
- Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` and `SPLIT` functions to extract individual lines from the `content` column.
- Exclude lines starting with `#` or `//` using string pattern matching in the `WHERE` clause.
- Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to extract programming languages from the `VARIANT` `"language"` column.
- Sort programming languages alphabetically.

18. **Query 18: Extract keys and values from the `language` `VARIANT` column**

    ```sql
    SELECT l."repo_name", k."key" AS "language_name", k."value"::NUMBER AS "bytes"
    FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES l,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => l."language") k
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

19. **Query 19: Find the most common programming languages among repositories**

    ```sql
    SELECT k."key" AS "language_name", COUNT(*) AS "repository_count"
    FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES l,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => l."language") k
    GROUP BY k."key"
    ORDER BY "repository_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

20. **Query 20: Retrieve commit messages from `SAMPLE_COMMITS`**

    ```sql
    SELECT "commit", "message"
    FROM GITHUB_REPOS.GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_COMMITS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the structure and content of the relevant tables and columns in the database. By exploring the data using these queries, we can gain insight into how to proceed with the task of retrieving non-empty, non-commented lines from `readme.md` files and associating them with programming languages used in the repositories.Query:

This Microsoft Azure template deploys a single Emercoin client which will connect to the public Emercoin network.

[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Femercoin-ubuntu%2Fazuredeploy.json)

Once your deployment is complete you will be able to connect to the Emercoin public network.

![Emercoin-Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/emercoin-ubuntu/images/emercoin.png)

# Template Parameters
When you launch the installation of the VM, you need to specify the following parameters:
* `vmDnsPrefix`: this is the public DNS name for the VM that you will use interact with your console. You just need to specify an unique name.
* `adminUsername`: self-explanatory. This is the account you will use for connecting to the node
* `adminPassword`: self-explanatory. Be aware that Azure requires passwords to have One upper case, one lower case, a special character, and a number
* `vmSize`: The type of VM that you want to use for the node. The default size is D1_v2 but you can change that if you expect to run workloads that require more RAM or CPU resources.

# Emercoin Deployment Walkthrough
1. Get your node's IP
 1. browse to https://portal.azure.com

 2. then click browse all, followed by ""resource groups"", and choose your resource group

 3. then expand your resources, and public ip address of your node.

2. Connect to your node
 1. SSH to the public ip of your node as the user you specified for `adminUsername`, enter your `adminPassword`
 2. Try to use the cli-client by `emc help` or `emc getinfo`
 3. Point your browser to the public ip of your node, sign in with `adminUsername` and `adminPassword` specified before (note that browser may show you a warning of bad certificate - it's OK, you may replace the self-signed certificates by yours at /etc/ssl/emc/emcweb*)

Copyright (c) 2003-2015, CKSource - Frederico Knabben. All rights reserved.
http://ckeditor.com - See LICENSE.md for license information.

CKEditor is a text editor to be used inside web pages. It's not a replacement
for desktop text editors like Word or OpenOffice, but a component to be used as
part of web applications and websites.

## Documentation

The full editor documentation is available online at the following address:
http://docs.ckeditor.com

## Installation

Installing CKEditor is an easy task. Just follow these simple steps:

 1. **Download** the latest version from the CKEditor website:
    http://ckeditor.com. You should have already completed this step, but be
    sure you have the very latest version.
 2. **Extract** (decompress) the downloaded file into the root of your website.

**Note:** CKEditor is by default installed in the `ckeditor` folder. You can
place the files in whichever you want though.

## Checking Your Installation

The editor comes with a few sample pages that can be used to verify that
installation proceeded properly. Take a look at the `samples` directory.

To test your installation, just call the following page at your website:

	http://<your site>/<CKEditor installation path>/samples/index.html

For example:

Once your deployment is complete you will be able to connect to the Emercoin public network.
![Emercoin-Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/emercoin-ubuntu/images/emercoin.png)
"When you launch the installation of the VM, you need to specify the following parameters:"
* `vmDnsPrefix`: this is the public DNS name for the VM that you will use interact with your console. You just need to specify an unique name.
* `adminUsername`: self-explanatory. This is the account you will use for connecting to the node
"* `adminPassword`: self-explanatory. Be aware that Azure requires passwords to have One upper case, one lower case, a special character, and a number"
* `vmSize`: The type of VM that you want to use for the node. The default size is D1_v2 but you can change that if you expect to run workloads that require more RAM or CPU resources.
1. Get your node's IP
 1. browse to https://portal.azure.com
" 2. then click browse all, followed by ""resource groups"", and choose your resource group"
" 3. then expand your resources, and public ip address of your node."
2. Connect to your node
" 1. SSH to the public ip of your node as the user you specified for `adminUsername`, enter your `adminPassword`"
 2. Try to use the cli-client by `emc help` or `emc getinfo`
" 3. Point your browser to the public ip of your node, sign in with `adminUsername` and `adminPassword` specified before (note that browser may show you a warning of bad certificate - it's OK, you may replace the self-signed certificates by yours at /etc/ssl/emc/emcweb*)"

Please see the wiki for information about using plugins.  If you're interested
"in creating your own plugins, please check out the Plugin Author's Guide"
on the wiki (TBD).
"All of these plugins conform to the AMD specification.  However, that"
doesn't necessarily mean that they'll work with other AMD loaders or
"builders.  Until the build-time API of AMD is finalized, there will be"
incompatibilities.
Modules that should work with any loader/builder:

 1. **Download** the latest version from the CKEditor website:
"    http://ckeditor.com. You should have already completed this step, but be"
    sure you have the very latest version.
 2. **Extract** (decompress) the downloaded file into the root of your website.
**Note:** CKEditor is by default installed in the `ckeditor` folder. You can
place the files in whichever you want though.
The editor comes with a few sample pages that can be used to verify that
installation proceeded properly. Take a look at the `samples` directory.
"To test your installation, just call the following page at your website:"
	http://<your site>/<CKEditor installation path>/samples/index.html
For example:
	http://www.example.com/ckeditor/samples/index.html
K3 Dockerfiles
==========
Dockerfiles are updated for three images:
1. **k3-app** -- (~250MB) light-weight image to run a K3 program. Based on debian:jessie. It contains only the necessary dependency libraries.
2. **k3-compiler** -- (~2 GB) Image containing the GHC and GCC tool chains to compile a K3 program to binary. Based on debian:jessie
"3. **k3-dev** (~2.5 GB)  -- Larger container with additional library and application support (e.g. clang, ruby, vim, and others). It is based on debian:sid"
To build an image use the following command:
```
docker build -f k3-dev -t damsl/k3-dev:<your_tag> .
```
"(Note: Docker build now has the -f option, so you don't have to call all docker files, ""Dockerfile"")"
"The image ```damsl/k3-dev:vanilla``` which is pushed to the repo contains the K3 source built with no options. Feel free to pull, use, & re-build K3 with whatever options necessary (and re-push with a new tag if needed)."

7a1d7e6dd76a2070e2d86826391468edc33bb6d6,"tpm: TPM 2.0 baseline support

TPM 2.0 devices are separated by adding a field 'flags' to struct
tpm_chip and defining a flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 for tagging them.

This patch adds the following internal functions:

- tpm2_get_random()
- tpm2_get_tpm_pt()
- tpm2_pcr_extend()
- tpm2_pcr_read()
- tpm2_startup()

Additionally, the following exported functions are implemented for
implementing TPM 2.0 device drivers:

- tpm2_do_selftest()
- tpm2_calc_ordinal_durations()
- tpm2_gen_interrupt()

The existing functions that are exported for the use for existing
subsystems have been changed to check the flags field in struct
tpm_chip and use appropriate TPM 2.0 counterpart if
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is est.

The code for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration() and tpm2_startup() were
originally written by Will Arthur.

313d21eeab9282e01fdcecd40e9ca87e0953627f,"tpm: device class for tpm

Added own device class for TPM. Uses MISC_MAJOR:TPM_MINOR for the
first character device in order to retain backwards compatibility.
Added tpm_dev_release() back attached to the character device.

I've been running this code now for a while on my laptop (Lenovo
T430S) TrouSerS works perfectly without modifications. I don't
believe it breaks anything significantly.

The sysfs attributes that have been placed under the wrong place
and are against sysfs-rules.txt should be probably left to
stagnate under platform device directory and start defining
new sysfs attributes to the char device directory.

Guidelines for future TPM sysfs attributes should be probably
along the lines of

- Single flat set of mandatory sysfs attributes. For example,
  current PPI interface is way way too rich when you only want
  to use it to clear and activate the TPM.

- Define sysfs attribute if and only if there's no way to get
  the value from ring-3. No attributes for TPM properties. It's
  just unnecessary maintenance hurdle that we don't want.

60ecd86c4d985750efa0ea3d8610972b09951715,"vTPM: fix memory allocation flag for rtce buffer at kernel boot

At ibm vtpm initialzation, tpm_ibmvtpm_probe() registers its interrupt
handler, ibmvtpm_interrupt, which calls ibmvtpm_crq_process to allocate
memory for rtce buffer.  The current code uses 'GFP_KERNEL' as the
type of kernel memory allocation, which resulted a warning at
kernel/lockdep.c.  This patch uses 'GFP_ATOMIC' instead so that the
allocation is high-priority and does not sleep.

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines of text from readme.md files in GitHub repositories. Exclude lines that are comments (lines starting with # for Markdown comments and // for code comments), and for each line, provide the frequency of occurrence along with a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repository that contains the line.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `readme.md` files in GitHub repositories, we exclude lines starting with `#` or `//`. For each line, we provide the frequency of its occurrence across the repositories and a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in those repositories.

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
Line,Frequency,Languages
line1:str,freq1:int,language_list1:str
line2:str,freq2:int,language_list2:str
...
```

- **Line**: The non-empty, non-commented line from `readme.md` files.
- **Frequency**: Number of times the line appears across `readme.md` files.
- **Languages**: Comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repositories containing the line..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GITHUB_REPOS': {'GITHUB_REPOS': ['LANGUAGES', 'LICENSES', 'SAMPLE_COMMITS', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS', 'SAMPLE_FILES', 'SAMPLE_REPOS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Exclude lines that are comments (lines starting with # for Markdown comments and // for code comments), and for each line, provide the frequency of occurrence along with a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repository that contains the line., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `readme.md` files in GitHub repositories, we exclude lines starting with `#` or `//`. For each line, we provide the frequency of its occurrence across the repositories and a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in those repositories.

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
Line,Frequency,Languages
line1:str,freq1:int,language_list1:str
line2:str,freq2:int,language_list2:str
...
```

- **Line**: The non-empty, non-commented line from `readme.md` files.
- **Frequency**: Number of times the line appears across `readme.md` files.
- **Languages**: Comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repositories containing the line. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `readme.md` files in GitHub repositories, we exclude lines starting with `#` or `//`. For each line, we provide the frequency of its occurrence across the repositories and a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in those repositories.

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
Line,Frequency,Languages
line1:str,freq1:int,language_list1:str
line2:str,freq2:int,language_list2:str
...
```

- **Line**: The non-empty, non-commented line from `readme.md` files.
- **Frequency**: Number of times the line appears across `readme.md` files.
- **Languages**: Comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repositories containing the line. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Exclude lines that are comments (lines starting with # for Markdown comments and // for code comments), and for each line, provide the frequency of occurrence along with a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repository that contains the line., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To retrieve all non-empty, non-commented lines from `readme.md` files in GitHub repositories, we exclude lines starting with `#` or `//`. For each line, we provide the frequency of its occurrence across the repositories and a comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in those repositories.

The result is presented in the following format:

```csv
Line,Frequency,Languages
line1:str,freq1:int,language_list1:str
line2:str,freq2:int,language_list2:str
...
```

- **Line**: The non-empty, non-commented line from `readme.md` files.
- **Frequency**: Number of times the line appears across `readme.md` files.
- **Languages**: Comma-separated list of programming languages (sorted alphabetically) used in the repositories containing the line. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
