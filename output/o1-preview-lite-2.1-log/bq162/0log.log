2025-01-25 02:17:57 - root - INFO - I apologize for the confusion. The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the column `Imaging_Assay_Type` does not exist in the table `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level3_segmentation_metadata_r5`. This is why you're receiving the error message:

```
400 Unrecognized name: Imaging_Assay_Type at [1:17]
```

**Explanation:**

In the table `imaging_level3_segmentation_metadata_r5`, the column `Imaging_Assay_Type` is not defined. The available columns in this table are:

- Imaging_Object_Class
- Parameter_file
- Filename
- HTAN_Parent_Data_File_ID
- entityId
- Id
- HTAN_Data_File_ID
- Imaging_Segmentation_Data_Type
- Component
- Imaging_Object_Class_Description
- Number_of_Objects
- Commit_SHA
- Software_and_Version
- File_Format
- HTAN_Center
- Manifest_Id
- Manifest_Version
- File_Size
- md5
- Data_Release
- CDS_Release

Since `Imaging_Assay_Type` is not present, we need to adjust the query.

**Solution:**

To retrieve the imaging assay types and their respective data levels available at the HTAN WUSTL center, we can adjust the query to use columns that exist in each table. Specifically, for the Level 3 table, we can use the `Imaging_Segmentation_Data_Type` or `Imaging_Object_Class` as they might provide relevant information about the assay.

Here’s a corrected SQL query that uses `Imaging_Object_Class` for Level 3:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Imaging_Assay_Type, 'Level 1' AS Data_Level
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level1_metadata_r5`
WHERE HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'
  AND Component IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%'

UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT Imaging_Assay_Type, 'Level 2' AS Data_Level
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level2_metadata_r5`
WHERE HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'
  AND Component IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%'

UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT Imaging_Segmentation_Data_Type AS Imaging_Assay_Type, 'Level 3' AS Data_Level
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level3_segmentation_metadata_r5`
WHERE HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'
  AND Component IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%'

UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT Imaging_Assay_Type, 'Level 4' AS Data_Level
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level4_metadata_r5`
WHERE HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'
  AND Component IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%`;
```

**Notes:**

- In the Level 3 query, I replaced `Imaging_Assay_Type` with `Imaging_Segmentation_Data_Type` to match the available columns.
- Ensure that the last backtick at the end of the query is replaced with a semicolon to close the query properly.

**Final Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Imaging_Assay_Type, 'Level 1' AS Data_Level
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level1_metadata_r5`
WHERE HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'
  AND Component IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%'

UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT Imaging_Assay_Type, 'Level 2' AS Data_Level
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level2_metadata_r5`
WHERE HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'
  AND Component IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%'

UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT Imaging_Segmentation_Data_Type AS Imaging_Assay_Type, 'Level 3' AS Data_Level
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level3_segmentation_metadata_r5`
WHERE HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'
  AND Component IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%'

UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT Imaging_Assay_Type, 'Level 4' AS Data_Level
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level4_metadata_r5`
WHERE HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'
  AND Component IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%';
```

**Explanation:**

- **Level 1 and Level 2:** Use `Imaging_Assay_Type` as before.
- **Level 3:** Replace `Imaging_Assay_Type` with `Imaging_Segmentation_Data_Type`, and alias it back to `Imaging_Assay_Type` for consistency in the result set.
- **Level 4:** Use `Imaging_Assay_Type` as before.

**Example Result:**

Assuming the query runs successfully, the results might look like:

| Imaging_Assay_Type | Data_Level |
|--------------------|------------|
| CODEX              | Level 1    |
| IMC                | Level 2    |
| MIBI               | Level 3    |
| H&E                | Level 4    |

**Additional Notes:**

- If `Imaging_Segmentation_Data_Type` does not provide the assay type information, you might need to use another relevant column or consider joining with another table that contains the assay type information.
- Ensure that you verify the column names in each table to match exactly, as SQL is case-sensitive regarding column names.

2025-01-25 02:18:51 - root - INFO - I apologize for the confusion and the errors in the previous SQL queries. Let's address the issues you're experiencing with the SQL query and provide a corrected version.

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Unclosed String Literal:**
   - The error message indicates a syntax error due to an unclosed string literal. This usually happens when a string starting with a single quote `'` doesn't have a matching closing quote.
   - In your query, all string literals appear to be properly closed. However, sometimes hidden characters or copy-paste errors can introduce issues.

2. **Non-existent Column `Imaging_Assay_Type` in Level 3 Metadata:**
   - The column `Imaging_Assay_Type` does not exist in the table `imaging_level3_segmentation_metadata_r5`. Attempting to select or filter on a non-existent column will cause an error like "Unrecognized name: Imaging_Assay_Type".

**Solution:**

- **For Level 3 Data:**
  - Since `Imaging_Assay_Type` doesn't exist in the Level 3 table, we need to use an appropriate column that provides assay type information.
  - The column `Imaging_Object_Class` or `Imaging_Segmentation_Data_Type` might contain relevant information.

- **Fixing the Unclosed String Literal Error:**
  - Ensure all string literals are properly closed with matching single quotes.
  - Verify that there's no trailing backticks or unmatched quotes in the query.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's a corrected SQL query that should retrieve the imaging assay types and their respective data levels for the HTAN WUSTL center, using existing columns and ensuring proper syntax:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Imaging_Assay_Type, 'Level 1' AS Data_Level
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level1_metadata_r5`
WHERE HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'
  AND Component IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%'

UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT Imaging_Assay_Type, 'Level 2' AS Data_Level
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level2_metadata_r5`
WHERE HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'
  AND Component IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%'

UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT Imaging_Segmentation_Data_Type AS Imaging_Assay_Type, 'Level 3' AS Data_Level
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level3_segmentation_metadata_r5`
WHERE HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'
  AND Component IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%'

UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT Imaging_Assay_Type, 'Level 4' AS Data_Level
FROM `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level4_metadata_r5`
WHERE HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'
  AND Component IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'
  AND LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%';
```

**Explanation:**

- **Level 1, 2, and 4:**
  - We use `Imaging_Assay_Type` as it exists in these tables.
- **Level 3:**
  - Since `Imaging_Assay_Type` doesn't exist, we use `Imaging_Segmentation_Data_Type` and alias it as `Imaging_Assay_Type` for consistency.
- **Filters:**
  - `HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'` filters records for the WUSTL center.
  - `Component IS NOT NULL` excludes records where `Component` is NULL.
  - `LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'` excludes records where `Component` contains 'Auxiliary' (case-insensitive).
  - `LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%'` excludes records where `Component` contains 'OtherAssay' (case-insensitive).
- **Syntax Corrections:**
  - Ensure all string literals (enclosed in single quotes `'`) are properly closed.
  - The SQL statement ends with a semicolon `;`.
  - Remove any trailing backticks or unmatched quotes.

**Notes:**

- If `Imaging_Segmentation_Data_Type` doesn't provide the assay type information you're seeking, you may need to examine other columns in the Level 3 table that contain assay-related information.
- Always double-check the column names in your tables to ensure they exist and are correctly spelled.
- If you continue to encounter errors, it might help to run each part of the query separately to isolate the issue.

**Example Execution:**

- Running the corrected query should provide you with a list of imaging assay types and their corresponding data levels for the HTAN WUSTL center.
- For example, the result might look like:

  | Imaging_Assay_Type | Data_Level |
  |--------------------|------------|
  | CODEX              | Level 1    |
  | CODEX              | Level 2    |
  | CODEX              | Level 3    |
  | CODEX              | Level 4    |
  | H&E                | Level 1    |
  | H&E                | Level 2    |
  | H&E                | Level 4    |

**Final Answer:**

Please use the corrected SQL query provided above to retrieve the imaging assay types and their respective data levels available at the HTAN WUSTL center in the 5th revision (r5) of the HTAN data.

Data was generated using the 10X Genomics V3 chemistry and was processed using CellRanger, where reads were mapped to HG38. The 15 filtered (5 donors each with 3 sorted samples) gene-by-cell count matrices were combined into a bigger gene-by-cell count matrix. To prevent sorted progenitor cells from dominating the cell composition, we down-sampled the sorted cells to 12,000, about half of the live cells. The combined matrix was converted to a Seurat object, with the fraction of mitochondrial UMI and sample information added as the metadata. We next applied the same procedure as for integrating patient scRNA-Seq data, except using top 1,500 VEGs, the first 20 PCs, and only regressing out confounding factors of the total UMI count per cell and the fraction of mitochondrial UMIs per cell."",

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, I will first identify the relevant tables, columns, and conditions required to find the imaging assay types and their respective data levels available at the HTAN WUSTL center in the 5th revision (r5) of the HTAN data.

**Relevant Tables:**

- `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level1_metadata_r5`
- `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level2_metadata_r5`
- `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level3_segmentation_metadata_r5`
- `isb-cgc-bq.HTAN_versioned.imaging_level4_metadata_r5`

**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- `HTAN_Center`: To filter records for the HTAN WUSTL center.
- `Component`: To exclude records where `Component` is NULL or contains 'Auxiliary' or 'OtherAssay'.
- `Imaging_Assay_Type`: To identify different imaging assay types.
- `HTAN_Data_File_ID`: To identify unique data files.
- `File_Format`: To provide additional information about the data.

**Conditions to be Used:**

- `Component IS NOT NULL`: To exclude records where `Component` is NULL.
- `LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%auxiliary%'`: To exclude records where `Component` contains 'Auxiliary' (case insensitive).
- `LOWER(Component) NOT LIKE '%otherassay%'`: To exclude records where `Component` contains 'OtherAssay' (case insensitive).
- `HTAN_Center = 'HTAN WUSTL'`: To filter records for the HTAN WUSTL center.

Task: According to the 5th revision (r5) of the HTAN data, list the different imaging assay types and their respective data levels (Level1, Level2, Level3, Level4) available at the HTAN WUSTL center. Exclude any records where the 'Component' is NULL or contains 'Auxiliary' or 'OtherAssay'. For each assay, provide the available data levels.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Assay_Type,Available_Data_Levels
```

After reviewing the 5th revision (r5) of the HTAN data, no imaging assay data levels were found for the HTAN WUSTL center that meet the specified criteria. Therefore, there are no imaging assay types and data levels to list for HTAN WUSTL in r5 data..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 02:28:41 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing According to the 5th revision (r5) of the HTAN data, list the different imaging assay types and their respective data levels (Level1, Level2, Level3, Level4) available at the HTAN WUSTL center. Exclude any records where the 'Component' is NULL or contains 'Auxiliary' or 'OtherAssay'. For each assay, provide the available data levels., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Assay_Type,Available_Data_Levels
```

After reviewing the 5th revision (r5) of the HTAN data, no imaging assay data levels were found for the HTAN WUSTL center that meet the specified criteria. Therefore, there are no imaging assay types and data levels to list for HTAN WUSTL in r5 data. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
