2025-01-25 04:56:59 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-25 04:56:59 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to a mismatched quotation mark in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, the closing quotation mark for the date `'2021-12-31'` is incorrect. You have a double quotation mark (`"`) instead of a single quotation mark (`'`), which causes a syntax error near `"Italy"`.

**Here's the incorrect part of your query:**

```sql
WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31" AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
```

**To fix the syntax error, replace the double quotation mark with a single quotation mark:**

```sql
WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31' AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT s."cust_id", SUM(s."amount_sold" - (s."quantity_sold" * c."unit_cost")) AS "total_profit"
FROM "sales" AS s
JOIN "customers" AS cu ON s."cust_id" = cu."cust_id"
JOIN "countries" AS co ON cu."country_id" = co."country_id"
JOIN "costs" AS c ON s."prod_id" = c."prod_id" AND s."time_id" = c."time_id"
WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31' AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
GROUP BY s."cust_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks:** SQL strings should be enclosed in single quotation marks (`'`), while identifiers (like table names and column names) that require quotation (due to special characters or reserved words) are enclosed in double quotation marks (`"`).

- **Date Strings:** Ensure that date strings are correctly enclosed in single quotation marks. So both `'2021-12-01'` and `'2021-12-31'` should have matching single quotes.

---

**Next Steps:**

Now that the syntax error is fixed, running the corrected query should provide you with the total profit per Italian customer in December 2021.

**Proceeding with the Task:**

1. **Calculate Total Profit per Italian Customer:**

   The corrected query will give you the total profit for each Italian customer during December 2021.

2. **Determine Profit Intervals:**

   - Retrieve all the `total_profit` values for Italian customers.
   - Calculate the range of profits (maximum and minimum profit).
   - Divide the profit range into ten equal intervals (buckets).

3. **Assign Customers to Buckets:**

   - For each customer, determine which profit bucket they belong to based on their `total_profit`.

4. **Calculate Required Metrics for Each Bucket:**

   - **Number of Customers:** Count of customers in each bucket.
   - **Maximum Profit:** Highest `total_profit` in each bucket.
   - **Minimum Profit:** Lowest `total_profit` in each bucket.

**Example SQL to Segment Customers into Buckets:**

To help you proceed, here's how you might segment the customers into ten profit buckets using SQL:

```sql
WITH italian_customers_profit AS (
  SELECT s."cust_id", SUM(s."amount_sold" - (s."quantity_sold" * c."unit_cost")) AS "total_profit"
  FROM "sales" AS s
  JOIN "customers" AS cu ON s."cust_id" = cu."cust_id"
  JOIN "countries" AS co ON cu."country_id" = co."country_id"
  JOIN "costs" AS c ON s."prod_id" = c."prod_id" AND s."time_id" = c."time_id"
  WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31' AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
  GROUP BY s."cust_id"
),
profit_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    MAX("total_profit") AS max_profit,
    MIN("total_profit") AS min_profit
  FROM italian_customers_profit
),
bucketed_customers AS (
  SELECT 
    icp."cust_id",
    icp."total_profit",
    ntile(10) OVER (ORDER BY icp."total_profit") AS profit_bucket
  FROM italian_customers_profit icp
)
SELECT 
  'Bucket' || bc.profit_bucket AS Profit_Bucket,
  COUNT(bc."cust_id") AS Number_of_Customers,
  MAX(bc."total_profit") AS Max_Profit,
  MIN(bc."total_profit") AS Min_Profit
FROM bucketed_customers bc
GROUP BY bc.profit_bucket
ORDER BY bc.profit_bucket;
```

**Note:**

- The `ntile(10)` window function divides the sorted `total_profit` data into ten groups (buckets) with approximately equal numbers of customers. It assigns a bucket number (from 1 to 10) to each customer.
- If you prefer buckets with equal profit intervals rather than equal numbers of customers, you'll need to calculate the profit range and define the intervals accordingly.

---

**Final Output Format:**

As per your original task, here's the expected output format:

```csv
Profit_Bucket,Number_of_Customers,Max_Profit,Min_Profit
Bucket1,number1:int,max_profit1:float,min_profit1:float
Bucket2,number2:int,max_profit2:float,min_profit2:float
Bucket3,number3:int,max_profit3:float,min_profit3:float
Bucket4,number4:int,max_profit4:float,min_profit4:float
Bucket5,number5:int,max_profit5:float,min_profit5:float
Bucket6,number6:int,max_profit6:float,min_profit6:float
Bucket7,number7:int,max_profit7:float,min_profit7:float
Bucket8,number8:int,max_profit8:float,min_profit8:float
Bucket9,number9:int,max_profit9:float,min_profit9:float
Bucket10,number10:int,max_profit10:float,min_profit10:float
(Attention: answer in ten rows)
```

**Adjusting for Equal Profit Intervals:**

If you need to segment the buckets based on equal profit intervals, you can modify the SQL query to calculate the profit intervals and assign customers accordingly.

**Example:**

```sql
WITH italian_customers_profit AS (
  SELECT s."cust_id", SUM(s."amount_sold" - (s."quantity_sold" * c."unit_cost")) AS "total_profit"
  FROM "sales" AS s
  JOIN "customers" AS cu ON s."cust_id" = cu."cust_id"
  JOIN "countries" AS co ON cu."country_id" = co."country_id"
  JOIN "costs" AS c ON s."prod_id" = c."prod_id" AND s."time_id" = c."time_id"
  WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31' AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
  GROUP BY s."cust_id"
),
profit_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    MAX("total_profit") AS max_profit,
    MIN("total_profit") AS min_profit,
    (MAX("total_profit") - MIN("total_profit")) / 10.0 AS interval_size
  FROM italian_customers_profit
),
bucketed_customers AS (
  SELECT 
    icp."cust_id",
    icp."total_profit",
    CASE 
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 1 THEN 1
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 2 THEN 2
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 3 THEN 3
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 4 THEN 4
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 5 THEN 5

2025-01-25 04:57:46 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-25 04:57:46 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to a mismatched quotation mark in the `WHERE` clause, specifically in the date `'2021-12-31"`.

**Problematic Line:**

```sql
WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31" AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
```

As you can see, the date `'2021-12-31"` starts with a single quote (`'`) but ends with a double quote (`"`). This causes the SQL parser to expect a closing single quote, leading to a syntax error near `WHERE`.

**Solution:**

Ensure that the date string `'2021-12-31'` has matching single quotes by replacing the ending double quote with a single quote.

**Corrected `WHERE` Clause:**

```sql
WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31' AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT s."cust_id", SUM(s."amount_sold" - (s."quantity_sold" * c."unit_cost")) AS "total_profit"
FROM "sales" AS s
JOIN "customers" AS cu ON s."cust_id" = cu."cust_id"
JOIN "countries" AS co ON cu."country_id" = co."country_id"
JOIN "costs" AS c ON s."prod_id" = c."prod_id" AND s."time_id" = c."time_id"
WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31' AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
GROUP BY s."cust_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks:** Ensure that all string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes (`'`).
- **Date Strings:** The date `'2021-12-31'` now has matching single quotes, which resolves the syntax error.

**Next Steps:**

After correcting the query, you should be able to execute it without any syntax errors. This query will provide you with the total profit for each Italian customer during December 2021.

**Proceeding with the Task:**

To segment Italian customers into ten profitability buckets with equal profit intervals and calculate the required metrics, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Profit per Customer:**

   Use the corrected query to obtain the `cust_id` and `total_profit` for Italian customers in December 2021.

2. **Determine Profit Intervals:**

   - Find the **maximum** and **minimum** `total_profit` values.
   - Calculate the **profit interval size** by subtracting the minimum profit from the maximum profit and dividing by 10.

3. **Assign Customers to Buckets:**

   - For each customer, determine their profit bucket based on their `total_profit` and the calculated intervals.

4. **Calculate Metrics for Each Bucket:**

   - **Number of Customers:** Count of customers in each bucket.
   - **Maximum Profit:** Highest `total_profit` in each bucket.
   - **Minimum Profit:** Lowest `total_profit` in each bucket.

**Example SQL Query for Bucketing:**

```sql
WITH italian_customers_profit AS (
  SELECT s."cust_id", SUM(s."amount_sold" - (s."quantity_sold" * c."unit_cost")) AS "total_profit"
  FROM "sales" AS s
  JOIN "customers" AS cu ON s."cust_id" = cu."cust_id"
  JOIN "countries" AS co ON cu."country_id" = co."country_id"
  JOIN "costs" AS c ON s."prod_id" = c."prod_id" AND s."time_id" = c."time_id"
  WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31' AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
  GROUP BY s."cust_id"
),
profit_stats AS (
  SELECT
    MAX("total_profit") AS max_profit,
    MIN("total_profit") AS min_profit,
    (MAX("total_profit") - MIN("total_profit")) / 10.0 AS interval_size
  FROM italian_customers_profit
),
bucketed_customers AS (
  SELECT
    icp."cust_id",
    icp."total_profit",
    FLOOR((icp."total_profit" - ps.min_profit) / ps.interval_size) + 1 AS profit_bucket
  FROM italian_customers_profit icp
  CROSS JOIN profit_stats ps
)
SELECT
  'Bucket' || CASE WHEN profit_bucket > 10 THEN 10 ELSE profit_bucket END AS Profit_Bucket,
  COUNT("cust_id") AS Number_of_Customers,
  MAX("total_profit") AS Max_Profit,
  MIN("total_profit") AS Min_Profit
FROM bucketed_customers
GROUP BY CASE WHEN profit_bucket > 10 THEN 10 ELSE profit_bucket END
ORDER BY Profit_Bucket;
```

**Notes:**

- The `FLOOR` function calculates the profit bucket based on the profit intervals.
- We adjust the bucket number to ensure it doesn't exceed 10.
- This query segments customers into ten buckets based on equal profit intervals and computes the required metrics.

**Final Output Format:**

```csv
Profit_Bucket,Number_of_Customers,Max_Profit,Min_Profit
Bucket1,number1:int,max_profit1:float,min_profit1:float
Bucket2,number2:int,max_profit2:float,min_profit2:float
Bucket3,number3:int,max_profit3:float,min_profit3:float
Bucket4,number4:int,max_profit4:float,min_profit4:float
Bucket5,number5:int,max_profit5:float,min_profit5:float
Bucket6,number6:int,max_profit6:float,min_profit6:float
Bucket7,number7:int,max_profit7:float,min_profit7:float

Bucket9,number9:int,max_profit9:float,min_profit9:float
Bucket10,number10:int,max_profit10:float,min_profit10:float
(Attention: answer in ten rows)
```

**Reminder:**

Ensure all table and column names are correctly spelled, and all quotation marks are properly matched in your SQL queries.

If you encounter any further errors or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

2025-01-25 04:58:34 - root - INFO - The syntax error in your SQL query is due to a mismatched quotation mark in the `WHERE` clause, specifically in the date `'2021-12-31"`.

**Issue in Your Query:**

```sql
WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31" AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
```

- The ending date `'2021-12-31"` starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`.
- This mismatch causes the SQL parser to encounter a syntax error near `WHERE` because it cannot properly parse the string literal.

**Correction:**

Ensure that string literals like dates are enclosed with matching single quotes `'`.

**Corrected `WHERE` Clause:**

```sql
WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31' AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql

GROUP BY s."cust_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks:** In SQL, string literals (like date strings) should be enclosed in single quotes `'`. Double quotes `"` are generally used for identifiers like table names or column names that might conflict with reserved words or contain special characters.
- **Date Strings:** Make sure both the start and end date strings are properly enclosed with single quotes.

---

**Next Steps:**

Now that the syntax error is fixed, you can run the corrected query to obtain the total profit for each Italian customer in December 2021.

**Proceeding with the Task:**

1. **Calculate Total Profit per Italian Customer:**

   - Execute the corrected query to get each Italian customer's `cust_id` and their `total_profit` for December 2021.

2. **Determine Profit Intervals:**

   - Find the **maximum** and **minimum** `total_profit` values from the result.
   - Calculate the **profit interval size**:
     \[
     \text{Interval Size} = \frac{\text{Max Profit} - \text{Min Profit}}{10}
     \]

3. **Assign Customers to Profitability Buckets:**

   - For each customer, determine their bucket based on their `total_profit`:
     - **Bucket 1:** `Min Profit` ≤ `total_profit` < `Min Profit` + `Interval Size`
     - **Bucket 2:** `Min Profit` + `Interval Size` ≤ `total_profit` < `Min Profit` + 2 × `Interval Size`
     - And so on, up to **Bucket 10**.

4. **Calculate Metrics for Each Bucket:**

   - **Number of Customers:** Count how many customers fall into each bucket.
   - **Maximum Profit:** The highest `total_profit` in each bucket.
   - **Minimum Profit:** The lowest `total_profit` in each bucket.

---

**SQL Query to Segment Customers into Ten Profitability Buckets:**

Here's how you can modify your SQL code to perform the segmentation and calculate the required metrics:

```sql
WITH italian_customers_profit AS (
  SELECT s."cust_id", SUM(s."amount_sold" - (s."quantity_sold" * c."unit_cost")) AS "total_profit"
  FROM "sales" AS s
  JOIN "customers" AS cu ON s."cust_id" = cu."cust_id"
  JOIN "countries" AS co ON cu."country_id" = co."country_id"
  JOIN "costs" AS c ON s."prod_id" = c."prod_id" AND s."time_id" = c."time_id"
  WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31' AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
  GROUP BY s."cust_id"
),
profit_stats AS (
  SELECT
    MAX("total_profit") AS max_profit,
    MIN("total_profit") AS min_profit,
    (MAX("total_profit") - MIN("total_profit")) / 10.0 AS interval_size
  FROM italian_customers_profit
),
bucketed_customers AS (
  SELECT
    icp."cust_id",
    icp."total_profit",
    CASE
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 1 THEN 1
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 2 THEN 2
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 3 THEN 3
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 4 THEN 4
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 5 THEN 5
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 6 THEN 6
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 7 THEN 7
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 8 THEN 8
      WHEN icp."total_profit" < ps.min_profit + ps.interval_size * 9 THEN 9
      ELSE 10
    END AS profit_bucket
  FROM italian_customers_profit icp
  CROSS JOIN profit_stats ps
)
SELECT
  'Bucket' || bucketed_customers.profit_bucket AS Profit_Bucket,
  COUNT(bucketed_customers."cust_id") AS Number_of_Customers,
  MAX(bucketed_customers."total_profit") AS Max_Profit,
  MIN(bucketed_customers."total_profit") AS Min_Profit
FROM bucketed_customers
GROUP BY bucketed_customers.profit_bucket
ORDER BY bucketed_customers.profit_bucket;
```

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task of segmenting Italian customers into ten profitability buckets for December 2021, we need to identify relevant tables and columns that will help us calculate the profit per customer and filter the required data.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **`customers` table:**
  - `cust_id`: Customer identifier (to link with sales)
  - `country_id`: Identifier for the customer's country (to link with countries)
  
- **`countries` table:**
  - `country_id`: Country identifier (to link with customers)
  - `country_name`: Name of the country (to identify Italian customers)
  
- **`sales` table:**
  - `cust_id`: Customer identifier (to link with customers)
  - `time_id`: Date of the sale (to filter sales in December 2021)
  - `quantity_sold`: Quantity of products sold
  - `amount_sold`: Total sales amount (to calculate revenue)
  
- **`costs` table:**
  - `prod_id`: Product identifier (to link with sales)
  - `time_id`: Date of the cost entry (to align with sales date)
  - `channel_id`, `promo_id`: Identifiers (to match specific sales)
  - `unit_cost`: Cost per unit (to calculate total cost)

- **`products` table:**
  - `prod_id`: Product identifier (to link with sales and costs)

- **`times` table:**
  - `time_id`: Date identifier (to use consistent date formats)

**Conditions and Filters:**

- Filter customers from Italy (`country_name = 'Italy'`).
- Select sales data for December 2021.
- Calculate profit per customer (total revenue minus total cost).
- Segment profit into ten equal intervals (buckets).

---

To understand the data and prepare for the calculation, here are 10 SQL queries exploring the relevant data:

1. **List of Italian Customers**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT c."cust_id"
   FROM "customers" AS c
   JOIN "countries" AS co ON c."country_id" = co."country_id"
   WHERE co."country_name" = 'Italy'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Sales Records for December 2021**

   ```sql
   SELECT s."cust_id", s."prod_id", s."time_id", s."quantity_sold", s."amount_sold"
   FROM "sales" AS s
   WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Costs Associated with Sales in December 2021**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."prod_id", c."time_id", c."unit_cost"
   FROM "costs" AS c
   WHERE c."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Sales Joined with Costs**

   ```sql
   SELECT s."cust_id", s."prod_id", s."quantity_sold", s."amount_sold", c."unit_cost"
   FROM "sales" AS s
   JOIN "costs" AS c ON s."prod_id" = c."prod_id" AND s."time_id" = c."time_id"
   WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate Profit per Sale**

   ```sql
   SELECT s."cust_id", s."amount_sold" - (s."quantity_sold" * c."unit_cost") AS "profit"
   FROM "sales" AS s
   JOIN "costs" AS c ON s."prod_id" = c."prod_id" AND s."time_id" = c."time_id"
   WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Total Profit per Customer in December 2021**

   ```sql
   SELECT s."cust_id", SUM(s."amount_sold" - (s."quantity_sold" * c."unit_cost")) AS "total_profit"
   FROM "sales" AS s
   JOIN "costs" AS c ON s."prod_id" = c."prod_id" AND s."time_id" = c."time_id"
   WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31'
   GROUP BY s."cust_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Total Profit for Italian Customers**

   ```sql
   SELECT s."cust_id", SUM(s."amount_sold" - (s."quantity_sold" * c."unit_cost")) AS "total_profit"
   FROM "sales" AS s
   JOIN "customers" AS cu ON s."cust_id" = cu."cust_id"
   JOIN "countries" AS co ON cu."country_id" = co."country_id"
   JOIN "costs" AS c ON s."prod_id" = c."prod_id" AND s."time_id" = c."time_id"
   WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31" AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
   GROUP BY s."cust_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Distinct Dates in the `times` Table**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "time_id"
   FROM "times"
   WHERE "time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List of Products Sold to Italian Customers**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT s."prod_id", p."prod_name"
   FROM "sales" AS s
   JOIN "customers" AS cu ON s."cust_id" = cu."cust_id"
   JOIN "countries" AS co ON cu."country_id" = co."country_id"
   JOIN "products" AS p ON s."prod_id" = p."prod_id"
   WHERE co."country_name" = 'Italy'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Total Quantity Sold per Product to Italian Customers**

    ```sql
    SELECT s."prod_id", SUM(s."quantity_sold") AS "total_quantity"
    FROM "sales" AS s
    JOIN "customers" AS cu ON s."cust_id" = cu."cust_id"
    JOIN "countries" AS co ON cu."country_id" = co."country_id"
    WHERE s."time_id" BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2021-12-31' AND co."country_name" = 'Italy'
    GROUP BY s."prod_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help us explore the data necessary for segmentation:

- **Queries 1 & 2**: Identify Italian customers and sales records for December 2021.
- **Queries 3 & 4**: Explore costs associated with those sales.
- **Query 5**: Calculate profit per sale.
- **Query 6**: Aggregate profit per customer.
- **Query 7**: Focus on Italian customers' profits.
- **Query 8**: Confirm the dates in December 2021 are correctly formatted.
- **Queries 9 & 10**: Understand which products are involved and their sales quantities.

By analyzing these results, we can proceed to segment the Italian customers into ten profitability buckets and calculate the required metrics for each bucket.Query:

Task: Can you segment Italian customers into ten profitability buckets for December 2021, using equal profit intervals, and calculate the following for each bucket in December 2021: the number of customers, maximum profit, and minimum profit?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: We have segmented Italian customers into ten profitability buckets for December 2021, using equal profit intervals. For each bucket, we have calculated the number of customers, maximum profit, and minimum profit.

```csv
Profit_Bucket,Number_of_Customers,Max_Profit,Min_Profit
Bucket1,number1:int,max_profit1:float,min_profit1:float
Bucket2,number2:int,max_profit2:float,min_profit2:float
Bucket3,number3:int,max_profit3:float,min_profit3:float
Bucket4,number4:int,max_profit4:float,min_profit4:float
Bucket5,number5:int,max_profit5:float,min_profit5:float
Bucket6,number6:int,max_profit6:float,min_profit6:float
Bucket7,number7:int,max_profit7:float,min_profit7:float
Bucket8,number8:int,max_profit8:float,min_profit8:float
Bucket9,number9:int,max_profit9:float,min_profit9:float
Bucket10,number10:int,max_profit10:float,min_profit10:float
(Attention: answer in ten rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 05:00:46 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you segment Italian customers into ten profitability buckets for December 2021, using equal profit intervals, and calculate the following for each bucket in December 2021: the number of customers, maximum profit, and minimum profit?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: We have segmented Italian customers into ten profitability buckets for December 2021, using equal profit intervals. For each bucket, we have calculated the number of customers, maximum profit, and minimum profit.
