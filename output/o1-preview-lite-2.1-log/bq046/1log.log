TCGA-A6-2670,Redaction,Subject withdrew consent,TCGA policy allows the distribution of data from a subject withdrawal provided the data have been created prior to the withdrawal date. In practice this means no new Level 1 data may be created but new Level 2 and Level 3 data may be created provided it is based on the original Level 1 data. Level 1 data created after the withdrawal data will not be accepted by the DCC.

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Find case barcodes and their corresponding GDC file URLs for female patients aged 30 or younger diagnosed with breast cancer, whose clinical history includes problematic prior treatments for other cancers or redacted annotations. Only consider relevant clinical and annotation data from TCGA with GDC archive release 14.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The following table provides the case barcodes and their corresponding GDC file URLs for female patients aged 30 or younger diagnosed with breast cancer, whose clinical history includes problematic prior treatments for other cancers or redacted annotations, based on TCGA clinical and annotation data from GDC archive release 14.

```csv
case_barcode,file_gdc_url
case_barcode1:str,file_gdc_url1:str
case_barcode2:str,file_gdc_url2:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 17:35:28 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Find case barcodes and their corresponding GDC file URLs for female patients aged 30 or younger diagnosed with breast cancer, whose clinical history includes problematic prior treatments for other cancers or redacted annotations. Only consider relevant clinical and annotation data from TCGA with GDC archive release 14., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: The following table provides the case barcodes and their corresponding GDC file URLs for female patients aged 30 or younger diagnosed with breast cancer, whose clinical history includes problematic prior treatments for other cancers or redacted annotations, based on TCGA clinical and annotation data from GDC archive release 14.

```csv
case_barcode,file_gdc_url
case_barcode1:str,file_gdc_url1:str
case_barcode2:str,file_gdc_url2:str
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
