After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Data Filtering:**
   - **`1result.sql`** includes conditions to exclude records with `NULL` or zero values for `category_name`, `sale_dollars`, and `volume_sold_liters`:
     ```sql
     WHERE
       category_name IS NOT NULL
       AND sale_dollars > 0
       AND volume_sold_liters > 0
     ```
   - This ensures that the calculation of average price per liter is accurate and avoids division by zero errors.

2. **Computation of Average Prices:**
   - **`1result.sql`** computes the average price per liter for each category and year in a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `avg_prices`:
     ```sql
     WITH avg_prices AS (
       SELECT
         category_name,
         EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date`) AS year,
         SUM(sale_dollars) / SUM(volume_sold_liters) AS avg_price_per_liter
       FROM
         `bigquery-public-data.iowa_liquor_sales.sales`
       WHERE
         ...
       GROUP BY
         category_name,
         year
     ),
     ```
   - This provides a pre-aggregated dataset that can be efficiently used in subsequent queries.

3. **Selection of Top Categories:**
   - The query then identifies the top 10 categories in 2021 based on the highest average price per liter:
     ```sql
     top_categories AS (
       SELECT
         category_name
       FROM
         avg_prices
       WHERE
         year = 2021
       ORDER BY
         avg_price_per_liter DESC
       LIMIT
         10
     )
     ```
   - By using the pre-aggregated `avg_prices` CTE, it ensures consistency in the data used for ranking categories.

4. **Final Result Assembly:**
   - The query joins `avg_prices` with `top_categories` to retrieve the average prices per liter for 2019, 2020, and 2021 for the top categories:
     ```sql
     SELECT
       avg_prices.category_name,
       avg_prices.year,
       ROUND(avg_prices.avg_price_per_liter, 4) AS avg_price_per_liter
     FROM
       avg_prices
     JOIN
       top_categories USING (category_name)
     ORDER BY
       avg_prices.category_name,
       avg_prices.year;
     ```
   - The result is a comprehensive and accurate comparison of average prices over the three years.

5. **Data Integrity:**
   - By explicitly handling `NULL` and zero values, **`1result.sql`** ensures data integrity and reliability of the computed averages.
   - **`0result.sql`** lacks these data validations, which could lead to inaccurate results due to division by zero or inclusion of irrelevant data.

Therefore, the correct SQL query that fulfills the task requirements is:

1result.sql
