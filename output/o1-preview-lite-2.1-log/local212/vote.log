After comparing the two SQL queries, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct query to use. Here's the reasoning:

**Reason:**

- **Filtering Delivered Deliveries:** The query in `1result.sql` includes the condition `AND LOWER(d.delivery_status) = 'delivered'` in the `WHERE` clause. This ensures that only deliveries with the status 'Delivered' are counted. It's important to consider only completed deliveries to accurately calculate the average number of daily deliveries per driver.

- **Accuracy in Calculations:** By filtering out deliveries that were canceled or not completed, we prevent inflating the delivery counts. This leads to a more accurate reflection of each driver's performance based on actual deliveries made.

- **Alignment with Business Metrics:** Typically, performance metrics for delivery drivers are measured based on successful deliveries. Including only 'Delivered' statuses aligns with how businesses assess driver efficiency.

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the appropriate SQL query to find the 5 delivery drivers with the highest average number of daily deliveries based on completed deliveries.
