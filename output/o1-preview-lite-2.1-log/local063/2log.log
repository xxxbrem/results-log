2025-01-24 22:41:34 - root - INFO - The error "datatype mismatch" occurs because the `LIMIT` clause expects an integer value, but the expression `(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "prod_id") * 0.2 FROM "sales")` may return a non-integer (floating-point) value. To fix this, we need to ensure that the value passed to `LIMIT` is an integer. We can achieve this by casting the result to an integer using `CAST(... AS INTEGER)`.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT s."prod_id", SUM(s."amount_sold") AS total_sales
FROM "sales" s
JOIN "customers" c ON s."cust_id" = c."cust_id"
JOIN "countries" co ON c."country_id" = co."country_id"
WHERE co."country_iso_code" = 'US'
  AND s."promo_id" = 999
GROUP BY s."prod_id"
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT (SELECT CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT s2."prod_id") * 0.2 AS INTEGER) FROM "sales" s2);
```

**Explanation:**

- **Casting to Integer:** We wrapped the subquery in the `LIMIT` clause with `CAST(... AS INTEGER)` to ensure the result is an integer.
- **Subquery Alias Correction:** In the subquery inside the `LIMIT`, we aliased the `sales` table as `s2` to avoid ambiguity since we are already using `s` in the main query.

This adjustment should resolve the "datatype mismatch" error and correctly limit the number of results to the top 20% of products by total sales.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables, Columns, and Potential Usage:**

1. **sales**
   - `prod_id`: Identifies the product sold; links to the `products` table.
   - `cust_id`: Identifies the customer; links to the `customers` table.
   - `time_id`: Indicates the date of sale; links to the `times` table.
   - `promo_id`: Indicates if a promotion was applied; used to filter out sales with promotions.
   - `quantity_sold`: Used to calculate total units sold per product.
   - `amount_sold`: Used to calculate total sales amount per product.

2. **products**
   - `prod_id`: Product identifier; links to the `sales` table.
   - `prod_name`: Name of the product; used for output.

3. **customers**
   - `cust_id`: Customer identifier; links to the `sales` table.
   - `country_id`: Identifies the customer's country; links to the `countries` table.

4. **countries**
   - `country_id`: Country identifier; links to the `customers` table.
   - `country_iso_code`: Used to filter for the United States (`'US'`).

5. **times**
   - `time_id`: Date identifier; links to the `sales` table.
   - `calendar_year`: Used to filter sales in 2019 and 2020.
   - `calendar_quarter_number`: Used to filter sales in Q4.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Sales in the US**: `countries.country_iso_code = 'US'`.
- **Sales without Promotions**: `sales.promo_id IS NULL` or `sales.promo_id = 0`.
- **Sales in Q4 of 2019 and 2020**:
  - `times.calendar_year = 2019` and `times.calendar_quarter_number = 4`.
  - `times.calendar_year = 2020` and `times.calendar_quarter_number = 4`.
- **Top 20% Products by Total Sales**: Calculate total sales per product and select the top 20%.
  
**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **List All Products:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "prod_id", "prod_name"
   FROM "products"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List All Country ISO Codes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country_iso_code"
   FROM "countries"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find Customers in the US:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c."cust_id"
   FROM "customers" c
   JOIN "countries" co ON c."country_id" = co."country_id"
   WHERE co."country_iso_code" = 'US'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List Promotion IDs Used in Sales:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "promo_id"
   FROM "sales"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Which product has the smallest change in sales share for each product from the top 20% of products by total sales between Q4 in 2019 and 2020 in US without any promotion?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name
name:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This table shows the product with the smallest change in sales share between Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 in the US without any promotion, among the top 20% of products by total sales..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 22:44:23 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which product has the smallest change in sales share for each product from the top 20% of products by total sales between Q4 in 2019 and 2020 in US without any promotion?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product_Name
name:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This table shows the product with the smallest change in sales share between Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 in the US without any promotion, among the top 20% of products by total sales. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
