- `nppes_provider_state`: State code of the provider. Used to filter data by state (e.g., 'NY' for New York).
- `total_claim_count`: Represents the number of Medicare Part D Claims, including refills. Used to calculate total prescriptions.
- `total_drug_cost`: Represents the aggregate cost paid for all claims. Used to calculate total drug costs.
- `generic_name`: Generic name of the drug. May be useful for grouping drugs.
- `npi`: National Provider Identifier. Could be used to identify unique providers if needed.
- `bene_count`: Number of Medicare Beneficiaries. Could provide additional insights.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- Filter by `nppes_provider_state = 'NY'` to focus on New York State.
- Filter by `drug_name = 'Specific Drug'` to focus on the top drug identified.
- Group by `drug_name` or `nppes_provider_state` to aggregate data.
- Order by `SUM(total_claim_count)` or `SUM(total_drug_cost)` to rank results.

    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
    WHERE drug_name = 'Top Drug Name'
    GROUP BY specialty_description
    ORDER BY total_claims DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Compare total drug costs between brand-name and generic versions of the top drug.**

    Suppose the generic name is known from previous queries.

    ```sql
    SELECT drug_name, SUM(total_drug_cost) AS total_cost, SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.part_d_prescriber_2014`
    WHERE generic_name = 'Top Generic Name'
    GROUP BY drug_name
    ORDER BY total_cost DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: For the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014, could you list the top five states with the highest total claim counts for this drug? Please also include their total claim counts and total drug costs. 

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
State,Total_Claim_Count,Total_Drug_Cost
state1:str,claim_count1:int,drug_cost1:float
state2:str,claim_count2:int,drug_cost2:float
state3:str,claim_count3:int,drug_cost3:float
state4:str,claim_count4:int,drug_cost4:float
state5:str,claim_count5:int,drug_cost5:float
(Attention: answer in five rows)
```

To solve this task, we first identified the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014 by summing the `total_claim_count` for each `drug_name` where `nppes_provider_state` is 'NY'. After determining the top drug, we then calculated the total claim counts and total drug costs for this drug across all states. We aggregated the data by state, summing `total_claim_count` and `total_drug_cost`, and selected the top five states with the highest total claim counts. The results are presented in the table above..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['hcpcs', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd10_procedures_2019', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['home_health_agencies_2013', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'hospital_general_info', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['care_site', 'concept', 'concept_ancestor', 'concept_class', 'concept_relationship', 'condition_era', 'condition_occurrence', 'cost', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'domain', 'dose_era', 'drug_era', 'drug_exposure', 'drug_strength', 'location', 'observation', 'observation_period', 'payer_plan_period', 'person', 'procedure_occurrence', 'provider', 'relationship', 'vocabulary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
