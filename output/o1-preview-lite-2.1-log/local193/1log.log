Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **payment**
   - `payment_id`: Unique identifier for each payment.
   - `customer_id`: Identifies which customer made the payment.
   - `amount`: The amount paid in each transaction (used to calculate sales).
   - `payment_date`: Timestamp of when the payment was made (used to determine if it falls within the 7-day and 30-day periods).

2. **customer**
   - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.
   - `create_date`: The date and time when the customer was created (potential initial purchase date, though actual purchase data is in `payment`).

**Potential Usage:**

- **`payment.amount`**: To calculate the total lifetime sales (LTV) per customer by summing this value.
- **`payment.payment_date`**: To determine the timing of each payment relative to the customer's initial purchase.
- **`customer.customer_id`**: To link customers with their payments.
- **Conditions:**
  - Exclude customers whose total lifetime sales are zero.
  - Calculate time periods based on exact 7 and 30 days (including hours, minutes, seconds) from the initial purchase date.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List of distinct customer IDs from the payment table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM payment LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Total lifetime sales (LTV) per customer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_ltv
   FROM payment
   GROUP BY customer_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Earliest payment date (initial purchase date) per customer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT customer_id, MIN(payment_date) AS first_purchase_date
   FROM payment
   GROUP BY customer_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Customers with zero lifetime sales (should be excluded):**

   ```sql
   SELECT customer_id
   FROM payment
   GROUP BY customer_id
   HAVING SUM(amount) = 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List of all customers from the customer table who have made no payments:**

   ```sql
   SELECT customer_id
   FROM customer
   WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM payment)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Payment amounts and dates for a specific customer (e.g., customer_id = 1):**

   ```sql
   SELECT amount, payment_date
   FROM payment
   WHERE customer_id = 1
   ORDER BY payment_date
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Total payments within the first 7 days after initial purchase for each customer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.customer_id, SUM(p.amount) AS amount_first_7_days
   FROM payment p
   JOIN (
     SELECT customer_id, MIN(payment_date) AS first_purchase_date
     FROM payment
     GROUP BY customer_id
   ) fp ON p.customer_id = fp.customer_id
   WHERE p.payment_date >= fp.first_purchase_date
     AND p.payment_date < DATETIME(fp.first_purchase_date, '+7 days')
   GROUP BY p.customer_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Total payments within the first 30 days after initial purchase for each customer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.customer_id, SUM(p.amount) AS amount_first_30_days
   FROM payment p
   JOIN (
     SELECT customer_id, MIN(payment_date) AS first_purchase_date
     FROM payment
     GROUP BY customer_id
   ) fp ON p.customer_id = fp.customer_id
   WHERE p.payment_date >= fp.first_purchase_date
     AND p.payment_date < DATETIME(fp.first_purchase_date, '+30 days')
   GROUP BY p.customer_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Percentage of total LTV that occurs in the first 7 days for each customer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.customer_id,
     (SUM(CASE WHEN p.payment_date >= fp.first_purchase_date AND p.payment_date < DATETIME(fp.first_purchase_date, '+7 days') THEN p.amount ELSE 0 END) * 100.0
      / SUM(p.amount)) AS percentage_first_7_days

     FROM payment
     GROUP BY customer_id
   ) fp ON p.customer_id = fp.customer_id
   GROUP BY p.customer_id
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Percentage of total LTV that occurs in the first 30 days for each customer:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p.customer_id,
      (SUM(CASE WHEN p.payment_date >= fp.first_purchase_date AND p.payment_date < DATETIME(fp.first_purchase_date, '+30 days') THEN p.amount ELSE 0 END) * 100.0

    ) fp ON p.customer_id = fp.customer_id
    GROUP BY p.customer_id
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Average total lifetime sales (LTV) across all customers with non-zero lifetime sales:**

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(total_ltv) AS average_ltv
    FROM (
      SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_ltv

Task: Could you find out the average percentage of the total lifetime sales (LTV) that occur in the first 7 and 30 days after a customer's initial purchase? Also, include the average total lifetime sales (LTV). Please exclude customers with zero lifetime sales. The percentage should be shown with %, and the 7- and 30-day periods should be based on the exact number of hours-minutes-seconds, not calendar days.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To find out the average percentage of the total lifetime sales (LTV) that occur in the first 7 and 30 days after a customer's initial purchase, we perform the following steps:

1. **Calculate Total Lifetime Sales (LTV)**: For each customer with non-zero lifetime sales, sum the `amount` from the `payment` table.
2. **Determine First Purchase Date**: Find the earliest `payment_date` for each customer to establish their initial purchase date.
3. **Calculate Sales in First 7 and 30 Days**:
   - Sum the `amount` of payments made within the first 7 days (exact hours-minutes-seconds) after the initial purchase.
   - Sum the `amount` of payments made within the first 30 days after the initial purchase.
4. **Compute Percentages**:
   - Calculate the percentage of LTV within the first 7 days: `(Sales in First 7 Days / Total LTV) * 100`.
   - Calculate the percentage of LTV within the first 30 days: `(Sales in First 30 Days / Total LTV) * 100`.
5. **Calculate Averages**: Compute the average LTV and the average percentages across all customers with non-zero lifetime sales.

The results are as follows:

```csv
Average_LTV,Percentage_First_7_Days,Percentage_First_30_Days
average_ltv:float>0,percentage_7_days:0<=float<=100,percentage_30_days:0<=float<=100
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This table presents:
- **Average_LTV**: The average total lifetime sales per customer.
- **Percentage_First_7_Days**: The average percentage of LTV that occurs within the first 7 days after the initial purchase.
- **Percentage_First_30_Days**: The average percentage of LTV that occurs within the first 30 days after the initial purchase..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
