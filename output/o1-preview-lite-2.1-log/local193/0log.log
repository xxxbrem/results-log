Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **payment**
  - **customer_id**: Identifies each customer. Used to group payments by customer.
  - **amount**: Represents the payment amount. Used to calculate the total lifetime sales (LTV) per customer.
  - **payment_date**: Indicates when the payment was made. Used to determine the initial purchase date and to calculate sales in the first 7 and 30 days after the initial purchase.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Exclude customers with zero lifetime sales**: Only include customers where the sum of `amount` is greater than zero.
- **Initial Purchase Date**: Use the earliest `payment_date` per customer to establish the starting point for calculating the 7 and 30-day periods.
- **Filter Payments within 7 and 30 Days**: Include payments where `payment_date` falls within 7 or 30 days (exact hours, minutes, seconds) after the initial purchase date.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Get a list of distinct customer IDs from the payment table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "customer_id"
   FROM "payment"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve the total lifetime sales (LTV) per customer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_lifetime_sales"
   FROM "payment"
   GROUP BY "customer_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find customers with non-zero lifetime sales:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_lifetime_sales"
   FROM "payment"
   GROUP BY "customer_id"
   HAVING SUM("amount") > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Determine the initial purchase date for each customer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", MIN("payment_date") AS "initial_purchase_date"
   FROM "payment"
   GROUP BY "customer_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List all payments made within the first 7 days after the initial purchase:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."customer_id", p."payment_date", p."amount"
   FROM "payment" AS p
   INNER JOIN (
       SELECT "customer_id", MIN("payment_date") AS "initial_purchase_date"
       FROM "payment"
       GROUP BY "customer_id"
   ) AS first_purchase ON p."customer_id" = first_purchase."customer_id"
   WHERE p."payment_date" >= first_purchase."initial_purchase_date"
     AND p."payment_date" < datetime(first_purchase."initial_purchase_date", '+7 days')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List all payments made within the first 30 days after the initial purchase:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."customer_id", p."payment_date", p."amount"
   FROM "payment" AS p
   INNER JOIN (
       SELECT "customer_id", MIN("payment_date") AS "initial_purchase_date"
       FROM "payment"
       GROUP BY "customer_id"
   ) AS first_purchase ON p."customer_id" = first_purchase."customer_id"
   WHERE p."payment_date" >= first_purchase."initial_purchase_date"
     AND p."payment_date" < datetime(first_purchase."initial_purchase_date", '+30 days')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate the total sales for each customer within the first 7 days:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."customer_id", SUM(p."amount") AS "sales_first_7_days"
   FROM "payment" AS p
   INNER JOIN (
       SELECT "customer_id", MIN("payment_date") AS "initial_purchase_date"
       FROM "payment"
       GROUP BY "customer_id"
   ) AS first_purchase ON p."customer_id" = first_purchase."customer_id"
   WHERE p."payment_date" >= first_purchase."initial_purchase_date"
     AND p."payment_date" < datetime(first_purchase."initial_purchase_date", '+7 days')
   GROUP BY p."customer_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate the total sales for each customer within the first 30 days:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."customer_id", SUM(p."amount") AS "sales_first_30_days"
   FROM "payment" AS p
   INNER JOIN (
       SELECT "customer_id", MIN("payment_date") AS "initial_purchase_date"
       FROM "payment"
       GROUP BY "customer_id"
   ) AS first_purchase ON p."customer_id" = first_purchase."customer_id"
   WHERE p."payment_date" >= first_purchase."initial_purchase_date"
     AND p."payment_date" < datetime(first_purchase."initial_purchase_date", '+30 days')
   GROUP BY p."customer_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Compare total lifetime sales with sales in the first 7 days per customer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."customer_id",
          SUM(p."amount") AS "total_lifetime_sales",
          SUM(CASE
                WHEN p."payment_date" >= first_purchase."initial_purchase_date"
                 AND p."payment_date" < datetime(first_purchase."initial_purchase_date", '+7 days')
                THEN p."amount"
                ELSE 0
              END) AS "sales_first_7_days"
   FROM "payment" AS p
   INNER JOIN (
       SELECT "customer_id", MIN("payment_date") AS "initial_purchase_date"
       FROM "payment"
       GROUP BY "customer_id"
   ) AS first_purchase ON p."customer_id" = first_purchase."customer_id"
   GROUP BY p."customer_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Compare total lifetime sales with sales in the first 30 days per customer:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."customer_id",
           SUM(p."amount") AS "total_lifetime_sales",
           SUM(CASE
                 WHEN p."payment_date" >= first_purchase."initial_purchase_date"
                  AND p."payment_date" < datetime(first_purchase."initial_purchase_date", '+30 days')
                 THEN p."amount"
                 ELSE 0
               END) AS "sales_first_30_days"
    FROM "payment" AS p
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT "customer_id", MIN("payment_date") AS "initial_purchase_date"
        FROM "payment"
        GROUP BY "customer_id"
    ) AS first_purchase ON p."customer_id" = first_purchase."customer_id"
    GROUP BY p."customer_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help to understand the data related to customers' lifetime sales and their purchasing behavior within the first 7 and 30 days after their initial purchase. By analyzing the outputs of these queries, we can proceed to calculate the average percentages and average LTV as specified in the task.Query:

Task: Could you find out the average percentage of the total lifetime sales (LTV) that occur in the first 7 and 30 days after a customer's initial purchase? Also, include the average total lifetime sales (LTV). Please exclude customers with zero lifetime sales. The percentage should be shown with %, and the 7- and 30-day periods should be based on the exact number of hours-minutes-seconds, not calendar days.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To find out the average percentage of the total lifetime sales (LTV) that occur in the first 7 and 30 days after a customer's initial purchase, we perform the following steps:

1. **Calculate Total Lifetime Sales (LTV)**: For each customer with non-zero lifetime sales, sum the `amount` from the `payment` table.
2. **Determine First Purchase Date**: Find the earliest `payment_date` for each customer to establish their initial purchase date.
3. **Calculate Sales in First 7 and 30 Days**:
   - Sum the `amount` of payments made within the first 7 days (exact hours-minutes-seconds) after the initial purchase.
   - Sum the `amount` of payments made within the first 30 days after the initial purchase.
4. **Compute Percentages**:
   - Calculate the percentage of LTV within the first 7 days: `(Sales in First 7 Days / Total LTV) * 100`.
   - Calculate the percentage of LTV within the first 30 days: `(Sales in First 30 Days / Total LTV) * 100`.
5. **Calculate Averages**: Compute the average LTV and the average percentages across all customers with non-zero lifetime sales.

The results are as follows:

```csv
Average_LTV,Percentage_First_7_Days,Percentage_First_30_Days
average_ltv:float>0,percentage_7_days:0<=float<=100,percentage_30_days:0<=float<=100
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This table presents:
- **Average_LTV**: The average total lifetime sales per customer.
- **Percentage_First_7_Days**: The average percentage of LTV that occurs within the first 7 days after the initial purchase.
- **Percentage_First_30_Days**: The average percentage of LTV that occurs within the first 30 days after the initial purchase..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Also, include the average total lifetime sales (LTV). Please exclude customers with zero lifetime sales. The percentage should be shown with %, and the 7- and 30-day periods should be based on the exact number of hours-minutes-seconds, not calendar days., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find out the average percentage of the total lifetime sales (LTV) that occur in the first 7 and 30 days after a customer's initial purchase, we perform the following steps:

1. **Calculate Total Lifetime Sales (LTV)**: For each customer with non-zero lifetime sales, sum the `amount` from the `payment` table.
2. **Determine First Purchase Date**: Find the earliest `payment_date` for each customer to establish their initial purchase date.
3. **Calculate Sales in First 7 and 30 Days**:
   - Sum the `amount` of payments made within the first 7 days (exact hours-minutes-seconds) after the initial purchase.
   - Sum the `amount` of payments made within the first 30 days after the initial purchase.
4. **Compute Percentages**:
   - Calculate the percentage of LTV within the first 7 days: `(Sales in First 7 Days / Total LTV) * 100`.
   - Calculate the percentage of LTV within the first 30 days: `(Sales in First 30 Days / Total LTV) * 100`.
5. **Calculate Averages**: Compute the average LTV and the average percentages across all customers with non-zero lifetime sales.

The results are as follows:

```csv
Average_LTV,Percentage_First_7_Days,Percentage_First_30_Days
average_ltv:float>0,percentage_7_days:0<=float<=100,percentage_30_days:0<=float<=100
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This table presents:
- **Average_LTV**: The average total lifetime sales per customer.
- **Percentage_First_7_Days**: The average percentage of LTV that occurs within the first 7 days after the initial purchase.
- **Percentage_First_30_Days**: The average percentage of LTV that occurs within the first 30 days after the initial purchase. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
