After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Direction Filter:** The task specifies to find trips from 'Clay St & Drumm St' to 'Sacramento St & Davis St' in **one direction only**. The SQL in **`2result.sql`** includes the condition `AND t.direction = 'I'`, which filters the trips to include only those in the **inbound** direction. This ensures that only trips moving from the start stop to the end stop in the correct direction are selected.

- **Accurate Stop Matching:** The SQL correctly matches the stops by their names without ambiguity, joining on the `stop_name` field and ensuring that `st1.stop_sequence < st2.stop_sequence`, which confirms that 'Clay St & Drumm St' comes before 'Sacramento St & Davis St' in the trip sequence.

- **Required Columns and Format:** The query selects the `departure_time` and `arrival_time` as `Start_Time` and `End_Time`, respectively, and includes the `trip_headsign` for each route. The times are provided in the required 'HH:MM:SS' format.

- **Ordering Results:** The results are ordered by `st1.departure_time`, which organizes the trips chronologically based on their start time from the initial stop.

The other SQLs, **`0result.sql`** and **`1result.sql`**, do not include the direction filter and may include trips in both directions, which does not fully meet the task requirement of considering one direction only.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

2result.sql
