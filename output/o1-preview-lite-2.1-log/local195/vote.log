After comparing the two SQL queries, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

The key difference between the two SQL queries lies in how they define the "top five actors":

1. **`0result.sql`**: This query identifies the top five actors based on the **number of films** they have acted in. It selects actors who have appeared in the most films, regardless of how often those films were rented.

2. **`2result.sql`**: This query identifies the top five actors based on the **number of rentals** their films have received. It selects actors whose films have been rented the most, which directly correlates with customer interest and appeal.

Since we are tasked with determining how widespread the appeal of the top five actors is—specifically by assessing the percentage of customers who have rented films featuring these actors—it is more appropriate to define the top actors based on the **popularity of their films among customers**, as measured by rental counts.

Therefore, **`2result.sql`** provides the correct approach by:

- Identifying the top five actors based on the total number of rentals for their films.
- Calculating the percentage of customers who have rented films featuring these top actors.

This method directly measures customer engagement and accurately reflects the actors' appeal to our customer base.
