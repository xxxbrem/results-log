After comparing both SQL queries, I have identified the key differences and determined which one is more appropriate for the task.

**First SQL Query (1result.sql):**

- Filters orders where `o."status" = 'Complete'`.
- Considers orders from Facebook users between August 2022 and November 2023.
- Calculates the profit without checking if the orders were actually delivered.

**Second SQL Query (2result.sql):**

- Filters orders where `o."status" = 'Complete'`.
- Adds an additional condition `o."delivered_at" IS NOT NULL` to ensure only delivered orders are considered.
- Considers orders from Facebook users between August 2022 and November 2023.
- Calculates the profit more accurately by considering only orders that have been delivered.

**Reasoning:**

The task requires listing the top 5 months from August 2022 to November 2023 where the profit from **Facebook-sourced completed orders** showed the largest month-over-month increase. Profit is calculated as **sales minus costs**.

Including the condition `o."delivered_at" IS NOT NULL` is crucial because:

- **Profit Realization:** Profit is only realized when the product has been delivered to the customer. Orders that are complete but not yet delivered could still be canceled or returned, affecting the actual profit.
- **Data Accuracy:** By ensuring that only delivered orders are included, we get a more accurate representation of the actual profits earned in each month.

Therefore, **the second SQL query (2result.sql) is the correct choice** because it provides a more accurate calculation of profit by considering only delivered orders, aligning with the requirements of the task.
