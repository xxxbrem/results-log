After comparing both SQL queries, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct query for calculating the average number of engaged sessions per user in December 2020.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Association of Parameters:**
  - `0result.sql` uses `MAX(IF(...))` within a `GROUP BY user_pseudo_id, event_timestamp` clause to accurately extract the `ga_session_id` and `session_engaged` parameters for each event timestamp per user. This ensures that each event's parameters are correctly associated with the corresponding user and event time.
  - In contrast, `1result.sql` attempts to extract the parameters using scalar subqueries without grouping, which may lead to incorrect associations if multiple events share the same `user_pseudo_id` but different sessions.

- **Event-Level Precision:**
  - By grouping on `event_timestamp`, `0result.sql` captures the event-level granularity, which is crucial when dealing with event parameters that can vary between events within the same session.
  - `1result.sql` does not account for potential multiple events per user per session, possibly resulting in inaccurate counts.

- **Reliable Counting of Engaged Sessions:**
  - `0result.sql` filters out events where `session_engaged` is not 1 and only counts distinct `ga_session_id`s where `session_engaged = 1`. This approach accurately counts the number of engaged sessions per user.
  - `1result.sql` may count `ga_session_id`s even when `session_engaged` is NULL or not 1 due to how it selects parameters, potentially inflating session counts.

- **Consistent Results:**
  - Although both queries produce similar average values, the method used in `0result.sql` ensures greater accuracy and reliability in the context of session-based analytics.

**Conclusion:**

For the above reasons, **`0result.sql`** is the more appropriate query to use for this calculation.
