2025-01-24 06:59:43 - root - INFO - Understood. Here's a simplified SQL query that retrieves the scoring plays for games between teams with the aliases 'Wildcats' and 'Fighting Irish', arranged chronologically. This query aims to provide data even if the exact game in the 2014 season isn't found by relaxing some conditions.

```sql
SELECT
  pbp.period,
  pbp.game_clock,
  pbp.team_alias AS scoring_team,
  pbp.points_scored,
  pbp.event_description AS description
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr` AS pbp
JOIN
  `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_games_sr` AS games
ON
  pbp.game_id = games.game_id
WHERE
  (
    (LOWER(games.h_alias) LIKE '%wildcats%' AND LOWER(games.a_alias) LIKE '%fighting irish%')
    OR
    (LOWER(games.a_alias) LIKE '%wildcats%' AND LOWER(games.h_alias) LIKE '%fighting irish%')
  )
  AND pbp.points_scored IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
  pbp.elapsed_time_sec ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

This query selects:

- **period**: The period in which the scoring event occurred.
- **game_clock**: The time remaining in the period at the time of the event.
- **scoring_team**: The alias of the team that scored (either 'Wildcats' or 'Fighting Irish').
- **points_scored**: The points scored in the event.
- **description**: A description of the scoring event.

It retrieves scoring plays from any game where a team with 'Wildcats' in its alias played against a team with 'Fighting Irish' in its alias. The results are ordered chronologically based on the elapsed time in the game. The `LIMIT 100` ensures that up to 100 records are returned.

Feel free to adjust the query further if needed.

   SELECT DISTINCT `game_id`, `h_market`, `h_alias`, `a_market`, `a_alias`, `season`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_games_sr`
   WHERE `season` = 2014
     AND (LOWER(`h_alias`) LIKE '%wildcats%' OR LOWER(`a_alias`) LIKE '%wildcats%')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List all games involving 'Fighting Irish' in 2014**

    ORDER BY `elapsed_time_sec`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Queries 1, 4, 7, and 8:** Help identify the exact `team_id` and `market` for the 'Wildcats' and 'Fighting Irish' teams to distinguish between multiple teams with the same alias.
  
- **Queries 2, 5, and 6:** Aim to find the specific game(s) between the 'Wildcats' and 'Fighting Irish' during the 2014 season by checking all games where either team has the specified aliases.

- **Query 3 and 10:** Retrieve play-by-play data for the specific game once the `game_id` is identified, focusing on scoring plays and including details like period, game clock, team scores, scoring team, and event description.

- **Query 9:** Provides the scheduled date of the game to ensure the correct game is identified, especially if there are multiple matchups between the teams in the season.

---

By executing these queries, we can gather all necessary information to create a detailed summary of the scoring plays between the 'Wildcats' and the 'Fighting Irish' in their 2014 season game.

**Note:** Replace `'specific_game_id'` with the actual `game_id` obtained from Query 2 after identifying the correct game.

---

### **Next Steps**

After collecting the data:

1. **Identify the Correct Teams:**
   - Determine which 'Wildcats' team played against the 'Fighting Irish' in 2014 (e.g., Kentucky Wildcats vs. Notre Dame Fighting Irish).

2. **Extract the Game ID:**
   - Use the `game_id` from the identified game to retrieve play-by-play data.

3. **Compile Scoring Plays:**
   - Use Query 10 to get all scoring events.
   - Accumulate team scores as you iterate through the events to include cumulative team scores.

4. **Arrange Chronologically:**
   - Use `elapsed_time_sec` to order the events.

5. **Prepare the Summary Table:**
   - Create a table with columns: `Period`, `Game_clock`, `Team_scores`, `Scoring_team`, `Description`.

---

**Example Summary (Partial and Hypothetical):**

```csv
Period,Game_clock,Team_scores,Scoring_team,Description
1,19:45,"Wildcats 2 - Fighting Irish 0",Wildcats,"Player A made a layup"
1,19:10,"Wildcats 2 - Fighting Irish 2",Fighting Irish,"Player B scored a jump shot"
1,18:30,"Wildcats 5 - Fighting Irish 2",Wildcats,"Player C hit a three-pointer"
...
```

Task: Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To summarize the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, arranged chronologically with the requested details, here is the data in CSV format:

```csv
Period,Game_clock,Team_scores,Scoring_team,Description
period:int,game_clock:str,team_scores:str,scoring_team:str,description:str
...
```

This table includes the period of play, the game clock showing the time remaining, the cumulative team scores at each scoring event, the team that scored (either "Wildcats" or "Fighting Irish"), and a description of the scoring event..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 07:08:09 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To summarize the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, arranged chronologically with the requested details, here is the data in CSV format:

```csv
Period,Game_clock,Team_scores,Scoring_team,Description
period:int,game_clock:str,team_scores:str,scoring_team:str,description:str
...
```

This table includes the period of play, the game clock showing the time remaining, the cumulative team scores at each scoring event, the team that scored (either "Wildcats" or "Fighting Irish"), and a description of the scoring event. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
