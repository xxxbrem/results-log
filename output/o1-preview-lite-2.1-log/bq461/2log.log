1. **`mbb_teams`**: This table contains team information.
   - `id`: Team ID (unique identifier for the team).
   - `market`: School name.
   - `name`: Team name.
   - `alias`: Team nickname (e.g., 'Wildcats', 'Fighting Irish').

   **Potential Usage**: Identify the team IDs for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish.

   **Conditions**:
   - `LOWER(alias) LIKE '%wildcats%'` or `LOWER(alias) LIKE '%fighting irish%'`.

2. **`mbb_games_sr`**: Contains game details.
   - `game_id`: Unique identifier for the game.
   - `season`: Season the game was played in.
   - `h_id`, `h_market`, `h_name`, `h_alias`: Home team details.
   - `a_id`, `a_market`, `a_name`, `a_alias`: Away team details.

   **Potential Usage**: Find the game ID for the game between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in the 2013-2014 season.

   **Conditions**:
   - `season = 2013` (the 2013-14 season is denoted by 2013).
   - Match teams where one is the Wildcats and the other is the Fighting Irish.

3. **`mbb_pbp_sr`**: Play-by-play data for games.
   - `game_id`: Game identifier (to filter the specific game).
   - `season`: Season the game was played in.
   - `period`: Period of the game.
   - `game_clock`: Time remaining in the period.
   - `team_id`, `team_market`, `team_name`: Details of the team involved in the play.
   - `event_type`: Type of event (e.g., 'fieldgoalmade').
   - `points_scored`: Points scored in the play.
   - `description`: Description of the play.
   - `elapsed_time_sec`: Time elapsed in the game (to order the plays chronologically).

   **Potential Usage**: Extract scoring plays and details for the specific game.

   **Conditions**:
   - `game_id` matches the identified game.
   - `points_scored > 0` to filter scoring plays.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Identify Team IDs for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT id, market, name, alias
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_teams`
   WHERE LOWER(alias) LIKE '%wildcats%' OR LOWER(alias) LIKE '%fighting irish%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Alternative Query Including Market Name:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT id, market, name, alias
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_teams`
   WHERE LOWER(alias) LIKE '%wildcats%'
     OR LOWER(market) LIKE '%wildcats%'
     OR LOWER(alias) LIKE '%fighting irish%'
     OR LOWER(market) LIKE '%fighting irish%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Check Available Seasons to Confirm Season Value:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT season
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_games_sr`
   ORDER BY season
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find the Game ID for the Wildcats vs. Fighting Irish Game in the 2013-14 Season:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT game_id, season,
     h_id AS home_team_id, h_market AS home_team_market, h_name AS home_team_name, h_alias AS home_team_alias,
     a_id AS away_team_id, a_market AS away_team_market, a_name AS away_team_name, a_alias AS away_team_alias
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_games_sr`
   WHERE season = 2013
     AND (
       (
         (LOWER(h_alias) LIKE '%wildcats%' OR LOWER(h_market) LIKE '%wildcats%')
         AND (LOWER(a_alias) LIKE '%fighting irish%' OR LOWER(a_market) LIKE '%fighting irish%')
       ) OR (
         (LOWER(h_alias) LIKE '%fighting irish%' OR LOWER(h_market) LIKE '%fighting irish%')
         AND (LOWER(a_alias) LIKE '%wildcats%' OR LOWER(a_market) LIKE '%wildcats%')
       )
     )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Identify Event Types Related to Scoring in Play-by-Play Data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT event_type
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
   WHERE points_scored > 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List All Scoring Plays for the Identified Game:**

   Replace `'specific_game_id'` with the actual game ID obtained from query 4.

   ```sql
   SELECT period, game_clock, team_market AS scoring_team, points_scored, description
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
   WHERE game_id = 'specific_game_id'
     AND points_scored > 0
   ORDER BY period ASC, elapsed_time_sec ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Retrieve Team Scores After Each Scoring Play Using Window Function:**

   ```sql
   SELECT period, game_clock, team_market AS scoring_team, points_scored, description,
     SUM(points_scored) OVER (PARTITION BY team_id ORDER BY elapsed_time_sec) AS team_score
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
   WHERE game_id = 'specific_game_id'
     AND points_scored > 0
   ORDER BY period ASC, elapsed_time_sec ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List Teams Involved in the Specific Game:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT team_id, team_market, team_name
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
   WHERE game_id = 'specific_game_id'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Get All Play-by-Play Events for the Specific Game:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
   WHERE game_id = 'specific_game_id'
   ORDER BY period ASC, elapsed_time_sec ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find the Earliest Scoring Play in the Game:**

    ```sql
    SELECT period, game_clock, team_market AS scoring_team, points_scored, description
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_pbp_sr`
    WHERE game_id = 'specific_game_id'
      AND points_scored > 0
    ORDER BY elapsed_time_sec ASC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the data and extracting the necessary information for the task.

**Note:** Replace `'specific_game_id'` with the actual game ID obtained from query 4. The `season` value `2013` corresponds to the 2013-14 season.

By executing these queries, we can obtain the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event for the game between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in the 2014 season, arranged chronologically.

Remember, all data is retrieved from the tables provided in the database:
- **Database**: `bigquery-public-data`
- **Schema**: `ncaa_basketball`

Task: Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To summarize the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, arranged chronologically with the requested details, here is the data in CSV format:

```csv
Period,Game_clock,Team_scores,Scoring_team,Description
period:int,game_clock:str,team_scores:str,scoring_team:str,description:str
...
```

This table includes the period of play, the game clock showing the time remaining, the cumulative team scores at each scoring event, the team that scored (either "Wildcats" or "Fighting Irish"), and a description of the scoring event..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
