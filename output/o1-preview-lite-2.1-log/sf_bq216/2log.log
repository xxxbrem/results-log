US-5238524-A,A hole masking apparatus for use in the manufacture of a printed wiring board is disclosed. The apparatus comprises first and second positioning sections provided on a conveying path of a base material at a distance apart for stopping the positioning of the base material having a plurality of through holes at respective given position; a masking device provided to respective positioning sections and having a head to paste a seal while supplying and for pasting the seal on through holes by moving the head in such a manner that the head is positioned on through holes which do not require a plugging up thereof; and a reversing section arranged between the first and the second positioning sections and for reversing face and back of the base material on the conveying path thereof.
US-4399807-A,"Automatic overtemperature control system for solar water heater panels is disclosed. In response to lack of liquid circulation through a solar panel, either through loss of liquid or failure to use water heated in the panel valve means are actuated at a preselectable temperature value to introduce cooling water into the circulation system which includes the solar panel. Such system assures the integrity of circulation through the solar panel and against panel degradation due to overheating. Cooling water is added directly to the panel or through an interconnected hot water storage tank. If desired, the system may be used for direct filling the solar panel or as a back-up to conventional float valve operated fill system. The automatic overtemperature control system is applicable either to thermosiphon or pressured circulation through the solar panel to maintain its temperature below a preselected value."
US-3777713-A,"A portable animal feeder includes top and bottom vertically spaced annular rings. A series of angularly disposed posts connect the top and bottom rings and are spaced sufficiently apart to permit the passage of animal heads therethrough. Means are provided to prevent spillage of animal feed placed in the feeder. To facilitate loading of the feed into the device, an optional gate is provided in the side of the feeder. A supporting ring is spaced below the bottom ring by supporting struts, and floor means are mounted in the feeder adjacent the bottom ring."
US-5575347-A,"A suspension device in a crawler vehicle has a vehicle body, a pair of parallel spaced swing beams mounted on a rear portion of the vehicle body by a suspension for angular movement about a first axis located substantially longitudinally centrally thereof, a rear idle wheel rotatably supported on a front portion of each of the swing beams for rotation about a second axis, a rear drive wheel rotatably supported on a rear portion of each of the swing beams for rotation about a third axis, a crawler belt trained around the rear idle wheel and the rear drive wheel, and a front wheel rotatably mounted on a front portion of the vehicle body. The distance from the second axis to the first axis is greater than the distance from the first axis to the third axis. The second axis is positioned on a front end of each of the swing beams, and the third axis is positioned between the first axis and a rear end of each of the swing beams. Preferably, the distance from the second axis to the first axis and the distance from the first axis to the third axis have a ratio of about 2:1."

### IPC Codes: Handling Main IPC Code Selection

When dealing with the `ipc` field in the `patents-public-data.patents.publications` dataset, it is important to understand the structure of this field, especially the subfield `first`. This subfield is a boolean that indicates whether a given IPC code is the main code for the publication number in question. This is crucial because each patent publication can be associated with multiple IPC codes, signifying the various aspects of the technology covered by the patent.

However, not every publication in the dataset has a designated main IPC code. This lack of a clearly identified main IPC code complicates the process of determining the most relevant IPC code for each publication, as selecting a single IPC code from multiple possibilities without clear prioritization can lead to inconsistent or skewed analyses.

This approach ensures a more consistent and representative selection of IPC codes across the dataset, facilitating more accurate and meaningful analysis of patent trends and classifications. By focusing on the most frequently occurring 4-digit IPC code, the view helps overcome the limitations posed by the absence of a designated main IPC code, thereby enhancing the reliability of patent-related studies and insights derived from this data.

Here is an example

```
SELECT 
    t1.publication_number, 
    SUBSTR(ipc_u.code, 0, 4) as ipc4, 
    COUNT(
    SUBSTR(ipc_u.code, 0, 4)
    ) as ipc4_count 
FROM 
    `patents-public-data.patents.publications` t1, 
    UNNEST(ipc) AS ipc_u 
GROUP BY 
    t1.publication_number, 
    ipc4

```



# Text Embeddings (Similarity)

Patent documents are rich with textual data. In fact, most of the information contained in a patent document is text. This includes the `abstract_localized`, `description_localized`, and `claims_localized`. Textual data can be a powerful tool to analyze and compare patent scope and content across patents. However, before being able to use textual data, it needs to be vectorized or transformed into text embeddings that can be used by machine learning models. Therefore, creating text embeddings from the textual data of patents is necessary to compare patent contents. Technically speaking, running an NLP algorithm that creates embeddings for all U.S. patents is computationally difficult.

Nevertheless, Google runs their own machine learning algorithm which transforms patent text metadata into text embeddings which they report in `patents-public-data.google_patents_research.publications` table. The textual embeddings of one patent, without any knowledge on the algorithm being used to create them, are meaningless on their own. However, the embeddings are powerful when it comes to comparing textual content of two or more patents. Embeddings can be used to calculate a similarity score between any two patents. This similarity score is calculated by applying the dot product of the embeddings vector of the patents, as shown below:

The similarity \( \text{Similarty}_{i,k} \) between two patents \( i \) and \( k \) is calculated as the dot product of their embedding vectors:

\[
\text{Similarty}_{i,k} = \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_k
\]

where

\[
\mathbf{v}_i = [v_{i1}, v_{i2}, v_{i3}, \ldots, v_{iN}]
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{v}_k = [v_{k1}, v_{k2}, v_{k3}, \ldots, v_{kN}]
\]

are the embedding vectors for patents \( i \) and \( k \) respectively. The higher the dot product, the more similar the patents.





# Originality (Trajtenberg)

One of the most important measures of a patent is "basicness". The aspects of basicness are tough to measure. Nevertheless, some literature finds that important aspects of these measures are embodied in the relationship between the invention and the technological predcessors and successors it is connected to through, for example, patent citations. We can thus use patent citations to construct measures that identify basicness and appropriability. Trajtenberg et al. 1997 provide a number of these measures. They distinguish between:

1. Forward-looking measures: measures that are derived from the relationship between an invention and subsequent technologies that build upon it. These measures are thus constructed from the forward citations. One example of a forward-looking basicness measure they provide is Generality, which is calculated as:

\[
\text{GENERALITY}_i = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{N_i} \left( \frac{\text{NCITING}_{G_k}}{\text{NCITING}_i} \right)
\]


2. Backward-looking measures: measures that are derived from the relationship between a given patent and the body of knowledge that preceded it. These measure are thus constructed from the backward citations. One example of a backward-looking basicness measure they provide is Orginality, which is calculated as:

\[
\text{ORIGINALITY}_i = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{N_i} \left( \frac{\text{NCITED}_{i,k}}{\text{NCITED}_i} \right)
\]

With **NCITING** and **NCITED** defined as the number of patents citing the focal patent and the number of patents cited by the focal patent, respectively. Index `i` corresponds to the focal patent considered, and `k` is the index of patent classes. For example, **NCITED_2,3** refers to the number of patents in patent class 3 and cited by our focal patent 2.


The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS_GOOGLE': {'PATENTS_GOOGLE': ['ABS_AND_EMB', 'CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task of identifying the top five patents filed in the same year as `US-9741766-B2` that are most similar based on technological similarities, we'll first determine the relevant tables, columns, and conditions needed for the analysis. Then, we'll write SQL queries to explore these tables and understand the data.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **PUBLICATIONS Table:**
   - `"publication_number"`: Used to identify patents.
   - `"filing_date"`: Used to determine the filing year of patents.
   - `"publication_date"`: Additional date information.
   
2. **ABS_AND_EMB Table:**
   - `"publication_number"`: Used to match with the PUBLICATIONS table.
   - `"embedding_v1"`: Contains the embedding vectors for patents.
   - `"title"`: Patent title, useful for additional context.
   - `"abstract"`: Patent abstract, may provide insights.
   - `"cpc"`: CPC codes for the patent, indicating technological areas.

**Conditions to be Used:**

- **Matching Filing Year:** We need patents filed in the same year as `US-9741766-B2`. We'll extract the year from the `"filing_date"` column.
- **Embedding Availability:** Only consider patents that have embeddings in the `"embedding_v1"` column.
- **Excluding the Target Patent:** Ensure that `US-9741766-B2` is not included in the list of similar patents.

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Identify the top five patents filed in the same year as `US-9741766-B2` that are most similar to it based on technological similarities. Please provide the publication numbers.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: By comparing the embedding vectors of patents filed in the same year as `US-9741766-B2`, we identified the top five most similar patents based on technological similarities.

```csv
Publication Number
pub_number1:str
pub_number2:str
pub_number3:str
pub_number4:str
pub_number5:str
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS_GOOGLE': {'PATENTS_GOOGLE': ['ABS_AND_EMB', 'CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
