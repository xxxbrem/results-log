The correct SQL is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

The task requires identifying the port that most frequently lies within the geographical area of named tropical storms in region code `'6585'`, with winds of at least 35 knots in the North Atlantic basin, and which is also located within a specific region intersecting with interstate roads.

Between the two provided SQL queries, `0result.sql` accurately addresses the task's requirements:

1. **Filters Ports in Region '6585':**
   - The query filters ports where `p.region_number = '6585'`.

2. **Selects Named Tropical Storms in North Atlantic with Winds â‰¥ 35 Knots:**
   - It filters hurricanes where:
     - `h.basin = 'NA'` (North Atlantic basin).
     - `h.wmo_wind >= 35` (wind speeds of at least 35 knots).
     - `h.name IS NOT NULL` and `h.name != 'NOT_NAMED'` (to ensure storms are named tropical storms).

3. **Ensures Ports are Within a Specific Region (State):**
   - The query joins with the `states` table and uses `ST_WITHIN(p.port_geom, s.state_geom)` to ensure that ports are located within a specific state or region.

4. **Calculates Proximity Between Ports and Storms:**
   - Uses `ST_DWITHIN(p.port_geom, ST_GEOGPOINT(h.longitude, h.latitude), 100000)` to find hurricanes within 100 km of the ports.

5. **Counts Unique Storm Occurrences:**
   - Groups by `p.port_name` and orders by `COUNT(DISTINCT h.sid) DESC` to identify the port most frequently affected by storms.

6. **Handles the Interstate Roads Criterion:**
   - Although data on interstate roads isn't included in the available datasets, the query includes the necessary spatial and regional filters. Given the limitations, the query satisfies as many conditions as possible.

**Explanation of Choice:**

- **Accuracy:** `0result.sql` closely aligns with the task by incorporating all specified conditions, ensuring a precise match to the requirements.
- **Specific Filters:** It explicitly filters out unnamed storms (`h.name != 'NOT_NAMED'`), which is crucial for focusing on named tropical storms.
- **Conciseness:** The query is straightforward and directly addresses the task without unnecessary complexity.
- **Result Consistency:** Both queries result in `BEAUFORT` as the port, but `0result.sql` does so with a more precise alignment to the task's conditions.

**Note:** While neither query includes data on interstate roads due to dataset limitations, `0result.sql` remains the better choice given it meets all other specified criteria.
