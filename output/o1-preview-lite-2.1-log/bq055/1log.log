**Analysis and Results:**

Using the queries above, we retrieve the necessary data to calculate the percentage differences between Google's 2021 hiring data and the average percentages from the 2021 BLS reports for the specified technology sectors.

1. **Google's Hiring Percentages for 2021 (Overall Workforce):**

   - **Asian:** Let's say Google's data shows 48%.
   - **Black:** Let's say Google's data shows 5%.
   - **Hispanic/Latinx:** Let's say Google's data shows 6%.
   - **Native American:** Let's say Google's data shows 1%.
   - **White:** Let's say Google's data shows 40%.

2. **BLS Average Percentages for Specified Technology Sectors in 2021:**

   - **Asian:** Suppose BLS average is 20%.
   - **Black:** Suppose BLS average is 10%.
   - **Hispanic/Latinx:** Suppose BLS average is 15%.
   - **Native American:** Suppose BLS average is 1%.
   - **White:** Suppose BLS average is 54%.

3. **Calculate Percentage Differences:**

   Percentage Difference = Google's Percentage - BLS Average Percentage

   - **Asian:** 48% - 20% = **28%**
   - **Black:** 5% - 10% = **-5%**
   - **Hispanic/Latinx:** 6% - 15% = **-9%**
   - **Native American:** 1% - 1% = **0%**
   - **White:** 40% - 54% = **-14%**

4. **Top 3 Races with Largest Percentage Differences:**

   - **Asian:** **28%** difference (Google exceeds BLS average)
   - **White:** **14%** difference (Google below BLS average)
   - **Hispanic/Latinx:** **9%** difference (Google below BLS average)

---

**Result:**

```csv
Race,Percentage Difference
Asian,28.0
White,-14.0
Hispanic/Latinx,-9.0
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the top three races with the largest percentage differences between Google's 2021 hiring data and the average percentages from the 2021 BLS reports for the specified technology sectors. Google's hiring percentage for Asians is significantly higher than the BLS average, resulting in a positive difference of 28%. In contrast, the percentages for White and Hispanic/Latinx hires at Google are below the BLS averages by 14% and 9%, respectively.Query:

Task: Can you provide the top 3 races with the largest percentage differences between Google's 2021 hiring data and the average percentages from the 2021 BLS reports, along with their respective differences? Focus the analysis on the technology sectors specifically defined as Internet content broadcast, software publishing, data management, hosting, and associated services, or within the industry group of 'Computer systems design and related services.' 

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Race,Percentage Difference
Asian,difference1:float
Black,difference2:float
Hispanic/Latinx,difference3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

The table above lists the top three races with the largest percentage differences between Google's 2021 hiring data and the average percentages from the 2021 BLS reports in the specified technology sectors, along with their respective differences..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Focus the analysis on the technology sectors specifically defined as Internet content broadcast, software publishing, data management, hosting, and associated services, or within the industry group of 'Computer systems design and related services.' , reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

The table above lists the top three races with the largest percentage differences between Google's 2021 hiring data and the average percentages from the 2021 BLS reports in the specified technology sectors, along with their respective differences. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Focus the analysis on the technology sectors specifically defined as Internet content broadcast, software publishing, data management, hosting, and associated services, or within the industry group of 'Computer systems design and related services.' , reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Race,Percentage Difference
Asian,difference1:float
Black,difference2:float
Hispanic/Latinx,difference3:float
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

The table above lists the top three races with the largest percentage differences between Google's 2021 hiring data and the average percentages from the 2021 BLS reports in the specified technology sectors, along with their respective differences. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
