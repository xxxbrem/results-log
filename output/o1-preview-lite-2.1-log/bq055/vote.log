After comparing both SQL scripts and considering the task requirements, the correct SQL script is **`0result.sql`**. Here's why:

**Reasoning:**

1. **Focus on Technology Sectors:**
   - The task specifically asks to focus the analysis on technology sectors defined as Internet content broadcast, software publishing, data management, hosting, and associated services, or within the industry group of 'Computer systems design and related services'.
   - **`0result.sql`** filters the BLS data using the `industry_group` column with the exact sectors specified:

     ```sql
     WHERE
       year = 2021 AND industry_group IN (
         'Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals',
         'Software publishers',
         'Data processing, hosting, and related services',
         'Computer systems design and related services'
     )
     ```

   - **`2result.sql`**, on the other hand, uses a broader filter on the `industry` column with `LIKE` statements and includes the `industry_group`, but it might capture unintended industries and is less precise.

2. **Using Google's Tech Workforce Data:**
   - **`0result.sql`** correctly uses Google's hiring data for the **'tech'** workforce:

     ```sql
     WHERE report_year = 2021 AND LOWER(workforce) = 'tech'
     ```

   - This aligns with the task's focus on technology sectors.
   - **`2result.sql`** uses the **'overall'** workforce:

     ```sql
     WHERE report_year = 2021 AND workforce = 'overall'
     ```

   - Comparing Google's overall workforce with BLS data for technology sectors is inconsistent with the task requirements.

3. **Calculation of Differences:**
   - Both scripts calculate the percentage differences between Google's hiring data and BLS averages.
   - **`0result.sql`** directly computes the differences relevant to the tech sector.
   - **`2result.sql`** performs weighted averages using employment numbers, which adds complexity and potential for errors, especially if the employment numbers are not directly comparable.

4. **Results Alignment:**
   - The output of **`0result.csv`** shows significant differences, especially for the Asian demographic, which is consistent with known industry trends in tech sectors.
   - The output of **`2result.csv`** shows smaller differences, which may not accurately reflect the disparities in the tech industry.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script as it appropriately focuses on the technology sectors and uses the relevant Google's tech workforce data for an accurate comparison.
