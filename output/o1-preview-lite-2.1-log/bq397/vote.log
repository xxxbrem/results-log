After comparing both SQL scripts and their results, I conclude that **2result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Correct Implementation of the Conditions:**
  - The second script accurately identifies channel groupings that have transactions from more than one country by grouping the data and counting distinct countries where `transactions > 0`.
  - It then selects the country with the highest total transactions within each of these qualifying channel groupings.

- **Use of Structured Query Approach:**
  - The second script employs Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into manageable steps:
    1. **transactions_per_country:** Calculates total transactions per country within each channel grouping.
    2. **channels_with_multiple_countries:** Identifies channel groupings with transactions from more than one country.
    3. **transactions_ranked:** Ranks countries within each qualifying channel grouping based on total transactions.
  - This structured approach enhances readability and maintainability.

- **Accurate Results:**
  - The output from the second script correctly lists the country with the highest total transactions for each qualifying channel grouping.

- **SQL Standards Compliance:**
  - The second script adheres to standard SQL practices, making it more portable and less prone to errors across different SQL environments.
  - It avoids using the `QUALIFY` clause, which is specific to certain SQL dialects (like BigQuery), and instead uses CTEs and well-supported SQL functions.

**As per the analysis, the second SQL script meets all the requirements and provides an accurate and reliable solution.**
