**Relevant columns and potential usage:**

- `channelGrouping`: Used to group sessions by marketing channel.
- `country`: Identifies the country associated with each session.
- `transactions`: Number of transactions in each session; used to calculate total transactions.
  
**Conditions that may be used:**

- Only consider sessions where `transactions` > 0.
- Only include `channelGrouping` values that have transactions from more than one country.
  
**SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct channel groupings:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `channelGrouping`
    FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **List distinct countries:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `country`
    FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **Total transactions by channel grouping:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `channelGrouping`, SUM(`transactions`) AS total_transactions
    FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
    GROUP BY `channelGrouping`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Total transactions by country:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `country`, SUM(`transactions`) AS total_transactions
    FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
    GROUP BY `country`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **Total transactions by channel grouping and country:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `channelGrouping`, `country`, SUM(`transactions`) AS total_transactions
    FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
    GROUP BY `channelGrouping`, `country`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Number of countries per channel grouping with transactions:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `channelGrouping`, COUNT(DISTINCT `country`) AS country_count
    FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
    WHERE `transactions` > 0
    GROUP BY `channelGrouping`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Identify channel groupings with transactions from multiple countries:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `channelGrouping`
    FROM (
      SELECT `channelGrouping`, COUNT(DISTINCT `country`) AS country_count
      FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
      WHERE `transactions` > 0
      GROUP BY `channelGrouping`
    )
    WHERE country_count > 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. **Total transactions per country within qualifying channel groupings:**

    ```sql
    SELECT t.`channelGrouping`, t.`country`, SUM(t.`transactions`) AS total_transactions
    FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions` AS t
    WHERE t.`transactions` > 0
      AND t.`channelGrouping` IN (
        SELECT `channelGrouping`
        FROM (
          SELECT `channelGrouping`, COUNT(DISTINCT `country`) AS country_count
          FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
          WHERE `transactions` > 0
          GROUP BY `channelGrouping`
          HAVING country_count > 1
        )
      )
    GROUP BY t.`channelGrouping`, t.`country`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **Find the top country by transactions within each qualifying channel grouping:**

    ```sql
    SELECT `channelGrouping`, `country`, total_transactions
    FROM (
      SELECT t.`channelGrouping`, t.`country`, SUM(t.`transactions`) AS total_transactions,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY t.`channelGrouping` ORDER BY SUM(t.`transactions`) DESC) AS rn
      FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions` AS t
      WHERE t.`transactions` > 0
        AND t.`channelGrouping` IN (
          SELECT `channelGrouping`
          FROM (
            SELECT `channelGrouping`, COUNT(DISTINCT `country`) AS country_count
            FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
            WHERE `transactions` > 0
            GROUP BY `channelGrouping`
            HAVING country_count > 1
          )
        )
      GROUP BY t.`channelGrouping`, t.`country`
    )
    WHERE rn = 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **List distinct channel grouping and country combinations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT `channelGrouping`, `country`
    FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively explore the data needed to identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, considering only those channels with transactions from multiple countries.Query:

Task: Identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, provided that the channel includes transactions from more than one country. What is the transaction total for that country?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, considering only those channels that include transactions from more than one country, we can aggregate the transaction data accordingly.

```csv
ChannelGrouping,Country,TotalTransactions
channel_grouping1:str,country1:str,total_transactions1:int
channel_grouping2:str,country2:str,total_transactions2:int
...
```
*(Attention: answer includes one row for each qualifying channel grouping.)*

**Explanation:**

The table above displays, for each channel grouping that has transactions from multiple countries, the country with the highest total transactions along with the transaction total for that country..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'data-to-insights': {'ecommerce': ['all_sessions', 'all_sessions_raw', 'categories', 'checkout_nudge', 'classification_model_2_results', 'days_with_rain', 'partition_by_day', 'partitions', 'product_list', 'products', 'rev_transactions', 'sales_by_sku', 'sales_report', 'site_wide_promotion', 'web_analytics']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To identify the country with the highest total transactions within each channel grouping, considering only those channels that include transactions from more than one country, we can aggregate the transaction data accordingly.

```csv
ChannelGrouping,Country,TotalTransactions
channel_grouping1:str,country1:str,total_transactions1:int
channel_grouping2:str,country2:str,total_transactions2:int
...
```
*(Attention: answer includes one row for each qualifying channel grouping.)*

**Explanation:**

The table above displays, for each channel grouping that has transactions from multiple countries, the country with the highest total transactions along with the transaction total for that country. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
