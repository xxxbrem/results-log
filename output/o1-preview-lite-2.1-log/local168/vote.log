**Reason:**

Between the two SQL queries provided, both aim to calculate the average salary for remote Data Analyst jobs requiring the top three most in-demand skills (`python`, `sas`, and `javascript`). However, the second SQL query (`2result.sql`) is more comprehensive and precise for the following reasons:

1. **Explicit Skill Matching:**
   - The query uses a CTE (`target_skills`) to dynamically select the `skill_id`s based on the skill names (`'python'`, `'sas'`, `'javascript'`). This ensures that the query remains correct even if the `skill_id`s change in the database.

2. **Data Cleansing:**
   - The `data_analyst_jobs` CTE includes a condition `AND TRIM(jp."salary_year_avg") != ''`, which filters out any records where `salary_year_avg` is an empty string. This is important because such values, if not filtered, could be considered as zero during aggregation, skewing the average salary calculation.

3. **Type Casting:**
   - In the final SELECT statement, the `salary_year_avg` is cast to `REAL` using `CAST(jws."salary_year_avg" AS REAL)`. This ensures that the average calculation is performed on numeric values, avoiding any potential errors or inaccuracies due to string data types.

4. **Structured Query:**
   - The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) enhances the readability and maintainability of the query. Each step is broken down logically:
     - Identifying the target skills.
     - Selecting relevant job postings.
     - Associating skills with job postings.
     - Combining the data to perform the final calculation.

5. **Robustness:**
   - The query accounts for potential data anomalies and ensures that only valid and relevant data is used in the average salary calculation.

By choosing `2result.sql`, we select a query that is thorough, accurate, and adheres to best practices in SQL querying, ensuring that the result (`106900.0`) is reliable and correctly computed.
