Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine in which year the two most common causes of traffic accidents were different from those in other years, we need to analyze the data provided in the tables. Here are the relevant tables and columns:

**Relevant Table:** `"collisions"`

- **Column:** `"collision_date"`  
  *Potential Usage:* Extract the year of each collision to group accidents by year.

- **Column:** `"primary_collision_factor"`  
  *Potential Usage:* Identify the primary cause of each traffic accident.

- **Column:** `"pcf_violation_code"`  
  *Potential Usage:* Specific violation codes associated with the accident causes.

- **Column:** `"pcf_violation_category"`  
  *Potential Usage:* Categorize the type of violation causing the accident.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Ensure that `"primary_collision_factor"` is not null or empty to get valid causes.
- Parse `"collision_date"` to extract the year for grouping.
- Group data by year and cause to count the number of accidents per cause per year.

Below are 10 SQL queries to explore the data:

1. **Get a sample of collision dates to understand the date format:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "collision_date" FROM "collisions" LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **Extract distinct years from the collision dates:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT substr("collision_date", -4) AS "year" FROM "collisions" LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **Get distinct values of primary collision factors:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "primary_collision_factor" FROM "collisions" LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Count accidents per primary collision factor:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "accident_count"
    FROM "collisions"
    GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
    ORDER BY "accident_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **Count accidents per year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT substr("collision_date", -4) AS "year", COUNT(*) AS "accident_count"
    FROM "collisions"
    GROUP BY "year"
    ORDER BY "year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Count accidents per primary collision factor per year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT substr("collision_date", -4) AS "year", "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "accident_count"
    FROM "collisions"
    GROUP BY "year", "primary_collision_factor"
    ORDER BY "year", "accident_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Get distinct values of PCF (Primary Collision Factor) violation categories:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "pcf_violation_category" FROM "collisions" LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. **Count accidents per PCF violation category:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "pcf_violation_category", COUNT(*) AS "accident_count"
    FROM "collisions"
    GROUP BY "pcf_violation_category"
    ORDER BY "accident_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **Count accidents per PCF violation category per year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT substr("collision_date", -4) AS "year", "pcf_violation_category", COUNT(*) AS "accident_count"
    FROM "collisions"
    GROUP BY "year", "pcf_violation_category"
    ORDER BY "year", "accident_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **Get the top 2 most common causes per year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "year", "primary_collision_factor", "accident_count" FROM (
      SELECT substr("collision_date", -4) AS "year", "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "accident_count",
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY substr("collision_date", -4) ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn
      FROM "collisions"
      GROUP BY "year", "primary_collision_factor"
    ) WHERE rn <= 2
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    *(Note: If the database does not support WINDOW functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`, this query may not work. In such cases, more advanced SQL features or multiple queries may be needed.)*

These queries help in understanding the distribution of accident causes over the years, which is essential to identify the years with different top two causes of traffic accidents.Query:

Task: In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year
year1:int
year2:int
...
```

(Explanation: These are the years in which the two most common causes of traffic accidents were different from those in other years.).
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
