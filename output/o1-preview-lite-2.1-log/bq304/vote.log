After comparing both SQL queries, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Tag Parsing:** The StackOverflow dataset stores tags in the `tags` field enclosed within angle brackets, like `<android-layout><android-activity>`. The `0result.sql` script correctly handles this format by using `REGEXP_REPLACE` to remove the leading `<` and trailing `>` from the tags string, and then splits the tags using `SPLIT(..., '><')` to extract individual tags.
  
- **Filtering Conditions:** The query filters questions where the title starts with 'how' (`LOWER(title) LIKE 'how%'`) and excludes questions containing troubleshooting terms by using `NOT (LOWER(title) LIKE '%fail%' OR LOWER(title) LIKE '%problem%' OR ...)`.

- **Tag Selection:** It filters questions to include only those with tags from the specified list (`tag IN (...)`), matching the task requirements.

- **Top 50 Questions per Tag:** The query uses `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY tag ORDER BY view_count DESC)` to partition the results by tag and assigns a row number based on the view count in descending order. It then selects the top 50 most viewed questions for each tag (`WHERE rn <= 50`).

- **Accurate Results:** The results in `0result.csv` align with the expected output, displaying the top 50 most viewed 'how' questions for each specified tag without including questions containing the troubleshooting terms.

In contrast, **`1result.sql`** assumes that the tags are separated by pipe characters (`'|'`), which does not match the actual format of the `tags` field in the StackOverflow dataset. This discrepancy would lead to incorrect parsing of tags and, consequently, incorrect results.
