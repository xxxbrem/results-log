The correct SQL query is provided in **`1result.sql`**.

```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

The task is to determine how the average reputation and number of badges vary among Stack Overflow users based on the number of complete years they have been members, considering only those who joined on or before October 1, 2021.

**Why `1result.sql` is the correct choice:**

- **Accurate Calculation of Years of Membership:**
  - The query calculates the number of complete years of membership using the `DATEDIFF` function:
    ```sql
    DATEDIFF('year', TO_TIMESTAMP("creation_date" / 1e6), TO_DATE('2021-10-01')) AS "Years_of_membership"
    ```
    This correctly computes the difference in years between the user's creation date and October 1, 2021.

- **Correct Filtering of Users:**
  - The `WHERE` clause ensures that only users who joined on or before October 1, 2021, are included:
    ```sql
    WHERE "creation_date" <= 1633046400000000  -- October 1, 2021, in microseconds since the epoch
    ```
    This aligns with the requirement to consider only those users.

- **Proper Handling of Badge Counts:**
  - The query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `badge_counts` to compute the number of badges per user:
    ```sql
    WITH badge_counts AS (
        SELECT "user_id", COUNT(*) AS "badge_count"
        FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.BADGES
        GROUP BY "user_id"
    )
    ```
    - It performs a LEFT JOIN with the `USERS` table to include users who may not have any badges, setting their `badge_count` to zero using `COALESCE`.
  - This method ensures accurate aggregation of badge counts per user without inflating counts due to joins.

- **Aggregating and Grouping Correctly:**
  - The query groups the data by `Years_of_membership` and calculates the average reputation and average number of badges:
    ```sql
    GROUP BY "Years_of_membership"
    ```
    - It uses the `ROUND` function to format the averages to four decimal places.

- **Simplicity and Clarity:**
  - The query structure is straightforward, making it easy to understand and maintain.
  - It separates the badge counting logic into a CTE, enhancing readability.

**Comparison with Other Options:**

- **`0result.sql`:**
  - While similar to `1result.sql`, this query uses `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ`, which may not handle time zones correctly if the data includes time zone information. Using `TO_TIMESTAMP` is more appropriate for ensuring accurate timestamp conversions.

- **`2result.sql`:**
  - This query calculates the badge count within the subquery by counting badge IDs and grouping by user ID, reputation, and creation date. While this approach can work, it may lead to inaccuracies due to the way joins and groupings are handled. Specifically, grouping by multiple user attributes can cause unintended aggregations.
  - Additionally, it uses `FLOOR` with `DATEDIFF` to calculate years of membership, which may not accurately represent complete years, especially if the difference falls exactly on a year boundary.

**Conclusion:**

The query in `1result.sql` accurately addresses all aspects of the task:

- Correctly calculates complete years of membership.
- Filters users who joined on or before October 1, 2021.
- Accurately computes average reputation and average number of badges per year of membership.
- Uses appropriate SQL functions and structures for clarity and correctness.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for this task.
