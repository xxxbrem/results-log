After reviewing and comparing the three SQL queries provided, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct and most robust query for calculating the percentage of page views on January 2, 2021, that were for PDP (Product Detail Page) type pages.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Correct Calculation of Total Page Views:**

   - **`2result.sql`** accurately calculates the total number of `page_view` events:

     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_page_views
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_20210102`
     WHERE event_name = 'page_view';
     ```

     This ensures that all `page_view` events are accounted for in the total, providing a correct denominator for the percentage calculation.

2. **Accurate Identification of PDP Page Views:**

   - **Use of `SAFE_OFFSET`:**

     - **`2result.sql`** uses `SAFE_OFFSET` when accessing array elements:

       ```sql
       SPLIT(ep.value.string_value, '/')[SAFE_OFFSET(3)]
       SPLIT(ep.value.string_value, '/')[SAFE_OFFSET(4)]
       ```

     - The `SAFE_OFFSET` function returns `NULL` instead of an error when an array index is out of bounds. This prevents potential runtime errors if the URL does not have enough segments, ensuring the query runs smoothly for all records.

   - **Extraction of the Last URL Segment:**

     - The query correctly extracts the last segment of the URL using:

       ```sql
       SPLIT(ep.value.string_value, '/')[OFFSET(ARRAY_LENGTH(SPLIT(ep.value.string_value, '/')) - 1)]
       ```

     - Since `OFFSET` is zero-based, subtracting 1 from the array length gives the correct index for the last element.

   - **Regex Matching for '+':**

     - It checks if the last URL segment contains a '+' sign using `REGEXP_CONTAINS`, which aligns with the PDP identification criteria.

   - **Category Matching:**

     - The query checks if the 4th or 5th URL segment matches one of the specified categories, ensuring accurate identification of PDP pages.

3. **Efficient Join with `UNNEST`:**

   - **`2result.sql`** uses an `INNER JOIN` with `UNNEST`:

     ```sql
     INNER JOIN UNNEST(t.event_params) AS ep
       ON ep.key = 'page_location'
     ```

     This is more efficient than using a `CROSS JOIN` and filtering in the `WHERE` clause. It directly joins only the relevant `event_params`, improving query performance.

4. **Robustness and Safety:**

   - The use of `SAFE_OFFSET` and proper array indexing makes **`2result.sql`** more robust and less prone to errors compared to **`0result.sql`**, which uses `OFFSET` without safety checks.

5. **Consistent Results:**

   - All three queries produce the same percentage (17.4911%), but **`2result.sql`** achieves this with greater precision and reliability due to the reasons mentioned above.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the query, **`2result.sql`** is the correct choice for determining the percentage of PDP page views.
