After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **1result.sql** is the correct answer. Here's why:

- **Accurate Distance Calculation**: The SQL in **1result.sql** uses a more precise approximation for computing the distances between cities. It accounts for the average latitude when calculating longitudinal distances, which makes the distance estimation more accurate compared to the other queries that use simpler methods.

- **Proper Grouping and Counting**: The query correctly groups all unique city pairs into the specified distance ranges (0-1000, 1000-2000, etc.) based on their average distances and counts the number of pairs in each range.

- **Result Consistency**: According to **1result.csv**, the distance range with the fewest unique city pairs is **5000-6000** with **15 pairs**, which answers the question directly.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
