After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Accurate Dataset Filtering:**
   - **`1result.sql`** uses the table `events_202012*`, which specifically selects data from December 2020. This aligns precisely with the task requirement to analyze data from December 2020.
   - The other queries, **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`**, use `events_*` with additional filters. While this can include December 2020, using `events_202012*` directly is more precise and reduces the risk of including data from other months.

2. **Clear Definition of Purchasers:**
   - **`1result.sql`** defines purchasers using a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `purchasers`, which selects distinct `user_pseudo_id` where `event_name = 'purchase'`.
   - This approach aligns with the instruction: "Just label anyone who was involved in purchase events as a purchaser."
   - The purchasers are then used directly in subsequent calculations for clarity and accuracy.

3. **Accurate Calculation of Average Pageviews:**
   - **`1result.sql`** separately calculates the average pageviews for purchasers (`avg_pageviews_purchasers`) and non-purchasers (`avg_pageviews_non_purchasers`) using CTEs.
   - It ensures that only `page_view` events are counted in the pageviews, aligning with the requirement to measure the average pageviews between the two groups.

4. **Calculation of the Average Difference:**
   - The final SELECT statement accurately computes the difference between the average pageviews of purchasers and non-purchasers.
   - It uses the `ROUND` function to format the result to four decimal places, which is appropriate for reporting averages.

5. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - Using CTEs in **`1result.sql`** enhances the readability and maintainability of the SQL script.
   - It makes the logic clear, which reduces the chances of errors and makes it easier to validate each step.

6. **Consistent Results:**
   - The result from **`1result.sql`** is `45.3654`, which matches the result from **`0result.sql`**.
   - However, the slight difference in the result from **`2result.sql`** (`45.37456967714964`) suggests a minor discrepancy, possibly due to differences in how the averages are calculated (e.g., inclusion of users with zero pageviews or different rounding methods).

**Conclusion:**

Given the precise filtering of data, clear definition of purchasers, accurate calculations, and the clarity of the SQL script, **`1result.sql`** is the correct and most appropriate SQL query to answer the task.
