2025-01-23 02:40:35 - root - INFO - It seems that the error occurs because the `"age_at_diagnosis"` column contains some invalid numeric values or empty strings, despite being declared as `NUMBER(38,0)`. This inconsistency can lead to errors when performing numeric operations or comparisons.

To address this issue, we can use the `TRY_TO_NUMBER` function, which attempts to convert a value to a number and returns `NULL` if it fails. This allows us to filter out any problematic entries.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "case_barcode") AS "total_patients"
FROM (
    SELECT
        "case_barcode",
        TRY_TO_NUMBER("age_at_diagnosis") AS "age_num",
        "disease_code",
        "pathologic_stage"
    FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0"."CLINICAL_V1_1"
) sub
WHERE "disease_code" = 'BRCA'
  AND "age_num" IS NOT NULL
  AND "age_num" <= 80
  AND "pathologic_stage" IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA');
```

**Explanation:**

- **Subquery:** We create a subquery where we attempt to convert `"age_at_diagnosis"` to a number using `TRY_TO_NUMBER("age_at_diagnosis") AS "age_num"`.
  - If the conversion is successful, `"age_num"` will have a numeric value.
  - If the conversion fails (due to empty strings or invalid data), `"age_num"` will be `NULL`.

- **Filtering Conditions:**
  - We filter for patients where `"age_num"` is not `NULL` and less than or equal to 80.
  - This ensures that we only include patients with valid numeric ages that meet our criteria.

- **Remaining Conditions:**
  - We continue to filter based on `"disease_code"` being `'BRCA'` and `"pathologic_stage"` being one of the specified stages.

**Why the Previous Queries Failed:**

- **Data Type Mismatch:** Even though `"age_at_diagnosis"` is declared as `NUMBER(38,0)`, it seems the column contains empty strings or invalid entries, possibly due to data inconsistencies during data entry or import.
  
- **Error with `CAST` and `TRY_CAST`:** Attempting to `CAST` a non-numeric string (like an empty string) to a numeric type results in an error because the operation is invalid.
  
- **`TRY_CAST` Limitation:** The error message indicates that `TRY_CAST` cannot be used between certain data types, specifically between `NUMBER(38,0)` and `FLOAT`, likely due to the underlying invalid data.

**Additional Steps to Verify Data Integrity:**

To further understand the data causing the error, you can run the following query to identify problematic entries:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "age_at_diagnosis"
FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0"."CLINICAL_V1_1"
WHERE TRY_TO_NUMBER("age_at_diagnosis") IS NULL
  AND "age_at_diagnosis" IS NOT NULL
  AND "age_at_diagnosis" <> '';
```

This will list all unique values in the `"age_at_diagnosis"` column that cannot be converted to a number, helping you identify any anomalies.

**Alternative Query Without Subquery:**

If you prefer not to use a subquery, you can incorporate the `TRY_TO_NUMBER` function directly in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "case_barcode") AS "total_patients"
FROM "TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0"."TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0"."CLINICAL_V1_1"
WHERE "disease_code" = 'BRCA'
  AND TRY_TO_NUMBER("age_at_diagnosis") IS NOT NULL
  AND TRY_TO_NUMBER("age_at_diagnosis") <= 80
  AND "pathologic_stage" IN ('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage IIA');
```

**Note:**

- The `TRY_TO_NUMBER` function attempts to convert the input to a numeric value. If it fails, it returns `NULL`. By checking that this value is not `NULL` and meets our condition (`<= 80`), we ensure we only include valid entries.
  
- Ensure that your database environment supports the `TRY_TO_NUMBER` function. If it does not, you might need to use a different method, such as filtering out non-numeric values using regular expressions or data cleansing before querying.

**Conclusion:**

By using `TRY_TO_NUMBER`, we handle any invalid numeric data gracefully, avoiding conversion errors and accurately counting the total number of patients who meet the specified criteria.

**Explanation:**

The error occurs because we were applying the `TRY_TO_NUMBER` function to columns that are already of numeric data types (`FLOAT`). Using `TRY_TO_NUMBER` or `TRY_CAST` on numeric columns can lead to SQL compilation errors, especially when there's a type mismatch.

**Correction Steps:**

- **Remove `TRY_TO_NUMBER` Functions**: Since `"reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped"` and `"HTSeq__FPKM"` are already numeric (`FLOAT`), we should not use `TRY_TO_NUMBER` on them.
  
- **Ensure Non-Null Values**: We check that these columns are not `NULL` using `IS NOT NULL`.
  
- **Check for Empty Strings (if applicable)**: Although numeric columns should not contain empty strings, adding a condition to exclude empty strings (e.g., `<> ''`) is a good practice if the data might contain such anomalies.

**Revised Query Explanation:**

- **`SELECT DISTINCT`**: Retrieves unique combinations of the specified columns.
  
- **Columns Selected**:
  - `m."case_barcode"`: Patient identifier.
  - `m."mirna_id"`: Unique microRNA identifier.
  - `m."reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped"`: Expression value of the microRNA.
  - `r."HTSeq__FPKM"`: Expression value of the gene `SNORA31`.
  
- **`FROM` and `JOIN`**: We join the microRNA expression data with the RNA-Seq gene expression data on the common `"case_barcode"`.

- **`WHERE` Clause**:
  - `r."gene_name" = 'SNORA31'`: We focus on the gene `SNORA31`.
  - `m."mirna_id" IS NOT NULL AND m."mirna_id" <> ''`: Ensures that the microRNA ID is valid.
  - `m."reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped" IS NOT NULL`: Ensures we have expression data for the microRNA.
  - `r."HTSeq__FPKM" IS NOT NULL`: Ensures we have expression data for `SNORA31`.

- **`LIMIT 100`**: Limits the result to the first 100 records.

**Note**:

- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that the data in the numeric columns does not contain invalid entries (e.g., empty strings, NaNs). Since these columns are of numeric types, they should not contain such values, but data anomalies can occur.
  
- **Further Error Handling**: If you still encounter errors, consider checking the data for any invalid entries or inconsistencies that may need to be cleaned before querying.

Task: Help me calculate the t-statistic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between all possible pairs of gene `SNORA31` in the RNAseq data (Log10 transformation) and unique identifiers in the microRNA data available in TCGA. The cohort for this analysis consists of BRCA patients that are 80 years old or younger at the time of diagnosis and Stage I,II,IIA as pathological state. And only consider samples of size more than 25 and with absolute Pearson correlation at least 0.3, and less than 1.0.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
miRNA_ID,Pearson_Correlation,t_statistic,Sample_Size
miRNA1:str,r_value1:float,t_value1:float,n1:int
miRNA2:str,r_value2:float,t_value2:float,n2:int
...
```

**Explanation**:

- **miRNA_ID**: The unique identifier of each microRNA.
- **Pearson_Correlation**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the Log10-transformed expression of `SNORA31` and each microRNA expression.
- **t_statistic**: The t-statistic calculated from the Pearson correlation coefficient using the formula:

  \[ t = r \times \sqrt{\frac{n - 2}{1 - r^2}} \]

  where:
  - \( r \) is the Pearson correlation coefficient.
  - \( n \) is the sample size.

- **Sample_Size**: The number of samples used in the calculation (greater than 25).

**Note**: The results include only those microRNAs where the absolute Pearson correlation is between 0.3 and less than 1.0..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 02:50:15 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Help me calculate the t-statistic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between all possible pairs of gene `SNORA31` in the RNAseq data (Log10 transformation) and unique identifiers in the microRNA data available in TCGA. The cohort for this analysis consists of BRCA patients that are 80 years old or younger at the time of diagnosis and Stage I,II,IIA as pathological state. And only consider samples of size more than 25 and with absolute Pearson correlation at least 0.3, and less than 1.0., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
miRNA_ID,Pearson_Correlation,t_statistic,Sample_Size
miRNA1:str,r_value1:float,t_value1:float,n1:int
miRNA2:str,r_value2:float,t_value2:float,n2:int
...
```

**Explanation**:

- **miRNA_ID**: The unique identifier of each microRNA.
- **Pearson_Correlation**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the Log10-transformed expression of `SNORA31` and each microRNA expression.
- **t_statistic**: The t-statistic calculated from the Pearson correlation coefficient using the formula:

  \[ t = r \times \sqrt{\frac{n - 2}{1 - r^2}} \]

  where:
  - \( r \) is the Pearson correlation coefficient.
  - \( n \) is the sample size.

- **Sample_Size**: The number of samples used in the calculation (greater than 25).

**Note**: The results include only those microRNAs where the absolute Pearson correlation is between 0.3 and less than 1.0. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-23 02:50:58 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Help me calculate the t-statistic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between all possible pairs of gene `SNORA31` in the RNAseq data (Log10 transformation) and unique identifiers in the microRNA data available in TCGA. The cohort for this analysis consists of BRCA patients that are 80 years old or younger at the time of diagnosis and Stage I,II,IIA as pathological state. And only consider samples of size more than 25 and with absolute Pearson correlation at least 0.3, and less than 1.0., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
miRNA_ID,Pearson_Correlation,t_statistic,Sample_Size
miRNA1:str,r_value1:float,t_value1:float,n1:int
miRNA2:str,r_value2:float,t_value2:float,n2:int
...
```

**Explanation**:

- **miRNA_ID**: The unique identifier of each microRNA.
- **Pearson_Correlation**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the Log10-transformed expression of `SNORA31` and each microRNA expression.
- **t_statistic**: The t-statistic calculated from the Pearson correlation coefficient using the formula:

  \[ t = r \times \sqrt{\frac{n - 2}{1 - r^2}} \]

  where:
  - \( r \) is the Pearson correlation coefficient.
  - \( n \) is the sample size.

- **Sample_Size**: The number of samples used in the calculation (greater than 25).

**Note**: The results include only those microRNAs where the absolute Pearson correlation is between 0.3 and less than 1.0. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
