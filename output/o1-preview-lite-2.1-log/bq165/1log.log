2025-01-26 17:00:47 - root - INFO - The error occurs because BigQuery does not support using `COUNT(DISTINCT STRUCT(...))` with aggregate functions on `STRUCT` types. To fix this, you can select the distinct combinations of `RefNo` and `CaseNo` in a subquery and then count the number of rows.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalSamples
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT c.RefNo, c.CaseNo
    FROM `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen` c
    WHERE c.Morph = '3111' OR c.Topo = '0401'
);
```

This query will return the total number of unique samples (based on `RefNo` and `CaseNo`) that meet the specified morphology or topology conditions.

    ```

### Explanation:

The queries above are designed to explore the relevant data in the context of calculating the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses in breast cancer and adenocarcinoma samples. They progressively build an understanding of the data by:

- Identifying cases with the specified morphology (`'3111'`) and topography (`'0401'`).
- Exploring the types of chromosomal changes and their occurrences.
- Mapping genomic coordinates to cytogenetic bands.
- Counting occurrences of specific types of aberrations, such as gains, losses, amplifications, and homozygous deletions.
- Preparing to compute frequencies by understanding the total number of samples and the distribution of abnormalities.

These queries serve as a foundation for constructing more complex analyses required to fulfill the task's objective.Query:

Task: Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'mitelman-db': {'prod': ['AuthorReference', 'CytoBands_hg38', 'CytoConverted', 'CytoConvertedLog', 'Cytogen', 'CytogenInv', 'CytogenInvValid', 'KaryAbnorm', 'KaryBit', 'KaryBreak', 'KaryClone', 'Koder', 'MolBiolClinAssoc', 'MolClinAbnorm', 'MolClinBreak', 'MolClinGene', 'RecurrentData', 'RecurrentNumData', 'Reference']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 17:03:37 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency

chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:05:52 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:06:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency

...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:08:27 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency

chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:11:00 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:12:25 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:14:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency

```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:15:43 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency

chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
