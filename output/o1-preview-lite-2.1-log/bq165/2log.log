2025-01-26 17:00:49 - root - INFO - I see that you're encountering the following error when running your SQL query:

```
400 Bad int64 value: X; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Bad int64 value: X
```

**Explanation:**

The error occurs because the `chromosome` column in your `CytoBands_hg38` table contains values like `'chr1'`, `'chr2'`, ..., `'chr22'`, `'chrX'`, and `'chrY'`. When you use `REPLACE(chromosome, 'chr', '')`, you get values like `'1'`, `'2'`, ..., `'22'`, `'X'`, and `'Y'`. 

The problem arises when you attempt to `CAST` these values to `INT64`. While `'1'` to `'22'` can be successfully cast to integers, `'X'` and `'Y'` cannot, leading to the error.

**Solution:**

To fix the error, we need to handle the cases where the chromosome is `'X'` or `'Y'`. We can do this by using a `CASE` statement in the `ORDER BY` clause to assign numeric values to `'X'` and `'Y'`. For example, we can assign `'X'` as `23` and `'Y'` as `24`.

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT chromosome, cytoband_name, hg38_start, hg38_stop
FROM `mitelman-db.prod.CytoBands_hg38`
ORDER BY
  CASE REPLACE(chromosome, 'chr', '')
    WHEN 'X' THEN 23
    WHEN 'Y' THEN 24
    ELSE CAST(REPLACE(chromosome, 'chr', '') AS INT64)
  END,
  hg38_start
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- The `CASE` statement checks the chromosome value after removing `'chr'`.
- If it is `'X'`, it assigns a value of `23`.
- If it is `'Y'`, it assigns a value of `24`.
- For all other chromosomes (`'1'` to `'22'`), it casts the value to `INT64`.
- This ensures that all chromosome values are represented as integers, allowing the `ORDER BY` clause to function correctly.

**Alternative Using `SAFE_CAST`:**

Alternatively, we could use `SAFE_CAST`, which returns `NULL` instead of an error when the cast fails. However, using `CASE` provides explicit control over how we handle `'X'` and `'Y'`, ensuring they are sorted appropriately.

---

**Proceeding with the Task:**

Now that we've fixed the error, let's continue with the task of calculating the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses.

**Steps to Calculate Frequencies:**

1. **Filter Samples of Interest:**

   Select samples with `Morph = '3111'` (breast cancer) or `Topo = '0401'` (adenocarcinoma) from the `Cytogen` table.

2. **Join with `CytoConverted`:**

   Join the filtered samples with `CytoConverted` to get the chromosomal changes.

3. **Map Chromosomal Changes to Cytobands:**

   Use genomic coordinates (`Start`, `End`) to map each change to the corresponding cytoband in `CytoBands_hg38`.

4. **Categorize Changes:**

   Based on the `Type` of change and `CellsPresent` (if available), categorize each event as amplification, gain, loss, or homozygous deletion.

5. **Aggregate Counts and Calculate Frequencies:**

   For each cytoband, count the number of each type of event and calculate the frequency as a percentage.

**Sample Query to Aggregate Counts:**

Below is a simplified version of how you might write a query to perform these calculations. Note that due to the complexity, the query is elaborate and may need adjustments based on your actual data and requirements.

```sql
WITH FilteredSamples AS (
  SELECT RefNo, CaseNo
  FROM `mitelman-db.prod.Cytogen`
  WHERE Morph = '3111' OR Topo = '0401'
),
ChromosomalChanges AS (
  SELECT a.RefNo, a.CaseNo, a.Chr, a.ChrOrd, a.Start, a.End, a.Type
  FROM `mitelman-db.prod.CytoConverted` AS a
  INNER JOIN FilteredSamples AS b
    ON a.RefNo = b.RefNo AND a.CaseNo = b.CaseNo
),
ChangesWithBands AS (
  SELECT cc.RefNo, cc.CaseNo, cc.Chr, cc.ChrOrd, cc.Start, cc.End, cc.Type,
         cb.cytoband_name, cb.hg38_start, cb.hg38_stop
  FROM ChromosomalChanges AS cc
  JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.CytoBands_hg38` AS cb
    ON cc.Chr = cb.chromosome
    AND cc.Start <= cb.hg38_stop
    AND cc.End >= cb.hg38_start
),
CategorizedChanges AS (
  SELECT cytoband_name, Type,
         CASE
           WHEN LOWER(Type) = 'gain' AND (cc.End - cc.Start) > (cb.hg38_stop - cb.hg38_start) THEN 'Amplification'
           WHEN LOWER(Type) = 'gain' THEN 'Gain'
           WHEN LOWER(Type) = 'loss' THEN 'Loss'
           -- Add conditions for homozygous deletions if applicable
           ELSE 'Other'
         END AS ChangeCategory
  FROM ChangesWithBands AS cc
  JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.CytoBands_hg38` AS cb
    ON cc.Chr = cb.chromosome
    AND cc.Start <= cb.hg38_stop
    AND cc.End >= cb.hg38_start
),
Counts AS (
  SELECT cytoband_name,
         SUM(CASE WHEN ChangeCategory = 'Amplification' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Amplifications_number,
         SUM(CASE WHEN ChangeCategory = 'Gain' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Gains_number,
         SUM(CASE WHEN ChangeCategory = 'Loss' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Losses_number,
         SUM(CASE WHEN ChangeCategory = 'HomozygousDeletion' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS HomozygousDeletions_number,
         COUNT(*) AS TotalChanges
  FROM CategorizedChanges
  GROUP BY cytoband_name
)
SELECT 
  cb.chromosome AS Chromosome,
  cb.cytoband_name AS Band_name,
  cb.hg38_start AS Band_start,
  cb.hg38_stop AS Band_end,
  c.Amplifications_number,
  ROUND(c.Amplifications_number / c.TotalChanges * 100, 2) AS Amplifications_frequency,
  c.Gains_number,
  ROUND(c.Gains_number / c.TotalChanges * 100, 2) AS Gains_frequency,
  c.Losses_number,
  ROUND(c.Losses_number / c.TotalChanges * 100, 2) AS Losses_frequency,
  c.HomozygousDeletions_number,
  ROUND(c.HomozygousDeletions_number / c.TotalChanges * 100, 2) AS HomozygousDeletions_frequency
FROM Counts AS c
JOIN `mitelman-db.prod.CytoBands_hg38` AS cb
  ON c.cytoband_name = cb.cytoband_name
ORDER BY
  CASE REPLACE(cb.chromosome, 'chr', '')
    WHEN 'X' THEN 23
    WHEN 'Y' THEN 24
    ELSE CAST(REPLACE(cb.chromosome, 'chr', '') AS INT64)
  END,
  cb.hg38_start;
```

**Please Note:**

- **Adjustments Needed:** The categorization logic in `CategorizedChanges` may need adjustment based on how amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions are defined in your dataset. For example, you may need to consider the `CellsPresent` column or other criteria.
  
- **Data Volume:** Since the dataset may be large, consider testing the query with a smaller subset or adding `LIMIT` clauses during development.

    ```

**Explanation:**

The queries above explore the relevant tables and columns to understand the data necessary for calculating the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses in breast cancer (`Morph = '3111'`) and adenocarcinoma (`Topo = '0401'`) samples. They help identify the types of chromosomal changes, map these changes to cytobands, and count the occurrences needed to compute frequencies. By examining the `Type` column in `CytoConverted`, we can categorize the changes into amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions. The cytoband information from `CytoBands_hg38` allows for sorting and grouping of changes by chromosomal bands.

Task: Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'mitelman-db': {'prod': ['AuthorReference', 'CytoBands_hg38', 'CytoConverted', 'CytoConvertedLog', 'Cytogen', 'CytogenInv', 'CytogenInvValid', 'KaryAbnorm', 'KaryBit', 'KaryBreak', 'KaryClone', 'Koder', 'MolBiolClinAssoc', 'MolClinAbnorm', 'MolClinBreak', 'MolClinGene', 'RecurrentData', 'RecurrentNumData', 'Reference']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 17:07:03 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency
chr1:str,p36.33:str,start1:int,end1:int,amp_num1:int,amp_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num1:int,gain_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num1:int,loss_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num1:int,homoDel_freq1:0.00<=float<=100.00
chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:08:41 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency

chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 17:10:22 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Chromosome,Band_name,Band_start,Band_end,Amplifications_number,Amplifications_frequency,Gains_number,Gains_frequency,Losses_number,Losses_frequency,HomozygousDeletions_number,HomozygousDeletions_frequency

chr1:str,p36.32:str,start2:int,end2:int,amp_num2:int,amp_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,gain_num2:int,gain_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,loss_num2:int,loss_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00,homoDel_num2:int,homoDel_freq2:0.00<=float<=100.00
...
```

The table above displays the number and frequency (percentage with two decimal places) of amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions for each chromosomal band. It focuses on a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples, using CytoConverter genomic coordinates. The results are sorted by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair positions of each band in ascending order. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
