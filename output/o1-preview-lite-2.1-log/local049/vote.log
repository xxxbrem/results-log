After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **2result.sql** is the correct answer. Here's the reasoning:

- **Readability and Maintainability**: The second query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) with the `WITH` clause to define the top industry. This separates the logic of finding the top industry from the main query, making the SQL statement more readable and easier to understand.
  
- **Clarity in Logic**: By using a CTE, `2result.sql` clearly defines the top industry once and then references it in the main query. This approach reduces potential errors and duplication of code, enhancing clarity.
  
- **Functionality**: Both queries yield the same resultâ€”an average number of new unicorns per year of **57.6667**. However, `2result.sql` achieves this in a more structured and efficient manner.

- **SQL Best Practices**: Utilizing CTEs is considered a best practice in SQL for complex queries. It improves query organization and performance, especially when the same subquery is used multiple times.

Therefore, **2result.sql** is preferred for its better practice approach and clarity.
