2025-01-27 17:06:06 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're encountering this error. The "Access Denied" message indicates that you do not have permission to access the `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` table, or the table may not exist.

Here's how you can proceed:

1. **Verify Table and Dataset Names:**

   - Double-check that the dataset and table names are correct.
   - The dataset `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes` might not be publicly accessible or might not exist.

2. **Use Publicly Accessible Data:**

   - The 1000 Genomes Project data is available in the `bigquery-public-data` project, which is publicly accessible.
   - You can use the following table instead: `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants`.
   - The schema may be slightly different, so you'll need to adjust the column names accordingly.

3. **Adjusted SQL Queries Using the Public Dataset:**

   Here are 10 SQL queries adapted to the publicly accessible dataset:

   **Relevant Tables and Columns:**

   - **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants`
     - `reference_name`: Chromosome name.
     - `start_position`: Start position of the variant.
     - `end_position`: End position of the variant.
     - `reference_bases`: Reference bases.
     - `alternate_bases.alt`: Alternate bases (requires UNNEST).
     - `info.VT`: Variant type.
     - `info.HWE`: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium chi-squared score.
     - `call.genotype`: Genotype calls (requires UNNEST).
     - `info.AF`: Allele frequency.

   **Queries:**

   1. **Get distinct reference names:**
      ```sql
      SELECT DISTINCT `reference_name`
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants`
      LIMIT 100;
      ```

   2. **Get start and end positions within the specified range on chromosome 17:**
      ```sql
      SELECT `start_position`, `end_position`
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants`
      WHERE `reference_name` = 'chr17'
        AND `start_position` >= 41196311
        AND `end_position` <= 41277499
      LIMIT 100;
      ```

   3. **Retrieve reference and alternate bases for variants in the specified region:**
      ```sql
      SELECT `reference_bases`, alt.alt_base
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants`,
        UNNEST(`alternate_bases`) AS alt
      WHERE `reference_name` = 'chr17'
        AND `start_position` >= 41196311
        AND `end_position` <= 41277499
      LIMIT 100;
      ```

   4. **List variant types (`VT`) in the specified region:**
      ```sql
      SELECT DISTINCT info.VT
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants`
      WHERE `reference_name` = 'chr17'
        AND `start_position` >= 41196311
        AND `end_position` <= 41277499
        AND info.VT IS NOT NULL
      LIMIT 100;
      ```

   5. **Retrieve Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test statistics (`HWE`):**
      ```sql
      SELECT info.HWE
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants`
      WHERE `reference_name` = 'chr17'
        AND `start_position` >= 41196311
        AND `end_position` <= 41277499
        AND info.HWE IS NOT NULL
      LIMIT 100;
      ```

   6. **Get allele frequencies (`AF`):**
      ```sql
      SELECT info.AF
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants`
      WHERE `reference_name` = 'chr17'
        AND `start_position` >= 41196311
        AND `end_position` <= 41277499
        AND info.AF IS NOT NULL
      LIMIT 100;
      ```

   7. **Explore genotype data from the `call` column:**
      ```sql
      SELECT call.call_set_name, call.genotype
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants`,
        UNNEST(`call`) AS call
      WHERE `reference_name` = 'chr17'
        AND `start_position` >= 41196311
        AND `end_position` <= 41277499
      LIMIT 100;
      ```

   8. **Count different genotypes per variant:**
      ```sql
      SELECT
        `start_position`,
        COUNTIF(call.genotype = [0,0]) AS hom_ref_count,
        COUNTIF(call.genotype IN ([0,1], [1,0])) AS het_count,
        COUNTIF(call.genotype = [1,1]) AS hom_alt_count
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants`,
        UNNEST(`call`) AS call
      WHERE `reference_name` = 'chr17'
        AND `start_position` >= 41196311
        AND `end_position` <= 41277499
      GROUP BY `start_position`
      LIMIT 100;
      ```

   9. **Get the total number of genotype calls per variant:**
      ```sql
      SELECT `start_position`, ARRAY_LENGTH(`call`) AS num_calls
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants`
      WHERE `reference_name` = 'chr17'
        AND `start_position` >= 41196311
        AND `end_position` <= 41277499
      LIMIT 100;
      ```

   10. **List variants with their allele frequencies and HWE scores:**
       ```sql
       SELECT
         `reference_name`,
         `start_position`,
         `end_position`,
         `reference_bases`,
         alt.alt_base,
         info.VT,
         info.HWE,
         info.AF
       FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants`,
         UNNEST(`alternate_bases`) AS alt
       WHERE `reference_name` = 'chr17'
         AND `start_position` >= 41196311
         AND `end_position` <= 41277499
       LIMIT 100;
       ```

**Explanation:**

- **Project and Dataset Names:** We've switched to using the `bigquery-public-data` project, which contains publicly accessible genomic datasets.
- **Adjusted Column Names:** The public dataset may have different column names (e.g., `start_position` instead of `start`, `end_position` instead of `end`).
- **Chromosome Naming:** In the public dataset, chromosomes may be named with the 'chr' prefix (e.g., 'chr17' instead of '17').

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Adjusted Queries:** Try running the adjusted queries using the `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants` table.
- **Permissions:** Ensure that you have access to query public datasets in BigQuery.
- **Review the Schema:** You can preview the table schema in the BigQuery console to familiarize yourself with any differences.

**Example Final Output:**

Once you retrieve the data, you can structure the final output as requested:

```csv
reference_name,start_position,end_position,reference_bases,alternate_bases,variant_type,chi_squared_score,observed_counts_homozygous_reference_genotypes,expected_counts_homozygous_reference_genotypes,observed_counts_heterozygous_genotypes,expected_counts_heterozygous_genotypes,observed_counts_homozygous_alternate_genotypes,expected_counts_homozygous_alternate_genotypes,allele_frequencies
chr17,41196315,41196316,A,T,SNP,0.05,obs_hom_ref:int,exp_hom_ref:float,obs_het:int,exp_het:float,obs_hom_alt:int,exp_hom_alt:float,0.12
...
```

- **Note:** Replace placeholders with actual data obtained from your queries.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue and proceed with your analysis. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
2025-01-27 17:06:35 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-27 17:06:35 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still experiencing access issues with the dataset. The "Access Denied" error indicates that you either don't have permission to access the table, or the table doesn't exist or is not publicly available.

Let's work through some steps to resolve this issue:

---

### **1. Verify the Table and Dataset Names**

Based on the error message, it seems that the table `bigquery-public-data.human_variants.1000_genomes_variants` is not accessible. The `bigquery-public-data` project hosts a variety of public datasets, but the specific table you're trying to access may not exist or may have moved.

#### **Updated Dataset Information**

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the 1000 Genomes Project data was available under different dataset names. You might want to try the following table instead:

- **Dataset**: `bigquery-public-data.human_genome_variants`
- **Table**: `1000_genomes_variants`

**Adjusted SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT reference_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.human_genome_variants.1000_genomes_variants`
LIMIT 100;
```

If this table also doesn't exist or is inaccessible, it's possible that the dataset has been moved or the table has been renamed.

---

### **2. Confirm Access to BigQuery Public Datasets**

To access public datasets in BigQuery, you need to ensure that:

- You have a Google Cloud project set up.
- The BigQuery API is enabled for your project.
- You have sufficient permissions (at least `bigquery.user` role) to query public datasets.

**Steps to Enable BigQuery API:**

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Select your project or create a new one.
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Library**.
4. Search for **BigQuery API** and ensure it's enabled.

---

### **3. Check Your Billing and Quota Limits**

While querying public datasets is free up to a certain limit, you still need to have billing enabled on your project to access certain datasets.

- **Enable Billing**: Ensure that billing is set up for your Google Cloud project.
- **BigQuery Sandbox**: If you don't have billing enabled, you can use the [BigQuery Sandbox](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox), which allows limited access without a credit card.

---

### **4. Explore Available Public Datasets**

You can browse the available datasets in the `bigquery-public-data` project to confirm the correct dataset and table names.

**How to Explore Datasets:**

1. Open the [BigQuery console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).
2. In the **Explorer** pane, expand **`bigquery-public-data`**.
3. Browse through the datasets to find those related to genomics or the 1000 Genomes Project.

---

### **5. Alternative Datasets**

If the `1000_genomes_variants` table is not available, you can use other public genomic datasets:

#### **Example: NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project**

- **Dataset**: `bigquery-public-data.ncbi_variation`
- **Table**: `variants`

**Sample SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT reference_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncbi_variation.variants`
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **Example: Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)**

- **Dataset**: `bigquery-public-data.gnomad`
- **Table**: `genomes`

**Sample SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT reference_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.gnomad.genomes`
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **6. Updated SQL Queries Based on Available Data**

Assuming you have access to the `gnomAD` dataset, here's how you can adjust your SQL queries:

**a. Get Distinct Reference Names:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT reference_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.gnomad.v3_genomes`
LIMIT 100;
```

**b. Retrieve Variants on Chromosome 17 in the Specified Range:**

```sql
SELECT
  reference_name,
  start_position,
  end_position,
  reference_bases,
  alternate_bases,
  allele_frequency,
  variant_type,
  info.HWE AS chi_squared_score
FROM `bigquery-public-data.gnomad.v3_genomes`
WHERE reference_name = 'chr17'
  AND start_position BETWEEN 41196311 AND 41277499
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:** The actual table name and fields may vary. Be sure to verify the table schema in the BigQuery console.

---

### **7. Verify Dataset Accessibility**

If you're still unable to access any datasets, it's possible that:

- Your Google Cloud account doesn't have the necessary permissions.
- There's a policy or organizational restriction in place.
- The datasets require special access or authentication.

---

### **8. Consider Alternative Methods to Access the Data**

If you cannot access the required data through BigQuery, you might consider:

- **Downloading Data Directly**: Visit the [1000 Genomes Project website](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data) to download the data files. You can then process them locally or upload them to your own BigQuery dataset.
- **Using Other Public Resources**: Platforms like [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html), [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/), or the [NCBI Variation Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/docs/human_variation_vcf/) may have accessible data.

---

### **9. Contact Support**

If you believe you should have access but are still encountering issues:

- **Google Cloud Support**: Reach out to [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support) for assistance.
- **Community Forums**: Post your issue on platforms like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-bigquery) or the [Google Cloud Community](https://cloud.google.com/community).

---

### **Summary of Steps to Take**

1. **Double-Check Table Names and Availability**: Use the BigQuery console to find the correct dataset and table.

2. **Ensure Proper Permissions**: Verify that you have the necessary permissions and that the BigQuery API is enabled.

3. **Enable Billing if Necessary**: Some datasets require billing to be enabled even if the queries are within the free tier.

4. **Try Alternative Datasets**: Use other publicly available genomic datasets in BigQuery.

5. **Consider Downloading the Data**: If BigQuery access isn't possible, download the data directly from official sources.

---

### **Final Note**

Access issues can be frustrating, but they are often resolvable with a bit of troubleshooting. By verifying your permissions and exploring alternative datasets, you should be able to proceed with your analysis.

If you need further assistance with specific queries or data processing steps once you have access to the data, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help.
2025-01-27 17:07:15 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-27 17:07:15 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear that you're still experiencing issues accessing the dataset. The 404 error indicates that the table `bigquery-public-data.human_genome_variants.1000_genomes_variants` does not exist in the location `US`. This suggests that the table may have been moved, renamed, or is no longer available in the `bigquery-public-data` project.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the public datasets in BigQuery may have updated their structures and available tables. Here's how you can proceed to find an accessible dataset and adjust your SQL queries accordingly.

---

### **1. Verify Available Datasets in BigQuery**

Before proceeding, it's important to check the current available datasets in the `bigquery-public-data` project:

- **Steps to Explore Datasets:**
  - Go to the [BigQuery console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).
  - In the **Explorer** pane on the left, expand the **`bigquery-public-data`** project.
  - Browse through the datasets to locate those related to genomic variants.

---

### **2. Use the 1000 Genomes Project Dataset in `genomics_public_data`**

The 1000 Genomes Project data is available in the `genomics-public-data` project. You can use the following dataset and table:

- **Project:** `genomics-public-data`
- **Dataset:** `1000_genomes`
- **Table:** `variants`

**Note:** This dataset provides variant data from the 1000 Genomes Project and should contain the information you need.

---

### **3. Adjusted SQL Queries Using the `genomics-public-data` Dataset**

Here are adjusted SQL queries to help you retrieve the data required for your task.

#### **a. Get Distinct Reference Names:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT reference_name
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **b. Retrieve Variants on Chromosome 17 in the Specified Range:**

```sql
SELECT
  reference_name,
  start_position,
  end_position,
  reference_bases,
  ALT.alt,
  INFO['VT'].string_value AS variant_type,
  INFO['HWE'].float_value AS chi_squared_score,
  INFO['AF'].float_value AS allele_frequency
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
  UNNEST(alternate_bases) AS ALT
WHERE reference_name = '17'
  AND start_position BETWEEN 41196311 AND 41277499
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **c. Count Observed Genotype Counts:**

To get observed counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, you'll need to unnest the `call` field.

```sql
SELECT
  reference_name,
  start_position,
  end_position,
  reference_bases,
  ALT.alt,
  COUNTIF(call.genotype = [0,0]) AS observed_hom_ref_count,
  COUNTIF(call.genotype IN ([0,1], [1,0])) AS observed_het_count,
  COUNTIF(call.genotype = [1,1]) AS observed_hom_alt_count
FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
  UNNEST(alternate_bases) AS ALT,
  UNNEST(call) AS call
WHERE reference_name = '17'
  AND start_position BETWEEN 41196311 AND 41277499
GROUP BY reference_name, start_position, end_position, reference_bases, ALT.alt
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **d. Calculate Expected Genotype Counts Using Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium**

To calculate expected counts, you'd use the allele frequencies. Assuming you have the allele frequency `p` (frequency of the reference allele), the expected counts are:

- Expected homozygous reference: `p^2 * total_calls`
- Expected heterozygous: `2 * p * q * total_calls`
- Expected homozygous alternate: `q^2 * total_calls`

However, since BigQuery doesn't allow direct calculation without data, we'll set up the query structure:

```sql
WITH allele_frequencies AS (
  SELECT
    reference_name,
    start_position,
    end_position,
    reference_bases,
    ALT.alt,
    SAFE_CAST(INFO['AF'].float_value AS FLOAT64) AS allele_frequency,
    ARRAY_LENGTH(call) AS total_calls
  FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
    UNNEST(alternate_bases) AS ALT
  WHERE reference_name = '17'
    AND start_position BETWEEN 41196311 AND 41277499
)

SELECT
  af.reference_name,
  af.start_position,
  af.end_position,
  af.reference_bases,
  af.alt,
  af.allele_frequency,
  (af.allele_frequency * af.allele_frequency) * af.total_calls AS expected_hom_alt_count,
  (2 * af.allele_frequency * (1 - af.allele_frequency)) * af.total_calls AS expected_het_count,
  ((1 - af.allele_frequency) * (1 - af.allele_frequency)) * af.total_calls AS expected_hom_ref_count
FROM allele_frequencies AS af
LIMIT 100;
```

#### **e. Combine Observed and Expected Counts**

You can join the observed and expected counts to compare them:

```sql
WITH observed_counts AS (
  SELECT
    reference_name,
    start_position,
    end_position,
    reference_bases,
    ALT.alt,
    COUNTIF(call.genotype = [0,0]) AS observed_hom_ref_count,
    COUNTIF(call.genotype IN ([0,1], [1,0])) AS observed_het_count,
    COUNTIF(call.genotype = [1,1]) AS observed_hom_alt_count,
    ARRAY_LENGTH(call) AS total_calls
  FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
    UNNEST(alternate_bases) AS ALT,
    UNNEST(call) AS call
  WHERE reference_name = '17'
    AND start_position BETWEEN 41196311 AND 41277499
  GROUP BY reference_name, start_position, end_position, reference_bases, ALT.alt
),
allele_frequencies AS (
  SELECT
    reference_name,
    start_position,
    end_position,
    reference_bases,
    ALT.alt,
    SAFE_CAST(INFO['AF'].float_value AS FLOAT64) AS allele_frequency,
    ARRAY_LENGTH(call) AS total_calls
  FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
    UNNEST(alternate_bases) AS ALT
  WHERE reference_name = '17'
    AND start_position BETWEEN 41196311 AND 41277499
)

SELECT
  o.reference_name,
  o.start_position,
  o.end_position,
  o.reference_bases,
  o.alt,
  o.observed_hom_ref_count,
  o.observed_het_count,
  o.observed_hom_alt_count,
  a.allele_frequency,
  (a.allele_frequency * a.allele_frequency) * a.total_calls AS expected_hom_alt_count,
  (2 * a.allele_frequency * (1 - a.allele_frequency)) * a.total_calls AS expected_het_count,
  ((1 - a.allele_frequency) * (1 - a.allele_frequency)) * a.total_calls AS expected_hom_ref_count
FROM observed_counts AS o
JOIN allele_frequencies AS a
ON o.reference_name = a.reference_name
AND o.start_position = a.start_position
AND o.end_position = a.end_position
AND o.reference_bases = a.reference_bases
AND o.alt = a.alt
LIMIT 100;
```

### **4. Explanation of Adjusted Queries**

- **Project and Dataset Names:** We've switched to using the `genomics-public-data` project, which hosts the 1000 Genomes Project data.

- **Table Schema Differences:** The schema may differ from previous examples. For instance:
  - The `alternate_bases` field might be an array of structures, requiring `UNNEST`.
  - The `INFO` field may be a key-value mapping.

- **Field Names:**
  - `reference_name`: Chromosome name (e.g., '17' for chromosome 17).
  - `start_position` and `end_position`: Position of the variant.
  - `reference_bases` and `alternate_bases`: Nucleotide bases.
  - `INFO`: A mapping of additional information, where you can extract fields like 'AF' and 'HWE'.

---

### **5. Verify Access and Permissions**

- **Accessing `genomics-public-data`:**
  - The `genomics-public-data` project is publicly accessible, but you need to have the appropriate permissions to query public datasets.
  - Ensure you're logged into your Google Cloud account and have the BigQuery API enabled.

- **Billing Requirements:**
  - While querying public datasets is free within certain limits, some actions may require billing to be enabled on your project.
  - Check if billing is set up and if you have any quotas or limits applied.

---

### **6. Alternative Datasets**

If you still cannot access the `genomics-public-data` project, consider using other genomic datasets:

#### **a. The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)**

- **Project:** `bigquery-public-data`
- **Dataset:** `gnomad`

**Adjusted Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  reference_name,
  start_position,
  end_position,
  reference_bases,
  ALT.alt,
  INFO.AF[OFFSET(0)] AS allele_frequency
FROM `bigquery-public-data.gnomad_exomes.gnomad_exomes_rsids`,
  UNNEST(alternate_bases) AS ALT
WHERE reference_name = '17'
  AND start_position BETWEEN 41196311 AND 41277499
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:** The `gnomAD` dataset may have different table names and structures, so verify the schema in the BigQuery console.

---

### **7. Download and Import the Data Manually**

If none of the public datasets are accessible, you can download the data and upload it to your own BigQuery project:

- **Download Data:**
  - Visit the [1000 Genomes Project FTP site](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/) to download VCF files for chromosome 17.

- **Upload to Google Cloud Storage:**
  - Upload the VCF files to a Google Cloud Storage bucket in your project.

- **Load into BigQuery:**
  - Use the BigQuery console or bq command-line tool to load the VCF files into a BigQuery table.
  - Specify the appropriate schema and enable the VCF parser.

2025-01-27 17:08:28 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-27 17:08:28 - root - INFO - I apologize for the confusion and for any inconvenience caused. The error you're encountering indicates that the column `start_position` is unrecognized in the `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` table.

In the `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` table, the position columns are named `start` and `end`, not `start_position` and `end_position`.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT `start`, `end`
   FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Column Names:** Use `start` instead of `start_position`, and `end` instead of `end_position`.
- **Table Schema Adjustment:** The `variants` table in the `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes` dataset uses `start` and `end` for genomic positions.

---

**Corrections for the Other SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve Reference and Alternate Bases for Variants in the Specified Region:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `reference_bases`, ALT_base
   FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
     UNNEST(`alternate_bases`) AS ALT_base
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **Position Columns:** Use `start` and `end`.
   - **Alternate Bases:** Unnest `alternate_bases` and alias as `ALT_base`.

---

2. **List Distinct Variant Types (`VT`) in the Specified Region:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT info_field.value AS VT
   FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
     UNNEST(`info`) AS info_field
   WHERE info_field.key = 'VT'
     AND `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
     AND info_field.value IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **Accessing INFO Fields:** The `info` field is an array of key-value pairs. We need to `UNNEST` it and filter for the key 'VT'.
   - **Position Columns:** Use `start` and `end`.

---

3. **Retrieve Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Test Statistics (`HWE`):**

   ```sql
   SELECT SAFE_CAST(info_field.value AS FLOAT64) AS HWE
   FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
     UNNEST(`info`) AS info_field
   WHERE info_field.key = 'HWE'
     AND `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
     AND info_field.value IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **Accessing HWE Value:** Unnest the `info` field and filter for the key 'HWE'. Use `SAFE_CAST` to convert the value to a floating-point number.
   - **Position Columns:** Use `start` and `end`.

---

4. **Get Allele Counts (`AC`), Total Number of Alleles (`AN`), and Allele Frequency (`AF`):**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     SAFE_CAST(info_field_AC.value AS INT64) AS AC,
     SAFE_CAST(info_field_AN.value AS INT64) AS AN,
     SAFE_CAST(info_field_AF.value AS FLOAT64) AS AF
   FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
     UNNEST(`info`) AS info_field_AC,
     UNNEST(`info`) AS info_field_AN,
     UNNEST(`info`) AS info_field_AF
   WHERE info_field_AC.key = 'AC'
     AND info_field_AN.key = 'AN'
     AND info_field_AF.key = 'AF'
     AND `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **Unnest INFO Fields Separately:** For each key ('AC', 'AN', 'AF'), we unnest the `info` field separately.
   - **Position Columns:** Use `start` and `end`.

---

5. **Explore Genotype Data from the `call` Column:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c.genotype
   FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
     UNNEST(`call`) AS c
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **Position Columns:** Use `start` and `end`.
   - **Accessing Genotypes:** Unnest the `call` array to access individual genotype calls.

---

6. **Count Different Genotypes per Variant:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     `start`,
     COUNTIF(ARRAY_TO_STRING(c.genotype, '/') = '0/0') AS hom_ref_count,
     COUNTIF(ARRAY_TO_STRING(c.genotype, '/') IN ('0/1', '1/0')) AS het_count,
     COUNTIF(ARRAY_TO_STRING(c.genotype, '/') = '1/1') AS hom_alt_count
   FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
     UNNEST(`call`) AS c
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   GROUP BY `start`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **Position Columns:** Use `start`.
   - **Genotype Representation:** Convert the genotype array to a string for comparison.
   - **Counting Genotypes:** Use `COUNTIF` to count each genotype category.

---

7. **Get the Total Number of Genotype Calls per Variant:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `start`, ARRAY_LENGTH(`call`) AS num_calls
   FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **Position Columns:** Use `start`.
   - **Counting Calls:** Use `ARRAY_LENGTH` to get the number of genotype calls per variant.

---

8. **List Sample IDs and Their Genotypes for Variants in the Specified Region:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c.call_set_name, c.genotype
   FROM `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` AS v,
     UNNEST(v.`call`) AS c
   WHERE v.`reference_name` = '17'
     AND v.`start` >= 41196311
     AND v.`end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **Position Columns:** Use `start` and `end`.
   - **Accessing Call Data:** Unnest the `call` array to access sample IDs (`call_set_name`) and genotypes.

---

**Additional Notes:**

- **INFO Field Access:** In the `genomics-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` table, the `info` field is an array of STRUCTs with `key` and `value` fields. Access it by unnesting `info` and filtering based on the `key`.

- **Genotype Representation:** The `genotype` field within `call` is an array of integers. It represents the alleles for each sample.

- **Position Columns:** Ensure that you use the correct position column names (`start` and `end`) in all your queries.

- **Data Types:** Use `SAFE_CAST` to convert values to the appropriate data types, handling any possible nulls or type mismatches.

---

**Example Final Output Structure:**

Based on the corrected queries, once you retrieve the data, you can structure your final output as requested:

```csv
reference_name,start,end,reference_bases,alternate_bases,variant_type,chi_squared_score,observed_counts_homozygous_reference_genotypes,expected_counts_homozygous_reference_genotypes,observed_counts_heterozygous_genotypes,expected_counts_heterozygous_genotypes,observed_counts_homozygous_alternate_genotypes,expected_counts_homozygous_alternate_genotypes,allele_frequency
17,41196315,41196316,A,G,SNP,0.05,45,44.2,10,11.6,5,4.2,0.12
...
```

---

**Summary:**

- **Use Correct Column Names:** Replace `start_position` with `start`, and `end_position` with `end`.
- **Accessing the INFO Field:** Unnest the `info` array and filter by the desired key.
- **Handling Genotype Arrays:** Convert genotype arrays to strings for comparison with common genotype representations like '0/0', '0/1', '1/1'.
- **Unnesting Arrays:** Use `UNNEST` to work with repeated fields such as `alternate_bases`, `info`, and `call`.

Relevant tables and columns:

- **Table**: `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`

  - `reference_name`: To filter variants on chromosome 17.
  - `start`: Start position of the variant; used for filtering within the specified range.
  - `end`: End position of the variant; used for filtering within the specified range.
  - `reference_bases`: Reference bases at the variant position; required for output.
  - `alternate_bases`: Alternate bases at the variant position; required for output.
  - `VT`: Variant type; required for output.
  - `HWE`: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test statistic (chi-squared score); required for output.
  - `call`: Contains genotype data per sample; used to calculate observed counts of genotypes.
  - `AF`: Allele frequency; required for output.
  - **Conditions**:
    - `reference_name` = '17'
    - `start` >= 41196311
    - `end` <= 41277499

Here are 10 different BigQuery SQL queries to explore the relevant data:

1. **Get distinct reference names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `reference_name`
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get start and end positions within the specified range on chromosome 17:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `start`, `end`
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve reference and alternate bases for variants in the specified region:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `reference_bases`, alt_base
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
     UNNEST(`alternate_bases`) AS alt_base
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **List variant types (`VT`) in the specified region:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `VT`
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test statistics (`HWE`):**
   ```sql
   SELECT `HWE`
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Get allele counts (`AC`), total number of alleles (`AN`), and allele frequency (`AF`):**
   ```sql
   SELECT `AC`, `AN`, `AF`
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Explore genotype data from the `call` column:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.genotype
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
     UNNEST(`call`) AS c
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count different genotypes per variant:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     `start`,
     COUNTIF(c.genotype = [0,0]) AS hom_ref_count,
     COUNTIF(c.genotype IN ([0,1], [1,0])) AS het_count,
     COUNTIF(c.genotype = [1,1]) AS hom_alt_count
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`,
     UNNEST(`call`) AS c
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   GROUP BY `start`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Get the total number of genotype calls per variant:**
   ```sql
   SELECT `start`, ARRAY_LENGTH(`call`) AS num_calls
   FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants`
   WHERE `reference_name` = '17'
     AND `start` >= 41196311
     AND `end` <= 41277499
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List sample IDs and their genotypes for variants in the specified region:**
    ```sql
    SELECT c.call_set_name, c.genotype
    FROM `spider2-public-data.1000_genomes.variants` AS v,
      UNNEST(`call`) AS c
    WHERE v.`reference_name` = '17'
      AND v.`start` >= 41196311
      AND v.`end` <= 41277499
    LIMIT 100;

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: What are the reference names, start positions, end positions, reference bases, alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores (calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), and the observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, including their allele frequencies and allele frequencies, for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41196311 and 41277499?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
reference_name,start,end,reference_bases,alternate_bases,variant_type,chi_squared_score,observed_counts_homozygous_reference_genotypes,expected_counts_homozygous_reference_genotypes,observed_counts_heterozygous_genotypes,expected_counts_heterozygous_genotypes,observed_counts_homozygous_alternate_genotypes,expected_counts_homozygous_alternate_genotypes,allele_frequencies
ref_name1:str,start1:int,end1:int,ref_bases1:str,alt_bases1:str,variant_type1:str,chi_squared1:float,obs_hom_ref1:int,exp_hom_ref1:float,obs_het1:int,exp_het1:float,obs_hom_alt1:int,exp_hom_alt1:float,allele_freq1:float
ref_name2:str,start2:int,end2:int,ref_bases2:str,alt_bases2:str,variant_type2:str,chi_squared2:float,obs_hom_ref2:int,exp_hom_ref2:float,obs_het2:int,exp_het2:float,obs_hom_alt2:int,exp_hom_alt2:float,allele_freq2:float
...
```

This table provides the reference names, start and end positions, reference and alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test, observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, along with their allele frequencies for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41196311 and 41277499..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'spider2-public-data': {'1000_genomes': ['pedigree', 'sample_info', 'variants']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 17:15:03 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the reference names, start positions, end positions, reference bases, alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores (calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), and the observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, including their allele frequencies and allele frequencies, for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41196311 and 41277499?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

2025-01-27 17:15:30 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the reference names, start positions, end positions, reference bases, alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores (calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), and the observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, including their allele frequencies and allele frequencies, for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41196311 and 41277499?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
reference_name,start,end,reference_bases,alternate_bases,variant_type,chi_squared_score,observed_counts_homozygous_reference_genotypes,expected_counts_homozygous_reference_genotypes,observed_counts_heterozygous_genotypes,expected_counts_heterozygous_genotypes,observed_counts_homozygous_alternate_genotypes,expected_counts_homozygous_alternate_genotypes,allele_frequencies

```

This table provides the reference names, start and end positions, reference and alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test, observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, along with their allele frequencies for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41196311 and 41277499. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 17:16:15 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the reference names, start positions, end positions, reference bases, alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores (calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), and the observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, including their allele frequencies and allele frequencies, for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41196311 and 41277499?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
reference_name,start,end,reference_bases,alternate_bases,variant_type,chi_squared_score,observed_counts_homozygous_reference_genotypes,expected_counts_homozygous_reference_genotypes,observed_counts_heterozygous_genotypes,expected_counts_heterozygous_genotypes,observed_counts_homozygous_alternate_genotypes,expected_counts_homozygous_alternate_genotypes,allele_frequencies

...
```

This table provides the reference names, start and end positions, reference and alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test, observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, along with their allele frequencies for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41196311 and 41277499. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
