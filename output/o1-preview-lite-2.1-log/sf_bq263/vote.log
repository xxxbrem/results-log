After comparing both SQL queries, **`2result.sql`** is the correct one. This is because it includes the `NULLIF` function in the profit margin calculation:

```sql
ROUND(SUM(oi."sale_price" - ii."cost") / NULLIF(SUM(oi."sale_price"), 0), 4) AS "Profit_Margin"
```

Using `NULLIF` ensures that if the total sales for any month are zero, the division does not result in a division-by-zero error, which could cause the query to fail. This makes the query more robust and reliable.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plaintext
2result.sql
