Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `activity_log`
   - **session**: To group actions by user session.
   - **stamp**: To order actions chronologically.
   - **action**: To identify the actions performed by users.
   - **path**: To identify the pages visited by users (e.g., `/detail`).

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter records where `path` equals `'/detail'`.
- Order actions by `stamp` within each `session`.
- Identify sequences where `path` is `'/detail'` twice in a row within the same `session`.
- Retrieve the third action following the two consecutive `'/detail'` page visits.
- Count the occurrences of each third action.
- Limit the results to the top three most common third actions.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List distinct actions performed by users:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "action"
   FROM "activity_log"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct paths visited by users:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "path"
   FROM "activity_log"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve all records where `path` is `'/detail'`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "activity_log"
   WHERE "path" = '/detail'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve session-wise actions ordered by timestamp:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "stamp", "action", "path"
   FROM "activity_log"
   ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find sessions with at least two actions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "session", COUNT(*) as action_count
   FROM "activity_log"
   GROUP BY "session"
   HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Retrieve actions preceding and following `'/detail'` page visits:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "stamp", "action", "path"
   FROM "activity_log"
   WHERE "session" IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "session"
     FROM "activity_log"
     WHERE "path" = '/detail'
   )
   ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Identify sequences of actions where `path` is `'/detail'`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM (
     SELECT "session", "stamp", "action", "path",
       LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS prev_path
     FROM "activity_log"
   ) AS sub
   WHERE "path" = '/detail' AND prev_path = '/detail'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List third actions after two consecutive `'/detail'` visits:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM (
     SELECT "session", "stamp", "action", "path",
       LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS prev_path1,
       LAG("path", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS prev_path2
     FROM "activity_log"
   ) AS sub
   WHERE prev_path1 = '/detail' AND prev_path2 = '/detail'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count occurrences of third actions after two `'/detail'` visits:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "action", COUNT(*) as occurrence_count
   FROM (
     SELECT "session", "action",
       LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS prev_path1,
       LAG("path", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS prev_path2
     FROM "activity_log"
   ) AS sub
   WHERE prev_path1 = '/detail' AND prev_path2 = '/detail'
   GROUP BY "action"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve the top three most common third actions:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "action", COUNT(*) as occurrence_count
    FROM (
      SELECT "session", "action",
        LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS prev_path1,
        LAG("path", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS prev_path2
      FROM "activity_log"
    ) AS sub
    WHERE prev_path1 = '/detail' AND prev_path2 = '/detail'
    GROUP BY "action"
    ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

11. **Display sessions where the pattern occurs:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "session"
    FROM (
      SELECT "session",
        LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS prev_path1,
        LAG("path", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS prev_path2
      FROM "activity_log"
    ) AS sub
    WHERE "path" IS NOT NULL AND prev_path1 = '/detail' AND prev_path2 = '/detail'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Check the timestamps of the sequences:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "session", "stamp", "action", "path"
    FROM (
      SELECT *, 
        LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS prev_path1,
        LAG("path", 2) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS prev_path2
      FROM "activity_log"
    ) AS sub
    WHERE prev_path1 = '/detail' AND prev_path2 = '/detail'
    ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Identify users who frequently visit `'/detail'`:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "session", COUNT(*) as detail_visits
    FROM "activity_log"
    WHERE "path" = '/detail'
    GROUP BY "session"
    ORDER BY detail_visits DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Find the most common actions overall:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "action", COUNT(*) as total_count
    FROM "activity_log"
    GROUP BY "action"
    ORDER BY total_count DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **List actions following a single `'/detail'` visit:**
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM (
      SELECT "session", "stamp", "action", "path",
        LAG("path", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY "session" ORDER BY "stamp") AS prev_path
      FROM "activity_log"
    ) AS sub
    WHERE prev_path = '/detail'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the data and identifying the sequences where users visit the `'/detail'` page twice in a row and the subsequent actions they take.

Task: List the three most common third actions users take after visiting the `/detail` page twice in a row, including each action's occurrence count.

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Third_Action,Occurrence_Count
action1:str,count1:int
action2:str,count2:int
action3:str,count3:int
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```

This table lists the three most common third actions taken by users after visiting the `/detail` page twice in a row, along with the number of times each action occurred..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
