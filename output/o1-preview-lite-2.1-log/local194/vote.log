After comparing both SQL queries, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct one. 

**Reason:**

- **Logical Structure:** `2result.sql` follows a clear and logical sequence of steps:
  - Calculates total revenue per film.
  - Determines the number of actors in each film.
  - Computes the average revenue per actor for each film.
  - Associates each actor with their films and the corresponding average revenue.
  - Uses window functions to rank the films per actor and selects the top three.

- **Correctness and Clarity:** The query correctly handles the aggregation and division to compute the average revenue per actor and ensures accurate rankings.

- **Optimization:** The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and the structuring of joins improves readability and maintainability.

Therefore, the chosen SQL query is:

```plaintext
2result.sql
```
