After reviewing and comparing the three SQL queries, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that fulfills the task requirements. Here is the reasoning:

**Task Requirements:**

- **Identify the zip code with the third-highest total sales** (of all liquor sales, not just Bourbon Whiskey) in Dubuque County for the year 2022.
- **Calculate the monthly per capita Bourbon Whiskey sales** for that specific zip code in 2022.
- **Consider only the population aged 21 and over** for the per capita calculation.

**Analysis of Each SQL Query:**

### **`0result.sql`**

- **Identifies the Third-Highest Zip Code:**

  - The CTE `sales_total_per_zip` calculates total sales per zip code in Dubuque County for 2022.
  - The CTE `zip_code_ranked` ranks the zip codes based on total sales in descending order.
  - The CTE `target_zip` selects the zip code with `rn = 3`, which is the third-highest total sales zip code.

- **Calculates Monthly Bourbon Whiskey Sales:**

  - The main `SELECT` statement filters sales data for the target zip code, Bourbon Whiskey category (`category_name = 'STRAIGHT BOURBON WHISKIES'`), and the year 2022.
  - It groups the sales by month and calculates the sum of `sale_dollars`.

- **Considers Population Aged 21 and Over:**

  - The CTE `population_21_plus` sums the population where `minimum_age >= 21` or `maximum_age >= 21` for the target zip code.
  - The per capita sales are calculated by dividing the monthly sales by this population.

### **`1result.sql`**

- **Identifies the Third-Highest Zip Code:**

  - Similar to `0result.sql`, it identifies the third-highest total sales zip code in Dubuque County for 2022.

- **Calculates Monthly Bourbon Whiskey Sales:**

  - Filters sales data for the target zip code, Bourbon Whiskey category (`LOWER(category_name) LIKE '%bourbon%'`), and the year 2022.
  - Groups sales by month.

- **Does **Not** Consider Population Aged 21 and Over:**

  - The CTE `population_total` calculates the **total population**, without filtering for age.
  - The per capita calculation divides monthly sales by the total population, not the population aged 21 and over.
  
- **Incorrect Population Used:**

  - Since the task specifies using the population aged 21 and over, this query does not meet the requirements.

### **`2result.sql`**

- **Hardcodes Zip Code:**

  - The query directly uses `zip_code_std = '52003'` without determining if it is the third-highest total sales zip code for 2022.
  - There's no evidence that '52003' is the correct zip code as per the task.

- **Calculates Monthly Bourbon Whiskey Sales:**

  - Filters sales data for Bourbon Whiskey sales in the specified zip code and year.

- **Considers Population Aged 21 and Over:**

  - The CTE `population` sums the population where `minimum_age >= 21` for the specified zip code.

- **Does Not Dynamically Identify the Target Zip Code:**

  - By hardcoding the zip code, it may not fulfill the task if '52003' is not actually the third-highest total sales zip code for 2022.

---

**Conclusion:**

- **`0result.sql`** correctly:

  - Identifies the zip code with the third-highest total sales in Dubuque County for 2022.
  - Calculates monthly Bourbon Whiskey sales for that zip code.
  - Uses the population aged 21 and over for the per capita calculation.

- **`1result.sql`** uses the total population instead of the population aged 21 and over, which does not meet the task's requirements.

- **`2result.sql`** does not dynamically determine the correct zip code and may not be using the appropriate one.

Therefore, the correct SQL query that accomplishes the task is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
