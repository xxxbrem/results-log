After comparing the provided SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL that answers the question is **`1result.sql`**.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - We need to determine which quickplay event type had the **lowest user retention rate during the second week** after users' initial engagement.
   - The users in scope are those who **first engaged between August 1 and August 15, 2018**.

2. **Analyzing the SQL Queries:**

   - **`0result.sql`:**
     - Calculates retention rates based on weeks since the user's first touch timestamp.
     - Uses `DATE_DIFF` to calculate the week difference.
     - Filters events occurring in weeks 0 and 1.
     - The result shows `level_start_quickplay` with a retention rate of approximately **23.84%**.
     - However, the retention rate seems unusually high compared to the other results, suggesting a potential error in the calculation or logic.

   - **`1result.sql`:**
     - Separately calculates:
       - **Total users** for each quickplay event type during the initial engagement period.
       - **Retained users** who performed the same quickplay event during their second week.
     - Joins the two datasets to compute the retention rate per quickplay event type.
     - The result shows `level_retry_quickplay` with the lowest retention rate of approximately **4.5302%**.
     - This approach aligns with standard retention calculations by considering specific event re-engagement in the retention period.

   - **`2result.sql`:**
     - Attempts to calculate the retention rate per quickplay event type.
     - Determines if a user had **any event** during the second week, not necessarily the same quickplay event type.
     - The retention rates are significantly higher (e.g., `level_start_quickplay` at **38.1%**), which may indicate that the calculation considers any user activity, not just the specified quickplay event type.
     - This does not directly answer the question focused on retention for each quickplay event type.

3. **Choosing the Correct SQL:**

   - **`1result.sql`** accurately calculates the retention rate by:
     - Focusing on users who first engaged during the specified period.
     - Calculating the number of users who repeated the **same quickplay event type** during the second week.
     - Providing retention rates that reflect users' return to perform the same quickplay activity, which is critical for event-type-specific retention analysis.
   - The result identifies `level_retry_quickplay` as the quickplay event type with the lowest retention rate during the second week, which directly answers the question.

4. **Conclusion:**

   - **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL because it:
     - Aligns with the required retention calculation methodology.
     - Provides accurate retention rates for each quickplay event type.
     - Correctly identifies the quickplay event type with the lowest user retention rate during the second week after initial engagement.
