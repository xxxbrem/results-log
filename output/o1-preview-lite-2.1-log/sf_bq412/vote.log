**Comparison of the SQL Queries and Results:**

---

**0result.sql:**

- **Query Analysis:**
  - **Filters Applied:**
    - Region code is 'HR' (Croatia).
    - Lower bound of shown times is greater than 10,000.
    - Upper bound of shown times is less than 25,000.
    - At least one audience criterion (demographics, geographic location, contextual signals, customer lists, or interest topics) is used, identified by checking if any of these fields in `"audience_selection_approach_info"` are `'CRITERIA_INCLUDED'` or `'CRITERIA_INCLUDED_AND_EXCLUDED'`.
  - **Data Retrieved:**
    - Page URL.
    - First shown time.
    - Last shown time.
    - Removal reason.
    - Violation category.
    - Lower and upper bound shown times.
  - **Ordering:**
    - Results are ordered by the most recent `"last_shown"` date in descending order.
  - **Limit:**
    - Top 5 ads are selected.

- **Result Analysis:**
  - The query correctly filters and retrieves ads that meet all specified conditions.
  - The output includes all required fields.
  - The results are ordered correctly to show the most recent ads.

**1result.sql:**

- **Query Analysis:**
  - **Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**
    - `filtered_ads`: Filters ads based on region and shown times.
    - `audience_match`: Identifies ads using at least one audience criterion.
    - `disapproval_info`: Retrieves removal reason and violation category.
  - **Joins CTEs to form the final result set.**
  - **Data Retrieved and Ordering:**
    - Similar to `0result.sql`.
  - **Limit:**
    - Results are limited to 5 ads.

- **Result Analysis:**
  - The query achieves the same result as `0result.sql` but uses CTEs, adding complexity without additional benefit.
  - All required conditions are applied, and necessary data is retrieved.

---

**2result.sql:**

- **Query Analysis:**
  - **Filters Applied:**
    - Same as in `0result.sql`, with explicit date conversions using `TO_DATE`.
    - Checks for audience criteria inclusion similar to `0result.sql`.
  - **Data Retrieved:**
    - Same fields as the other queries.
  - **Ordering and Limit:**
    - Results are ordered by `"last_shown"` date in descending order.
    - Limited to top 5 ads.

- **Result Analysis:**
  - The query correctly filters the ads and retrieves the required fields.
  - Date casting adds unnecessary complexity since the dates can be cast directly to `DATE` using `::DATE` as in `0result.sql`.

**Conclusion:**

All three queries successfully retrieve the required data and apply the necessary filters to meet the task's conditions. However, **`0result.sql`** stands out for the following reasons:

- **Simplicity and Efficiency:**
  - The query is straightforward and easy to read, with all conditions clearly specified in the `WHERE` clause.
  - It avoids unnecessary complexity such as multiple CTEs or extra date conversion functions.

- **Correct Application of Conditions:**
  - Filters are correctly applied to ensure only ads from Croatia with shown times between 10,000 and 25,000 are selected.
  - It accurately checks for the use of at least one audience criterion.

- **Accurate Results:**
  - The output includes all required fields.
  - Ads are correctly ordered by the most recent `last_shown` date.
