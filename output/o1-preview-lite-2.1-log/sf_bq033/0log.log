2025-01-23 23:17:52 - root - INFO - The error in your query occurs because the `"abstract_localized"` column contains an **array** of JSON objects rather than a single JSON object. To access the `"text"` key within the first element of the array, you need to specify the index `[0]` before accessing the `"text"` key. Here's how you can correct your query:

```sql
SELECT t."publication_number", t."abstract_localized"[0]:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
WHERE t."country_code" = 'US'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **t."abstract_localized"[0]:** This accesses the first element in the JSON array.
- **:"text"::STRING:** This extracts the value associated with the `"text"` key and casts it as a `STRING`.

Alternatively, if you want to handle cases where there might be multiple entries in the `"abstract_localized"` array (e.g., abstracts in multiple languages), you can use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to iterate over each element of the array:

```sql
SELECT t."publication_number", f.value:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f
WHERE t."country_code" = 'US'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."abstract_localized") f:** This expands the array into multiple rows, one for each element in the array.
- **f.value:"text"::STRING:** This extracts the `"text"` field from each JSON object in the array.

Using these corrected queries should resolve the syntax error and allow you to extract the abstract texts successfully.

**Testing the Corrected Query:**

You can run the corrected query to verify that it works:

```sql
SELECT t."publication_number", t."abstract_localized"[0]:"text"::STRING AS "abstract_text"
FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
WHERE t."country_code" = 'US'
LIMIT 10;
```

**Sample Results:**

```csv
publication_number,abstract_text
"US1234567A1","The subject invention relates to systems and methods..."
"US2345678A1","A method is described that involves..."
"US3456789A1","The invention comprises a method of dual oxide gate formation..."
...
```

These results should display the abstract texts for U.S. publications, allowing you to further filter and analyze the data as needed.

Data encoding one or more parameters related to the resource value is accessed, where the one or more parameters are monitored by a plurality of sensors that form an Internet of Things (IoT) and then released by the IoT of the plurality of sensors on a blockchain network. At least one parameter from the data is compared with a predetermined threshold value or a predetermined threshold range. In response to determining that the at least one parameter has exceeded the predetermined threshold value or the predetermined threshold range, a calculation of the resource value is triggered according to evaluation logic described by a smart contract released on the blockchain network in association with the one or more parameters being monitored, such that a consensus is reached on the blockchain network regarding the resource value that has been calculated."

Task: How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase "internet of things") filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings, the data would be structured as follows:

```csv
Year,Month,Num_Publications
2008,1,num_publications:int
2008,2,num_publications:int
...
2022,12,num_publications:int
```

*Note: `Num_Publications` represents the count of publications filed in each respective month and year.*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 23:19:31 - root - INFO - To determine the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase "internet of things") filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings, we can use the following SQL query:

```sql
WITH months AS (
    SELECT
        DATEADD(month, seq4(), '2008-01-01') AS month_date
    FROM
        TABLE(GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT => 180))
),
publications_filtered AS (
    SELECT
        TO_DATE(TO_CHAR(t."filing_date"), 'YYYYMMDD') AS filing_date_parsed
    FROM
        PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t
    WHERE
        t."country_code" = 'US'
        AND t."filing_date" BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20221231
        AND t."abstract_localized"[0]:'text'::STRING ILIKE '%internet of things%'
),
publication_counts AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_TRUNC('month', filing_date_parsed) AS month_date,
        COUNT(*) AS num_publications
    FROM
        publications_filtered
    GROUP BY
        month_date
)
SELECT
    YEAR(m.month_date) AS "Year",
    MONTH(m.month_date) AS "Month",
    COALESCE(pc.num_publications, 0) AS "Num_Publications"
FROM
    months m
    LEFT JOIN publication_counts pc ON pc.month_date = m.month_date
ORDER BY
    "Year", "Month";
```

This query performs the following steps:

1. **Generates a list of all months between January 2008 and December 2022** using the `GENERATOR` function in the `months` CTE (Common Table Expression).
2. **Filters the publications** to include only those:
   - With `country_code` equal to `'US'`.
   - With `filing_date` between `20080101` and `20221231`.
   - Where the abstract text (extracted from the first element of the `"abstract_localized"` array) contains the phrase `'internet of things'` (case-insensitive match using `ILIKE`).
3. **Counts the number of publications per month** in the `publication_counts` CTE by:
   - Truncating the `filing_date_parsed` to the first day of the month using `DATE_TRUNC('month', ...)`.
   - Grouping by the truncated date.
4. **Left joins the counts with the list of all months** to ensure that months with zero publications are included.
5. **Selects and displays the results** with columns for `Year`, `Month`, and `Num_Publications`, using `COALESCE` to replace `NULL` counts with zero.
6. **Orders the results** by `Year` and `Month` in ascending order.

*Note: Ensure that all column names and table references are adjusted to match the actual names in your database, and that all column names are enclosed in double quotation marks as per Snowflake SQL dialect requirements.*

2025-01-23 23:20:19 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase "internet of things") filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings, the data would be structured as follows:

```csv
Year,Month,Num_Publications
2008,1,num_publications:int
2008,2,num_publications:int
...
2022,12,num_publications:int
```

*Note: `Num_Publications` represents the count of publications filed in each respective month and year.* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-23 23:21:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase 'internet of things') were filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of U.S. publications related to IoT (where the abstract includes the phrase "internet of things") filed each month from 2008 to 2022, including months with no filings, the data would be structured as follows:

```csv
Year,Month,Num_Publications
2008,1,num_publications:int
2008,2,num_publications:int
...
2022,12,num_publications:int
```

*Note: `Num_Publications` represents the count of publications filed in each respective month and year.* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
