2025-01-26 23:40:48 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to a type mismatch in your SQL query. Specifically, you're comparing an `INT64` column (`ejection`) to a string (`'1'`). In SQL, when comparing values, both sides of the comparison operator should be of the same data type.

**Explanation of the Error:**

- **Error Message:** `No matching signature for operator = for argument types: INT64, STRING`
- **Cause:** The `ejection` column is of type `INT64` (an integer), but you're comparing it to `'1'`, which is a string because it's enclosed in single quotes.
- **Solution:** Remove the single quotes around `1` to treat it as an integer.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected query without the type mismatch:

```sql
SELECT 
     consecutive_number,
     person_number,
     ejection,
     CASE 
       WHEN ejection = 1 THEN 1  -- Assuming 1 indicates ejection occurred
       ELSE 0
     END AS rollover_indicator
FROM 
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
LIMIT 100;
```

**Additional Notes:**

- **Assumption on `ejection` Values:**
  - Ensure that the value `1` correctly represents an ejection in your data. You may want to refer to the data dictionary or documentation to confirm the meaning of `ejection` codes.
  - If `ejection` has other codes representing ejection occurrences (e.g., `2`, `3`), you should include them in your condition.

- **Example with Multiple Ejection Codes:**

  If, for example, any non-zero value indicates an ejection, you could modify the query as:

  ```sql
  SELECT 
       consecutive_number,
       person_number,
       ejection,
       CASE 
         WHEN ejection > 0 THEN 1  -- Any positive value indicates ejection occurred
         ELSE 0
       END AS rollover_indicator
  FROM 
       `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Understanding `ejection` Codes:**

  If you have access to the code definitions, you might find something like:

  - `0`: Not ejected
  - `1`: Totally ejected
  - `2`: Partially ejected
  - `...`: Other codes

  In that case, to mark any form of ejection, you can adjust your condition:

  ```sql
  SELECT 
       consecutive_number,
       person_number,
       ejection,
       CASE 
         WHEN ejection IN (1, 2) THEN 1  -- 1 or 2 indicates ejection occurred
         ELSE 0
       END AS rollover_indicator
  FROM 
       `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

**Why This Fix Works:**

- **Data Type Consistency:** By removing the single quotes around `1`, both `ejection` and `1` are treated as integers (`INT64`), resolving the type mismatch.
- **Logical Comparison:** This allows the SQL engine to evaluate the condition correctly, returning the expected results without errors.

**Running the Corrected Query:**

After applying the correction, you should be able to run the query successfully and obtain results similar to:

```csv
consecutive_number,person_number,ejection,rollover_indicator
390301,1,0,0
240301,1,0,0
390999,1,0,0
270285,1,0,0
170522,1,0,0
380037,1,0,0
290022,1,0,0

482805,1,0,0
560129,1,0,0
390312,1,0,0
...
```

**Conclusion:**

Always ensure that the data types on both sides of a comparison operator match. In SQL:

- Numbers should be compared with numbers (without quotes).
- Strings are enclosed in quotes and should be compared with strings.

If you encounter similar errors in the future, check the data types of your columns and the literals or variables you're comparing them to.

**Explanation:**

The SQL queries above are designed to extract critical details from the 2015 traffic accident data, focusing on the columns and conditions specified in your info document. By executing these queries, you can gather information on factors such as age, person type, restraint use, survival status, alcohol and drug involvement, airbag deployment, rollover occurrence, and driver distraction.

Each query selects specific columns from the relevant tables and applies conditions to calculate or interpret the data according to your requirements. The use of `LIMIT 100` ensures that the queries return a manageable number of rows for initial analysis.

Please replace `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities` with the actual database and schema names if they differ.Query:

Task: Please help me compile the critical details on traffic accidents in 2015, as listed in the info document.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
consecutive_number,county,type_of_intersection,light_condition,atmospheric_conditions_1,hour_of_crash,functional_system,related_factors,delay_to_hospital,delay_to_scene,age,person_type,seating_position,restraint,survived,rollover,airbag,alcohol,drugs,related_factors_person_level1,travel_speed,speeding_related,extent_of_damage,body_type,vehicle_removal,manner_of_collision,roadway_surface_condition,first_harmful_event,most_harmful_event
consecutive_number:int,county:str,type_of_intersection:str,light_condition:str,atmospheric_conditions_1:str,hour_of_crash:int,functional_system:str,related_factors:str,delay_to_hospital:int or NULL,delay_to_scene:int or NULL,age:int,person_type:str,seating_position:str,restraint:float (0 to 1),survived:int (0 or 1),rollover:int (0 or 1),airbag:int (0 or 1),alcohol:int (0 or 1),drugs:int (0 or 1),related_factors_person_level1:int,travel_speed:int,speeding_related:int (0 or 1),extent_of_damage:str,body_type:str,vehicle_removal:str,manner_of_collision:int (≤11),roadway_surface_condition:int (≤8),first_harmful_event:int (<90 or 0),most_harmful_event:int (<90 or 0)
...
```

**Explanation:**

The above CSV format lists the critical details of traffic accidents in 2015 as specified in the provided information. Each column represents a specific attribute of the accident, vehicle, or person involved. The data types and expected values are indicated for each field to clarify the nature of the data. The ellipsis (`...`) signifies that the dataset contains multiple records following this structure..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'nhtsa_traffic_fatalities': [' accident_2020', ' cevent_2017', ' cevent_2019', ' distract_2015', ' drimpair_2017', ' drimpair_2019', ' factor_2020', ' maneuver_2018', ' nmcrash_2018', ' nmcrash_2019', ' nmimpair_2015', ' nmimpair_2016', ' nmimpair_2018', ' safetyeq_2016', ' vsoe_2015', 'accident_2016', 'damage_2016', 'factor_2016', 'nmcrash_2016', 'person_2015']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 23:47:48 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please help me compile the critical details on traffic accidents in 2015, as listed in the info document., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
consecutive_number,county,type_of_intersection,light_condition,atmospheric_conditions_1,hour_of_crash,functional_system,related_factors,delay_to_hospital,delay_to_scene,age,person_type,seating_position,restraint,survived,rollover,airbag,alcohol,drugs,related_factors_person_level1,travel_speed,speeding_related,extent_of_damage,body_type,vehicle_removal,manner_of_collision,roadway_surface_condition,first_harmful_event,most_harmful_event
consecutive_number:int,county:str,type_of_intersection:str,light_condition:str,atmospheric_conditions_1:str,hour_of_crash:int,functional_system:str,related_factors:str,delay_to_hospital:int or NULL,delay_to_scene:int or NULL,age:int,person_type:str,seating_position:str,restraint:float (0 to 1),survived:int (0 or 1),rollover:int (0 or 1),airbag:int (0 or 1),alcohol:int (0 or 1),drugs:int (0 or 1),related_factors_person_level1:int,travel_speed:int,speeding_related:int (0 or 1),extent_of_damage:str,body_type:str,vehicle_removal:str,manner_of_collision:int (≤11),roadway_surface_condition:int (≤8),first_harmful_event:int (<90 or 0),most_harmful_event:int (<90 or 0)
...
```

**Explanation:**

The above CSV format lists the critical details of traffic accidents in 2015 as specified in the provided information. Each column represents a specific attribute of the accident, vehicle, or person involved. The data types and expected values are indicated for each field to clarify the nature of the data. The ellipsis (`...`) signifies that the dataset contains multiple records following this structure. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 23:52:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please help me compile the critical details on traffic accidents in 2015, as listed in the info document., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
consecutive_number,county,type_of_intersection,light_condition,atmospheric_conditions_1,hour_of_crash,functional_system,related_factors,delay_to_hospital,delay_to_scene,age,person_type,seating_position,restraint,survived,rollover,airbag,alcohol,drugs,related_factors_person_level1,travel_speed,speeding_related,extent_of_damage,body_type,vehicle_removal,manner_of_collision,roadway_surface_condition,first_harmful_event,most_harmful_event
consecutive_number:int,county:str,type_of_intersection:str,light_condition:str,atmospheric_conditions_1:str,hour_of_crash:int,functional_system:str,related_factors:str,delay_to_hospital:int or NULL,delay_to_scene:int or NULL,age:int,person_type:str,seating_position:str,restraint:float (0 to 1),survived:int (0 or 1),rollover:int (0 or 1),airbag:int (0 or 1),alcohol:int (0 or 1),drugs:int (0 or 1),related_factors_person_level1:int,travel_speed:int,speeding_related:int (0 or 1),extent_of_damage:str,body_type:str,vehicle_removal:str,manner_of_collision:int (≤11),roadway_surface_condition:int (≤8),first_harmful_event:int (<90 or 0),most_harmful_event:int (<90 or 0)
...
```

**Explanation:**

The above CSV format lists the critical details of traffic accidents in 2015 as specified in the provided information. Each column represents a specific attribute of the accident, vehicle, or person involved. The data types and expected values are indicated for each field to clarify the nature of the data. The ellipsis (`...`) signifies that the dataset contains multiple records following this structure. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 23:54:59 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please help me compile the critical details on traffic accidents in 2015, as listed in the info document., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
consecutive_number,county,type_of_intersection,light_condition,atmospheric_conditions_1,hour_of_crash,functional_system,related_factors,delay_to_hospital,delay_to_scene,age,person_type,seating_position,restraint,survived,rollover,airbag,alcohol,drugs,related_factors_person_level1,travel_speed,speeding_related,extent_of_damage,body_type,vehicle_removal,manner_of_collision,roadway_surface_condition,first_harmful_event,most_harmful_event
consecutive_number:int,county:str,type_of_intersection:str,light_condition:str,atmospheric_conditions_1:str,hour_of_crash:int,functional_system:str,related_factors:str,delay_to_hospital:int or NULL,delay_to_scene:int or NULL,age:int,person_type:str,seating_position:str,restraint:float (0 to 1),survived:int (0 or 1),rollover:int (0 or 1),airbag:int (0 or 1),alcohol:int (0 or 1),drugs:int (0 or 1),related_factors_person_level1:int,travel_speed:int,speeding_related:int (0 or 1),extent_of_damage:str,body_type:str,vehicle_removal:str,manner_of_collision:int (≤11),roadway_surface_condition:int (≤8),first_harmful_event:int (<90 or 0),most_harmful_event:int (<90 or 0)
...
```

**Explanation:**

The above CSV format lists the critical details of traffic accidents in 2015 as specified in the provided information. Each column represents a specific attribute of the accident, vehicle, or person involved. The data types and expected values are indicated for each field to clarify the nature of the data. The ellipsis (`...`) signifies that the dataset contains multiple records following this structure. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
