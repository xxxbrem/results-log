2025-01-26 23:40:18 - root - INFO - I apologize for the confusion earlier. The error occurred because the column `light_condition` does not exist in the table `person_2015`. The `light_condition` information is typically found in the `accident` table, but as per the available data, we have `accident_2016` but not `accident_2015`.

Since we're focusing on traffic accidents in **2015**, and we don't have access to an `accident_2015` table, we need to adjust the SQL queries to utilize only the available tables and columns.

---

**Revised SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve basic details of accidents from `person_2015` (adjusted):**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     consecutive_number,
     county,
     timestamp_of_crash
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct types of persons involved in accidents:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT
     person_type
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Identify accidents where the airbag was deployed:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     consecutive_number,
     air_bag_deployed
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
   WHERE
     LOWER(air_bag_deployed) LIKE '%deployed%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve records of drivers under the age of 18:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     consecutive_number,
     age,
     person_type
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
   WHERE
     age < 18 AND LOWER(person_type_name) = 'driver'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find accidents involving alcohol:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     consecutive_number,
     alcohol_test_status3_name
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
   WHERE
     LOWER(alcohol_test_status3_name) LIKE '%positive%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List accidents where the driver was distracted (from `distract_2015`):**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     consecutive_number,
     vehicle_number,
     driver_distracted_by_name
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.distract_2015`
   WHERE
     driver_distracted_by_name IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get records of non-motorists with impairment at the time of crash (from `nmimpair_2015`):**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     consecutive_number,
     person_number,
     condition_impairment_at_time_of_crash_non_motorist_name
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.nmimpair_2015`
   WHERE
     condition_impairment_at_time_of_crash_non_motorist_name IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Identify accidents involving rollovers from `vsoe_2015`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     consecutive_number,
     vehicle_number,
     sequence_of_events_name
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.vsoe_2015`
   WHERE
     LOWER(sequence_of_events_name) LIKE '%rollover%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve age and restraint use of individuals involved:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     consecutive_number,
     age,
     restraint_system_helmet_use_name
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
   WHERE
     restraint_system_helmet_use_name IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find accidents with drug involvement reported by police:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      consecutive_number,
      police_reported_drug_involvement
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
    WHERE
      LOWER(police_reported_drug_involvement) = 'yes'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **List accidents with related factors at the person level:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      consecutive_number,
      related_factors_person_level1_name
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
    WHERE
      related_factors_person_level1_name IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Retrieve counts of accidents by county:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      county,
      COUNT(*) AS accident_count
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
    GROUP BY
      county
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Identify accidents involving high travel speeds (from `vsoe_2015` if `travel_speed` exists):**

    Since the `vsoe_2015` table may not contain `travel_speed`, we'll adjust this query to use the `vehicle_2015` table if available. However, based on the provided tables, we don't have `vehicle_2015`. Therefore, we will omit this query or modify it based on available data.

14. **Identify accidents with severe injury severity:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      consecutive_number,
      injury_severity_name
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
    WHERE
      injury_severity_name = 'Fatal Injury (K)'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find accidents involving non-motorists at specific locations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      consecutive_number,
      non_motorist_location_at_time_of_crash_name
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.person_2015`
    WHERE
      non_motorist_location_at_time_of_crash_name IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Issue Resolution:**
  - The error occurred because `light_condition` is not a column in `person_2015`.
  - We have adjusted the queries to include only existing columns within `person_2015` and other available tables.
  - Where applicable, we replaced `light_condition` with other relevant columns or removed it.

- **Adjusted Queries:**
  - **Queries 1 & 2:** Simplified to include existing columns.
  - **Queries 4 & 5:** Updated to use the correct column names, such as `person_type_name` and `alcohol_test_status3_name`.
  - **Query 6:** Uses the `distract_2015` table, ensuring columns exist.
  - **Queries 7 & 8:** Confirmed that columns exist in `nmimpair_2015` and `vsoe_2015`.
  - **Query 12:** Changed to count accidents by `county` since `light_condition` is not available.
  - **Query 13:** Omitted or adjusted due to lack of `travel_speed` data for 2015.
  - **Queries 14 & 15:** Ensured the correct usage of column names ending with `_name` for descriptions.

**Note on Data Availability:**

- **2015 Accident Data:**
  - We lack the `accident_2015` table, which would typically contain information such as `light_condition`, `weather_conditions`, and `functional_system`.
  - As an alternative, we can focus on person-level data from `person_2015` and vehicle events from `vsoe_2015`.

**Additional Considerations:**

- When joining tables or accessing specific columns, always ensure that the columns exist in the specified tables.
- Column names sometimes end with `_name` to provide descriptive text; use these columns to get readable information.
- Use `IS NOT NULL` to filter out records where specific information is available.

**Explanation:**

The above SQL queries are designed to compile critical details on traffic accidents in **2015** using the provided tables. Each query targets specific columns and conditions to extract meaningful data:

- **Queries 1-5:** Retrieve basic accident details, distinct person types, airbag deployment, involvement of young drivers, and alcohol involvement from the `person_2015` table.
- **Queries 6-7:** Focus on driver distraction and non-motorist impairment from the `distract_2015` and `nmimpair_2015` tables.
- **Queries 8 & 13:** Extract rollover events and high-speed accidents from the `vsoe_2015` table.
- **Queries 9, 11, 14:** Analyze restraint use, related factors at person level, and severe injuries.
- **Queries 10 & 15:** Identify drug involvement and specific non-motorist locations.

Each query is unique and follows the guidelines:

- Uses actual database, schema, and table names.
- Encloses column names and table identifiers with backticks.
- Uses `SELECT` statements only, without CTEs.
- Limits the results to 100 rows.
- Incorporates `DISTINCT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and other clauses to add variety.

Task: Please help me compile the critical details on traffic accidents in 2015, as listed in the info document.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
consecutive_number,county,type_of_intersection,light_condition,atmospheric_conditions_1,hour_of_crash,functional_system,related_factors,delay_to_hospital,delay_to_scene,age,person_type,seating_position,restraint,survived,rollover,airbag,alcohol,drugs,related_factors_person_level1,travel_speed,speeding_related,extent_of_damage,body_type,vehicle_removal,manner_of_collision,roadway_surface_condition,first_harmful_event,most_harmful_event
consecutive_number:int,county:str,type_of_intersection:str,light_condition:str,atmospheric_conditions_1:str,hour_of_crash:int,functional_system:str,related_factors:str,delay_to_hospital:int or NULL,delay_to_scene:int or NULL,age:int,person_type:str,seating_position:str,restraint:float (0 to 1),survived:int (0 or 1),rollover:int (0 or 1),airbag:int (0 or 1),alcohol:int (0 or 1),drugs:int (0 or 1),related_factors_person_level1:int,travel_speed:int,speeding_related:int (0 or 1),extent_of_damage:str,body_type:str,vehicle_removal:str,manner_of_collision:int (≤11),roadway_surface_condition:int (≤8),first_harmful_event:int (<90 or 0),most_harmful_event:int (<90 or 0)
...
```

**Explanation:**

The above CSV format lists the critical details of traffic accidents in 2015 as specified in the provided information. Each column represents a specific attribute of the accident, vehicle, or person involved. The data types and expected values are indicated for each field to clarify the nature of the data. The ellipsis (`...`) signifies that the dataset contains multiple records following this structure..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'nhtsa_traffic_fatalities': [' accident_2020', ' cevent_2017', ' cevent_2019', ' distract_2015', ' drimpair_2017', ' drimpair_2019', ' factor_2020', ' maneuver_2018', ' nmcrash_2018', ' nmcrash_2019', ' nmimpair_2015', ' nmimpair_2016', ' nmimpair_2018', ' safetyeq_2016', ' vsoe_2015', 'accident_2016', 'damage_2016', 'factor_2016', 'nmcrash_2016', 'person_2015']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 23:53:16 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please help me compile the critical details on traffic accidents in 2015, as listed in the info document., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
consecutive_number,county,type_of_intersection,light_condition,atmospheric_conditions_1,hour_of_crash,functional_system,related_factors,delay_to_hospital,delay_to_scene,age,person_type,seating_position,restraint,survived,rollover,airbag,alcohol,drugs,related_factors_person_level1,travel_speed,speeding_related,extent_of_damage,body_type,vehicle_removal,manner_of_collision,roadway_surface_condition,first_harmful_event,most_harmful_event
consecutive_number:int,county:str,type_of_intersection:str,light_condition:str,atmospheric_conditions_1:str,hour_of_crash:int,functional_system:str,related_factors:str,delay_to_hospital:int or NULL,delay_to_scene:int or NULL,age:int,person_type:str,seating_position:str,restraint:float (0 to 1),survived:int (0 or 1),rollover:int (0 or 1),airbag:int (0 or 1),alcohol:int (0 or 1),drugs:int (0 or 1),related_factors_person_level1:int,travel_speed:int,speeding_related:int (0 or 1),extent_of_damage:str,body_type:str,vehicle_removal:str,manner_of_collision:int (≤11),roadway_surface_condition:int (≤8),first_harmful_event:int (<90 or 0),most_harmful_event:int (<90 or 0)
...
```

**Explanation:**

The above CSV format lists the critical details of traffic accidents in 2015 as specified in the provided information. Each column represents a specific attribute of the accident, vehicle, or person involved. The data types and expected values are indicated for each field to clarify the nature of the data. The ellipsis (`...`) signifies that the dataset contains multiple records following this structure. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-26 23:54:47 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please help me compile the critical details on traffic accidents in 2015, as listed in the info document., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

**Explanation:**

The above CSV format lists the critical details of traffic accidents in 2015 as specified in the provided information. Each column represents a specific attribute of the accident, vehicle, or person involved. The data types and expected values are indicated for each field to clarify the nature of the data. The ellipsis (`...`) signifies that the dataset contains multiple records following this structure. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
