After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that `2result.sql` is the correct SQL query to answer the task.

**Reason:**

- **Task Requirement:** The task specifically asks for the numeric value of the **active** council district in Austin with the highest number of bike trips that start and end within the same district, but not at the same station.

- **Differences Between the SQLs:**

  - **`0result.sql`:**

    - **Does not filter by station status:** It includes trips from all stations regardless of whether they are currently active or not.
    - **Potentially includes inactive stations:** This might lead to considering trips from districts that are no longer active.

  - **`2result.sql`:**

    - **Filters by active station status:** It only includes trips where both the start and end stations are marked as `'active'` in the `bikeshare_stations` table.
    - **Accurately represents active districts:** By considering only active stations, it ensures the council district counted is currently active.

- **Alignment with Task:** Since the task emphasizes **active** council districts, `2result.sql` appropriately filters the data to meet this criterion, making it the correct choice.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

2result.sql
