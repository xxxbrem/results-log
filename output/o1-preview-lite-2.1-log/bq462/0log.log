2025-01-27 06:55:56 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-27 06:55:56 - root - INFO - I apologize for the confusion. The error occurred because the column `team_market` does not exist in the table `mbb_teams_games_sr`. Instead, the team's market (school name) is stored in the column `market`.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT market, AVG(points_game) AS average_points
FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_teams_games_sr`
WHERE season >= 2010
GROUP BY market
ORDER BY average_points DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Column Correction:**
  - Replace `team_market` with `market` since the column containing the team's school name is `market`.
  
- **Query Functionality:**
  - **SELECT**: Retrieves the team's school name (`market`) and calculates the average points per game (`AVG(points_game)`).
  - **FROM**: Specifies the dataset `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_teams_games_sr`.
  - **WHERE**: Filters records to include only those from seasons 2010 and onwards (`season >= 2010`).
  - **GROUP BY**: Groups the data by `market` to calculate the average points for each team.
  - **ORDER BY**: Orders the results in descending order of `average_points`.
  - **LIMIT 100**: Limits the output to the top 100 teams.

**Updated Query Results:**

When you run the corrected query, you should receive results similar to:

```csv
market,average_points
Team A,85.6
Team B,82.3
Team C,81.7
Team D,80.5
Team E,79.9
...
```

*(Note: The actual team names and average points will vary based on the data.)*

**Additional Note:**

- If you encounter any further issues or need clarification on column names, you can refer to the table schema to verify the correct column names.

**Alternative Query Including Team Name:**

If you would like to include the team's name along with the market (school name), you can modify the query as follows:

```sql
SELECT market, name AS team_name, AVG(points_game) AS average_points
FROM `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_teams_games_sr`
WHERE season >= 2010
GROUP BY market, team_name
ORDER BY average_points DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

This will provide both the school's name and the team's name:

```csv
market,team_name,average_points
Team A University,Eagles,85.6
Team B College,Tigers,82.3
Team C Institute,Bulldogs,81.7
...
```

**Feel free to run the corrected query, and let me know if you need any more assistance.**

Task: Please provide the top five records since 2010 for NCAA basketball in four categories: largest venues (Date N/A), biggest championship margins since 2015, highest scoring games, and most three-pointers in a matchup ("Team A vs Team B"). Organize the results into a table with columns for Category, Date, Matchup or Venue, and Key Metric.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To provide the top five records since 2010 for NCAA basketball in the four specified categories, the results are organized into a table with columns for **Category**, **Date**, **Matchup or Venue**, and **Key Metric**.

**(Attention: answer in five rows per category)**

**Explanation:**

- **Largest Venues**: Lists the top five venues with the largest capacities (Date N/A as it's not applicable).
  - *Key Metric*: Venue capacity in integer values.

- **Biggest Championship Margins**: Shows the top five championship games since 2015 with the largest margins of victory.
  - *Date*: The date when the championship game was played.
  - *Matchup*: The teams that played in the championship game.
  - *Key Metric*: Margin of victory (must be a positive integer).

- **Highest Scoring Games**: Includes the top five games since 2010 with the highest combined total points scored by both teams.
  - *Date*: The date when the game was played.
  - *Matchup*: The teams involved in the game.
  - *Key Metric*: Total points scored in the game.

- **Most Three-Pointers in a Matchup**: Lists the top five games since 2010 where the highest number of three-pointers were made collectively by both teams.
  - *Date*: The date when the game was played.
  - *Matchup*: The teams involved in the game.
  - *Key Metric*: Total number of three-pointers made (must be a non-negative integer).

*Note: The actual data values are placeholders indicating the expected data types and constraints.*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
