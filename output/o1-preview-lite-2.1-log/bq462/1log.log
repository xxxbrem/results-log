Task: Please provide the top five records since 2010 for NCAA basketball in four categories: largest venues (Date N/A), biggest championship margins since 2015, highest scoring games, and most three-pointers in a matchup ("Team A vs Team B"). Organize the results into a table with columns for Category, Date, Matchup or Venue, and Key Metric.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To provide the top five records since 2010 for NCAA basketball in the four specified categories, the results are organized into a table with columns for **Category**, **Date**, **Matchup or Venue**, and **Key Metric**.

```csv

```
**(Attention: answer in five rows per category)**

**Explanation:**

- **Largest Venues**: Lists the top five venues with the largest capacities (Date N/A as it's not applicable).
  - *Key Metric*: Venue capacity in integer values.

- **Biggest Championship Margins**: Shows the top five championship games since 2015 with the largest margins of victory.
  - *Date*: The date when the championship game was played.
  - *Matchup*: The teams that played in the championship game.
  - *Key Metric*: Margin of victory (must be a positive integer).

- **Highest Scoring Games**: Includes the top five games since 2010 with the highest combined total points scored by both teams.
  - *Date*: The date when the game was played.
  - *Matchup*: The teams involved in the game.
  - *Key Metric*: Total points scored in the game.

- **Most Three-Pointers in a Matchup**: Lists the top five games since 2010 where the highest number of three-pointers were made collectively by both teams.
  - *Date*: The date when the game was played.
  - *Matchup*: The teams involved in the game.
  - *Key Metric*: Total number of three-pointers made (must be a non-negative integer).

*Note: The actual data values are placeholders indicating the expected data types and constraints.*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'ncaa_basketball': ['mascots', 'mbb_games_sr', 'mbb_historical_teams_games', 'mbb_historical_teams_seasons', 'mbb_historical_tournament_games', 'mbb_pbp_sr', 'mbb_players_games_sr', 'mbb_teams', 'mbb_teams_games_sr', 'team_colors']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 06:56:08 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please provide the top five records since 2010 for NCAA basketball in four categories: largest venues (Date N/A), biggest championship margins since 2015, highest scoring games, and most three-pointers in a matchup ("Team A vs Team B"). Organize the results into a table with columns for Category, Date, Matchup or Venue, and Key Metric., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To provide the top five records since 2010 for NCAA basketball in the four specified categories, the results are organized into a table with columns for **Category**, **Date**, **Matchup or Venue**, and **Key Metric**.

**(Attention: answer in five rows per category)**

**Explanation:**

- **Largest Venues**: Lists the top five venues with the largest capacities (Date N/A as it's not applicable).
  - *Key Metric*: Venue capacity in integer values.

- **Biggest Championship Margins**: Shows the top five championship games since 2015 with the largest margins of victory.
  - *Date*: The date when the championship game was played.
  - *Matchup*: The teams that played in the championship game.
  - *Key Metric*: Margin of victory (must be a positive integer).

- **Highest Scoring Games**: Includes the top five games since 2010 with the highest combined total points scored by both teams.
  - *Date*: The date when the game was played.
  - *Matchup*: The teams involved in the game.
  - *Key Metric*: Total points scored in the game.

- **Most Three-Pointers in a Matchup**: Lists the top five games since 2010 where the highest number of three-pointers were made collectively by both teams.
  - *Date*: The date when the game was played.
  - *Matchup*: The teams involved in the game.
  - *Key Metric*: Total number of three-pointers made (must be a non-negative integer).

*Note: The actual data values are placeholders indicating the expected data types and constraints.* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
