2025-01-23 15:13:45 - root - INFO - Understood. The empty values in the `"duration"` column are causing issues when trying to find the minimum duration. We need to exclude those entries where the duration is empty or null. Additionally, since durations are stored as strings in the format `"MM:SS"`, we need to convert them to seconds for proper numerical comparison.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT m."duration", w1."name" AS "Winner_name", w2."name" AS "Loser_name"
FROM "Matches" m
JOIN "Wrestlers" w1 ON m."winner_id" = w1."id"
JOIN "Wrestlers" w2 ON m."loser_id" = w2."id"
WHERE m."title_id" IN (SELECT "id" FROM "Belts" WHERE "name" LIKE '%NXT%')
  AND m."title_change" != 1
  AND m."duration" IS NOT NULL
  AND m."duration" != ''
ORDER BY
  (CAST(SUBSTR(m."duration", 1, 2) AS INTEGER) * 60 + CAST(SUBSTR(m."duration", 4, 2) AS INTEGER)) ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query:

- **Joins** the `"Matches"` table with the `"Wrestlers"` table twice to get the names of both the winner and the loser.
- **Filters** matches to those involving titles with names containing "NXT", excluding matches with a title change.
- **Excludes** matches where the duration is empty or null.
- **Orders** the results by the total duration in seconds, calculated by converting the `"MM:SS"` format into seconds.
- **Limits** the results to the shortest match (the one with the minimum duration).

By executing this query, you should get the names of the two wrestlers involved in the shortest NXT title match (excluding matches with a title change) and the duration of that match.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**First, let's identify the relevant tables, columns, and potential usage for this task:**

---

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Belts**
   - `"id"`: Primary key for the Belts table. Will be used to link to the `"title_id"` in the Matches table.
   - `"name"`: Name of the title/belt. We will use this to find the `"id"` corresponding to the "NXT" title.

2. **Matches**
   - `"id"`: Primary key for the Matches table.
   - `"title_id"`: Foreign key linking to `"Belts"."id"`. Used to identify matches involving the NXT title.
   - `"title_change"`: Indicates if a title change occurred in the match. We will use this to exclude matches with a title change (`"title_change" != 1`).
   - `"duration"`: Duration of the match. We will use this to find the shortest match.
   - `"winner_id"`: Foreign key linking to `"Wrestlers"."id"`. Used to find the winning wrestler.
   - `"loser_id"`: Foreign key linking to `"Wrestlers"."id"`. Used to find the losing wrestler.

3. **Wrestlers**
   - `"id"`: Primary key for the Wrestlers table.
   - `"name"`: Name of the wrestler. We will use this to get the names of the winner and loser.

---

**Conditions to be Used:**

- **Identify the "NXT" title:**
  - Use `"Belts"."name" = 'NXT'` to find the `"id"` of the NXT title.
- **Exclude matches with a title change:**
  - Use `"Matches"."title_change" != 1` to exclude matches where the title changed hands.
- **Find the shortest match:**
  - Use the `"duration"` column to find the match with the minimum duration among the filtered matches.

---

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List all belt names to see how titles are named:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name" FROM "Belts" LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Find the ID of the "NXT" title in the Belts table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id" FROM "Belts" WHERE "name" = 'NXT' LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all matches involving the NXT title:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "Matches"
   WHERE "title_id" = (SELECT "id" FROM "Belts" WHERE "name" = 'NXT')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Check the durations of matches involving the NXT title (excluding title changes):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "duration" FROM "Matches"
   WHERE "title_id" = (SELECT "id" FROM "Belts" WHERE "name" = 'NXT')
     AND "title_change" != 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find the minimum duration among NXT title matches without a title change:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("duration") FROM "Matches"
   WHERE "title_id" = (SELECT "id" FROM "Belts" WHERE "name" = 'NXT')
     AND "title_change" != 1;
   ```

6. **Retrieve the match details of the shortest NXT title match (excluding title changes):**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "Matches"
   WHERE "title_id" = (SELECT "id" FROM "Belts" WHERE "name" = 'NXT')
     AND "title_change" != 1
   ORDER BY "duration" ASC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

7. **Get the winner and loser IDs from the shortest NXT title match:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "winner_id", "loser_id" FROM "Matches"
   WHERE "title_id" = (SELECT "id" FROM "Belts" WHERE "name" = 'NXT')
     AND "title_change" != 1
   ORDER BY "duration" ASC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

8. **List all wrestler names to understand the data in the Wrestlers table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name" FROM "Wrestlers" LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve the names of the winner and loser in the shortest NXT title match:**

   ```sql
   SELECT w1."name" AS "Winner_name", w2."name" AS "Loser_name"
   FROM "Matches" m
   JOIN "Wrestlers" w1 ON m."winner_id" = w1."id"
   JOIN "Wrestlers" w2 ON m."loser_id" = w2."id"
   WHERE m."title_id" = (SELECT "id" FROM "Belts" WHERE "name" = 'NXT')
     AND m."title_change" != 1
   ORDER BY m."duration" ASC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

10. **Examine the format of the durations in the Matches table:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "duration" FROM "Matches" LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **List all matches with their durations and wrestler IDs to see the range of durations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "winner_id", "loser_id", "duration" FROM "Matches" LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Retrieve all NXT title matches with winner and loser names and match durations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT m."duration", w1."name" AS "Winner_name", w2."name" AS "Loser_name"
    FROM "Matches" m
    JOIN "Wrestlers" w1 ON m."winner_id" = w1."id"
    JOIN "Wrestlers" w2 ON m."loser_id" = w2."id"
    WHERE m."title_id" = (SELECT "id" FROM "Belts" WHERE "name" = 'NXT')
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List NXT title matches without title changes, ordered by duration ascending:**

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM "Matches"
    WHERE "title_id" = (SELECT "id" FROM "Belts" WHERE "name" = 'NXT')
      AND "title_change" != 1
    ORDER BY "duration" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Find the match type of the shortest NXT title match (excluding title changes):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "match_type_id" FROM "Matches"
    WHERE "title_id" = (SELECT "id" FROM "Belts" WHERE "name" = 'NXT')
      AND "title_change" != 1
    ORDER BY "duration" ASC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

15. **Retrieve the event date and location of the shortest NXT title match:**

    ```sql
    SELECT c."event_date", l."name" AS "Location"
    FROM "Matches" m
    JOIN "Cards" c ON m."card_id" = c."id"
    JOIN "Locations" l ON c."location_id" = l."id"
    WHERE m."title_id" = (SELECT "id" FROM "Belts" WHERE "name" = 'NXT')
      AND m."title_change" != 1
    ORDER BY m."duration" ASC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

Task: For the NXT title that had the shortest match (excluding titles with "title change"), what were the names of the two wrestlers involved?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the names of the two wrestlers involved in the shortest NXT title match (excluding matches with a title change), we identified the match with the shortest duration where the title is "NXT" and there was no title change.

```csv
Winner_name,Loser_name
winner_name:str,loser_name:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 15:16:23 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For the NXT title that had the shortest match (excluding titles with "title change"), what were the names of the two wrestlers involved?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the names of the two wrestlers involved in the shortest NXT title match (excluding matches with a title change), we identified the match with the shortest duration where the title is "NXT" and there was no title change.

```csv
Winner_name,Loser_name
winner_name:str,loser_name:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
