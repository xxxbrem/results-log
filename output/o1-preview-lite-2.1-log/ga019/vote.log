After reviewing both SQL queries and their results, I recommend using `1result.sql` as the correct answer. Here's why:

**Comparison of SQL Queries:**

### **0result.sql:**

**Approach:**

- **Installation Data:**
  - Collects all `first_open` events from August and September 2018 to identify users who installed the app during that period.
  - Uses multiple `UNION ALL` statements to combine data from each day's events table.
- **Event Data:**
  - Aggregates all events (including those in early October) to capture user activity after installation.
- **User Activity Calculation:**
  - For each user, computes the **last event timestamp**.
  - Calculates the **number of days since installation** by finding the difference between the last event timestamp and the installation timestamp.
  - Considers users with `days_since_install >= 7` as those who did not uninstall within seven days.
- **Percentage Calculation:**
  - Counts total installations and the number of active users after seven days.
  - Calculates the percentage of users who did not uninstall within seven days.

**Issues:**

- **Complexity:**
  - The query is lengthy due to repetitive `UNION ALL` statements, making it less efficient and harder to maintain.
- **Assumption on Last Event:**
  - Relies on the last event timestamp, which could misrepresent users who were inactive but did not uninstall.
  - Users who had no events after a certain point might be incorrectly considered as having uninstalled.

### **1result.sql:**

**Approach:**

- **Installation Data:**
  - Selects distinct `user_pseudo_id` and `user_first_touch_timestamp` for users who performed the `first_open` event during August and September 2018.
- **Event Data:**
  - Aggregates events from August, September, and the first three days of October to capture post-installation activity.
- **User Activity Calculation:**
  - Joins installations with events to find users who had **any event** more than seven days after their installation.
  - Uses `TIMESTAMP_MICROS` to accurately compute time differences.
- **Percentage Calculation:**
  - Counts the number of users who were active after seven days.
  - Calculates the percentage relative to the total number of installations.

**Advantages:**

- **Efficiency:**
  - The query is more concise, reducing redundancy with less use of `UNION ALL`.
- **Direct Measurement:**
  - Directly identifies users who had any activity beyond seven days after installation.
  - More accurately captures users who did not uninstall within seven days or never uninstalled.
- **Accuracy:**
  - Avoids potential misclassification by focusing on the presence of events after seven days rather than the last event timestamp.

**Conclusion:**

The second SQL query (`1result.sql`) more accurately addresses the task by:

- Directly measuring user engagement beyond seven days after installation.
- Ensuring that all users who did not uninstall within seven days or never uninstalled are included.
- Providing a simpler and more efficient query, making it easier to read and maintain.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice for determining the percentage of users who either did not uninstall the app within seven days or never uninstalled it after installing during August and September 2018.
