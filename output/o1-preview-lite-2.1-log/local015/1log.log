This query simplifies the previous conditions by ensuring that the comparison for `victim_degree_of_injury` is case-insensitive using `LOWER(v."victim_degree_of_injury") = 'killed'`. It retrieves data about victims involved in motorcycle collisions who were killed, along with their helmet usage information from `victim_safety_equipment_1`. Removing the additional conditions allows the query to return results where previously none were found.

This query selects victims who were **drivers** killed in motorcycle collisions, ensuring that the `victim_safety_equipment_1` column is not empty. By adding the conditions `v."victim_safety_equipment_1" IS NOT NULL` and `v."victim_safety_equipment_1" != ''`, we filter out rows where safety equipment information is missing. This should provide a more accurate dataset for calculating the percentages of helmet usage among motorcycle accident fatalities.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `collisions`
   - **`case_id`**: Used to join with the `victims` table.
   - **`motorcycle_collision`**: Identifies motorcycle collisions. Condition: `motorcycle_collision = 1`.
   
2. **Table:** `victims`
   - **`case_id`**: Used to join with the `collisions` table.
   - **`victim_degree_of_injury`**: Indicates the severity of injury. Condition: `victim_degree_of_injury` indicates fatality (e.g., 'Killed').
   - **`victim_safety_equipment_1`** and **`victim_safety_equipment_2`**: Indicates helmet usage.
   - **`victim_role`**: Identifies if the victim was the driver/rider. Condition: `victim_role = 'Driver'` or `victim_role = 'Motorcyclist'`.
   
3. **Table:** `parties`
   - **`case_id`** and **`party_number`**: Potentially used to link specific parties involved.
   - **`statewide_vehicle_type`**: Identifies the type of vehicle involved. Condition: `statewide_vehicle_type` indicates motorcycle.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- **Identify Motorcycle Collisions:** `motorcycle_collision = 1` in the `collisions` table.
- **Identify Fatalities:** `victim_degree_of_injury = 'Killed'` in the `victims` table.
- **Identify Helmet Usage:** Check `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` for indications of helmet use.
- **Identify Riders:** `victim_role = 'Driver'` in the `victims` table.
- **Join Conditions:** Use `case_id` to join between `collisions` and `victims` tables.

   FROM "victims"
   WHERE "victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List Distinct Helmet Usage Descriptions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "victim_safety_equipment_1"
   FROM "victims"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find Fatalities Involving Motorcyclists Wearing Helmets:**

   ```sql
   SELECT v."case_id", v."victim_safety_equipment_1"
   FROM "victims" v
   JOIN "collisions" c ON v."case_id" = c."case_id"
   WHERE c."motorcycle_collision" = 1
     AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
     AND v."victim_safety_equipment_1" LIKE '%Helmet%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count Total Motorcycle Collision Fatalities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_fatalities
   FROM "victims" v
   JOIN "collisions" c ON v."case_id" = c."case_id"
   WHERE c."motorcycle_collision" = 1
     AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed';
   ```

8. **List Victims Without Helmets in Motorcycle Fatalities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT v."case_id", v."victim_safety_equipment_1"
   FROM "victims" v
   JOIN "collisions" c ON v."case_id" = c."case_id"
   WHERE c."motorcycle_collision" = 1
     AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
     AND (v."victim_safety_equipment_1" IS NULL OR v."victim_safety_equipment_1" NOT LIKE '%Helmet%')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List Distinct `victim_role` Values to Identify Riders:**

   ```sql

   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve Helmet Usage Among Motorcycle Fatalities by Role:**

    ```sql
    SELECT v."victim_role", v."victim_safety_equipment_1", v."victim_safety_equipment_2"
    FROM "victims" v
    JOIN "collisions" c ON v."case_id" = c."case_id"
    WHERE c."motorcycle_collision" = 1
      AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
    LIMIT 100;

These queries progressively explore the relevant data needed to calculate the percentages of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets versus those who weren't. By examining the distinct values and counts, we gain insights into the dataset, which helps in formulating a final query to compute the required percentages.Query:

Task: Help me respectively caulculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Helmet_use,Percentage
Helmeted,percentage:0<=float<=100
Not Helmeted,percentage:0<=float<=100
```

To calculate the percentages of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we analyze the data from the `collisions` and `victims` tables. We identify motorcycle collisions with fatalities by filtering records where `motorcycle_collision` is true in the `collisions` table and `victim_degree_of_injury` indicates fatality in the `victims` table. We then determine helmet usage by examining `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` in the `victims` table. The percentages represent the proportion of fatalities where riders were helmeted versus not helmeted among all motorcycle accident fatalities..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 04:05:14 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Help me respectively caulculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Helmet_use,Percentage
Helmeted,percentage:0<=float<=100
Not Helmeted,percentage:0<=float<=100
```

To calculate the percentages of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we analyze the data from the `collisions` and `victims` tables. We identify motorcycle collisions with fatalities by filtering records where `motorcycle_collision` is true in the `collisions` table and `victim_degree_of_injury` indicates fatality in the `victims` table. We then determine helmet usage by examining `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` in the `victims` table. The percentages represent the proportion of fatalities where riders were helmeted versus not helmeted among all motorcycle accident fatalities. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
