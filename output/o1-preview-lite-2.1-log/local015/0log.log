The table structure information is (table names): 
['victims', 'collisions', 'case_ids', 'parties']
Begin Exploring Related Columns
To calculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we need to explore and understand the relevant data in the provided tables.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"collisions"`
  - `"case_id"`: Used to join with the `"victims"` table.
  - `"motorcycle_collision"`: Indicates whether the collision involved a motorcycle (usually `1` for true).
  
- **Table:** `"victims"`
  - `"case_id"`: Used to join with the `"collisions"` table.
  - `"victim_degree_of_injury"`: Indicates the severity of the victim's injuries (e.g., `'Fatal'` for fatalities).
  - `"victim_safety_equipment_1"`: Lists the primary safety equipment used by the victim (e.g., `'Helmet Worn'`).
  - `"victim_safety_equipment_2"`: Lists additional safety equipment used by the victim, if any.
  - `"victim_role"`: Indicates the role of the victim (e.g., `'Driver'`, `'Passenger'`).

**Potential Conditions:**

- Filter collisions where `"motorcycle_collision"` equals `1` to identify motorcycle-related accidents.
- Filter victims where `"victim_degree_of_injury"` equals `'Fatal'` to focus on fatalities.
- Use `"victim_safety_equipment_1"` and `"victim_safety_equipment_2"` to determine helmet usage.
- Use `"victim_role"` to ensure we're analyzing motorcycle riders (drivers and passengers).

**Sample SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **Get distinct injury degrees in the victims table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "victim_degree_of_injury"
   FROM "victims"

    SELECT v."victim_degree_of_injury", v."victim_safety_equipment_1", c."motorcycle_collision"
    FROM "victims" v
    JOIN "collisions" c ON v."case_id" = c."case_id"
    WHERE c."motorcycle_collision" = 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Retrieve fatally injured victims in motorcycle collisions:**
    ```sql
    SELECT v.*
    FROM "victims" v
    JOIN "collisions" c ON v."case_id" = c."case_id"
    WHERE c."motorcycle_collision" = 1
      AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Fatal'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **List safety equipment of fatal victims in motorcycle collisions:**
    ```sql
    SELECT v."victim_safety_equipment_1", v."victim_safety_equipment_2"
    FROM "victims" v
    JOIN "collisions" c ON v."case_id" = c."case_id"
    WHERE c."motorcycle_collision" = 1
      AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Fatal'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Count of helmet usage among fatally injured motorcyclists:**
    ```sql
    SELECT v."victim_safety_equipment_1", COUNT(*) AS "fatalities_count"
    FROM "victims" v
    JOIN "collisions" c ON v."case_id" = c."case_id"
    WHERE c."motorcycle_collision" = 1
      AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Fatal'
      AND v."victim_role" IN ('Driver', 'Passenger')
    GROUP BY v."victim_safety_equipment_1"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Get distinct victim roles in the victims table:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "victim_role"
    FROM "victims"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Identify fatally injured motorcycle drivers and passengers:**
    ```sql
    SELECT v."victim_role", v."victim_safety_equipment_1", v."victim_degree_of_injury"
    FROM "victims" v
    JOIN "collisions" c ON v."case_id" = c."case_id"
    WHERE c."motorcycle_collision" = 1
      AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Fatal'
      AND v."victim_role" IN ('Driver', 'Passenger')
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

16. **Check safety equipment descriptions for fatalities in motorcycle collisions:**

    ```

20. **List the distribution of victim ages in motorcycle fatalities:**
    ```sql
    SELECT v."victim_age", COUNT(*) AS "fatalities_count"
    FROM "victims" v
    JOIN "collisions" c ON v."case_id" = c."case_id"

    GROUP BY v."victim_age"
    ORDER BY "fatalities_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help us understand the data related to motorcycle accident fatalities and helmet usage. By analyzing the outputs of these queries, we can determine the number of fatalities involving helmeted riders versus those without helmets and calculate the respective percentages.

**Note:** In your actual analysis, ensure you replace `'Helmet Worn'` with the exact value that indicates helmet usage in the `"victim_safety_equipment_1"` column, based on the data retrieved from the exploratory queries.Query:

Task: Help me respectively caulculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Helmet_use,Percentage
Helmeted,percentage:0<=float<=100
Not Helmeted,percentage:0<=float<=100
```

To calculate the percentages of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we analyze the data from the `collisions` and `victims` tables. We identify motorcycle collisions with fatalities by filtering records where `motorcycle_collision` is true in the `collisions` table and `victim_degree_of_injury` indicates fatality in the `victims` table. We then determine helmet usage by examining `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` in the `victims` table. The percentages represent the proportion of fatalities where riders were helmeted versus not helmeted among all motorcycle accident fatalities..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
