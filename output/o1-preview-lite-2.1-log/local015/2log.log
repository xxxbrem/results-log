Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `collisions`
  - `"case_id"`: Used to join with other tables.
  - `"motorcycle_collision"`: Indicates if the collision involved a motorcycle (`1` for true).
  
- **Table:** `victims`
  - `"case_id"`: Used to join with other tables.
  - `"victim_degree_of_injury"`: Indicates the severity of injury (looks for fatalities).
  - `"victim_safety_equipment_1"`: Safety equipment used by the victim (e.g., helmet).
  - `"victim_safety_equipment_2"`: Additional safety equipment.
  
- **Table:** `parties`
  - `"case_id"`: Used to join with other tables.
  - `"statewide_vehicle_type"`: Type of vehicle involved (e.g., motorcycle).
  - `"party_type"`: Role of the party in the collision (e.g., driver, passenger).
  
**Possible Conditions:**

- **Motorcycle Collisions:** `"motorcycle_collision" = 1`
- **Fatalities:** `"victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'` (assuming 'Killed' indicates fatality)
- **Helmet Usage:** `"victim_safety_equipment_1"` or `"victim_safety_equipment_2"` indicating helmet usage
- **Motorcycle Riders:** `"statewide_vehicle_type"` indicating motorcycle, and `"party_type"` indicating driver or passenger

**Sample SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List distinct values of `victim_degree_of_injury`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "victim_degree_of_injury"
   FROM "victims"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve motorcycle collisions from `collisions` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "case_id"
   FROM "collisions"
   WHERE "motorcycle_collision" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List distinct values of `victim_safety_equipment_1`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "victim_safety_equipment_1"
   FROM "victims"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get victims involved in fatal injuries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_id", "victim_degree_of_injury"
   FROM "victims"
   WHERE "victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find parties driving motorcycles:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "case_id", "party_type", "statewide_vehicle_type"
   FROM "parties"
   WHERE "statewide_vehicle_type" LIKE '%Motorcycle%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List safety equipment used by victims in fatalities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "victim_safety_equipment_1", "victim_safety_equipment_2"
   FROM "victims"
   WHERE "victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get cases with motorcycle collisions and fatalities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."case_id"
   FROM "collisions" AS c
   JOIN "victims" AS v ON c."case_id" = v."case_id"
   WHERE c."motorcycle_collision" = 1 AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List statewide vehicle types in fatal collisions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p."statewide_vehicle_type"
   FROM "parties" AS p
   JOIN "victims" AS v ON p."case_id" = v."case_id"
   WHERE v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find helmet usage among fatal motorcycle collision victims:**

   ```sql
   SELECT v."victim_safety_equipment_1", v."victim_safety_equipment_2"
   FROM "victims" AS v
   JOIN "collisions" AS c ON v."case_id" = c."case_id"
   WHERE c."motorcycle_collision" = 1 AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Get counts of helmeted vs. non-helmeted fatalities in motorcycle collisions:**

    ```sql
    SELECT v."victim_safety_equipment_1", COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM "victims" AS v
    JOIN "collisions" AS c ON v."case_id" = c."case_id"
    WHERE c."motorcycle_collision" = 1 AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Killed'
    GROUP BY v."victim_safety_equipment_1"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the data related to motorcycle accident fatalities, helmet usage, and how the tables are connected. By examining the results of these queries, we can gather the necessary information to calculate the percentages as required.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT "victim_degree_of_injury"
   FROM "victims"

Answer:
victim_degree_of_injury
no injury

Task: Help me respectively caulculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Helmet_use,Percentage
Helmeted,percentage:0<=float<=100
Not Helmeted,percentage:0<=float<=100
```

To calculate the percentages of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we analyze the data from the `collisions` and `victims` tables. We identify motorcycle collisions with fatalities by filtering records where `motorcycle_collision` is true in the `collisions` table and `victim_degree_of_injury` indicates fatality in the `victims` table. We then determine helmet usage by examining `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` in the `victims` table. The percentages represent the proportion of fatalities where riders were helmeted versus not helmeted among all motorcycle accident fatalities..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 03:56:18 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Help me respectively caulculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Helmet_use,Percentage
Helmeted,percentage:0<=float<=100
Not Helmeted,percentage:0<=float<=100
```

To calculate the percentages of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we analyze the data from the `collisions` and `victims` tables. We identify motorcycle collisions with fatalities by filtering records where `motorcycle_collision` is true in the `collisions` table and `victim_degree_of_injury` indicates fatality in the `victims` table. We then determine helmet usage by examining `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` in the `victims` table. The percentages represent the proportion of fatalities where riders were helmeted versus not helmeted among all motorcycle accident fatalities. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
