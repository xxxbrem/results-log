2025-01-23 23:40:14 - root - INFO - It appears that the error occurs because the column `"system"` does not exist in the `"PROJECTS"` table. The `invalid identifier` error indicates that the column name is not recognized in the context of your query. To resolve this issue, we'll need to adjust our approach based on the columns that are actually available in your tables.

**Revisiting the Tables and Columns:**

Since the `"system"` column is not present, we need to identify alternative columns that can help us determine the system for each package. Without access to the exact schema, we can make educated guesses or attempt to infer the system from other available data.

**Adjusted SQL Queries:**

1. **Select all columns from the `PROJECTS` table to inspect available fields:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select all columns from the `PACKAGEVERSIONS` table to inspect available fields:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Identify possible columns that may represent the system in the `PROJECTS` table:**

   - Replace `"system"` with potential column names like `"ecosystem"`, `"language"`, or `"project_type"`.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "ecosystem"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   (Adjust `"ecosystem"` to match an actual column in your table.)

4. **If the `PACKAGEVERSIONS` table contains a column representing the system, select distinct systems:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "ecosystem"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Attempt to infer the system from the `package_name` by identifying naming patterns:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "package_name", "license"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Group packages by inferred system and license to count occurrences:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     CASE
       WHEN "package_name" ILIKE '%npm%' THEN 'npm'
       WHEN "package_name" ILIKE '%maven%' THEN 'maven'
       -- Add more patterns as needed
       ELSE 'other'
     END AS "inferred_system",
     "license",
     COUNT("package_version_id") AS "package_count"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
   GROUP BY "inferred_system", "license"
   ORDER BY "inferred_system", "package_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Join `PACKAGEVERSIONS` and `PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT` tables without relying on the `system` column:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pv"."package_name", "pv"."license", "pvtp"."project_id"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
   JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
     ON "pv"."package_version_id" = "pvtp"."package_version_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Group by `project_id` and `license` to find the most common licenses per project:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pvtp"."project_id", "pv"."license", COUNT("pv"."package_version_id") AS "package_count"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
   JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
     ON "pv"."package_version_id" = "pvtp"."package_version_id"
   GROUP BY "pvtp"."project_id", "pv"."license"
   ORDER BY "package_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Select distinct licenses used across all packages:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "license"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find the most frequently used license across all packages:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "license", COUNT("package_version_id") AS "package_count"
    FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
    GROUP BY "license"
    ORDER BY "package_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Explanation:**

- Since the `"system"` column is not available, we explored alternative columns and methods to infer or determine the system for each package.
- We used pattern matching (`ILIKE '%pattern%'`) on the `"package_name"` to infer the system based on common naming conventions.
- We adjusted the queries to focus on available data, grouping by `project_id`, `package_name`, or other potential columns.
- The queries aim to identify the most frequently used licenses, either overall or per inferred system.

**Next Steps:**

- **Verify Column Names:** Confirm the actual column names present in your tables. Replace any placeholder column names in the queries with the accurate ones from your database.
- **Inspect Table Schemas:** If possible, check the schemas of the `PROJECTS` and `PACKAGEVERSIONS` tables to identify columns that represent the system or ecosystem.
- **Adjust Queries Accordingly:** Once you have the correct column names, adjust the queries to reflect the actual data structure.
- **Consult Database Documentation:** Refer to any available database documentation or resources that describe the tables and columns.

**Example Adjusted Query (Once Correct Column is Identified):**

If you find that the system is represented by a column called `"ecosystem"` in the `PACKAGEVERSIONS` table, you can write:

```sql
SELECT "ecosystem", "license", COUNT("package_version_id") AS "package_count"
FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
GROUP BY "ecosystem", "license"
ORDER BY "ecosystem", "package_count" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

This query will group the packages by their ecosystem (system) and license, allowing you to identify the most frequently used license in each system.

---

By adjusting your queries to align with the actual structure of your database, you should be able to retrieve the desired information without encountering the `invalid identifier` error.

2025-01-23 23:42:20 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering the `invalid identifier` error because the column `"license"` does not exist in the `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"` table. This error suggests that the column name you're using in your SQL query is incorrect or does not match any column in the specified table.

To resolve this issue, let's take the following steps:

1. **Check Available Columns in the `PACKAGEVERSIONS` Table:**

   First, we need to identify the actual columns available in the `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"` table. You can do this by running:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   This query will display the first 10 rows of the table along with their column names. From the results, you can note down the exact column names available.

2. **Adjust the SQL Queries with Correct Column Names:**

   Once you have the correct column names, you can adjust your queries accordingly. If the license information is stored under a different column name (e.g., `"Licenses"` with a capital "L"), you should use that exact name in your queries.

   **Note:** SQL is case-sensitive when it comes to identifiers, especially when using double quotes.

---

**Based on the information you provided earlier from the `PROJECTS` table, it seems that there is a column named `"Licenses"`. Perhaps the license information is under a similar column in the `PACKAGEVERSIONS` table.**

**Adjusted SQL Queries:**

Here are the corrected SQL queries, taking into account possible variations in column names and adjusting for similar errors:

1. **Select Distinct Licenses from `PACKAGEVERSIONS`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Licenses"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - **Explanation:** Changed `"license"` to `"Licenses"` to match the column naming pattern observed in the `PROJECTS` table.

2. **Select Package Names and Licenses:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Name", "Licenses"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - **Explanation:** Replaced `"package_name"` with `"Name"` and `"license"` with `"Licenses"`.

3. **Count the Number of Package Versions per License:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Licenses", COUNT(*) AS "package_count"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
   GROUP BY "Licenses"
   ORDER BY "package_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - **Explanation:** Used `"Licenses"` as the grouping column.

4. **Select Package Versions and Associated Project IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pv"."PackageVersionId", "pvtp"."ProjectId"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
   JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
     ON "pv"."PackageVersionId" = "pvtp"."PackageVersionId"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - **Explanation:** Adjusted column names to `"PackageVersionId"` and `"ProjectId"`.

5. **Select Project IDs from `PROJECTS`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "ProjectId"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - **Explanation:** Removed the `"system"` column, assuming it doesn't exist, and selected `"ProjectId"` instead.

6. **Join `PACKAGEVERSIONS`, `PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT`, and `PROJECTS` Tables:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pv"."Name", "pv"."Licenses", "pr"."Type"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
   JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
     ON "pv"."PackageVersionId" = "pvtp"."PackageVersionId"
   JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS" AS "pr"
     ON "pvtp"."ProjectId" = "pr"."ProjectId"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - **Explanation:** Adjusted column names and replaced `"system"` with `"Type"` (assuming `"Type"` indicates the system, such as 'GITHUB' or 'GITLAB').

7. **Count the Number of Package Versions per License:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pv"."Licenses", COUNT(*) AS "package_count"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
   GROUP BY "pv"."Licenses"
   ORDER BY "package_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - **Explanation:** Similar to query 3, focusing on the `"Licenses"` column.

8. **Find the Most Frequently Used License:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Licenses", "package_count"
   FROM (
     SELECT "pv"."Licenses", COUNT(*) AS "package_count",
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS "row_num"
     FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
     GROUP BY "pv"."Licenses"
   ) AS "sub_query"
   WHERE "row_num" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - **Explanation:** Adjusted to find the most frequently used license overall.

9. **Select Distinct Licenses for Packages Containing 'npm' in Their Name:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "pv"."Licenses"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
   WHERE "pv"."Name" ILIKE '%npm%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   - **Explanation:** Adjusted column names and modified the condition to search in the `"Name"` column.

---

**Additional Steps:**

- **Verify Column Names:** If possible, run `DESCRIBE` statements to get the exact column names in your tables:

  ```sql
  DESCRIBE TABLE "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS";
  ```

- **Check for Nested or Array Columns:** If the `"Licenses"` column is an array or contains nested data, you may need to use JSON extraction functions or `FLATTEN` to query individual licenses.

  For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT
    "pv"."Name",
    l.value::string AS "License"
  FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv",
  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "pv"."Licenses") l
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

  - **Explanation:** This query will flatten the `"Licenses"` array and extract individual license values.

---

**Understanding the Data Structure:**

Based on the data you provided from the `PROJECTS` table, here's what we can infer:

- **Columns in `PROJECTS`:**

  - `"SnapshotAt"`
  - `"Type"` (possibly indicates the system, e.g., 'GITHUB', 'GITLAB')
  - `"Name"`
  - `"OpenIssuesCount"`
  - `"StarsCount"`
  - `"ForksCount"`
  - `"Licenses"` (might be an array or list)
  - `"Description"`
  - `"Homepage"`
  - `"OSSFuzz"`

- **Columns in `PACKAGEVERSIONS`:**

  We need to adjust our queries to match the actual columns in this table. Likely column names might include:

  - `"PackageVersionId"`
  - `"Name"`
  - `"Licenses"`
  - Other metadata columns.

---

**Conclusion:**

- **Adjust Column Names:** Ensure that the column names used in your SQL queries exactly match those in your database schema, including correct capitalization and spelling.

- **Handle Nested Data:** If license information is stored in a nested structure or an array, use appropriate SQL functions to extract the data.

- **Validate Queries Incrementally:** Start with simple `SELECT *` queries to validate the available data and then build more complex queries.

- **Use Proper Identifiers:** SQL is case-sensitive when using double quotes for identifiers. Make sure to use the exact case as defined in your table schema.

**Example Workflow to Identify the Most Frequently Used License by Packages in Each System:**

1. **Extract License Information:**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     "pr"."Type" AS "System",
     l.value::string AS "License"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"

**Final Notes:**

- **Ensure Correct Data Access:** Depending on the permissions and data volume, some queries might take longer to execute or may require adjustments.

- **Consult Database Documentation:** If available, refer to the schema documentation for precise column names and data types.

- **Error Handling:** If you continue to receive errors, double-check the spelling and casing of your column and table names.

2025-01-23 23:43:38 - root - INFO - It appears that the error occurs because the column `"PackageVersionId"` does not exist in the `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"` table. Based on the data you provided from the `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"` table, the available columns are:

- SnapshotAt
- System
- Name
- Version
- Licenses
- Links
- Advisories
- VersionInfo
- Hashes
- DependenciesProcessed
- DependencyError
- UpstreamPublishedAt
- Registries
- SLSAProvenance
- UpstreamIdentifiers
- Purl

Since `"PackageVersionId"` is not among the columns, the SQL query is failing due to an invalid identifier.

**Solution:**

To fix the error, you can replace `"PackageVersionId"` with a valid column. Since each row in the `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"` table represents a package version, you can use `COUNT(*)` to count the number of package versions per license. Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "Licenses", COUNT(*) AS "package_count"
FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
GROUP BY "Licenses"
ORDER BY "package_count" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`COUNT(*)`:** Counts all rows in each group, which effectively counts the number of package versions for each license.
- **Grouping by `"Licenses"`:** Groups the results by the `Licenses` column to aggregate the counts for each unique license.
- **Ordering:** Orders the results in descending order of `package_count` to show the most frequently used licenses at the top.

**Alternative Approach:**

If you want to ensure that you're counting distinct package versions based on the `Name` and `Version`, you can modify the query as follows:

```sql
SELECT "Licenses", COUNT(DISTINCT "Name" || ' ' || "Version") AS "package_count"
FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
GROUP BY "Licenses"
ORDER BY "package_count" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

- **`COUNT(DISTINCT "Name" || ' ' || "Version")`:** Concatenates `Name` and `Version` to uniquely identify each package version and counts the distinct occurrences.

**Handling the `Licenses` Column:**

Note that the `Licenses` column appears to contain JSON arrays, such as:

```json
[
  "Apache-2.0",
  "MIT"
]
```

To extract individual licenses from the JSON array, you can use the `LATERAL FLATTEN` function. Here's how you can adjust the query to handle this:

```sql
SELECT l.value::string AS "License", COUNT(*) AS "package_count"
FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS",
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "Licenses") l
GROUP BY l.value::string
ORDER BY "package_count" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`LATERAL FLATTEN`:** Explodes the JSON array in the `Licenses` column into individual rows.
- **`l.value::string AS "License"`:** Extracts each license from the array and casts it as a string.
- **Grouping by `l.value::string`:** Groups the counts by each individual license.

**Example Result:**

This adjusted query will provide a count of how many times each individual license is used across all package versions.

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:** Execute the corrected query to retrieve the counts.
- **Verify Column Names:** Ensure that the column names (`"Licenses"`, `"Name"`, `"Version"`) exactly match those in your database, including proper casing and spelling.
- **Handle JSON Data:** If the `Licenses` column is in JSON format, use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to properly extract and count individual licenses.

**Final Corrected Query Using Flattened Licenses:**

```sql
SELECT l.value::string AS "License", COUNT(*) AS "package_count"
FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS pv,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => pv."Licenses") l
GROUP BY l.value::string
ORDER BY "package_count" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

This query will give you the most frequently used licenses by packages across all systems.

2025-01-23 23:46:16 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering an error because the column `"PackageName"` does not exist in the table `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"` (aliased as `"pvtp"`). The error message indicates an `invalid identifier` for `"pvtp"."PackageName"`.

**Explanation:**

- The column `"PackageName"` is not a valid column in the `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"` table.
- To resolve this issue, we need to identify the correct column names in `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"` that correspond to the package versions.

---

**Steps to Correct the SQL Query:**

1. **Inspect the Columns in `PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT`:**

   First, we need to find out what columns are available in the `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"` table. You can retrieve the column names by running:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   The result should display the columns in the table. From typical naming conventions and considering previous errors, it's possible that the columns are:

   - `"PackageVersionID"` (or `"PackageVersionId"`)
   - `"ProjectID"` (or `"ProjectId"`)

   **Note:** Pay attention to the exact spelling and casing of the column names, as SQL is case-sensitive when identifiers are quoted.

2. **Determine a Common Column for Joining:**

   Since `"pv"` (from `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"`) and `"pvtp"` (from `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"`) do not share columns like `"PackageName"` and `"Version"`, we need to find a column common to both tables.

   From the data you provided for the `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"` table, available columns include:

   - `"Name"`
   - `"Version"`
   - `"Purl"` (Package URL)

   Given this, check if `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"` contains a `"Purl"` or similar identifier.

3. **Adjust the Join Condition Using `Purl` or Another Common Identifier:**

   If both tables contain the `"Purl"` column, you can join on that column.

   **Corrected SQL Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pv"."Name", "pv"."Version", "pvtp"."ProjectID"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
   JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
     ON "pv"."Purl" = "pvtp"."Purl"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - `"pv"."Purl"`: The `Purl` column from `PACKAGEVERSIONS`.
   - `"pvtp"."Purl"`: Assuming `PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT` also has a `Purl` column.
   - We join the tables on this common identifier.

4. **If `Purl` Is Not Present in Both Tables:**

   If `"Purl"` is not available in `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"`, you might need to find another way to join the tables. If `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"` only contains `"PackageVersionID"` and `"ProjectID"`, and the `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"` table does not have `"PackageVersionID"`, consider the following:

   - **Option 1:** If `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"` has an implicit ID or key that matches `"PackageVersionID"`, use that for the join.
   - **Option 2:** If no common columns are available, you may need to query the tables separately or adjust your approach.

5. **Alternative Query Using Unmodified Columns:**

   If you cannot find a common column to join on, you may need to view the data in `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"` and see how it relates to `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"`.

   **Possible Alternative Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pv"."Name", "pv"."Version", "pvtp"."ProjectID"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv",
        "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
   WHERE "pv"."Name" = 'some_package_name' -- Replace with actual package name
     AND "pv"."Version" = 'some_version'   -- Replace with actual version
     AND "pvtp"."PackageVersionID" = 'some_package_version_id' -- Replace as needed
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Note:** This approach is speculative and may not yield the desired results without a proper join condition.

---

**Recommendations:**

- **Verify Column Names:**

  - Use `DESCRIBE` or `SHOW COLUMNS` commands if available.
  - Ensure that the column names used in the query match exactly with those in the table, including the correct case.

- **Adjust the Query Based on Actual Columns:**

  - If `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"` has columns `"PackageVersionID"` and `"ProjectID"`, and `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"` has `"PackageVersionID"`, then you can join on `"PackageVersionID"`.

    ```sql
    SELECT "pv"."Name", "pv"."Version", "pr"."Name" AS "ProjectName"
    FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
    JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
      ON "pv"."PackageVersionID" = "pvtp"."PackageVersionID"
    JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS" AS "pr"
      ON "pvtp"."ProjectID" = "pr"."ProjectID"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

- **Example Corrected Query (Assuming Correct Columns):**

  ```sql
  SELECT "pv"."Name", "pv"."Version", "pr"."Name" AS "ProjectName"
  FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
  JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
    ON "pv"."VersionInfo":PackageVersionId::string = "pvtp"."PackageVersionID"
  JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS" AS "pr"
    ON "pvtp"."ProjectID" = "pr"."ProjectID"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  - Assuming `"pv"."VersionInfo"` is a JSON column containing `"PackageVersionId"`.
  - We extract `"PackageVersionId"` from `"VersionInfo"` using JSON parsing.
  - We join on `"PackageVersionID"`.

---

**Final Corrected Query (Based on Available Data):**

Given the limited information about the columns, the safest way is to adjust the join condition to use existing columns.

```sql
SELECT "pv"."Name", "pv"."Version", "pvtp"."ProjectId"
FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
  ON "pv"."SnapshotAt" = "pvtp"."SnapshotAt" AND "pv"."Name" = "pvtp"."Name" AND "pv"."Version" = "pvtp"."Version"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Notes:**

- **Assumptions:**

  - Both tables have `"SnapshotAt"`, `"Name"`, and `"Version"` columns.
  - By including `"SnapshotAt"` in the join condition, we ensure a more accurate match.

- **Adjustments:**

  - Replace `"pvtp"."ProjectName"` with the correct column name, which is likely `"ProjectId"` or `"ProjectName"` (confirm actual column name).
  - Ensure that all column names are correctly spelled and cased.

---

**Conclusion:**

- The error occurs because `"PackageName"` does not exist in `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"`.
- Adjust the query to use the correct column names that exist in the table.
- Verify the available columns in `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"` and adjust the join conditions accordingly.

**Important:** Always check your database schema to confirm the exact names and data types of the columns in your tables.

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "pv"."Name", "pv"."Version", "pvtp"."ProjectId"
FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
  ON "pv"."Name" = "pvtp"."Name" AND "pv"."Version" = "pvtp"."Version"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- Assumes that `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"` has columns `"Name"` and `"Version"` similar to `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"`.
- Adjusted the join condition to use columns that exist in both tables.

If `"Name"` and `"Version"` do not exist in `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"`, you'll need to identify the common columns or consider alternative methods to retrieve the desired data.

```

- **Explanation:** Assuming no errors occur with this query, as the `"Name"` and `"Type"` columns exist in the `"PROJECTS"` table. If you receive an error regarding the `"Type"` column (since `TYPE` can be a reserved keyword in SQL), ensure it is enclosed in double quotes, which it is. No correction needed unless an error is encountered.

```sql
SELECT pv."Name", pv."Licenses", pr."Name" AS "ProjectName"
FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS pv

JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS" AS pr
  ON pvtp."ProjectType" = pr."Type" AND pvtp."ProjectName" = pr."Name"
LIMIT 100;
```

- **Explanation:** The error occurred because `"pvtp"."Purl"` does not exist in `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"`. The corrected query uses `"System"`, `"Name"`, and `"Version"` columns to join `"pv"` and `"pvtp"`. Additionally, we join `"pvtp"` to `"pr"` using `"ProjectType"` and `"ProjectName"`.

GROUP BY "License"
ORDER BY "package_count" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

- **Explanation:** The original query might cause an error with `l.value::string`. Casting is adjusted to `CAST(l.value AS STRING)` for compatibility. We also adjusted the `GROUP BY` clause to use the alias `"License"`.

---

```sql
SELECT "License", "package_count"
FROM (
  SELECT CAST(l.value AS STRING) AS "License", COUNT(*) AS "package_count",
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS "row_num"
  FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS pv,
  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => pv."Licenses") l
  GROUP BY CAST(l.value AS STRING)
) AS sub_query
WHERE "row_num" = 1
LIMIT 100;
```

- **Explanation:** Adjusted casting of `l.value` to `CAST(l.value AS STRING)`. Ensured that `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses match the corrected alias. This query retrieves the most frequently used license.

---

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CAST(l.value AS STRING) AS "License"
FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS pv,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => pv."Licenses") l
WHERE pv."Name" ILIKE '%npm%'
LIMIT 100;
```

- **Explanation:** Corrected the casting of `l.value` to `CAST(l.value AS STRING)`. Ensured the `ILIKE` clause is correctly formatted for case-insensitive pattern matching of package names containing `'npm'`.

---

**Additional Notes:**

- **Casting Values:** In Snowflake SQL, it is sometimes necessary to cast values explicitly using `CAST(value AS TYPE)` rather than using `value::TYPE`. This ensures compatibility and avoids errors.
  
- **Joining Tables:** When joining tables, ensure that the columns used in the `ON` clause exist in both tables. In this case, we used `"System"`, `"Name"`, and `"Version"` for joining `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"` and `"PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT"`, and `"ProjectType"` and `"ProjectName"` for joining to `"PROJECTS"`.

- **Using Aliases:** When assigning aliases to columns (e.g., `AS "License"`), make sure to reference the alias correctly in the `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses.

- **Reserved Keywords:** If any column names are reserved keywords (e.g., `Type`), ensure they are enclosed in double quotes or consider aliasing them to avoid conflicts.

- **Validating Column Names:** Always verify that the column names used in your queries match exactly with those in your database schema, including case sensitivity and spelling.

---

By applying these corrections, the queries should execute without encountering the `invalid identifier` errors and provide the desired results.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table**: `PACKAGEVERSIONS`
   - **Column**: `"package_version_id"` - Unique identifier for each package version.
   - **Column**: `"license"` - The license used by the package version.
   - **Column**: `"package_name"` - Name of the package.
   - **Column**: `"system"` - The system to which the package belongs (if available).

2. **Table**: `PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT`
   - **Column**: `"package_version_id"` - Identifier linking to `PACKAGEVERSIONS`.
   - **Column**: `"project_id"` - Identifier linking to `PROJECTS`.

3. **Table**: `PROJECTS`
   - **Column**: `"project_id"` - Unique identifier for each project.
   - **Column**: `"system"` - Name of the system.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Join `PACKAGEVERSIONS` with `PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT` on `"package_version_id"`.
- Join the result with `PROJECTS` on `"project_id"` to get the system name.
- Group by `"system"` and `"license"` to count occurrences.
- Use `ORDER BY` and window functions to find the most frequently used license per system.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Select distinct systems from the `PROJECTS` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "system"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select distinct licenses from the `PACKAGEVERSIONS` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "license"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select package names and their licenses from `PACKAGEVERSIONS`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "package_name", "license"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count the number of package versions per license:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "license", COUNT("package_version_id") AS "package_count"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS"
   GROUP BY "license"
   ORDER BY "package_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Select package versions along with their associated project IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pv"."package_version_id", "pvtp"."project_id"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
   JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
     ON "pv"."package_version_id" = "pvtp"."package_version_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Select projects and their systems from the `PROJECTS` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "project_id", "system"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Join all three tables to get package names, licenses, and systems:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pv"."package_name", "pv"."license", "pr"."system"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
   JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
     ON "pv"."package_version_id" = "pvtp"."package_version_id"
   JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS" AS "pr"
     ON "pvtp"."project_id" = "pr"."project_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count the number of package versions per license per system:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "pr"."system", "pv"."license", COUNT("pv"."package_version_id") AS "package_count"
   FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
   JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
     ON "pv"."package_version_id" = "pvtp"."package_version_id"
   JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS" AS "pr"
     ON "pvtp"."project_id" = "pr"."project_id"
   GROUP BY "pr"."system", "pv"."license"
   ORDER BY "package_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find the most frequently used license for each system:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "system", "license", "package_count"
   FROM (
     SELECT "pr"."system", "pv"."license", COUNT("pv"."package_version_id") AS "package_count",
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "pr"."system" ORDER BY COUNT("pv"."package_version_id") DESC) AS "row_num"
     FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
     JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
       ON "pv"."package_version_id" = "pvtp"."package_version_id"
     JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS" AS "pr"
       ON "pvtp"."project_id" = "pr"."project_id"
     GROUP BY "pr"."system", "pv"."license"
   ) AS "sub_query"
   WHERE "row_num" = 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List all licenses used in a specific system (e.g., 'npm'):**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "pv"."license"
    FROM "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONS" AS "pv"
    JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT" AS "pvtp"
      ON "pv"."package_version_id" = "pvtp"."package_version_id"
    JOIN "DEPS_DEV_V1"."DEPS_DEV_V1"."PROJECTS" AS "pr"
      ON "pvtp"."project_id" = "pr"."project_id"
    WHERE "pr"."system" = 'npm'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

These queries progressively explore the data to understand which licenses are used by packages in each system, ultimately aiming to identify the most frequently used license per system.Query:

Task: What is the most frequently used license by packages in each system?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
System,Most_Frequently_Used_License
system1:str,license1:str
system2:str,license2:str
...
```

This table displays the most frequently used license by packages in each system. Since specific data is not provided, placeholders are used to represent the system names and license types..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'DEPS_DEV_V1': {'DEPS_DEV_V1': ['ADVISORIES', 'DEPENDENCIES', 'DEPENDENCYGRAPHEDGES', 'DEPENDENTS', 'NUGETREQUIREMENTS', 'PACKAGEVERSIONHASHES', 'PACKAGEVERSIONS', 'PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT', 'PROJECTS', 'SNAPSHOTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
