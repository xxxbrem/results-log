After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, the SQL query in `2result.sql` is the correct choice. Here's the reasoning:

- **Accurate Use of Tables and Columns:** Both queries aim to determine the most frequently used license by packages in each system. They utilize the `"System"` and `"Licenses"` columns from the `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"` table. According to the observations, the `"System"` column is present in the `"PACKAGEVERSIONS"` table, allowing direct access without additional joins.

- **Efficient License Extraction:** Both queries correctly handle the `"Licenses"` column, which contains JSON arrays of licenses, by using the `LATERAL FLATTEN` function to explode the arrays into individual license entries.

- **Simpler and More Readable:** The `2result.sql` query is more concise and straightforward:
  - It combines the counts and rankings in a single query without using multiple common table expressions (CTEs).
  - It uses `ROW_NUMBER()` instead of `RANK()`, which is appropriate here since we want the top license per system without handling ties in ranking.
  - The overall structure is easier to read and maintain.

- **Consistent Results:** Both queries produce the same results, listing the most frequently used license for each system. However, `2result.sql` achieves this with a simpler approach.

- **Avoidance of Unnecessary NULL Checks:** The `2result.sql` query does not include additional `WHERE` clauses to filter out NULL values, assuming that the data is already cleaned or that NULL licenses are not significant for the count.

**Conclusion:**

Given its simplicity, readability, and efficiency, `2result.sql` is the correct SQL query to determine the most frequently used license by packages in each system.
