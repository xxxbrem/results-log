After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct and most appropriate query for solving the problem.

**Reason:**

- **Clarity and Readability:** `2result.sql` clearly defines variables `customer_minutes` and `subscriber_minutes`, making the query easier to understand and maintain.
- **Correct Calculation:** It accurately calculates the cumulative bike usage minutes for both customers and subscribers by summing up the `duration_sec` divided by 60 (to convert seconds to minutes).
- **Accurate Absolute Difference:** The query computes the absolute difference between `customer_minutes` and `subscriber_minutes`, ensuring the correct value regardless of which is larger.
- **Proper Formatting:** It uses `FORMAT_DATE('%B %Y', DATE(2017, month, 1))` to format the month and year correctly in the final output.
- **Efficiency:** The query is concise and avoids unnecessary grouping or computations present in the other queries.

**Therefore, the correct SQL file is:**

2result.sql
