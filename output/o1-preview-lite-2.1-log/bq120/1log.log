**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_snap_enrollment.snap_enrollment`

   - `SNAP_All_Participation_Persons`: Total SNAP participation (persons) — potential usage: to get total SNAP participation per region.
   - `SNAP_All_Participation_Households`: Total SNAP participation (households) — potential usage: to get the number of SNAP households per region.
   - `FIPS`: FIPS code identifying the region (county) — potential usage: to identify the region and join with income data.
   - `GeoDesc`: Geographic description — potential usage: to get the name of the region.
   - `Date`: Date of the data — **condition:** filter to dates in 2017.

2. **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.state_2017_1yr`

   - `income_less_10000`: Number of households earning less than $10,000 — potential usage: to calculate households earning under $20,000.
   - `income_10000_14999`: Number of households earning between $10,000 and $14,999 — potential usage: to calculate households earning under $20,000.
   - `income_15000_19999`: Number of households earning between $15,000 and $19,999 — potential usage: to calculate households earning under $20,000.
   - `households`: Total number of households — potential usage: to calculate ratios.
   - `geo_id`: Geographic identifier — potential usage: to join with FIPS codes.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter `Date` in `snap_enrollment` table to only include data from 2017.
- Aggregate SNAP participation data by region (state or county).
- Join tables on matching geographic identifiers (e.g., FIPS codes).
- Calculate the ratio of households earning under $20,000 to SNAP households.

These queries help explore and understand the data relevant to the task by retrieving SNAP participation figures, income data, and calculating the required ratios. They demonstrate different SQL operations such as aggregation, joining tables, calculating ratios, and ordering results to identify the top regions with the highest total SNAP participation and their respective ratios of households earning under $20,000 to SNAP households for the year 2017.Query:

Task: What are the top 10 regions with the highest total SNAP participation, along with their respective ratios of households earning under $20,000 to SNAP households, as of 2017?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: Here are the top 10 regions with the highest total SNAP participation in 2017, along with their respective ratios of households earning under $20,000 to SNAP households:

```csv
Region_Name,total_snap_households,ratio_under_20k_to_snap_households
region1:str,total_snap1:int,ratio1:float
region2:str,total_snap2:int,ratio2:float
region3:str,total_snap3:int,ratio3:float
region4:str,total_snap4:int,ratio4:float
region5:str,total_snap5:int,ratio5:float
region6:str,total_snap6:int,ratio6:float
region7:str,total_snap7:int,ratio7:float
region8:str,total_snap8:int,ratio8:float
region9:str,total_snap9:int,ratio9:float
region10:str,total_snap10:int,ratio10:float
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 22:18:28 - root - INFO - Apologies for the inconvenience. The error occurs because the `geo_id` field in the `county_2017_1yr` table does not have the expected format for extracting the county FIPS code using `SUBSTR`. Instead, the `geo_id` field already contains the 5-digit county FIPS code. 

To fix the issue, we can adjust the query by directly using `geo_id` as the county FIPS code without applying `SUBSTR`. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT
  s.GeoDesc AS Region_Name,
  s.total_snap_households,
  (c.income_less_10000 + c.income_10000_14999 + c.income_15000_19999) / s.total_snap_households AS ratio_under_20k_to_snap_households
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      FIPS,
      GeoDesc,
      SUM(SNAP_All_Participation_Households) AS total_snap_households,
      SUM(SNAP_All_Participation_Persons) AS total_snap_participation
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_snap_enrollment.snap_enrollment`
    WHERE
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Date) = 2017
    GROUP BY
      FIPS, GeoDesc
  ) AS s
JOIN
  (
    SELECT
      geo_id AS county_fips,
      income_less_10000,
      income_10000_14999,
      income_15000_19999
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2017_1yr`
  ) AS c
ON
  s.FIPS = c.county_fips
ORDER BY
  s.total_snap_participation DESC
LIMIT
  10
```

This query will retrieve the top 10 regions with the highest total SNAP participation in 2017, along with their respective ratios of households earning under $20,000 to SNAP households.

2025-01-26 22:18:29 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the top 10 regions with the highest total SNAP participation, along with their respective ratios of households earning under $20,000 to SNAP households, as of 2017?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Here are the top 10 regions with the highest total SNAP participation in 2017, along with their respective ratios of households earning under $20,000 to SNAP households:

```csv
Region_Name,total_snap_households,ratio_under_20k_to_snap_households
region1:str,total_snap1:int,ratio1:float
region2:str,total_snap2:int,ratio2:float
region3:str,total_snap3:int,ratio3:float
region4:str,total_snap4:int,ratio4:float
region5:str,total_snap5:int,ratio5:float
region6:str,total_snap6:int,ratio6:float
region7:str,total_snap7:int,ratio7:float
region8:str,total_snap8:int,ratio8:float
region9:str,total_snap9:int,ratio9:float
region10:str,total_snap10:int,ratio10:float
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
