Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Table:**

- `GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"`: Total snowfall in inches; used to identify days with significant snowfall amounts.
- `"DATE_VALID_STD"`: Date of the weather data; used to filter records within specific date ranges.
- `"POSTAL_CODE"`: U.S. postal codes; used to identify and display snowfall data by location.
- `"COUNTRY"`: Country code; used to filter records to include only data from the United States.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `"COUNTRY" = 'US'`: To select records from the United States.
- `"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 0`: To find days with recorded snowfall.
- `"TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6`: To find days with snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches.
- Date conditions using `"DATE_VALID_STD"` to filter specific time frames.

   WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US'
   GROUP BY "POSTAL_CODE"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List distinct dates with recorded snowfall:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "DATE_VALID_STD"
   FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
   WHERE "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 0
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Retrieve snowfall data for postal codes starting with '9' (West Coast codes):**
   ```sql

   WHERE "POSTAL_CODE" LIKE '9%' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 0
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Calculate average snowfall per day across all U.S. postal codes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "DATE_VALID_STD", AVG("TOT_SNOWFALL_IN") AS "AVG_SNOWFALL_IN"
   FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
   WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US'
   GROUP BY "DATE_VALID_STD"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **List postal codes with snowfall greater than 6 inches during a specific week:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "POSTAL_CODE"
   FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
   WHERE "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6 AND "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Retrieve dates and postal codes where any snowfall was recorded:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "DATE_VALID_STD", "POSTAL_CODE"
    FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
    WHERE "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 0

    WHERE "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31'
    GROUP BY "DATE_VALID_STD"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Find the top 10 postal codes with the highest average snowfall:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "POSTAL_CODE", AVG("TOT_SNOWFALL_IN") AS "AVG_SNOWFALL_IN"
    FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
    GROUP BY "POSTAL_CODE"
    ORDER BY "AVG_SNOWFALL_IN" DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

13. **List all U.S. postal codes where snowfall occurred on '2023-02-15':**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "POSTAL_CODE"
    FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
    WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "DATE_VALID_STD" = '2023-02-15' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 0
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Retrieve all dates with total snowfall exceeding 100 inches across the U.S.:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "DATE_VALID_STD", SUM("TOT_SNOWFALL_IN") AS "TOTAL_SNOWFALL_IN"
    FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
    WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US'
    GROUP BY "DATE_VALID_STD"
    HAVING SUM("TOT_SNOWFALL_IN") > 100
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Get snowfall data for postal codes in a specific state (e.g., starting with '60' for Illinois):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "DATE_VALID_STD", "POSTAL_CODE", "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN"
    FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
    WHERE "POSTAL_CODE" LIKE '60%' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 0
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries explore various aspects of the snowfall data in the `HISTORY_DAY` table, helping to understand the distribution, frequency, and magnitude of snowfall events across different locations and time periods in the United States.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT "POSTAL_CODE"
   FROM GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI.STANDARD_TILE.HISTORY_DAY
   WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 0
   LIMIT 1000;

Task: Assuming today is April 1, 2024, I would like to know the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year (January 15, 2023, to January 21, 2023), we utilize the `HISTORY_DAY` table from the `STANDARD_TILE` schema of the `GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI` database. This table contains historical weather data, including snowfall amounts (`TOT_SNOWFALL_IN`), dates (`DATE_VALID_STD`), and postal codes (`POSTAL_CODE`).

The resulting data would be structured as follows:

```csv
postal_code,date,snowfall_amount_in
postal_code1:str,date1:date,snowfall1:float > 6
postal_code2:str,date2:date,snowfall2:float > 6
...
```

This table lists each postal code alongside the date and the corresponding snowfall amount in inches (greater than 6 inches) within the specified week..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI': {'STANDARD_TILE': ['CLIMATOLOGY_DAY', 'FORECAST_DAY', 'HISTORY_DAY']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

We select the postal code, date, and snowfall amount, filtering for U.S. locations (`COUNTRY` = 'US'), dates between `'2023-01-15'` and `'2023-01-21'`, and snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql

ORDER BY "DATE_VALID_STD", "POSTAL_CODE";

2025-01-20 22:08:31 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Assuming today is April 1, 2024, I would like to know the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year (January 15, 2023, to January 21, 2023), we utilize the `HISTORY_DAY` table from the `STANDARD_TILE` schema of the `GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI` database. This table contains historical weather data, including snowfall amounts (`TOT_SNOWFALL_IN`), dates (`DATE_VALID_STD`), and postal codes (`POSTAL_CODE`).

The resulting data would be structured as follows:

```csv
postal_code,date,snowfall_amount_in
postal_code1:str,date1:date,snowfall1:float > 6
postal_code2:str,date2:date,snowfall2:float > 6
...
```

This table lists each postal code alongside the date and the corresponding snowfall amount in inches (greater than 6 inches) within the specified week. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
