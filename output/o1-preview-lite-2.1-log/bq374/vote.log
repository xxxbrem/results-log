After comparing the three provided SQL queries and their results, I conclude that all three queries correctly calculate the required percentage. Each query determines the proportion of new users who, between August 1, 2016, and April 30, 2017, both stayed on the site for more than 5 minutes during their initial visit and made a purchase on a subsequent visit, relative to the total number of new users in the same period.

**Option 0 (`0result.sql`):**

- Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into smaller parts.
- Calculates:
  - **`total_new_users`**: Total number of new users during the specified period.
  - **`new_users_over_5min`**: New users who stayed over 5 minutes on their initial visit.
  - **`users_met_all_criteria`**: Users from `new_users_over_5min` who made a purchase on a subsequent visit.
- The final calculation divides `users_met_all_criteria.num_users_met_criteria` by `total_new_users.total`, yielding the correct percentage.

**Option 1 (`1result.sql`):**

- Utilizes nested SELECT statements and the `EXISTS` clause for efficiency.
- Directly computes:
  - The numerator: Count of new users who stayed over 5 minutes on their initial visit and made a purchase on a subsequent visit.
  - The denominator: Total number of new users during the specified period.
- By dividing the numerator by the denominator, it obtains the required percentage in a concise manner.

**Option 2 (`2result.sql`):**

- Similar to Option 0 but uses an `INNER JOIN` between initial visits and subsequent purchases.
- Accurately identifies users who satisfy both conditions.
- The final calculation divides the count of these users by the total number of new users to get the percentage.

While all three queries produce the same correct result of approximately **0.3079%**, **Option 1 (`1result.sql`)** is the most efficient and straightforward. It avoids unnecessary subqueries and joins, making it more optimized for performance and easier to read.

Therefore, I recommend **Option 1 (`1result.sql`)** as the correct answer.
