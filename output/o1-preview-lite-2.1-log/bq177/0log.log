**Explanation:**

- **Queries 1-3**: Explore the inpatient data to list providers and identify top providers by total inpatient payments in a single year.
- **Queries 4-5**: Aggregate inpatient payments across all years to find the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015.
- **Queries 6-9**: Calculate annual inpatient and outpatient revenues averaged by case for the identified provider.
- **Query 10**: Combine inpatient and outpatient average revenues per case into a single result set for each year.
- **Queries 11-12**: Retrieve additional details about the provider's services for deeper understanding.
- **Query 13**: Compute total inpatient discharges per year to observe trends over time.

**Note:** Replace `'123456'` with the actual `provider_id` obtained from Query 5 that identifies the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015.

Task: For the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015, tell me its annual inpatient and outpatient revenues averaged by case for each year during that period.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: I apologize, but I don't have access to the specific data in the `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare` database to provide the exact revenues for the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015. However, I can provide you with a format and guide on how you can retrieve and calculate this information.

**Format:**

```csv
Year,Average_Inpatient_Revenue_per_Case,Average_Outpatient_Revenue_per_Case
2011,inpatient_avg_revenue_2011:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2011:float
2012,inpatient_avg_revenue_2012:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2012:float
2013,inpatient_avg_revenue_2013:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2013:float
2014,inpatient_avg_revenue_2014:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2014:float
2015,inpatient_avg_revenue_2015:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2015:float
```

*(Attention: answer in five rows)*

**Explanation:**

- **Year:** Each year from 2011 to 2015.
- **Average_Inpatient_Revenue_per_Case:** The provider's annual total inpatient revenue divided by the number of inpatient cases (discharges) for that year.
- **Average_Outpatient_Revenue_per_Case:** The provider's annual total outpatient revenue divided by the number of outpatient cases (services) for that year.

**How to Calculate:**

1. **Identify the Provider:**
   - Use the `inpatient_charges_*` tables from 2011 to 2015 to calculate the total inpatient service cost for each provider.
   - Sum the product of `average_total_payments` and `total_discharges` for each provider across all years.
   - Identify the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost over the five years.

2. **Calculate Annual Revenues:**
   - **Inpatient Revenue per Case:**
     - For each year, multiply `average_total_payments` by `total_discharges` to get the total inpatient revenue.
     - Divide the total inpatient revenue by `total_discharges` to get the average revenue per case.
   - **Outpatient Revenue per Case:**
     - Use the `outpatient_charges_*` tables for each year.
     - Multiply `average_total_payments` by `outpatient_services` to get the total outpatient revenue.
     - Divide the total outpatient revenue by `outpatient_services` to get the average revenue per case.

3. **Populate the CSV:**
   - Fill in the calculated average revenues for each year in the CSV format provided above.

**Note:** Replace `inpatient_avg_revenue_YYYY` and `outpatient_avg_revenue_YYYY` with the actual calculated float values for each year from 2011 to 2015.

**Example Entry:**

```csv
Year,Average_Inpatient_Revenue_per_Case,Average_Outpatient_Revenue_per_Case
2011,15000.50,1200.75
...
```

*(This is just an illustrative example with placeholder values)*

**Summary:**

By calculating the average inpatient and outpatient revenues per case for the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015, you can analyze the provider's revenue trends over those years. This requires aggregating data from the relevant inpatient and outpatient charge datasets and performing calculations as outlined above..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['hcpcs', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd10_procedures_2019', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['home_health_agencies_2013', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'hospital_general_info', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['care_site', 'concept', 'concept_ancestor', 'concept_class', 'concept_relationship', 'condition_era', 'condition_occurrence', 'cost', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'domain', 'dose_era', 'drug_era', 'drug_exposure', 'drug_strength', 'location', 'observation', 'observation_period', 'payer_plan_period', 'person', 'procedure_occurrence', 'provider', 'relationship', 'vocabulary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 05:50:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015, tell me its annual inpatient and outpatient revenues averaged by case for each year during that period., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: I apologize, but I don't have access to the specific data in the `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare` database to provide the exact revenues for the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015. However, I can provide you with a format and guide on how you can retrieve and calculate this information.

**Format:**

```csv
Year,Average_Inpatient_Revenue_per_Case,Average_Outpatient_Revenue_per_Case
2011,inpatient_avg_revenue_2011:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2011:float
2012,inpatient_avg_revenue_2012:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2012:float
2013,inpatient_avg_revenue_2013:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2013:float
2014,inpatient_avg_revenue_2014:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2014:float
2015,inpatient_avg_revenue_2015:float,outpatient_avg_revenue_2015:float
```

*(Attention: answer in five rows)*

**Explanation:**

- **Year:** Each year from 2011 to 2015.
- **Average_Inpatient_Revenue_per_Case:** The provider's annual total inpatient revenue divided by the number of inpatient cases (discharges) for that year.
- **Average_Outpatient_Revenue_per_Case:** The provider's annual total outpatient revenue divided by the number of outpatient cases (services) for that year.

**How to Calculate:**

1. **Identify the Provider:**
   - Use the `inpatient_charges_*` tables from 2011 to 2015 to calculate the total inpatient service cost for each provider.
   - Sum the product of `average_total_payments` and `total_discharges` for each provider across all years.
   - Identify the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost over the five years.

2. **Calculate Annual Revenues:**
   - **Inpatient Revenue per Case:**
     - For each year, multiply `average_total_payments` by `total_discharges` to get the total inpatient revenue.
     - Divide the total inpatient revenue by `total_discharges` to get the average revenue per case.
   - **Outpatient Revenue per Case:**
     - Use the `outpatient_charges_*` tables for each year.
     - Multiply `average_total_payments` by `outpatient_services` to get the total outpatient revenue.
     - Divide the total outpatient revenue by `outpatient_services` to get the average revenue per case.

3. **Populate the CSV:**
   - Fill in the calculated average revenues for each year in the CSV format provided above.

**Note:** Replace `inpatient_avg_revenue_YYYY` and `outpatient_avg_revenue_YYYY` with the actual calculated float values for each year from 2011 to 2015.

**Example Entry:**

```csv
Year,Average_Inpatient_Revenue_per_Case,Average_Outpatient_Revenue_per_Case
2011,15000.50,1200.75
...
```

*(This is just an illustrative example with placeholder values)*

**Summary:**

By calculating the average inpatient and outpatient revenues per case for the provider with the highest total inpatient service cost from 2011-2015, you can analyze the provider's revenue trends over those years. This requires aggregating data from the relevant inpatient and outpatient charge datasets and performing calculations as outlined above. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
