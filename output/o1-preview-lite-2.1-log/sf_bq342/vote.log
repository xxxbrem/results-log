After comparing the two SQL queries, **`2result.sql`** is the correct one.

**Reasoning:**

- **`2result.sql`** accurately computes the **average of the hourly changes** in total transaction values for the specified Ethereum token and addresses for each year (2019 and 2020). It does this by:
  - Calculating the total transaction value per hour.
  - Computing the absolute difference in total values between consecutive hours (i.e., hourly changes).
  - Averaging these hourly changes for each year.
  - Finally, finding the difference between the averages of 2020 and 2019.

  This approach aligns precisely with the task's requirement to find the difference in the average hourly changes in transaction values between the two years.

- **`1result.sql`**, however, calculates the average of the **average transaction values per hour** for each year and then computes the difference between these averages. This does not reflect the changes in transaction values from hour to hour but rather the average transaction value within each hour, which is not what the task requires.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

2result.sql
