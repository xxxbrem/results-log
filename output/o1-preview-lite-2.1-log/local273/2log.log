Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure! Let's start by identifying the relevant tables, columns, and their potential usage for the task:

---

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`products`**
   - **`id`**: Product identifier used to join with other tables.
   - **`name`**: Name of the product; needed for the final output.

2. **`orderlines`**
   - **`product_id`**: Links to `products.id`; associates orders with products.
   - **`qty`**: Quantity of product ordered.

3. **`picking_line`**
   - **`product_id`**: Links to `products.id`; associates picked items with products.
   - **`qty`**: Quantity of product picked from inventory.
   - **`location_id`**: Inventory location identifier.
   - **`order_id`**: Links to `orders.id`; associates the pick with a specific order.

4. **`inventory`**
   - **`product_id`**: Links to `products.id`; identifies the product in inventory.
   - **`purchase_id`**: Links to `purchases.id`; used to get purchase date.
   - **`qty`**: Quantity available at the inventory location.

5. **`purchases`**
   - **`id`**: Purchase identifier; used to join with `inventory`.
   - **`purchased`**: Date when the product was purchased; used to order inventory by date.

---

**Conditions and Usage:**

- **Joining Tables:**
  - Use `product_id` to join `products`, `orderlines`, and `picking_line` tables.
  - Use `purchase_id` to join `inventory` and `purchases` to get purchase dates.

- **Ordering Inventory Locations:**
  - Order inventory by `purchased` date (earliest first) and by `qty` (smallest first).

- **Calculating Quantities:**
  - Sum `qty` from `orderlines` to get total ordered quantity per product.
  - Sum `qty` from `picking_line` to get total picked quantity per product.
  - Calculate pick percentage: `(Total Picked Qty / Total Ordered Qty) * 100`.

---

Now, let's write at least 10 different SQLite `SELECT` queries to explore the data:

1. **Retrieve distinct product names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name"
   FROM "products"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List product IDs and names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name"
   FROM "products"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get ordered quantities per product from `orderlines`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", "qty"
   FROM "orderlines"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Calculate total ordered quantity per product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_ordered_qty"
   FROM "orderlines"
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Retrieve picked quantities per product from `picking_line`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", "qty"
   FROM "picking_line"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate total picked quantity per product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_picked_qty"
   FROM "picking_line"
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List inventory quantities with purchase dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", i."qty", p."purchased"
   FROM "inventory" i
   JOIN "purchases" p ON i."purchase_id" = p."id"
   ORDER BY p."purchased" ASC, i."qty" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get total inventory quantity per product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_inventory_qty"
   FROM "inventory"
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Join `products` with total ordered quantities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT pr."name", SUM(ol."qty") AS "total_ordered_qty"
   FROM "products" pr
   JOIN "orderlines" ol ON pr."id" = ol."product_id"
   GROUP BY pr."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Join `products` with total picked quantities:**

    ```sql
    SELECT pr."name", SUM(pl."qty") AS "total_picked_qty"
    FROM "products" pr
    JOIN "picking_line" pl ON pr."id" = pl."product_id"
    GROUP BY pr."name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Calculate pick percentage for each product:**

    ```sql
    SELECT pr."name",
           SUM(ol."qty") AS "total_ordered_qty",
           SUM(pl."qty") AS "total_picked_qty",
           (CAST(SUM(pl."qty") AS REAL) / SUM(ol."qty")) * 100 AS "pick_percentage"
    FROM "products" pr
    LEFT JOIN "orderlines" ol ON pr."id" = ol."product_id"
    LEFT JOIN "picking_line" pl ON pr."id" = pl."product_id"
    GROUP BY pr."name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Order inventory locations by earliest purchase and smallest quantity:**

    ```sql
    SELECT i."location_id", i."product_id", i."qty", p."purchased"
    FROM "inventory" i
    JOIN "purchases" p ON i."purchase_id" = p."id"
    ORDER BY p."purchased" ASC, i."qty" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Find ordered and picked quantities per order:**

    ```sql
    SELECT ol."order_id", ol."product_id", ol."qty" AS "ordered_qty", pl."qty" AS "picked_qty"
    FROM "orderlines" ol
    LEFT JOIN "picking_line" pl ON ol."order_id" = pl."order_id" AND ol."product_id" = pl."product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List orders where picked quantity matches ordered quantity:**

    ```sql
    SELECT ol."order_id", ol."product_id", ol."qty" AS "ordered_qty", SUM(pl."qty") AS "total_picked_qty"
    FROM "orderlines" ol
    JOIN "picking_line" pl ON ol."order_id" = pl."order_id" AND ol."product_id" = pl."product_id"
    GROUP BY ol."order_id", ol."product_id"
    HAVING SUM(pl."qty") = ol."qty"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Identify products with discrepancies between ordered and picked quantities:**

    ```sql
    SELECT pr."name", SUM(ol."qty") AS "total_ordered_qty", SUM(pl."qty") AS "total_picked_qty"
    FROM "products" pr
    JOIN "orderlines" ol ON pr."id" = ol."product_id"
    LEFT JOIN "picking_line" pl ON pr."id" = pl."product_id"
    GROUP BY pr."name"
    HAVING SUM(ol."qty") != SUM(pl."qty")
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries will help you understand the data available in the related tables and columns, and provide insights necessary to compute the average pick percentage for each product.

---

**Note:** The above queries are designed to explore the data step by step, starting from simple retrievals to more complex aggregations and joins. They help in:

- Understanding how products are linked with orders and picking records.
- Calculating total quantities ordered and picked per product.
- Ordering inventory based on purchase dates and quantities.
- Identifying any discrepancies between ordered and picked quantities.

By analyzing the results of these queries, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of the data, which will aid in accurately computing the average pick percentage as per the task requirements.Query:

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: What is the average pick percentage for each product (by name), considering the quantity picked from inventory locations that are ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity, while ensuring that the picked quantity matches the overlapping range between the order quantity and the available inventory?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: Sure, here is the average pick percentage for each product:

```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product1:str,average_pick_percentage1:float
product2:str,average_pick_percentage2:float
...
```

**Explanation:** The average pick percentage for each product is calculated by comparing the quantity picked from inventory locations—ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity—to the ordered quantity. This ensures that the picked quantity aligns with the overlapping range between what was ordered and what was available in inventory..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 03:02:39 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the average pick percentage for each product (by name), considering the quantity picked from inventory locations that are ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity, while ensuring that the picked quantity matches the overlapping range between the order quantity and the available inventory?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: Sure, here is the average pick percentage for each product:

```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product1:str,average_pick_percentage1:float
product2:str,average_pick_percentage2:float
...
```

**Explanation:** The average pick percentage for each product is calculated by comparing the quantity picked from inventory locations—ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity—to the ordered quantity. This ensures that the picked quantity aligns with the overlapping range between what was ordered and what was available in inventory. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
