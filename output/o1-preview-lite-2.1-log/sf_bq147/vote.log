After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL that fulfills the task requirements for the following reasons:

1. **Focus on Protein-Coding Genes**: It specifically filters RNA-Seq data for `"gene_type" = 'protein_coding'`, ensuring we're focusing on protein-coding genes as required.

2. **Consistent Sample Type Names**: It uses the `"sample_type_name"` column, which provides clear and descriptive names like `'Solid Tissue Normal'` and `'Primary Tumor'`, making the query more readable and accurate.

3. **Identifying Cases with Both Normal and Other Tissue Samples**:
   - The query groups the RNA-Seq data by `"case_barcode"` and checks for cases that have both `'Solid Tissue Normal'` samples and other types of samples.
   - The `HAVING` clause ensures that only cases with at least one normal sample (`"sample_type_name" = 'Solid Tissue Normal'`) and at least one other sample (`"sample_type_name" != 'Solid Tissue Normal'`) are included.

4. **Directly Queries RNA-Seq Data**: Since we're focusing on protein-coding genes and RNA-Seq data, querying directly from `"RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28"` is efficient and avoids unnecessary joins.

5. **Accurate Results**: The output in `1result.csv` shows case barcodes along with their associated sample types, confirming that the cases have both normal and other tissue samples.

Therefore, the SQL in `1result.sql` correctly identifies TCGA breast cancer cases that include both normal and other types of tissue samples, focusing on protein-coding genes.
