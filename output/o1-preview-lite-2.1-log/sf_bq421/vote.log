1result.sql
```

The SQL query in `1result.sql` correctly answers the task by listing all unique pairs of embedding medium and staining substance code meanings, along with the number of occurrences for each pair, based on the 'SM' modality data. It retrieves this information from the `IDC.IDC_V17."DICOM_METADATA_CURATED_SERIES_LEVEL"` table, grouping by the relevant code meanings and counting the occurrences.

The query ensures that:

- **Embedding medium code meanings** are sourced from `"primaryAnatomicStructure_CodeMeaning"`.
- **Staining substance code meanings** are sourced from `"illuminationType_CodeMeaning"`.
- Only records where `"Modality"` equals `'SM'` are considered.
- The results are grouped and ordered appropriately to reflect the unique pairs and their frequencies.

This approach provides the desired information directly and efficiently, making `1result.sql` the correct choice.
