2025-01-25 05:04:45 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query arises from the incorrect use of the `STRING_AGG` function syntax in BigQuery. In BigQuery, the `SEPARATOR` keyword is not used. Instead, you specify the separator as the second argument of the `STRING_AGG` function, and the `ORDER BY` clause comes after the expression.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  c.cmte_nm AS committee_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT cc.cand_id) AS number_of_supported_candidates,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT cand.cand_name ORDER BY cand.cand_name ASC, ', ') AS supported_candidates,
  SUM(i.transaction_amt) AS total_small_dollar_donations
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.committee_2016` c
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_committee_2016` cc
  ON c.cmte_id = cc.cmte_id
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_2016` cand
  ON cc.cand_id = cand.cand_id
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016` i
  ON c.cmte_id = i.cmte_id
WHERE i.transaction_amt > 0 AND i.transaction_amt < 200
GROUP BY c.cmte_nm
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Syntax Correction:** Removed the `SEPARATOR` keyword and placed the separator `', '` as the second argument in `STRING_AGG`. The `ORDER BY` clause is placed immediately after the expression within `STRING_AGG`.
  
- **Function Syntax in BigQuery:**
  ```
  STRING_AGG([DISTINCT] expression [{ORDER BY expression [ASC|DESC]}] [, separator])
  ```

**Result Format:**

Executing the corrected query will produce a table with the following columns:

- **committee_name:** The name of the committee.
- **number_of_supported_candidates:** The number of unique candidates supported by the committee.
- **supported_candidates:** The names of the supported candidates in alphabetical order, separated by commas.
- **total_small_dollar_donations:** The total amount of small-dollar donations (over \$0 and under \$200) received by the committee.

**Sample Output:**

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,supported_candidates,total_small_dollar_donations
committee_name1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidate_names1:str,total_donations1:float
committee_name2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidate_names2:str,total_donations2:float
...
```

This table lists committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over \$0 (under \$200 each). For each qualifying committee, it includes the committee name, the number of supported candidates, the candidates' names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total amount of small-dollar donations received.
2025-01-25 05:05:58 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-25 05:05:58 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering arises from the incorrect syntax of the `STRING_AGG` function in your SQL query. Specifically, the placement of the `ORDER BY` clause and the separator is causing the issue.

**Explanation:**

In BigQuery, the correct syntax for the `STRING_AGG` function with an `ORDER BY` clause is:

```sql
STRING_AGG([DISTINCT] expression [, separator] [ORDER BY key [ASC|DESC]])
```

Key points:

- The **separator** (e.g., `', '`) is specified as the second argument, immediately after the expression.
- The **`ORDER BY` clause** comes after the separator and does not require any additional keywords.
- The **`SEPARATOR` keyword** is not used in BigQuery's `STRING_AGG` function.

**Your Query and the Error:**

Your query includes:

```sql
STRING_AGG(DISTINCT cand.cand_name ORDER BY cand.cand_name ASC SEPARATOR ', ')
```

The error message:

```
Cannot ORDER BY literal values at [4:67]
```

Indicates that the query parser is interpreting `SEPARATOR ', '` as a problem because the syntax does not match BigQuery's expectations.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected query with the proper `STRING_AGG` syntax:

```sql
SELECT
  c.cmte_nm AS committee_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT cc.cand_id) AS number_of_supported_candidates,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT cand.cand_name, ', ' ORDER BY cand.cand_name ASC) AS supported_candidates,
  SUM(i.transaction_amt) AS total_small_dollar_donations
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.committee_2016` c
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_committee_2016` cc
  ON c.cmte_id = cc.cmte_id
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_2016` cand
  ON cc.cand_id = cand.cand_id
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016` i
  ON c.cmte_id = i.cmte_id
WHERE i.transaction_amt > 0 AND i.transaction_amt < 200
GROUP BY c.cmte_nm
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

- **Separator Placement:** The separator `', '` is placed as the second argument in `STRING_AGG`, immediately after the expression `DISTINCT cand.cand_name`.
- **Order of Clauses:** The `ORDER BY` clause is placed after the separator, within the parentheses of `STRING_AGG`.
- **Removal of `SEPARATOR` Keyword:** The `SEPARATOR` keyword is not part of BigQuery's syntax and has been removed.

**Syntax Structure:**

The correct structure for `STRING_AGG` in BigQuery is:

```sql
STRING_AGG([DISTINCT] expression [, separator] [ORDER BY key [ASC|DESC]])
```

**Example:**

```sql
STRING_AGG(DISTINCT cand.cand_name, ', ' ORDER BY cand.cand_name ASC)
```

**Additional Notes:**

- Ensure all column names and table references are correct.
- Verify that the columns used in the `SELECT` clause and `GROUP BY` clause are consistent.
- The `COUNT(DISTINCT cc.cand_id)` function counts the number of unique candidates supported by each committee.
- The `SUM(i.transaction_amt)` function calculates the total small-dollar donations received by each committee.

**Result:**

Executing the corrected query will produce a table with the following columns:

- **committee_name:** The name of the committee.
- **number_of_supported_candidates:** The number of unique candidates supported by the committee.
- **supported_candidates:** The names of the supported candidates in alphabetical order, separated by commas.
- **total_small_dollar_donations:** The total amount of small-dollar donations (over \$0 and under \$200) received by the committee.

**Sample Output Format:**

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,supported_candidates,total_small_dollar_donations
committee_name1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidate_names1:str,total_donations1:float
committee_name2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidate_names2:str,total_donations2:float
...
```

**Summary:**

By adjusting the `STRING_AGG` function to match BigQuery's syntax requirements, the query should now execute successfully and provide the desired data.

**Reference:**

For more information on `STRING_AGG`, you can refer to the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate_functions#string_agg).
2025-01-25 05:06:42 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-25 05:06:42 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering indicates that the `STRING_AGG` function is not recognized. This function is available in BigQuery **Standard SQL** but not in **Legacy SQL**.

To resolve this issue, ensure that your query is executed using **Standard SQL**. You can do this by adding the `#standardSQL` directive at the top of your query.

Here is the corrected query:

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
  c.cmte_nm AS committee_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT cc.cand_id) AS number_of_supported_candidates,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT cand.cand_name, ', ' ORDER BY cand.cand_name ASC) AS supported_candidates,
  SUM(i.transaction_amt) AS total_small_dollar_donations
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.committee_2016` c
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_committee_2016` cc
  ON c.cmte_id = cc.cmte_id
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_2016` cand
  ON cc.cand_id = cand.cand_id
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016` i
  ON c.cmte_id = i.cmte_id
WHERE i.transaction_amt > 0 AND i.transaction_amt < 200
GROUP BY c.cmte_nm
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- Adding `#standardSQL` at the beginning tells BigQuery to use Standard SQL syntax.
- The `STRING_AGG` function is correctly used in Standard SQL and will aggregate candidate names as desired.

**Sample Output Format:**

Running this query will produce a table like:

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,supported_candidates,total_small_dollar_donations
committee_name1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidate_names1:str,total_donations1:float
committee_name2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidate_names2:str,total_donations2:float
...
```

This table lists committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over \$0 (under \$200 each). For each qualifying committee, it includes the committee name, the number of supported candidates, the candidates' names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total amount of small-dollar donations received.

2025-01-25 05:09:10 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-25 05:09:10 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering occurs because you're trying to execute the `STRING_AGG` function without including it within a `SELECT` statement. In SQL, all expressions and functions need to be part of a valid query, typically starting with `SELECT`.

Additionally, ensure that you're using BigQuery **Standard SQL**, as the `STRING_AGG` function with the syntax you're using is available in Standard SQL, not in Legacy SQL.

**Explanation:**

- **Syntax Error:** Executing `STRING_AGG` on its own is not valid SQL syntax. It must be included within a `SELECT` statement.
- **Standard SQL:** The `STRING_AGG` function with ordering and distinct support is available in BigQuery Standard SQL. You need to enable Standard SQL by adding `#standardSQL` at the beginning of your query or by configuring your query settings.

**Correct Usage:**

Wrap your `STRING_AGG` function within a `SELECT` statement, and ensure you're using Standard SQL.

**Example:**

If you want to test the `STRING_AGG` function, you can write a query like this:

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT cand.cand_name, ', ' ORDER BY cand.cand_name ASC) AS supported_candidates
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_2016` cand
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation of the Query:**

- **`#standardSQL`:** This tells BigQuery to use Standard SQL syntax.
- **`SELECT STRING_AGG(...)`:** Wraps the function within a `SELECT` statement.
- **`FROM ...`:** Specifies the table to query (`candidate_2016` in this case).
- **`LIMIT 100`:** Limits the number of results (though in this case, `STRING_AGG` will return a single aggregated string).

**Applying It to Your Original Query:**

In your original context, the `STRING_AGG` function is part of a larger query. Make sure the entire query is correctly structured.

Here's how your full query should look:

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
  c.cmte_nm AS committee_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT cc.cand_id) AS number_of_supported_candidates,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT cand.cand_name, ', ' ORDER BY cand.cand_name ASC) AS supported_candidates,
  SUM(i.transaction_amt) AS total_small_dollar_donations
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.committee_2016` c
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_committee_2016` cc
  ON c.cmte_id = cc.cmte_id
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_2016` cand
  ON cc.cand_id = cand.cand_id
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016` i
  ON c.cmte_id = i.cmte_id
WHERE i.transaction_amt > 0 AND i.transaction_amt < 200
GROUP BY c.cmte_nm
LIMIT 100;
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Ensure Execution in Standard SQL:** The `STRING_AGG` function with ordering and distinct aggregation is only available in BigQuery Standard SQL.
- **Function Placement:** The `STRING_AGG` function must be within the `SELECT` clause of your query.
- **Contextual Use:** If you're testing the function separately, always include it within a `SELECT` statement and specify a `FROM` clause to indicate the source of data.

**Summary:**

- **Wrap Functions in `SELECT`:** Always include expressions and functions within a `SELECT` statement.
- **Use Standard SQL:** Add `#standardSQL` at the top of your query to use Standard SQL features.

9. **Find committees that support candidates and received small-dollar donations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT i.cmte_id
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016` i
   JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_committee_2016` cc
   ON i.cmte_id = cc.cmte_id
   WHERE i.transaction_amt > 0 AND i.transaction_amt < 200
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Get committee names, number of supported candidates, candidate names (alphabetical order), and total small-dollar donations:**

    ```sql
    SELECT c.cmte_nm AS committee_name,
           COUNT(DISTINCT cc.cand_id) AS number_of_supported_candidates,
           STRING_AGG(DISTINCT cand.cand_name ORDER BY cand.cand_name ASC SEPARATOR ', ') AS supported_candidates,
           SUM(i.transaction_amt) AS total_small_dollar_donations
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.committee_2016` c
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_committee_2016` cc
      ON c.cmte_id = cc.cmte_id
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.candidate_2016` cand
      ON cc.cand_id = cand.cand_id
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.fec.individuals_2016` i
      ON c.cmte_id = i.cmte_id
    WHERE i.transaction_amt > 0 AND i.transaction_amt < 200
    GROUP BY c.cmte_nm
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries progressively build toward answering the task by selecting relevant data from the appropriate tables, applying necessary filters, and aggregating information to obtain the desired results.Query:
SELECT cmte_id, cmte_nm
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.fec.committee_2016`
   LIMIT 100;

Task: Please display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,supported_candidates,total_small_dollar_donations
committee_name1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidate_names1:str,total_donations1:float
committee_name2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidate_names2:str,total_donations2:float
...
```

Here is a table listing committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, the table includes the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names in alphabetical order (separated by commas), and the total amount of small-dollar donations received..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
