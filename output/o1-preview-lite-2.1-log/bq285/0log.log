2025-01-23 10:43:13 - root - INFO - The error occurs because the column `city` does not exist in the `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations` table. The correct column name is `branch_city`.

Please update your SQL query to use `branch_city` instead of `city`.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT branch_city AS city, COUNT(DISTINCT institution_name) AS institution_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE state_name = 'Florida' 
  AND branch_city IS NOT NULL 
  AND institution_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY branch_city
ORDER BY institution_count DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Changed `city` to `branch_city`:** The `locations` table uses `branch_city` to represent the city where each bank branch is located.
- **Aliased `branch_city` as `city`:** In the `SELECT` clause, `branch_city AS city` allows the result set to have a column named `city`, matching your original intent.
- **Rest of the query remains the same:** The query will now correctly count the number of unique bank institutions in each city in Florida and order them in descending order.

After running this corrected query, you should receive the results without any errors.

  description=""The legal/statistical area description (LSAD) codes describe the particular typology for each geographic entity. For legal entities, the LSAD reflects the term that appears in legal documentation pertaining to the entity, such as a treaty, charter, legislation, resolution, or ordinance. For statistical entities, the LSAD is the term assigned by the Census Bureau or other agency defining the entity. The LSAD code is a two-character field that corresponds to a description of the legal or statistical type of entity and identifies whether the LSAD term should be capitalized and should precede or follow the name of the geographic entity. Note that the same LSAD code is assigned to entities at different levels of the geographic hierarchy when they share the same LSAD. For example, the Census Bureau assigns the same LSAD code (\""21\"") to boroughs in New York and Connecticut, although they are county subdivisions in the former and incorporated places in the latter.\n\nThese codes can be found in the TIGER/Line products, gazetteer files, and other products.

Task: Could you provide me with the zip code of the location that has the highest number of bank institutions in Florida?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The zip code with the highest number of bank institutions in Florida is **33131**, located in Miami's financial district.

```csv
Zip_Code,Number_of_Bank_Institutions
33131,25
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This result is based on counting the number of unique bank institutions in each zip code within Florida from the `fdic_banks.locations` table, and identifying the zip code with the highest count..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Task: Could you provide me with the zip code of the location that has the highest number of bank institutions in Florida?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The zip code with the highest number of bank institutions in Florida is **33131**, located in Miami's financial district.

```csv
Zip_Code,Number_of_Bank_Institutions
33131,25
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This result is based on counting the number of unique bank institutions in each zip code within Florida from the `fdic_banks.locations` table, and identifying the zip code with the highest count..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

  description=""The legal/statistical area description (LSAD) codes describe the particular typology for each geographic entity. For legal entities, the LSAD reflects the term that appears in legal documentation pertaining to the entity, such as a treaty, charter, legislation, resolution, or ordinance. For statistical entities, the LSAD is the term assigned by the Census Bureau or other agency defining the entity. The LSAD code is a two-character field that corresponds to a description of the legal or statistical type of entity and identifies whether the LSAD term should be capitalized and should precede or follow the name of the geographic entity. Note that the same LSAD code is assigned to entities at different levels of the geographic hierarchy when they share the same LSAD. For example, the Census Bureau assigns the same LSAD code (\""21\"") to boroughs in New York and Connecticut, although they are county subdivisions in the former and incorporated places in the latter.\n\nThese codes can be found in the TIGER/Line products, gazetteer files, and other products. The table below describes each code and which geographic entities each code is valid for.""

Task: Could you provide me with the zip code of the location that has the highest number of bank institutions in Florida?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The zip code with the highest number of bank institutions in Florida is **33131**, located in Miami's financial district.

```csv
Zip_Code,Number_of_Bank_Institutions
33131,25
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This result is based on counting the number of unique bank institutions in each zip code within Florida from the `fdic_banks.locations` table, and identifying the zip code with the highest count..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'census_utility': ['fips_class_code', 'fips_codes_all', 'fips_codes_states', 'functional_status_codes', 'lsad_codes', 'mtfcc_feature_class_codes'], 'fda_food': ['food_enforcement', 'food_events'], 'fdic_banks': ['institutions', 'locations'], 'geo_census_blockgroups': ['blockgroups_01', 'blockgroups_02', 'blockgroups_04', 'blockgroups_05', 'blockgroups_06', 'blockgroups_08', 'blockgroups_09', 'blockgroups_10', 'blockgroups_11', 'blockgroups_12', 'blockgroups_13', 'blockgroups_15', 'blockgroups_16', 'blockgroups_17', 'blockgroups_18', 'blockgroups_19', 'blockgroups_20', 'blockgroups_21', 'blockgroups_22', 'blockgroups_23', 'blockgroups_24', 'blockgroups_25', 'blockgroups_26', 'blockgroups_27', 'blockgroups_28', 'blockgroups_29', 'blockgroups_30', 'blockgroups_31', 'blockgroups_32', 'blockgroups_33', 'blockgroups_34', 'blockgroups_35', 'blockgroups_36', 'blockgroups_37', 'blockgroups_38', 'blockgroups_39', 'blockgroups_40', 'blockgroups_41', 'blockgroups_42', 'blockgroups_44', 'blockgroups_45', 'blockgroups_46', 'blockgroups_47', 'blockgroups_48', 'blockgroups_49', 'blockgroups_50', 'blockgroups_51', 'blockgroups_53', 'blockgroups_54', 'blockgroups_55', 'blockgroups_56', 'blockgroups_60', 'blockgroups_66', 'blockgroups_69', 'blockgroups_72', 'blockgroups_78', 'us_blockgroups_national'], 'geo_us_boundaries': ['adjacent_counties', 'adjacent_states', 'cbsa', 'cnecta', 'coastline', 'congress_district_115', 'congress_district_116', 'counties', 'csa', 'metropolitan_divisions', 'national_outline', 'nws_forecast_regions', 'railways', 'states', 'urban_areas', 'zip_codes']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The zip code with the highest number of bank institutions in Florida is **33131**, located in Miami's financial district.

```csv
Zip_Code,Number_of_Bank_Institutions
33131,25
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This result is based on counting the number of unique bank institutions in each zip code within Florida from the `fdic_banks.locations` table, and identifying the zip code with the highest count. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
