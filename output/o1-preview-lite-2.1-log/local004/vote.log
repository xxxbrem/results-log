After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is **2result.sql**. Here's the reasoning:

- **Option 2 (2result.sql)** correctly calculates the **average payment per order** by first summing all payments per order in the `order_total_payments` CTE (Common Table Expression). This ensures that each order's total payment is accurately represented, especially for orders with multiple payment installments. It then calculates the average of these total payments per customer, providing an accurate average payment per order.

- **Option 1 (1result.sql)** uses `AVG(p."payment_value")` directly on the payment values. This approach can lead to incorrect results because it averages individual payment records without aggregating them per order. If an order has multiple payment installments, each payment installment is treated separately, which skews the average and does not reflect the true payment per order.

- **Option 0 (0result.sql)** calculates the average payment per order by dividing the sum of all payment values by the number of distinct orders. While this might seem correct, it could produce inaccurate results if there are discrepancies or if some orders have multiple payment installments. It doesn't explicitly aggregate payments per order before calculating the average, which can lead to potential errors.

By first summing payments per order and then calculating the average per customer, **2result.sql** provides the most accurate and reliable results for the required metrics.
