After comparing the three SQL queries, **`2result.sql`** is the correct choice for the following reasons:

1. **Efficiency**: This query uses a single SQL statement with aggregate functions, which is more efficient than using multiple subqueries as in the other options. It scans the dataset only once.

2. **Readability**: The query is concise and easy to understand. It directly calculates the percentage by summing up the trees with 'Good' health and dividing by the total number of trees in the Bronx.

3. **Accuracy**: All three queries produce the same result (78.1473%), but `2result.sql` achieves this result in a more straightforward and efficient manner.

**Correct SQL file:**

```plaintext
2result.sql
