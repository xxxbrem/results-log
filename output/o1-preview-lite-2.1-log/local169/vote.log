After comparing both SQL queries, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer for calculating the annual retention rate of Colorado legislators who started their first term between 1917 and 1999, tracked up to 20 years later.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Handling of Service Status:** `1result.sql` uses a `CASE WHEN EXISTS` clause to accurately determine if a legislator was in office during each specific year. This approach checks for any term that covers the exact date, ensuring that legislators who had breaks in service are correctly accounted for.

- **Recursive Numbers Generation:** It employs a recursive CTE to generate the sequence of numbers representing each year offset. This method is scalable and efficient for generating sequences without manually listing each number.

- **Null Date Handling:** The query explicitly filters out any `NULL` values in `term_start` and `term_end` within the `"terms"` CTE, ensuring data integrity and preventing potential errors in date comparisons.

- **Clarity and Readability:** The structure of `1result.sql` is modular, with well-defined CTEs that make the logic easier to follow and maintain.
