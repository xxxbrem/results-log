Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task, we'll consider the relevant tables and columns from the provided datasets.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Database:** `bigquery-public-data`
- **Schema:** `noaa_icoads`
- **Tables:**
  - `icoads_core_2010`
  - `icoads_core_2011`
  - `icoads_core_2012`
  - `icoads_core_2013`
  - `icoads_core_2014`

**Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- `year` (INT64): Used to filter data between 2010 and 2014.
- `month` (INT64): Used to group data by month.
- `air_temperature` (FLOAT64): Used to calculate the average air temperature per month.
- `wetbulb_temperature` (FLOAT64): Used to calculate the average wet bulb temperature per month.
- `dewpoint_temperature` (FLOAT64): Used to calculate the average dew point temperature per month.
- `sea_surface_temp` (FLOAT64): Used to calculate the average sea surface temperature per month.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014`: To select data within the specified years.
- Exclude missing or null values: Ensure calculations are based on valid temperature readings.
- Temperature ranges: Exclude outliers by setting reasonable temperature limits.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Select Sample Data from 2010:**

    ```sql
    SELECT year, month, air_temperature, wetbulb_temperature, dewpoint_temperature, sea_surface_temp
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_2010`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **Select Distinct Years and Months from 2010 to 2014:**

      AND year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014
    GROUP BY year, month
    ORDER BY year, month
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find Months with Sufficient Data (e.g., >1000 Observations):**

    ```sql
    SELECT year, month, COUNT(*) AS num_observations
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_icoads.icoads_core_*`
    WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2010' AND '2014'
      AND year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014
      AND air_temperature IS NOT NULL
      AND wetbulb_temperature IS NOT NULL
      AND dewpoint_temperature IS NOT NULL
      AND sea_surface_temp IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY year, month
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1000
    ORDER BY year, month
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries allow us to understand the data distribution and compute the required values to identify the top 3 months with the smallest sum of absolute differences between the average temperatures.Query:
SELECT year, month, air_temperature, wetbulb_temperature, dewpoint_temperature, sea_surface_temp

Task: What are the top 3 months between 2010 and 2014 with the smallest sum of absolute differences between the average air temperature, wet bulb temperature, dew point temperature, and sea surface temperature, including respective years and sum of differences? Please present the year and month in numerical format.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the top 3 months between 2010 and 2014 with the smallest sum of absolute differences between the average air temperature, wet bulb temperature, dew point temperature, and sea surface temperature, we compute the average values for each of these temperatures for every month in the given period. Then, for each month, we calculate the sum of absolute differences between these averages.

The results are presented below in numerical format for the year and month, along with the corresponding sum of differences:

```csv
Year,Month,Sum_of_Differences
year1:int,month1:int,sum_difference1:float
year2:int,month2:int,sum_difference2:float
year3:int,month3:int,sum_difference3:float
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 12:35:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the top 3 months between 2010 and 2014 with the smallest sum of absolute differences between the average air temperature, wet bulb temperature, dew point temperature, and sea surface temperature, including respective years and sum of differences? Please present the year and month in numerical format., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the top 3 months between 2010 and 2014 with the smallest sum of absolute differences between the average air temperature, wet bulb temperature, dew point temperature, and sea surface temperature, we compute the average values for each of these temperatures for every month in the given period. Then, for each month, we calculate the sum of absolute differences between these averages.

The results are presented below in numerical format for the year and month, along with the corresponding sum of differences:

```csv
Year,Month,Sum_of_Differences
year1:int,month1:int,sum_difference1:float
year2:int,month2:int,sum_difference2:float
year3:int,month3:int,sum_difference3:float
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
