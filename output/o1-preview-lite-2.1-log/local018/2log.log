Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to identify the most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021 and compare its share to 2011. Here are the relevant tables and columns:

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `collisions`
   - **"collision_date"** (TEXT): Used to filter collisions by year (extracting the year from the date).
   - **"primary_collision_factor"** (TEXT): Indicates the primary cause of the collision; used to identify and count causes.
   - **"pcf_violation_code"** (TEXT): Violation code associated with the primary collision factor; may help categorize causes.
   - **"pcf_violation_category"** (TEXT): Category of the violation; used to group and compare causes.
   - **"case_id"** (REAL): Unique identifier for each collision; used to count total incidents.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Extract the year from `"collision_date"` to filter data for 2011 and 2021.
- Group data by `"primary_collision_factor"` to find the most common causes.
- Calculate the percentage share of each cause relative to the total incidents per year.

Here are 10 different SQLite SQL queries to explore the data:

```sql
-- 1. Inspect unique collision dates to understand the date format
SELECT DISTINCT "collision_date" FROM "collisions" LIMIT 100;

-- 2. Extract the year from collision_date and list sample dates with years
SELECT "collision_date", SUBSTR("collision_date", 1, 4) AS "year" FROM "collisions" LIMIT 100;

-- 3. List distinct primary collision factors in the dataset
SELECT DISTINCT "primary_collision_factor" FROM "collisions" LIMIT 100;

-- 4. Count total collisions per year to understand yearly incident volumes
SELECT SUBSTR("collision_date", 1, 4) AS "year", COUNT(DISTINCT "case_id") AS "total_incidents"
FROM "collisions"
GROUP BY "year"
ORDER BY "year"
LIMIT 100;

-- 5. Find the most common primary_collision_factors in 2021
SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "count"
FROM "collisions"
WHERE SUBSTR("collision_date", 1, 4) = '2021'
GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
ORDER BY "count" DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- 6. Find the most common primary_collision_factors in 2011
SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "count"
FROM "collisions"
WHERE SUBSTR("collision_date", 1, 4) = '2011'
GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
ORDER BY "count" DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- 7. Compare the counts of a specific primary_collision_factor between 2011 and 2021
SELECT SUBSTR("collision_date", 1, 4) AS "year", COUNT(*) AS "count"
FROM "collisions"
WHERE "primary_collision_factor" = 'Unsafe Speed' -- Replace with actual factor after inspection
GROUP BY "year"
HAVING "year" IN ('2011', '2021')
ORDER BY "year"
LIMIT 100;

-- 8. List pcf_violation_codes and their categories in 2021
SELECT DISTINCT "pcf_violation_code", "pcf_violation_category"
FROM "collisions"
WHERE SUBSTR("collision_date", 1, 4) = '2021'
LIMIT 100;

-- 9. Count total incidents with each pcf_violation_category in 2021
SELECT "pcf_violation_category", COUNT(*) AS "count"
FROM "collisions"
WHERE SUBSTR("collision_date", 1, 4) = '2021'
GROUP BY "pcf_violation_category"
ORDER BY "count" DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- 10. Find the percentage share of the most common cause in 2021 relative to total incidents
SELECT 
  (COUNT(*) * 100.0) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "collisions" WHERE SUBSTR("collision_date", 1, 4) = '2021') AS "percentage_share"
FROM "collisions"
WHERE SUBSTR("collision_date", 1, 4) = '2021' AND "primary_collision_factor" = 'Unsafe Speed' -- Replace with actual factor
LIMIT 100;
```

These queries will help you understand the data in the relevant columns and gather the necessary information to calculate the percentage decrease of the most common cause of traffic accidents from 2011 to 2021.Query:

Task: For the most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021, how much did its share (percentage in the annual roal incidents) decrease compared to 10 years earlier?

Please answer only one complete SQL in sqlite dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "column_name" FROM "table_name" WHERE ... ``` (Replace "table_name" with the actual table name. Enclose table and column names with double quotations if they contain special characters or match reserved keywords.)
Follow the answer format like: To determine how much the share of the most common cause of traffic accidents decreased from 2011 to 2021, we calculate the percentage difference in its occurrence relative to the total annual incidents for both years.

```csv
Percentage_decrease
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: 

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: To determine how much the share of the most common cause of traffic accidents decreased from 2011 to 2021, we calculate the percentage difference in its occurrence relative to the total annual incidents for both years.

```csv
Percentage_decrease
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
