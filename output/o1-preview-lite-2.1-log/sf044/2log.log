2025-01-20 22:48:33 - root - INFO - Apologies for the confusion earlier. The error occurred because the schema name `CYBERSYN` was included twice in the table path. The correct table reference should include the database name, schema name, and table name in the format:

```sql
FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE
```

In this case, the correct table path is:

- **Database:** `FINANCE__ECONOMICS`
- **Schema:** `CYBERSYN`
- **Table:** `COMPANY_INDEX`

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "COMPANY_NAME", "PRIMARY_TICKER"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.COMPANY_INDEX
LIMIT 1000;
```

Please try running this corrected query. It should retrieve the company names and their primary ticker symbols from the `COMPANY_INDEX` table without any errors.

**Note:** Make sure to adjust other queries accordingly by removing the extra `CYBERSYN` in the table path. The general format should be:

```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.TABLE_NAME
WHERE ...
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Example Adjustments:**

- **Original Query with Error:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "DATE", "VALUE"
  FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
  WHERE "TICKER" = 'AAPL' AND "VARIABLE" = 'Close'
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

- **Corrected Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "DATE", "VALUE"
  FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
  WHERE "TICKER" = 'AAPL' AND "VARIABLE" = 'Close'
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

By ensuring the correct table path, you should be able to execute the queries successfully.

---

**Summary:**

The error was due to an incorrect table path in the SQL query. By correcting the table reference to exclude the duplicate schema name, the query should execute without issues.

2025-01-20 22:49:22 - root - INFO - I'm sorry to hear you're still encountering an error. Let's work together to troubleshoot this issue.

**Understanding the Error:**

The error message:

```
002043 (02000): 01b9d8d8-0004-7e70-0001-11c300f2d3de: SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

indicates that the database object you're referring to (in this case, the table) does not exist or cannot be accessed.

**Possible Reasons and Solutions:**

1. **Double Check the Table Path:**

   In the information provided, it seems that some tables include an extra `CYBERSYN` in the table path. Specifically, the table is listed as:

   ```
   table_name,FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.COMPANY_INDEX
   ```

   This suggests that the correct path might actually include the extra `CYBERSYN`.

   **Try Running the Query with the Extra 'CYBERSYN':**

   ```sql
   SELECT "COMPANY_NAME", "PRIMARY_TICKER"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN.COMPANY_INDEX
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   If this still results in an error, proceed to the next steps.

2. **Verify the Available Schemas and Tables:**

   It's possible that the schema or table names are slightly different or that you don't have access to them. Let's list all schemas and tables to verify their existence.

   **List Schemas in the Database:**

   ```sql
   SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE FINANCE__ECONOMICS;
   ```

   **List Tables in the 'CYBERSYN' Schema:**

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN;
   ```

   **List Tables in the 'CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN' Schema:**

   If the schema is nested or named with a period, you might need to include both parts:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA FINANCE__ECONOMICS."CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN";
   ```

   Note: When schema or table names contain special characters like periods (`.`), it's important to enclose them in double quotes.

3. **Check for Case Sensitivity:**

   Some database systems are case-sensitive, especially when identifiers are enclosed in double quotes. Ensure that you are using the exact case as defined in the database.

   **Try Adjusting the Case:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "COMPANY_NAME", "PRIMARY_TICKER"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.COMPANY_INDEX
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   Or, if the schema and table names are in lowercase:

   ```sql
   SELECT "company_name", "primary_ticker"
   FROM finance__economics.cybersyn.company_index
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Confirm Your Access Rights:**

   Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the database, schema, and table.

   - **Check if You Have Access to the Database:**

     ```sql
     SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE();
     ```

   - **Check Your Roles and Privileges:**

     ```sql
     SHOW GRANTS TO USER CURRENT_USER;
     ```

   If you don't have sufficient privileges, you may need to contact your database administrator.

5. **Alternative Table Names:**

   Sometimes, tables might have prefixes or suffixes. Check if there is a versioned or differently named table.

   **List All Tables that Might Be Relevant:**

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES LIKE '%COMPANY%';
   ```

6. **Use Fully Qualified Names with Quotes:**

   If the schema name includes a period, you need to enclose it in double quotes.

   **Example:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "COMPANY_NAME", "PRIMARY_TICKER"
   FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS."CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN"."COMPANY_INDEX"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Check for Views Instead of Tables:**

   It's possible that `COMPANY_INDEX` is a view rather than a table.

   **List Views in the Schema:**

   ```sql
   SHOW VIEWS IN SCHEMA FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN;
   ```

   If `COMPANY_INDEX` appears in the list of views, you can query it the same way as a table.

8. **Verify Object Existence Directly:**

   **Describe the Table or View:**

   ```sql
   DESC TABLE FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.COMPANY_INDEX;
   ```

   Or, if it's a view:

   ```sql
   DESC VIEW FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.COMPANY_INDEX;
   ```

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Queries Above:** Start by running the `SHOW SCHEMAS` and `SHOW TABLES` commands to identify the correct schema and table names.

- **Adjust Your Query Based on Findings:** Use the exact schema and table names as they appear in your database.

- **Ensure Proper Quoting:** Remember to use double quotes for identifiers that are case-sensitive or contain special characters.

**Example Adjusted Query:**

If you find that the schema is actually named `CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN`, you should adjust your query accordingly:

```sql
SELECT "COMPANY_NAME", "PRIMARY_TICKER"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS."CYBERSYN.CYBERSYN".COMPANY_INDEX
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Alternative Approach:**

If you cannot locate the `COMPANY_INDEX` table, but you need the ticker symbols for specific companies, and you have access to the `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` table, you might be able to proceed without `COMPANY_INDEX`.

For example, if you know the tickers of the Magnificent 7 tech companies (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA, NVDA), you can directly query the `STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES` table.

**Example Query:**

```sql
SELECT "TICKER", "DATE", "VALUE"
FROM FINANCE__ECONOMICS.CYBERSYN.STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES
WHERE "TICKER" IN ('AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'TSLA', 'NVDA')
  AND "VARIABLE" = 'Close'
  AND "DATE" BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-06-30'
ORDER BY "TICKER", "DATE"
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Conclusion:**

The error you're experiencing likely stems from one of the following:

- Incorrect table or schema name.
- Lack of access privileges.
- Case sensitivity issues.
- The object being a view instead of a table.

By verifying the available schemas and tables and ensuring correct referencing, you should be able to resolve the issue.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or clarification on any of these steps.

description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

Task: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I don't have access to stock price data for the year 2024. Therefore, I cannot provide the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024. If you need information on these companies up to 2023, I'd be happy to help with that..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

Task: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I don't have access to stock price data for the year 2024. Therefore, I cannot provide the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024. If you need information on these companies up to 2023, I'd be happy to help with that..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

Task: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I don't have access to stock price data for the year 2024. Therefore, I cannot provide the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024. If you need information on these companies up to 2023, I'd be happy to help with that..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

Task: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I don't have access to stock price data for the year 2024. Therefore, I cannot provide the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024. If you need information on these companies up to 2023, I'd be happy to help with that..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

Task: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I don't have access to stock price data for the year 2024. Therefore, I cannot provide the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024. If you need information on these companies up to 2023, I'd be happy to help with that..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

The OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.

The OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.

The OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others."

Task: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I don't have access to stock price data for the year 2024. Therefore, I cannot provide the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024. If you need information on these companies up to 2023, I'd be happy to help with that..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
