Based on the comparison of the SQL queries and their results:

**Option 0:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT indicator_code) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators_with_Value_Zero
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE country_code = 'RUS'
  AND value = 0;
```
Result:
```
Number_of_Debt_Indicators_with_Value_Zero
12
```

**Option 1:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT indicator_code) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators_with_Value_Zero
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE country_code = 'RUS' AND value = 0;
```
Result:
```
Number_of_Debt_Indicators_with_Value_Zero
12
```

**Option 2:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT indicator_code) AS Number_of_Debt_Indicators_with_Value_Zero
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_debt.international_debt`
WHERE country_code = 'RUS' 
  AND value = 0 
  AND value IS NOT NULL
  AND indicator_code IS NOT NULL;
```
Result:
```
Number_of_Debt_Indicators_with_Value_Zero
12
```

**Comparison and Reasoning:**

- **Value IS NOT NULL:**
  - In SQL, comparing `value = 0` automatically excludes `NULL` values because any comparison with `NULL` results in `NULL`, which is not `TRUE`. Therefore, adding `value IS NOT NULL` is redundant.

- **Indicator_Code IS NOT NULL:**
  - When counting `DISTINCT indicator_code`, if there are records where `indicator_code` is `NULL` and `value = 0`, they would be counted as one `NULL` indicator.
  - If we want to exclude `NULL` `indicator_code` values from our count, adding `indicator_code IS NOT NULL` ensures we only count valid debt indicators.

- **Result Consistency:**
  - All three queries return the same result (`12`), indicating that in this dataset, there are `12` distinct `indicator_code` values where `value = 0` for Russia, and none of the `indicator_code` values are `NULL` when `value = 0`.

**Conclusion:**

- **Option 2** is the most precise and explicitly ensures that both `value` and `indicator_code` are not `NULL`. It is good practice to include these conditions to avoid counting `NULL` values, especially in different datasets where `NULL` values might exist.
