2025-01-25 01:58:16 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-25 01:58:16 - root - INFO - I see that you're encountering an error because the column `FIPS` does not exist in table `a`, which is `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2015_5yr`. The `county_2015_5yr` table does not have a `FIPS` column; instead, it has a `geo_id` column that includes the FIPS code as part of its value.

To fix this issue, we can extract the county FIPS code from the `geo_id` column by using the `SUBSTR` function to grab the last five characters. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT SUBSTR(a.`geo_id`, -5) AS `FIPS`,
       ((b.`unemployed_pop` / b.`pop_in_labor_force`) * 100) - ((a.`unemployed_pop` / a.`pop_in_labor_force`) * 100) AS `unemployment_rate_change`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2015_5yr` AS a
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2018_5yr` AS b
  ON a.`geo_id` = b.`geo_id`
WHERE a.`pop_in_labor_force` > 0 AND b.`pop_in_labor_force` > 0
LIMIT 100;
```

In this query:

- **`SUBSTR(a.\`geo_id\`, -5)`** extracts the last five characters from the `geo_id`, which corresponds to the county's FIPS code.
- We're still joining the 2015 and 2018 ACS data on `geo_id`.
- The rest of the query calculates the change in unemployment rates between 2015 and 2018.

If you need to join this data with the `dual_eligible_enrollment_by_county_and_program` table using the `FIPS` code, you can adjust your query as follows:

```sql
SELECT SUBSTR(c.`geo_id`, -5) AS `FIPS`,
       ((d.`unemployed_pop` / d.`pop_in_labor_force`) * 100) - ((c.`unemployed_pop` / c.`pop_in_labor_force`) * 100) AS `Unemployment_Rate_Change`,
       a.`Public_Total` - b.`Public_Total` AS `Enrollee_Count_Change`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cms_dual_eligible_enrollment.dual_eligible_enrollment_by_county_and_program` AS a
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cms_dual_eligible_enrollment.dual_eligible_enrollment_by_county_and_program` AS b
  ON a.`FIPS` = b.`FIPS`
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2015_5yr` AS c
  ON SUBSTR(c.`geo_id`, -5) = a.`FIPS`
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.county_2018_5yr` AS d
  ON SUBSTR(d.`geo_id`, -5) = b.`FIPS`
WHERE a.`Date` = '2015-12-01' AND b.`Date` = '2018-12-01'
  AND b.`Public_Total` < a.`Public_Total`
  AND c.`pop_in_labor_force` > 0 AND d.`pop_in_labor_force` > 0
  AND (d.`unemployed_pop` / d.`pop_in_labor_force`) > (c.`unemployed_pop` / c.`pop_in_labor_force`)
```

In this adjusted query:

- **Extracting FIPS Codes**: We use `SUBSTR(c.\`geo_id\`, -5)` and `SUBSTR(d.\`geo_id\`, -5)` to extract the FIPS codes from the `geo_id` columns in the ACS data tables.
- **Joining on FIPS**: We join the ACS data tables with the dual-eligible enrollment tables using the extracted FIPS codes.
- **Conditions**: The query filters for counties where the dual-eligible enrollee counts decreased and the unemployment rate increased from 2015 to 2018.
- **No `LIMIT`**: I've removed the `LIMIT` clause to ensure all relevant counties are included.

Please try running the corrected query. If you encounter any further errors or need additional assistance, feel free to let me know!

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **For ACS data**:
  - Join data on `geo_id` between 2015 and 2018 datasets.
  - Calculate unemployment rates: `(unemployed_pop / pop_in_labor_force) * 100`.
  - Identify counties where unemployment rate increased from 2015 to 2018.

- **For dual-eligible enrollee data**:
  - Filter `Date` to '2015-12-01' and '2018-12-01'.
  - Compare `Public_Total` between the two dates for each county.
  - Identify counties where enrollee counts decreased from 2015 to 2018.

Task: Count the number of counties that experienced an increase in unemployment from 2015 to 2018, using 5-year ACS data, and a decrease in dual-eligible enrollee counts between December 1, 2015, and December 1, 2018.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_Counties
count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This represents the number of counties that experienced an increase in unemployment from 2015 to 2018, using 5-year ACS data, and a decrease in dual-eligible enrollee counts between December 1, 2015, and December 1, 2018..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
