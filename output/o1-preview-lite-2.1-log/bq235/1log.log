    SELECT provider_id, provider_name, average_total_payments
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Calculate average inpatient payments per provider:**
    ```sql
    SELECT provider_id, provider_name, AVG(average_total_payments) AS avg_inpatient_payment
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
    GROUP BY provider_id, provider_name
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **List all records from outpatient charges 2014:**

    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Calculate average outpatient payments per provider:**
    ```sql
    SELECT provider_id, provider_name, AVG(average_total_payments) AS avg_outpatient_payment
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014`
    GROUP BY provider_id, provider_name
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. **Join inpatient and outpatient data on provider_id:**
    ```sql
    SELECT i.provider_id, i.provider_name, i.average_total_payments AS inpatient_payment, o.average_total_payments AS outpatient_payment
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014` AS i
    JOIN `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2014` AS o
    ON i.provider_id = o.provider_id
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **Calculate total inpatient payments per provider (weighted by discharges):**
    ```sql
    SELECT provider_id, provider_name, SUM(total_discharges * average_total_payments) AS total_inpatient_payments
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.inpatient_charges_2014`
    GROUP BY provider_id, provider_name
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Can you tell me which healthcare provider incurs the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Provider_ID,Provider_Name,Combined_Total_Payments
id:str,name:str,value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine which healthcare provider incurs the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014, we aggregate the total payments for each provider from both the `inpatient_charges_2014` and `outpatient_charges_2014` tables in the `cms_medicare` schema. By summing the total payments for inpatient and outpatient services per provider, we identify the provider with the highest combined total payments..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'cms_codes': ['hcpcs', 'icd10_diagnoses_2019', 'icd10_procedures_2019', 'icd9_diagnoses', 'icd9_procedures'], 'cms_medicare': ['home_health_agencies_2013', 'home_health_agencies_2014', 'hospice_providers_2014', 'hospital_general_info', 'inpatient_charges_2011', 'inpatient_charges_2012', 'inpatient_charges_2013', 'inpatient_charges_2014', 'inpatient_charges_2015', 'nursing_facilities_2013', 'nursing_facilities_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2011', 'outpatient_charges_2012', 'outpatient_charges_2013', 'outpatient_charges_2014', 'outpatient_charges_2015', 'part_d_prescriber_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2012', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2013', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2014', 'physicians_and_other_supplier_2015', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2013', 'referring_durable_medical_equip_2014'], 'cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop': ['care_site', 'concept', 'concept_ancestor', 'concept_class', 'concept_relationship', 'condition_era', 'condition_occurrence', 'cost', 'death', 'device_exposure', 'domain', 'dose_era', 'drug_era', 'drug_exposure', 'drug_strength', 'location', 'observation', 'observation_period', 'payer_plan_period', 'person', 'procedure_occurrence', 'provider', 'relationship', 'vocabulary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 02:29:36 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you tell me which healthcare provider incurs the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Provider_ID,Provider_Name,Combined_Total_Payments
id:str,name:str,value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine which healthcare provider incurs the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014, we aggregate the total payments for each provider from both the `inpatient_charges_2014` and `outpatient_charges_2014` tables in the `cms_medicare` schema. By summing the total payments for inpatient and outpatient services per provider, we identify the provider with the highest combined total payments. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-24 02:30:19 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you tell me which healthcare provider incurs the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Provider_ID,Provider_Name,Combined_Total_Payments
id:str,name:str,value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine which healthcare provider incurs the highest combined average costs for both outpatient and inpatient services in 2014, we aggregate the total payments for each provider from both the `inpatient_charges_2014` and `outpatient_charges_2014` tables in the `cms_medicare` schema. By summing the total payments for inpatient and outpatient services per provider, we identify the provider with the highest combined total payments. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
