After comparing the SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Calculation of Max Composition:** `2result.sql` correctly identifies the maximum composition value for each month within the specified date range (September 2018 to August 2019).
  
- **Three-Month Rolling Average:** It utilizes window functions to compute the three-month rolling average of the maximum composition values. This approach ensures a smooth and continuous calculation without manual averaging.
  
- **Inclusion of Required Fields:** The output includes all the necessary information:
  - **Date:** The `month_year` field represents the date.
  - **Interest Name:** Retrieved by joining with the `interest_map` table.
  - **Max Index Composition for the Month:** The highest composition value for each month.
  - **Rolling Average:** Calculated using window functions over the maximum compositions.
  - **Top-Ranking Interests from Previous Months:** Includes the top-ranking interests from one and two months prior, providing insights into trends over time.
  
- **Consistent Results:** The results in `2result.csv` align with expectations, showing logical progression and appropriate rolling averages that reflect the data accurately.

**Conclusion:**

`2result.sql` effectively fulfills the requirements by providing a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the interest data.
