   WHERE `state_code` = '06' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
   LIMIT 100
   ```

8. **List distinct parameter names in VOC daily summary to confirm pollutants:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT `parameter_name`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.voc_daily_summary`
   LIMIT 100
   ```

9. **Retrieve PM10 measurements along with county names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT `date_local`, `county_name`, `arithmetic_mean`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
   WHERE `state_code` = '06' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
   LIMIT 100
   ```

10. **Get the number of observations per month for PM10 in California in 2020:**

    ```sql
    SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM `date_local`) AS month, COUNT(*) AS observation_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm10_daily_summary`
    WHERE `state_code` = '06' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `date_local`) = 2020
    GROUP BY month
    ORDER BY month
    LIMIT 100
    ```

Task: Please calculate the monthly average levels of PM10, PM2.5 FRM, PM2.5 non-FRM, volatile organic emissions, SO2 (scaled by a factor of 10), and Lead (scaled by a factor of 100) air pollutants in California for the year 2020.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: We calculated the monthly average levels of PM10, PM2.5 FRM, PM2.5 non-FRM, volatile organic emissions, SO₂ (scaled by a factor of 10), and Lead (scaled by a factor of 100) air pollutants in California for the year 2020. The averages are computed per month.

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'epa_historical_air_quality': ['air_quality_annual_summary', 'co_daily_summary', 'co_hourly_summary', 'hap_daily_summary', 'hap_hourly_summary', 'lead_daily_summary', 'no2_daily_summary', 'no2_hourly_summary', 'nonoxnoy_daily_summary', 'nonoxnoy_hourly_summary', 'o3_daily_summary', 'o3_hourly_summary', 'pm10_daily_summary', 'pm10_hourly_summary', 'pm25_frm_daily_summary', 'pm25_frm_hourly_summary', 'pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary', 'pm25_nonfrm_hourly_summary', 'pm25_speciation_daily_summary', 'pm25_speciation_hourly_summary', 'pressure_daily_summary', 'pressure_hourly_summary', 'rh_and_dp_daily_summary', 'rh_and_dp_hourly_summary', 'so2_daily_summary', 'so2_hourly_summary', 'temperature_daily_summary', 'temperature_hourly_summary', 'voc_daily_summary', 'voc_hourly_summary', 'wind_daily_summary', 'wind_hourly_summary']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 12:21:16 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please calculate the monthly average levels of PM10, PM2.5 FRM, PM2.5 non-FRM, volatile organic emissions, SO2 (scaled by a factor of 10), and Lead (scaled by a factor of 100) air pollutants in California for the year 2020., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: We calculated the monthly average levels of PM10, PM2.5 FRM, PM2.5 non-FRM, volatile organic emissions, SO₂ (scaled by a factor of 10), and Lead (scaled by a factor of 100) air pollutants in California for the year 2020. The averages are computed per month.
