After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is `0result.sql`.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Week 2 Calculation:** The SQL in `0result.sql` correctly defines Week 2 as the period from 8 to 14 days after each user's first session date. This aligns precisely with the task requirement to measure retention in the second week after a user's first session.

  ```sql
  DATE(TIMESTAMP_MICROS(returns.`event_timestamp`)) BETWEEN DATE_ADD(cohorts.`first_session_date`, INTERVAL 8 DAY)
    AND DATE_ADD(cohorts.`first_session_date`, INTERVAL 14 DAY)
  ```

- **User-Level Precision:** By using each user's actual `first_session_date`, the SQL ensures that the retention calculation is based on the individual user's activity, rather than aggregating by cohort week start dates. This method provides a more accurate retention rate for users returning in their specific Week 2 period.

- **Alignment with Task Requirements:** The query includes only users whose first session start event occurred after July 9, 2018, and up to September 23, 2018, ensuring that cohorts are correctly formed within the specified date range.

- **Consistent Cohort Grouping:** Cohorts are grouped by the week of the user's first session start event, using `DATE_TRUNC` with a `WEEK(MONDAY)` parameter, which aligns with the Monday-starting weeks as per the task description.

In contrast, the SQL queries in `1result.sql` and `2result.sql` calculate Week 2 retention based on the cohort week start date rather than the individual user's first session date. This approach can misalign the retention period for users who did not start on the first day of the cohort week, potentially including activity outside the intended 8 to 14-day window after their first session.
