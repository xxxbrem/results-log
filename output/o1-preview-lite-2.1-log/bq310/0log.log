Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task, we need to identify relevant tables, columns, and conditions that can help us find the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
  - **`title`**: Contains the title of the question.
    - *Potential Usage*: Search for questions containing the word "how".
  - **`tags`**: Contains the tags associated with the question.
    - *Potential Usage*: Filter questions tagged with Android-related tags like 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', etc.
  - **`view_count`**: Number of times the question has been viewed.
    - *Potential Usage*: Identify the most viewed questions.
  - **`creation_date`**: Date when the question was created.
    - *Potential Usage*: Filter questions based on creation date.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Title Contains "how"**: `WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'`
- **Specific Android Tags**:
  - `tags LIKE '%<android-layout>%'`
  - `tags LIKE '%<android-activity>%'`
  - `tags LIKE '%<android-intent>%'`
- **Multiple Tags**: Use `OR` to include multiple tags.
- **Order By View Count**: `ORDER BY view_count DESC`
- **Limit Results**: `LIMIT 100`

Task: What is the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow, across specified tags such as 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', and others

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: The title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow across specified tags is:

```csv
Title
title:str
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This question has the highest number of views among those tagged with Android-related tags (such as 'android-layout', 'android-activity', 'android-intent', etc.) and containing the word "how" in the title..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'stackoverflow': ['badges', 'comments', 'post_history', 'post_links', 'posts_answers', 'posts_moderator_nomination', 'posts_orphaned_tag_wiki', 'posts_privilege_wiki', 'posts_questions', 'posts_tag_wiki', 'posts_tag_wiki_excerpt', 'posts_wiki_placeholder', 'stackoverflow_posts', 'tags', 'users', 'votes']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 11:36:53 - root - INFO - Apologies for the inconvenience. The error occurs because the table `posts_questions` may not contain the expected data or might be empty. Instead, we should use the `posts` table, which contains all posts, and filter for questions using `post_type_id = 1`. Additionally, to include all Android-related tags, we should adjust the `tags` condition to match any tags containing "android" within angle brackets.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT title
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts`
WHERE post_type_id = 1
  AND LOWER(title) LIKE '%how%'
  AND tags LIKE '%<%android%>%'
ORDER BY view_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query selects the title of the most viewed question that:

- Is a question (`post_type_id = 1`)
- Has "how" in the title
- Is related to Android development (tags containing "android")

Following the required answer format:

The title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow across specified tags is:

```csv
Title
title:str
```

(Note: The actual title would be retrieved when executing the query.)
