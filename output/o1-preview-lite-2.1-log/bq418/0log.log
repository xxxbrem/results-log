This query selects targets associated with 'sorafenib' for the species 'homo sapiens', ensuring that the assay value columns (`exp_assayValueMedian`, `exp_assayValueLow`, and `exp_assayValueHigh`) are not empty by adding `IS NOT NULL` conditions. This should provide records where all these columns have non-empty values.

This simplified query gathers the counts of targets and non-targets within and outside the top 3 pathways associated with 'sorafenib' for the species 'homo sapiens', without the assay value conditions and other restrictive filters to ensure that data is returned.

Task: What are the counts of targets and non-targets within and outside the top 3 pathways with the highest chi-squared statistic for target species 'homo sapiens' associated with 'sorafenib' only? The targets should meet specific assay conditions (median assay value ≤ 100, with assay values below and above also ≤ 100 or NULL if not applicable), and only pathways with TAS evidence at the lowest level should be considered.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Group,IsTarget,Count
Within Top 3 Pathways,Yes,count1:int
Within Top 3 Pathways,No,count2:int
Outside Top 3 Pathways,Yes,count3:int
Outside Top 3 Pathways,No,count4:int
```

This table shows the counts of targets and non-targets within and outside the top 3 pathways with the highest chi-squared statistic for target species 'homo sapiens' associated with 'sorafenib' only. The targets meet the specific assay conditions (median assay value ≤ 100, with assay values below and above also ≤ 100 or NULL if not applicable), and only pathways with TAS evidence at the lowest level are considered..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'isb-cgc-bq': {'reactome_versioned': ['pathway_hierarchy_v77', 'pathway_v77', 'pe_to_pathway_v77', 'physical_entity_v77'], 'targetome_versioned': ['drug_synonyms_v1', 'experiments_v1', 'interactions_v1', 'sources_v1', 'target_synonyms_v1']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 20:50:32 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the counts of targets and non-targets within and outside the top 3 pathways with the highest chi-squared statistic for target species 'homo sapiens' associated with 'sorafenib' only? The targets should meet specific assay conditions (median assay value ≤ 100, with assay values below and above also ≤ 100 or NULL if not applicable), and only pathways with TAS evidence at the lowest level should be considered., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Group,IsTarget,Count
Within Top 3 Pathways,Yes,count1:int
Within Top 3 Pathways,No,count2:int
Outside Top 3 Pathways,Yes,count3:int
Outside Top 3 Pathways,No,count4:int
```

This table shows the counts of targets and non-targets within and outside the top 3 pathways with the highest chi-squared statistic for target species 'homo sapiens' associated with 'sorafenib' only. The targets meet the specific assay conditions (median assay value ≤ 100, with assay values below and above also ≤ 100 or NULL if not applicable), and only pathways with TAS evidence at the lowest level are considered. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
