System and method of reconstructing complex custom objects,"A system and method is provided for reconstructing one or more collections of objects across platforms. More particularly, Java Annotations are used to assist a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) wizard in reconstructing a collection of objects. In implementation, the system and method parses the object types such that a wizard can recreate or reconstruct the collection of objects for use by a receiving service. The method comprises reconstructing a collection using one or more annotations that document a base object of the collection."
Multilayer printed wiring board for semiconductor devices and method for manufacturing the board,"A multilayer printed wiring board includes one or more resin layers having via-holes and a core layer having via-holes. The via-holes formed in the one or more resin layers are open in the direction opposite to the direction in which the via-holes formed in the core layer are open. A method for manufacturing a multilayer printed wiring board includes a step of preparing a single- or double-sided copper-clad laminate; a step of forming lands by processing the copper-clad laminate; a step of forming a resin layer on the upper surface of the copper-clad laminate, forming openings for via-holes in the resin layer, and then forming the via-holes; and a step of forming openings for via-holes in the lower surface of the copper-clad laminate and then forming the via-holes."
Liquid crystal display and method of manufacturing the same,"A liquid crystal display utilizing a vertically aligned state of liquid crystal molecules when no voltage is applied and to a method of manufacturing the same. Objectives include providing a liquid crystal display and a method of manufacturing the same in which the existing step for forming vertical alignment films can be omitted to achieve a cost reduction. The liquid crystal display includes a monofunctional monomer having a structure expressed by X—R (where X represents an acrylate group or a methacrylate group, and R represents an organic group having a steroid skeleton). A liquid crystal material is sandwiched between substrates, which are then irradiated with ultraviolet rays to cure the monofunctional monomer, thereby forming a polymer film at an interface of a substrate. The monofunctional monomer has a hydrophobic skeleton such as an alkyl chain and a photoreactive group on one side of the skeleton."
Coating tool,"Provided is a coating tool for forming a film having uniform thickness on a target by controlling precisely a flow-rate of a coating liquid, even if its viscosity is high. In the coating tool, a coating head 1 includes a pair of head members 10 and 20; a slot 3 is formed between a pair of interior surfaces 11 and 21, facing each other, of the head members 10 and 20; and a coating liquid flows through the slot 3 and is discharged from the tip of the coating head 1. An internal flow-rate control mechanism 60 is provided to control the flow-rate of the coating liquid in the slot 3 by adjusting a convexity and/or a concavity."
Bias techniques for magnetic tape media,"The disclosure is directed to a method for creating a remnant magnetization on a magnetic tape medium. The magnetic tape is first substantially demagnetized, e.g., erased, by an erasure unit having multiple magnetic elements of alternating polarity. The erased magnetic tape is then passed by a bias magnet that creates a remnant magnetization on the magnetic tape. The remnant magnetized magnetic tape is then passed through a servo write head that writes servo patterns to the remnant magnetized magnetic tape. The bias magnet may be housed within the erasure unit or within a bias unit, and the distance between the bias magnet and the tape path of the magnetic tape may be adjustable to create the desired remnant magnetization on the magnetic tape. The remnant magnetization created on the magnetic tape may be greater than 20 percent to reduce defects in the servo pattern written to the magnetic tape."
Portable pressurization headphones,"A portable headset for equalizing air pressure across the tympanic membrane of a user's ears. The device comprises two earpieces secured at opposing ends of a headband. The earpieces are cup-shaped housings containing a fan and a speaker. A mesh screen covers the open portion of the housing to protect the user's ear from contact with the fan blades. Additionally, a cushion is disposed along the perimeter of the housing to buffer the user's ear from the device. When the device is turned on, the fans rotate and air is pushed into or pulled out of the ear canals. Rate of rotation and direction of rotation are controlled via at least one pressurization selection dial. Thus the air pressure can be changed as a plane ascends or descends through the atmosphere."

8636691,Method and apparatus to indicate prior use of a medical item,"The present invention monitors an IV bag injection port and informs the user of prior injections. The present invention employs an object and/or a sealed chamber within a transparent IV fluid bag injection port. In the case of the object, notification of prior use is achieved when the object's or IV fluid's appearance is altered. With respect to the sealed chamber, the chamber's seal is breached to allow fluid to pass between the chamber and the IV bag to change the appearance of the contents of the chamber. Since the injection port and bag walls are at least partially transparent, medical personnel are able to observe the altered appearance of either the object, IV fluid or the sealed chamber."
8639358,Fail-safe implantable medical electrical lead,"An integrated bipolar implantable medical electrical lead, which may be employed by a cardiac defibrillator, has a single low voltage electrode and a single high voltage electrode and employs a relatively robust and fail-safe configuration of three conductors. Each of the three conductors extends within an individual lumen of a tri-lumen insulative body of the lead. First and second conductors of the three connect, in parallel, the low voltage electrode to a first contact of a connector terminal assembly of the lead, and a third conductor of the three connects the high voltage electrode to a second and a third contact of the connector terminal assembly. A configuration of the third conductor differs from that of the first and second conductors in order to make the third conductor more susceptible to fracture, relative to the first and second conductors, after many years of chronic implant under extreme loading conditions."
8637455,Compositions and methods for delivery of glycopeptide antibiotics to medical device surfaces,"The presently disclosed subject matter relates to peptides having binding affinity for glycopeptide antibiotics and methods and compositions for delivering glycopeptide antibiotic to the surface of medical devices. The peptide compositions can comprise a peptide having binding affinity for a surface material of a medical device that is coupled to the peptide having binding affinity for glycopeptide antibiotic. Also provided are methods of applying the peptide compositions to a medical device by contacting the peptide compositions with a surface of the medical device. In addition, kits are provided comprising the peptide compositions."
8630995,Methods and systems for acquiring and processing veterinary-related information to facilitate differential diagnosis,"Computer-implemented methods and systems for acquiring and processing veterinary-related information, such as non-human animal diseases, associated medical signs, differentials, and treatment-related information, are provided. The disclosed methods and systems facilitate performing computer-based differential diagnosis by veterinary medicine practitioners. An example method may comprise: importing veterinary-related text information, wherein the veterinary-related text information is related to one or more non-human animal diseases; parsing the veterinary-related text information into one or more terms; determining relations between the one or more terms; classifying the one or more terms such that each term relates to one of: a non-human animal species, an animal disease, a medical sign and a treatment; and generating a database table associated with the imported veterinary-related text information, the database table comprising the one or more classified terms and the relations therebetween."
8621692,Surgical bed clamp apparatus,"A medical table and clamp apparatus provides a medical table having sides and at least one rail extending along a side. A clamp travels along the rail, the clamp having a clamp body which has a pair of spaced apart appendages with a recess therebetween. An internally threaded sleeve extends through the body and has an end portion that communicates with the recess. An externally threaded shaft threadably engages the sleeve. A bearing is mounted on one end of the shaft. A pusher/pressure plate is mounted on the bearing with a pivotal, articulating or ball and socket connection and has a concave surface that grips curved structures. The pusher plate is supported within the recess. The pusher plate is movable toward or away from the sleeve. An insert is connectable to the pressure/pusher plate and presents a flat surface to an implement that is to be clamped."
8636919,Reactive solutions,"Material and methods are disclosed involving the generation and containment of solutions incorporating reactive precursors and reactive treatment agents. Formulations of these materials can be applied widely as disinfectants, odor control agents, decontamination and fumigation agents, liquid, gas, and air treatment materials, respiratory agents, food and beverage processing agents, neutralization

External knowledge that might be helpful: 
## Patent Citations

Patent citations are citations to other patent documents. They take the form of backward (cited) and forward (citing) citations. Backward citations, also referred to as back citations or cited patent documents, refer to earlier patent applications or grants that affect the scope of the claims of an application. Forward citations or citing documents refer to later filings of applications that are affected by the scope of the claims of the cited document.

## Our Focus

We only focus on patents which are applied in the USA, and particularly in chemistry, biology, and medical-related fields. Concretely, the subsection id of Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) should be chosen from C5 to C13, or its group id is among the following set:
- A01G
- A01H
- A61K
- A61P
- A61Q
- B01F
- B01J
- B81B
- B82B
- B82Y
- G01N
- G16H

System and method of reconstructing complex custom objects,"A system and method is provided for reconstructing one or more collections of objects across platforms. More particularly, Java Annotations are used to assist a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) wizard in reconstructing a collection of objects. In implementation, the system and method parses the object types such that a wizard can recreate or reconstruct the collection of objects for use by a receiving service. The method comprises reconstructing a collection using one or more annotations that document a base object of the collection."
Multilayer printed wiring board for semiconductor devices and method for manufacturing the board,"A multilayer printed wiring board includes one or more resin layers having via-holes and a core layer having via-holes. The via-holes formed in the one or more resin layers are open in the direction opposite to the direction in which the via-holes formed in the core layer are open. A method for manufacturing a multilayer printed wiring board includes a step of preparing a single- or double-sided copper-clad laminate; a step of forming lands by processing the copper-clad laminate; a step of forming a resin layer on the upper surface of the copper-clad laminate, forming openings for via-holes in the resin layer, and then forming the via-holes; and a step of forming openings for via-holes in the lower surface of the copper-clad laminate and then forming the via-holes."
Liquid crystal display and method of manufacturing the same,"A liquid crystal display utilizing a vertically aligned state of liquid crystal molecules when no voltage is applied and to a method of manufacturing the same. Objectives include providing a liquid crystal display and a method of manufacturing the same in which the existing step for forming vertical alignment films can be omitted to achieve a cost reduction. The liquid crystal display includes a monofunctional monomer having a structure expressed by X—R (where X represents an acrylate group or a methacrylate group, and R represents an organic group having a steroid skeleton). A liquid crystal material is sandwiched between substrates, which are then irradiated with ultraviolet rays to cure the monofunctional monomer, thereby forming a polymer film at an interface of a substrate. The monofunctional monomer has a hydrophobic skeleton such as an alkyl chain and a photoreactive group on one side of the skeleton."
Coating tool,"Provided is a coating tool for forming a film having uniform thickness on a target by controlling precisely a flow-rate of a coating liquid, even if its viscosity is high. In the coating tool, a coating head 1 includes a pair of head members 10 and 20; a slot 3 is formed between a pair of interior surfaces 11 and 21, facing each other, of the head members 10 and 20; and a coating liquid flows through the slot 3 and is discharged from the tip of the coating head 1. An internal flow-rate control mechanism 60 is provided to control the flow-rate of the coating liquid in the slot 3 by adjusting a convexity and/or a concavity."
Bias techniques for magnetic tape media,"The disclosure is directed to a method for creating a remnant magnetization on a magnetic tape medium. The magnetic tape is first substantially demagnetized, e.g., erased, by an erasure unit having multiple magnetic elements of alternating polarity. The erased magnetic tape is then passed by a bias magnet that creates a remnant magnetization on the magnetic tape. The remnant magnetized magnetic tape is then passed through a servo write head that writes servo patterns to the remnant magnetized magnetic tape. The bias magnet may be housed within the erasure unit or within a bias unit, and the distance between the bias magnet and the tape path of the magnetic tape may be adjustable to create the desired remnant magnetization on the magnetic tape. The remnant magnetization created on the magnetic tape may be greater than 20 percent to reduce defects in the servo pattern written to the magnetic tape."
Portable pressurization headphones,"A portable headset for equalizing air pressure across the tympanic membrane of a user's ears. The device comprises two earpieces secured at opposing ends of a headband. The earpieces are cup-shaped housings containing a fan and a speaker. A mesh screen covers the open portion of the housing to protect the user's ear from contact with the fan blades. Additionally, a cushion is disposed along the perimeter of the housing to buffer the user's ear from the device. When the device is turned on, the fans rotate and air is pushed into or pulled out of the ear canals. Rate of rotation and direction of rotation are controlled via at least one pressurization selection dial. Thus the air pressure can be changed as a plane ascends or descends through the atmosphere."

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTSVIEW': {'PATENTSVIEW': ['APPLICATION', 'ASSIGNEE', 'BOTANIC', 'BRF_SUM_TEXT', 'CLAIM', 'CLAIMS_2021', 'CPC_CURRENT', 'CPC_GROUP', 'CPC_SUBGROUP', 'CPC_SUBSECTION', 'DETAIL_DESC_TEXT_2021', 'DRAW_DESC_TEXT', 'DRAW_DESC_TEXT_2021', 'FIGURES', 'FOREIGNCITATION', 'FOREIGN_PRIORITY', 'GOVERNMENT_INTEREST', 'GOVERNMENT_ORGANIZATION', 'INVENTOR', 'INVENTOR_GENDER', 'IPCR', 'LAWYER', 'LOCATION', 'LOCATION_ASSIGNEE', 'LOCATION_INVENTOR', 'MAINCLASS', 'MAINCLASS_CURRENT', 'MATCH', 'NBER', 'NBER_CATEGORY', 'NBER_SUBCATEGORY', 'NON_INVENTOR_APPLICANT', 'OTHERREFERENCE', 'PATENT', 'PATENT_ASSIGNEE', 'PATENT_CONTRACTAWARDNUMBER', 'PATENT_GOVINTORG', 'PATENT_INVENTOR', 'PATENT_LAWYER', 'PCT_DATA', 'PERSISTENT_ASSIGNEE_DISAMBIG', 'PERSISTENT_INVENTOR_DISAMB', 'PERSISTENT_INVENTOR_DISAMBIG', 'RAWASSIGNEE', 'RAWEXAMINER', 'RAWINVENTOR', 'RAWLAWYER', 'RAWLOCATION', 'REL_APP_TEXT', 'SUBCLASS', 'SUBCLASS_CURRENT', 'USAPPLICATIONCITATION', 'USPATENTCITATION', 'USPC', 'USPC_CURRENT', 'USRELDOC', 'US_TERM_OF_GRANT', 'WIPO', 'WIPO_FIELD']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
