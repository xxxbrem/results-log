External knowledge that might be helpful: 
## Patent Citations

Patent citations are citations to other patent documents. They take the form of backward (cited) and forward (citing) citations. Backward citations, also referred to as back citations or cited patent documents, refer to earlier patent applications or grants that affect the scope of the claims of an application. Forward citations or citing documents refer to later filings of applications that are affected by the scope of the claims of the cited document.

## Our Focus

We only focus on patents which are applied in the USA, and particularly in chemistry, biology, and medical-related fields. Concretely, the subsection id of Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) should be chosen from C5 to C13, or its group id is among the following set:
- A01G
- A01H
- A61K
- A61P
- A61Q
- B01F
- B01J
- B81B
- B82B
- B82Y
- G01N
- G16H

Task: Tell me the patent title and abstract, as well as the publication date, the backward citation and forward citation count within 5 years for those published in January 2014. The detailed requirements are provided in `forward_backward_citation.md`.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the provided database schema and the task requirements, the following table presents the patent title, abstract, publication date, backward citation count within 5 years, and forward citation count within 5 years for patents published in January 2014. These patents were applied in the USA and are classified in specified chemistry, biology, and medical-related CPC classes.

```csv
Title,Abstract,Publication_Date,Backward_Citation_Count,Forward_Citation_Count
title1:str,abstract1:str,2014-01-dd,backward_count1:int,forward_count1:int
title2:str,abstract2:str,2014-01-dd,backward_count2:int,forward_count2:int
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTSVIEW': {'PATENTSVIEW': ['APPLICATION', 'ASSIGNEE', 'BOTANIC', 'BRF_SUM_TEXT', 'CLAIM', 'CLAIMS_2021', 'CPC_CURRENT', 'CPC_GROUP', 'CPC_SUBGROUP', 'CPC_SUBSECTION', 'DETAIL_DESC_TEXT_2021', 'DRAW_DESC_TEXT', 'DRAW_DESC_TEXT_2021', 'FIGURES', 'FOREIGNCITATION', 'FOREIGN_PRIORITY', 'GOVERNMENT_INTEREST', 'GOVERNMENT_ORGANIZATION', 'INVENTOR', 'INVENTOR_GENDER', 'IPCR', 'LAWYER', 'LOCATION', 'LOCATION_ASSIGNEE', 'LOCATION_INVENTOR', 'MAINCLASS', 'MAINCLASS_CURRENT', 'MATCH', 'NBER', 'NBER_CATEGORY', 'NBER_SUBCATEGORY', 'NON_INVENTOR_APPLICANT', 'OTHERREFERENCE', 'PATENT', 'PATENT_ASSIGNEE', 'PATENT_CONTRACTAWARDNUMBER', 'PATENT_GOVINTORG', 'PATENT_INVENTOR', 'PATENT_LAWYER', 'PCT_DATA', 'PERSISTENT_ASSIGNEE_DISAMBIG', 'PERSISTENT_INVENTOR_DISAMB', 'PERSISTENT_INVENTOR_DISAMBIG', 'RAWASSIGNEE', 'RAWEXAMINER', 'RAWINVENTOR', 'RAWLAWYER', 'RAWLOCATION', 'REL_APP_TEXT', 'SUBCLASS', 'SUBCLASS_CURRENT', 'USAPPLICATIONCITATION', 'USPATENTCITATION', 'USPC', 'USPC_CURRENT', 'USRELDOC', 'US_TERM_OF_GRANT', 'WIPO', 'WIPO_FIELD']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
