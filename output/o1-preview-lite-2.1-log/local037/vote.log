After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL for solving the task.

---

**Reasoning:**

1. **Alignment with the Task:**
   - **Task Definition:** Find the top three product categories with the highest number of payments in orders where all payments are of a single payment type.
   - Both SQL queries accurately address this task by:
     - Selecting orders (`order_id`) where there's only one distinct `payment_type`.
     - Joining these orders with order items and products to count the number of payments per product category.
     - Ordering the results to identify the top three categories.

2. **Comparison of SQL Queries:**
   - **`1result.sql`:**
     - Uses a subquery within the `JOIN` clause to identify orders with a single payment type.
     - While effective, the subquery within the `JOIN` can be less readable, especially in more complex queries.
   - **`2result.sql`:**
     - Utilizes a **Common Table Expression (CTE)** with the `WITH` clause to define `single_payment_type_orders`.
     - This approach separates the logic of identifying orders with a single payment type from the main query, enhancing readability and maintainability.
     - The main query then simply joins with the CTE, making the overall structure clearer.

3. **Results:**
   - Both queries produce identical results:

     ```
     Product_Category,Number_of_Payments
     cama_mesa_banho,10822
     beleza_saude,9515
     esporte_lazer,8464
     ```

   - This confirms that both are logically correct and yield the same outcome.

4. **Best Practice:**
   - Using CTEs is generally considered a good practice for complex queries as it:
     - Improves readability by breaking down the query into logical parts.
     - Makes debugging easier.
     - Enhances reusability of code segments.

**Conclusion:**

Given the enhanced readability and maintainability, **`2result.sql`** is the preferred choice for solving this task.
