After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL script that accurately calculates the median from the highest season goals of each team is:

```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Median Calculation:** The `1result.sql` script uses the `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY "highest_season_goals")` function to calculate the median. This is a standard and precise method for computing the median in SQL, especially suitable for continuous distributions and when dealing with potentially fractional median values.

- **Proper Aggregation:**
  - It first aggregates the total goals scored by each team in each season.
  - Then, it identifies the highest season goal total for each team by taking the `MAX("season_goals")`.
  - Finally, it computes the median of these highest season goals across all teams.

- **SQL Standards Compliance:** The script is structured using standard SQL functions and syntax, making it compatible with many SQL databases that support window functions and the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function.

- **Clarity and Readability:** The use of aliases like `team_highest_goals` and `team_season_goals` improves the readability of the query, making it clear what each subquery represents.

**Note on Other Options:**

- **`0result.sql`:**
  - While it also calculates the median, it uses `MEDIAN("highest_season_goals")`, which might not be supported in all SQL databases.
  - Casting the median to an integer (`CAST(... AS INT)`) could potentially lose precision if the median is a fractional value.

- **`2result.sql`:**
  - Similar to `0result.sql`, it employs `MEDIAN("max_season_goals")` and casts the result to `NUMERIC(10,4)`.
  - While it provides more precision than an integer cast, it still relies on the `MEDIAN` function, which may not be as universally supported or precise as `PERCENTILE_CONT`.

**Conclusion:**

The `1result.sql` script provides a precise, standard, and reliable way to calculate the median of the highest season goals of each team, aligning well with the requirements of the task.
