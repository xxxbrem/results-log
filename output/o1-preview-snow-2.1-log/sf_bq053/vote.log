After analyzing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL that answers the question accurately.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Question Requirements:**
   - **Objective:** Compare the number of trees of each fall color between 1995 and 2015.
   - **Conditions:**
     - Only consider trees that were **alive in 2015**.
     - Exclude trees that were **dead in 1995**.
     - Focus on species present in both censuses to reflect the change accurately.

2. **Analysis of Each SQL Query:**

   - **`0result.sql`:**
     - Selects species present in both censuses with trees alive in 2015 and not dead in 1995.
     - Matches species using `spc_common` (common name).
     - However, it results in very low counts and only includes a few fall colors:
       - `Orange/Brown`, `Yellow`, `Yellow/Orange`.
     - Likely due to strict matching and potential mismatches in `spc_common` names between datasets.

   - **`1result.sql`:**
     - Counts trees by fall color in each census independently.
     - Does not ensure that we're only considering species that were alive in both 1995 and 2015.
     - Includes species that might not have been present or alive in both years.
     - Does not fully comply with the requirement to exclude trees marked as dead in 1995 and consider only those alive in 2015.

   - **`2result.sql`:**
     - **First**, it creates a list of species that are **alive in 2015**.
     - **Then**, it counts trees in 1995 **only for those species** that are alive in 2015, ensuring we're comparing the same set of species.
     - Excludes trees marked as dead in 1995 by checking the `status` field.
     - Counts are grouped by `fall_color`, providing a comparison of the number of trees for each fall color.
     - This approach aligns with the question's requirement of considering only trees that were alive in 2015 and not dead in 1995.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - **`2result.sql`** accurately reflects the changes in the number of trees by fall color from 1995 to 2015.
   - It ensures that only relevant trees are considered according to the specified conditions.
   - The results provide counts for all applicable fall colors, offering a comprehensive comparison.
