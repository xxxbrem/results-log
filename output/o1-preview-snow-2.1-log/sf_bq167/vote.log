Upon comparing both SQL queries, I have chosen **2result.sql** as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Avoids Duplicate Pairs:** The `2result.sql` includes the condition `WHERE a."FromUserId" < a."ToUserId"` which ensures that each pair of users is considered only once. This prevents counting the same pair twice in reverse order (e.g., both `(User1, User2)` and `(User2, User1)`).

- **Accurate Mutual Upvotes Calculation:** By using an inner join between the upvotes from User1 to User2 and from User2 to User1, it accurately matches mutual upvotes between the two users.

- **Clean and Efficient Query:** The query is concise and effectively retrieves the necessary information without unnecessary complexity.

Both SQL queries produce the same result, but **2result.sql** is more precise in handling the mutual upvotes between user pairs. It ensures that each unique pair is counted only once, making it the better choice.

**Therefore, the selected SQL is:**
