After comparing the SQL queries, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL for the following reasons:

- **Use of `RANK()` Function**: `1result.sql` uses the `RANK()` window function to assign ranks based on the total distance traveled by each hurricane. This function correctly handles ties by assigning the same rank to hurricanes that have traveled equal distances. This is important to accurately identify the hurricane that traveled the second longest distance.
  
- **Handling Ties Appropriately**: In contrast, `0result.sql` uses `ROW_NUMBER()`, which assigns a unique sequential number to each row, regardless of ties. This could lead to incorrectly identifying the second longest hurricane if there are hurricanes that traveled the same distance.
  
- **Correct Calculation Steps**:
  - **Calculating Segment Distances**: All queries calculate the distance between consecutive coordinates using spatial functions.
  - **Aggregating Total Distances**: Summing up the segment distances to get the total distance per hurricane.
  - **Ranking Hurricanes**: `1result.sql` ranks hurricanes using `RANK()` to account for ties.
  - **Retrieving Final Latitude**: It then retrieves the final latitude of the hurricane that ranked second in total distance.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** appropriately calculates and identifies the hurricane that traveled the second longest distance and retrieves its final latitude accurately.
