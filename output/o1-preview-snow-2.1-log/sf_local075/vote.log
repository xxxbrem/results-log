After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Clarity and Efficiency:** `1result.sql` uses direct references to the `"event_type"` codes (e.g., `1` for views, `2` for adds to cart, `3` for purchases), which simplifies the query and improves efficiency by avoiding unnecessary joins with the `"SHOPPING_CART_EVENT_IDENTIFIER"` table.

- **Accurate Calculation of Purchases:** By selecting `"event_type" = 3` directly for purchases in the `purchase_visits` CTE, the query accurately identifies purchase events without relying on event names. This reduces potential errors due to event name mismatches.

- **Structured Approach:** The query breaks down the computation into clear Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for views, adds to cart, and purchases, making it easier to read and maintain.

- **Consistent Results:** Both queries produce the same output, but `1result.sql` achieves this with a more straightforward and concise approach.
