After comparing the provided SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **1result.sql** calculates the maximum SNAP participation per region during 2017, ensuring that the data represents the highest participation levels for that year.
- It joins this data with the income information to accurately compute the ratio of households earning under $20,000 to SNAP households.
- The query aligns with the task by providing the top 10 regions with the highest total SNAP participation in 2017 and their respective ratios.

Therefore, the chosen SQL is:
