   FROM FEC.FEC.INDIVIDUALS_2016;
   ```

6. **Retrieve Individual Contributions Greater than $200 from INDIVIDUALS_2016**

   ```sql
   SELECT "cmte_id", "transaction_amt"
   FROM FEC.FEC.INDIVIDUALS_2016
   WHERE "transaction_amt" >= 200
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count the Number of Candidates Supported by Each Committee**

   ```sql
   SELECT "cmte_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "cand_id") AS "number_of_candidates"
   FROM FEC.FEC.CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016
   GROUP BY "cmte_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate Total Small-Dollar Donations per Committee**

   ```sql
   SELECT "cmte_id", SUM("transaction_amt") AS "total_small_dollar_donations"
   FROM FEC.FEC.INDIVIDUALS_2016
   WHERE "transaction_amt" > 0 AND "transaction_amt" < 200 AND "entity_tp" = 'IND'
   GROUP BY "cmte_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List Committees That Received Small-Dollar Donations**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "cmte_id"
   FROM FEC.FEC.INDIVIDUALS_2016
   WHERE "transaction_amt" > 0 AND "transaction_amt" < 200 AND "entity_tp" = 'IND'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve Candidate Names Supported by a Specific Committee**

    ```sql
    SELECT cand."cand_name"
    FROM FEC.FEC.CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016 cc
    JOIN FEC.FEC.CANDIDATE_2016 cand ON cc."cand_id" = cand."cand_id"
    WHERE cc."cmte_id" = 'C00618389'
    ORDER BY cand."cand_name" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help us explore the relevant data needed to fulfill the task, such as identifying committees, their supported candidates, and calculating total small-dollar donations received.Query:

Task: Please display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each), the following table presents the required information:

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,candidates_names,total_small_dollar_donations
committee1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidates_names1:str,total_small_dollar_donations1:float > 0
committee2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidates_names2:str,total_small_dollar_donations2:float > 0
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **committee_name**: The name of the committee from the `COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **number_of_supported_candidates**: The number of candidates the committee supports, derived from the `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **candidates_names**: The names of the supported candidates, in alphabetical order and separated by commas, from the `CANDIDATE_2016` table.
- **total_small_dollar_donations**: The total amount of small-dollar donations (over $0 and under $200 each) received by the committee, calculated from the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table.

Note: The actual data is represented by placeholders since the specific records are not provided..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 14:53:32 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each), the following table presents the required information:

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,candidates_names,total_small_dollar_donations
committee1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidates_names1:str,total_small_dollar_donations1:float > 0
committee2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidates_names2:str,total_small_dollar_donations2:float > 0
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **committee_name**: The name of the committee from the `COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **number_of_supported_candidates**: The number of candidates the committee supports, derived from the `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **candidates_names**: The names of the supported candidates, in alphabetical order and separated by commas, from the `CANDIDATE_2016` table.
- **total_small_dollar_donations**: The total amount of small-dollar donations (over $0 and under $200 each) received by the committee, calculated from the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table.

Note: The actual data is represented by placeholders since the specific records are not provided. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
Current snswer: 
Too long, hard cut:

2025-01-25 14:54:44 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each), the following table presents the required information:

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,candidates_names,total_small_dollar_donations
committee1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidates_names1:str,total_small_dollar_donations1:float > 0
committee2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidates_names2:str,total_small_dollar_donations2:float > 0
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **committee_name**: The name of the committee from the `COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **number_of_supported_candidates**: The number of candidates the committee supports, derived from the `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **candidates_names**: The names of the supported candidates, in alphabetical order and separated by commas, from the `CANDIDATE_2016` table.
- **total_small_dollar_donations**: The total amount of small-dollar donations (over $0 and under $200 each) received by the committee, calculated from the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table.

Note: The actual data is represented by placeholders since the specific records are not provided. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-25 14:56:45 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each), the following table presents the required information:

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,candidates_names,total_small_dollar_donations
committee1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidates_names1:str,total_small_dollar_donations1:float > 0
committee2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidates_names2:str,total_small_dollar_donations2:float > 0
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **committee_name**: The name of the committee from the `COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **number_of_supported_candidates**: The number of candidates the committee supports, derived from the `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **candidates_names**: The names of the supported candidates, in alphabetical order and separated by commas, from the `CANDIDATE_2016` table.
- **total_small_dollar_donations**: The total amount of small-dollar donations (over $0 and under $200 each) received by the committee, calculated from the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table.

Note: The actual data is represented by placeholders since the specific records are not provided. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-25 14:57:34 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each). For each qualifying committee, list the committee name, number of supported candidates, the candidates' names (in alphabetical order, separated by commas), and total small-dollar donations dollars., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To display committees from 2016 that supported candidates and received small-dollar donations over $0 (under $200 each), the following table presents the required information:

```csv
committee_name,number_of_supported_candidates,candidates_names,total_small_dollar_donations
committee1:str,num_candidates1:int,candidates_names1:str,total_small_dollar_donations1:float > 0
committee2:str,num_candidates2:int,candidates_names2:str,total_small_dollar_donations2:float > 0
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **committee_name**: The name of the committee from the `COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **number_of_supported_candidates**: The number of candidates the committee supports, derived from the `CANDIDATE_COMMITTEE_2016` table.
- **candidates_names**: The names of the supported candidates, in alphabetical order and separated by commas, from the `CANDIDATE_2016` table.
- **total_small_dollar_donations**: The total amount of small-dollar donations (over $0 and under $200 each) received by the committee, calculated from the `INDIVIDUALS_2016` table.

Note: The actual data is represented by placeholders since the specific records are not provided. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
