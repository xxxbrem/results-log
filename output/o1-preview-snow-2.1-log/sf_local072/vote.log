The correct SQL script is:

```plain
0result.sql
```

This script dynamically identifies the country with data inserted on nine different days in January 2022. It then determines the longest consecutive period of data insertions for that country during that month and calculates the proportion of entries from its capital city within that period, accurately addressing the task's requirements.
