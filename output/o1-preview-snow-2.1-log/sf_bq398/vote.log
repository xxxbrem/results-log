After comparing the SQL queries and their results:

- **Option 1 (0result.sql)** selects data from the `INTERNATIONAL_DEBT` table, filtering for debt indicators containing 'Debt' in their names. It retrieves the maximum individual debt values for each indicator. However, the debt values are relatively smaller and may not represent the total debt accurately.

- **Option 2 (1result.sql)** selects data from the `INDICATORS_DATA` table in the `WORLD_BANK_WDI` schema. It filters for Russia's debt indicators and sums the debt values for each indicator, providing a cumulative total debt per indicator. The resulting debt values are significantly higher, reflecting the overall debt amounts.

- **Option 3 (2result.sql)** also selects from the `INDICATORS_DATA` table but retrieves the maximum debt value per indicator rather than the total. While it shows high debt values, the cumulative totals from Option 2 provide a more comprehensive view.

**Option 2 (1result.sql)** is the correct choice because it calculates the total debt per indicator, presenting the top three debt indicators for Russia based on the highest cumulative debt values. This approach aligns best with the task of identifying the debt indicators with the highest debt amounts.
