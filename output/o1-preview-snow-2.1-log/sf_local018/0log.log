Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `COLLISIONS`
  - **"collision_date"**: To extract the year of each collision for filtering data by year (e.g., 2021 and 2011).
  - **"primary_collision_factor"**: Represents the primary cause of each collision.
  - **"pcf_violation_category"**: Category of the violation associated with the collision; useful for grouping causes.
  - **"pcf_violation_code"**: Specific code of the violation; can be used to identify and categorize causes.
  - **"case_id"**: Unique identifier for each collision; can be used to join with other tables if needed.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Extracting the year from **"collision_date"** to filter records for the years **2021** and **2011**.
- Grouping collisions by **"primary_collision_factor"** or **"pcf_violation_category"** to count the number of incidents per cause.
- Calculating the total number of incidents per year to compute the percentage share of each cause.
- Ordering results to identify the most common causes.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve a sample of collision dates to understand the date format:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "collision_date"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Extract the year from collision dates and list the distinct years present:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTRING("collision_date", -4) AS "year"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS";
   ```

3. **List distinct primary collision factors to understand possible causes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS";
   ```

4. **Retrieve collision dates and primary collision factors for a sample of records:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "collision_date", "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"

    ```

14. **Calculate the change in collision counts for each primary collision factor between 2011 and 2021:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
      t1."primary_collision_factor",
      t1."collision_count_2021",
      t2."collision_count_2011",
      t1."collision_count_2021" - t2."collision_count_2011" AS "count_difference"
    FROM (
      SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count_2021"
      FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
      WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%'
      GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"

    ON t1."primary_collision_factor" = t2."primary_collision_factor"
    ORDER BY "count_difference" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find the specific violation codes associated with the most common cause in 2021:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "pcf_violation_code", COUNT(*) AS "violation_count"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    WHERE "collision_date" LIKE '%2021%' AND "primary_collision_factor" = '<MOST_COMMON_CAUSE>'
    GROUP BY "pcf_violation_code"
    ORDER BY "violation_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    *Replace `<MOST_COMMON_CAUSE>` with the actual value from previous queries.*

Task: For the most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021, how much did its share (percentage in the annual roal incidents) decrease compared to 10 years earlier?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Cause,Percentage_Decrease
cause_of_accident:str,percentage_decrease:float > 0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021 was **cause_of_accident**. Its share of the annual total incidents decreased by **percentage_decrease**% compared to 2011..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive signs.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 13:44:08 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For the most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021, how much did its share (percentage in the annual roal incidents) decrease compared to 10 years earlier?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Cause,Percentage_Decrease
cause_of_accident:str,percentage_decrease:float > 0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The most common cause of traffic accidents in 2021 was **cause_of_accident**. Its share of the annual total incidents decreased by **percentage_decrease**% compared to 2011. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
