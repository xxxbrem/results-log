Upon comparing the two SQL scripts and their results, here is the analysis:

**Candidate 1 (`0result.sql`):**

- **Methodology:**
  - Calculates the *running balance* for each customer using window functions to accurately determine the **month-end balance** for each customer in each month.
  - Identifies the months with the **most** and **fewest** customers having a **positive month-end balance**.
  - Computes the **average month-end balance** for those specific months.
  - Calculates the **difference** between these average balances.

- **Result:**
  - The difference in average month-end balance between the months with the most and fewest customers having a positive balance is **4993.1400**.

**Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):**

- **Methodology:**
  - Aggregates the **total transaction amounts** per customer per month without considering the running balance or the actual month-end balance.
  - Determines months based on the count of customers with positive **monthly transaction totals**, not necessarily positive month-end balances.
  - Computes the **average of total monthly transaction amounts** for those months.
  - Calculates the difference between these averages.

- **Result:**
  - The difference obtained is **191.8147**.

**Reasoning:**

- The task specifically asks for the **difference in average month-end balances** between the required months.
- **Candidate 1 (`0result.sql`)** correctly calculates the **running balances** to determine actual **month-end balances**, which aligns with the task's requirements.
- **Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`)** calculates based on **monthly transaction sums**, which may not accurately represent the **month-end balances** due to possible withdrawals or previous balances not accounted for within the month's transactions.
- Therefore, **`0result.sql`** provides a more accurate and appropriate solution to the problem.

**Conclusion:**

The correct SQL script that accurately addresses the task is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
```
