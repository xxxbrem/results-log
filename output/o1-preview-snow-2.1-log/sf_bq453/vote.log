After comparing the three SQL scripts and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the most appropriate and accurate SQL query for the task.

**Reasons for choosing `2result.sql`:**

1. **Accurate Chi-Squared Calculations:**
   - The chi-squared scores calculated in `2result.sql` are consistent with the expected values for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For example, the chi-squared score for the variant at position 41217379 is **2.3302**, which is a reasonable value given the observed and expected genotype counts.
   - In contrast, the chi-squared score in `1result.sql` for the same variant is **78.0191**, which is unusually high and suggests a potential error in the calculation method.

2. **Correct Expected Genotype Frequencies:**
   - `2result.sql` calculates the expected genotype counts based on the observed allele frequencies derived from the genotype data, not solely relying on the allele frequency (`AF`) provided in the dataset. This ensures that the expected counts are directly comparable to the observed counts.
   - `0result.sql` uses the allele frequency (`AF`) from the dataset to compute expected counts, which may not align with the actual genotype distribution in the sample.

3. **Consistent Methodology:**
   - The method in `2result.sql` aligns with standard practices for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium calculations. It uses observed genotype counts to calculate allele frequencies and then computes expected genotype counts from these frequencies.
   - The query ensures that both the observed and expected counts are based on the same data source.

4. **Comprehensive Data Extraction:**
   - `2result.sql` includes all required fields: reference names, start and end positions, reference and alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores, observed and expected genotype counts, and allele frequencies.
   - The query handles the necessary data transformations, such as flattening arrays and casting data types, to accurately process the genotype information.

5. **Readable and Maintained Code:**
   - The SQL code is structured with clear CTEs (Common Table Expressions) that separate data extraction, genotype counting, and calculations, making it easier to understand and maintain.
   - It uses meaningful aliases and comments to explain each step of the process.

**Conclusion:**

Given these reasons, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL script as it accurately computes the chi-squared scores and genotype counts required for the task, ensuring both correctness and reliability in the results.
