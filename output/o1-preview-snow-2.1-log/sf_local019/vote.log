After comparing the SQL queries and their results, here is the analysis:

---

**Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**

- **Approach:** Selects matches for NXT titles using a list of title IDs. Calculates the total duration in seconds by parsing the `"duration"` field. Filters matches where there was no title change (`"title_change" = 0`). Retrieves the match with the shortest duration and the names of the wrestlers involved.
- **Strengths:** Considers multiple NXT-related titles by including their IDs in the list.
- **Weaknesses:** May include matches from titles that are not strictly the NXT Championship, potentially leading to less precise results.

**Result:**
```
WRESTLER1_NAME,WRESTLER2_NAME
Bron Breakker,Duke Hudson
```

---

**Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`):**

- **Approach:** Focuses specifically on matches for the NXT Championship (`"title_id" = 23153`). Handles durations in both "MM:SS" and "HH:MM:SS" formats by calculating the total duration in seconds. Filters matches with no title change and orders them to find the shortest match. Retrieves the names of the wrestlers involved.
- **Strengths:**
  - Precisely targets the NXT Championship, ensuring that only relevant matches are considered.
  - Accurately handles different duration formats.
- **Weaknesses:** None significant; the query is precise and efficient.

**Result:**
```
WRESTLER1_NAME,WRESTLER2_NAME
Bron Breakker,Duke Hudson
```

---

**Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):**

- **Approach:** Attempts to select matches for the NXT Championship by dynamically retrieving its ID. Calculates the duration in seconds and filters for the shortest match with no title change. Retrieves wrestler names.
- **Strengths:** Dynamically retrieves the NXT Championship ID, which increases maintainability if IDs change.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Contains syntax errors:
    - `m.,` is invalid; likely intended to be `m.*` to select all columns from `m`.
    - In the `Shortest_Match` CTE, the `SELECT` statement is incomplete. It should specify which columns to select.

**Result:**
```
WRESTLER1_NAME,WRESTLER2_NAME
Bron Breakker,Duke Hudson
```

---

**Conclusion:**

While all candidates aim to find the shortest NXT Championship match without a title change and yield the same result, **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`)** is the most accurate and syntactically correct choice:

- **Precision:** Targets only the NXT Championship by using `"title_id" = 23153`, ensuring no other titles are included.
- **Robustness:** Correctly handles different duration formats (both "MM:SS" and "HH:MM:SS") by calculating total seconds.
- **Syntax:** Contains no syntax errors, ensuring the query runs successfully.
- **Efficiency:** Filters and orders data effectively to find the desired result.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
