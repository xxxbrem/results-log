After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, I recommend using `1result.sql` as the correct answer. Here's why:

- **Dynamic Best-Selling Artist Identification**: `1result.sql` dynamically calculates the best-selling artist by summing the total sales (`UnitPrice * Quantity`) for each artist and selecting the one with the highest total. This ensures the query remains accurate even if the data changes, without hardcoding any `ArtistId`.

- **Direct Join with Artists Table**: This query explicitly joins the `ARTISTS` table, making the relationship between artists and their albums clear. It enhances readability and maintainability of the SQL script.

- **Accurate Aggregation and Filtering**: By grouping the results by customer and ensuring the total amount spent is less than `$1`, it precisely fulfills the requirement of identifying customers who spent less than `$1` on the best-selling artist's albums.
