After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query.

**Reasoning:**

- The query in `2result.sql` uses `SUM(CASE WHEN "health" = 'Good' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` to count the number of trees with 'Good' health. This approach explicitly handles all records, assigning a count of `1` when the condition is met and `0` otherwise, ensuring that NULL or empty values are correctly accounted for in the denominator.
- Both queries yield the same result; however, `2result.sql` provides clearer logic by explicitly specifying the `ELSE 0` clause, making the query more robust and easier to understand.
- The calculation divides the total number of 'Good' health trees by the total number of trees in the Bronx, and then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage, rounding to four decimal places for precision.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

2result.sql
