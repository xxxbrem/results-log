After comparing the three SQL scripts and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that accurately fulfills the task requirements. Here's the reasoning:

### Task Requirements:

- **For each pizza order**, list the pizza name followed by ": ", then all the ingredients in **alphabetical order**.
- If any ingredient is ordered more than once, indicate it with '**2x**' directly in front of the ingredient without a space.
- The report should account for **multiple pizzas in the same order** and handle **exclusions** and **extras** appropriately.

### Analysis of the SQL Scripts and Results:

#### **`0result.sql` and `0result.csv`**

- **Issue with Ingredient Counts**: The ingredient counts are inflated for some orders. For example, in order ID 4, the counts for ingredients are higher than expected (e.g., `3xMushrooms`), suggesting that toppings from multiple pizzas are being aggregated incorrectly.
- **Combination of Pizzas**: It appears that toppings from different pizzas within the same order are being combined, which is not aligned with the requirement to report **per pizza** in each order.
- **Duplicated Entries**: Some orders have duplicated entries with the same pizza name and toppings, indicating possible redundancy in the results.

#### **`1result.sql` and `1result.csv`**

- **Excessive Multiplication of Ingredients**: Similar to `0result.sql`, the counts for some ingredients are excessively high. For instance, in order ID 4, ingredients like `2xBBQ Sauce` appear multiple times, which is incorrect.
- **Incorrect Handling of Exclusions and Extras**: The script seems to misinterpret how exclusions and extras should adjust the counts of ingredients, leading to inaccurate counts.
- **Aggregation Across Different Pizzas**: There's an aggregation of toppings across different pizzas in the same order, which should be avoided.

#### **`2result.sql` and `2result.csv`**

- **Accurate Ingredient Counts**: The counts of ingredients correctly reflect the number of times each topping appears for each pizza. For example, in order ID 5, `2xBacon` is shown because an extra bacon was added to the default bacon on the Meatlovers pizza.
- **Per Pizza Reporting**: Each pizza within an order is reported separately, which aligns with the requirement. Order ID 3 correctly lists both the Meatlovers and Vegetarian pizzas with their respective toppings.
- **Proper Handling of Exclusions and Extras**:
  - **Exclusions**: Ingredients that are excluded do not appear in the final list. For example, in order ID 4, `Cheese` is excluded from the Meatlovers pizza and does not appear in the ingredient list.
  - **Extras**: Additional toppings are included and counted appropriately. For instance, in order ID 9, `2xBacon` and `2xChicken` indicate that extra bacon and chicken were added.

- **Alphabetical Order**: Ingredients are listed in alphabetical order as specified.
- **No Redundancy or Over-Aggregation**: The script correctly handles multiple pizzas in the same order without combining their toppings, avoiding overcounting.

### Conclusion:

`2result.sql` produces a report that meets all the specified requirements:

- It accounts for each pizza within an order separately.
- It correctly adjusts for exclusions and extras.
- It accurately counts ingredients and uses the '2x' notation where appropriate.
- Ingredients are listed in alphabetical order.
- It avoids combining toppings from different pizzas or overcounting them.
