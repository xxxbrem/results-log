I have compared the two SQL queries and their results.

**First SQL (0result.sql):**

- Returns a list of seven strikers who scored no less than 100 runs in a match, but their team lost.
- The players are:

  - YK Pathan
  - A Symonds
  - WP Saha
  - SPD Smith
  - SR Tendulkar
  - V Kohli
  - SR Watson

These players are known to have scored centuries (100 or more runs) in IPL matches where their team did not win.

**Second SQL (1result.sql):**

- Returns a large list of strikers, many of whom did not score 100 runs in a match.
- Includes players like Harbhajan Singh, BB McCullum, KA Pollard, etc., who are unlikely to have scored 100 runs in a single IPL match that their team lost.

**Comparison and Reasoning:**

- The **first SQL** correctly aggregates the runs scored by each striker in each match, ensuring that only those who scored **no less than 100 runs** in a **single match** are selected.
- The **second SQL** likely has an issue with the aggregation or grouping, causing it to sum runs across multiple matches or not correctly filter the players who scored 100 runs in a match.
- As a result, the first SQL accurately answers the question, while the second SQL provides incorrect and inflated results.

**Conclusion:**

The **first SQL (0result.sql)** is the correct query because it accurately identifies the strikers who scored no less than 100 runs in a match but their team lost the game.
