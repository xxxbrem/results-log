After comparing the two SQL scripts, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct one.

**Reason:**

- **Scope of Variables:** In `2result.sql`, the statistical calculations (`avg_loss` and `std_dev`) are defined in the `stats` Common Table Expression (CTE) and are correctly referenced within the subqueries in the `SELECT` statement. This ensures that the average loss rate and standard deviation are properly applied when counting the items.
  
- **Subquery Usage:** By placing the `COUNT(*)` queries inside subqueries within the `SELECT` clause, `2result.sql` avoids potential issues with variable scope that can occur when using `CROSS JOIN` or combining aggregate functions without grouping.
  
- **Consistency:** The results from `2result.sql` match the expected output, providing the correct counts of items below, within, and above one standard deviation from the average loss rate.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
