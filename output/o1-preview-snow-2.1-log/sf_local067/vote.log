After comparing both SQL queries and their outputs, **`1result.sql`** is chosen as the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- Both SQL queries aim to calculate the highest and lowest profits for Italian customers segmented into ten evenly divided tiers based on their December 2021 sales profits.
- Both queries produce the same results, as evidenced by the identical CSV outputs.
- However, **`1result.sql`** uses clearer and more descriptive CTE (Common Table Expression) names, such as `"december_2021_times"` and `"sales_in_december_2021"`, which enhance the readability and understanding of each step in the query.
- The query in **`1result.sql`** follows a logical flow:
  - It first identifies Italian customers.
  - Then selects the time IDs for December 2021.
  - Filters the sales to include only those from December 2021.
  - Joins sales with costs based on multiple keys, ensuring data consistency.
  - Calculates profits for each sale and aggregates them per customer.
  - Finally, it segments customers into ten tiers and calculates the highest and lowest profits per tier.
- The consistent formatting and aliasing in **`1result.sql`** make it easier to follow the logic, which is important for maintainability and collaboration.
