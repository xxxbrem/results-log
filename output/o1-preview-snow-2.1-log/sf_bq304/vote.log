After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the most appropriate and correct SQL to solve the task.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Proper Tag Handling:**
   - **Unnesting Tags:** `1result.sql` uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` along with string manipulation functions to **split and unnest the tags** from each question into separate rows. This accurately handles questions with multiple tags.
   - **Consistent Tag Matching:** By converting tags to lowercase and matching them against a list of specified tags, it ensures **consistent and accurate tag filtering**.

2. **Efficient Filtering:**
   - **Excludes Troubleshooting Terms:** It **excludes questions containing troubleshooting terms** by applying `NOT ILIKE` filters on the `title`.
   - **Ensures 'How' Questions:** It **includes only questions where the title contains 'how'**, ensuring that the questions are relevant to the task.

3. **Retrieving Top 50 Questions Per Tag:**
   - **Partitioning and Ranking:** By using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY tag ORDER BY "view_count" DESC)`, it **ranks questions within each tag** based on view counts.
   - **Selecting Top 50:** It **selects the top 50 most viewed questions per tag** by filtering on the row number (`rn <= 50`).

4. **Ensuring Minimum Question Count:**
   - **Verification of Question Count:** Since it unpacks and filters questions before ranking, it **naturally ensures that only tags with at least 50 questions** (after filtering) will have 50 results. Otherwise, it will return as many questions as are available.

5. **Handling Multiple Tags Per Question:**
   - **Accurate Tag Association:** By unnesting, if a question has multiple tags, it will be **considered under each relevant tag**, increasing the accuracy and relevance of the results.

In contrast:

- **`0result.sql`** uses a `CROSS JOIN` with tags and matches tags using string patterns. This method is less efficient and may not handle tags as accurately, especially if there are formatting inconsistencies.
- **`2result.sql`** combines multiple queries using `UNION ALL`, which is less efficient and more cumbersome to maintain or modify.

**Therefore, `1result.sql` is the correct choice as it best fulfills the requirements of the task by efficiently and accurately retrieving the desired data.**
