After reviewing the SQL scripts and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice.

**Reason:**

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: `1result.sql` calculates the required financial metrics per item and then aggregates them per category and year. This detailed approach ensures that the calculations are precise and account for variations among individual items within each category.

- **Accurate Calculations**: It computes the average wholesale price, maximum wholesale price, minimum wholesale price, wholesale price difference, total wholesale price, total selling price, average loss rate, total loss, and profit for each category within each year, exactly as requested.

- **Proper Rounding**: All calculated values are rounded to two decimal places, adhering to the specified requirement.

- **Data Alignment**: By joining tables on both `item_code` and `Year`, it ensures data consistency and accuracy across different datasets.

Therefore, the SQL script that provides the correct analysis is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
