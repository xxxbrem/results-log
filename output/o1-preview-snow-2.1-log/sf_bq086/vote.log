After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct and most appropriate SQL query to answer the task:

**What percentage of each country's population was confirmed to have COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020?**

**Reasons:**

1. **Accurate Calculation:**
   - All three SQL queries correctly compute the percentage by dividing the cumulative confirmed cases by the population and multiplying by 100.
   - The calculation is performed using the expression:
     ```sql
     ("cumulative_confirmed" / "population") * 100
     ```
     and rounded to four decimal places with the `ROUND` function.

2. **Ordering of Results:**
   - **`0result.sql`** includes an `ORDER BY` clause that sorts the results in descending order of the percentage of confirmed cases:
     ```sql
     ORDER BY "percentage_confirmed" DESC NULLS LAST;
     ```
   - This ordering highlights the countries with the highest percentages at the top, making it easier to identify and analyze the most affected countries.

3. **Direct Relevance to the Task:**
   - Ordering by the percentage of confirmed cases directly addresses the task's requirement to understand the extent of the pandemic's impact relative to each country's population as of the specified date.
   - It provides immediate insights into which countries had the highest proportion of their population confirmed with COVID-19 by June 30, 2020.

4. **Clarity and Completeness:**
   - The query includes necessary conditions to ensure data completeness and accuracy:
     - Filters data to the specific date (`"date" = '2020-06-30'`).
     - Ensures data is at the country level (`"aggregation_level" = 0`).
     - Excludes records with `NULL` or zero population and confirmed cases.
   - The use of `NULLS LAST` in the `ORDER BY` clause ensures that countries with missing or zero percentages are listed at the end, improving data quality.

5. **Comparison with Other Queries:**
   - **`1result.sql`** orders the results by `"country_name"`, which, while useful for locating specific countries, does not prioritize the percentage information crucial to the task.
   - **`2result.sql`** does not include an `ORDER BY` clause, resulting in an unordered dataset, which may not effectively convey the needed insights.

**Conclusion:**

Given these reasons, **`0result.sql`** is the most suitable SQL query to answer the task effectively.
