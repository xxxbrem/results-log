After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **SQL 1 (`1result.sql`)** accurately calculates the population and average individual income for each zip code based on census tract data within a 5-mile radius of the specified point (47.685833°N, -122.191667°W).

  - It first selects census tracts whose centroids are within a 5-mile radius using precise geospatial functions.
  
  - It then joins these tracts with zip codes that intersect them, ensuring that all zip codes covering these tracts are included.
  
  - The **population** for each zip code is calculated by summing the populations of the intersecting census tracts.
  
  - The **average individual income** is calculated as a weighted average, using the populations of the census tracts as weights. This provides a more accurate representation compared to a simple average, especially when tracts have varying populations.

- **SQL 0 (`0result.sql`)** has limitations:

  - It selects zip codes based on whether their internal point (centroid) is within 5 miles of the specified point. This may exclude zip codes that partially lie within the radius but have centroids outside it.
  
  - It uses ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) data directly, which might not accurately represent the income variations within the census tracts intersecting the zip codes.
  
  - The average individual income is taken directly from the ZCTA data, not accounting for population variations within the tracts.

- **SQL 2 (`2result.sql`)** also has limitations:

  - It selects zip codes whose centroids are within 5 miles, similar to SQL 0, potentially missing relevant zip codes.
  
  - It calculates the average individual income as a simple average of the incomes of the intersecting census tracts, without weighting by population. This can skew the results if the tracts have significantly different populations.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the most appropriate and accurate SQL query to fulfill the task requirements.
