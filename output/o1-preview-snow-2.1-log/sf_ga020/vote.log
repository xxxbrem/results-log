After analyzing the provided SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that accurately addresses the task. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Task Requirements**:
   - **User Cohort**: Users who first engaged between August 1 and August 15, 2018.
   - **Event Types**: Quickplay event types (e.g., `level_start_quickplay`, `level_end_quickplay`, etc.).
   - **Retention Metric**: The percentage of users who performed a specific quickplay event type during their initial engagement (week 1) and were active (any event) during the second week after their initial engagement (week 2).
   - **Objective**: Identify the quickplay event type with the **lowest** user retention rate during week 2.

2. **Analysis of Each SQL Query**:

   - **`0result.sql`**:
     - Calculates retention based on users performing the **same event type** in both week 1 and week 2.
     - This approach does not align with the task, which requires checking if users were **active in any way** during week 2.
   
   - **`1result.sql`**:
     - Correctly identifies users who performed each quickplay event type during their initial engagement.
     - Calculates retention by checking if these users were **active in any way** during week 2.
     - Aligns with the task's requirement to measure overall user retention regardless of the event type in week 2.
   
   - **`2result.sql`**:
     - Appears to limit the results to only one event type, indicating a possible issue in the query logic.
     - Does not provide comprehensive results for all quickplay event types necessary to identify the one with the lowest retention rate.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - **`1result.sql`** appropriately captures the necessary data and performs the correct calculations to determine the user retention rates for each quickplay event type.
   - It identifies `level_reset_quickplay` as the event type with the lowest retention rate during the second week after initial engagement.
