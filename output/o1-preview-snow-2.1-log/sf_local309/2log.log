**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **DRIVERS**

   - `"driver_id"`: Used to join with the RESULTS and SPRINT_RESULTS tables to identify drivers.
   - `"full_name"`: Provides the full name of each driver, required for the final output.

2. **CONSTRUCTORS**

   - `"constructor_id"`: Used to join with the RESULTS and SPRINT_RESULTS tables to identify constructors.
   - `"name"`: Provides the name of each constructor, required for the final output.

3. **RESULTS**

   - `"driver_id"`: Identifies the driver in each race.
   - `"constructor_id"`: Identifies the constructor in each race.
   - `"race_id"`: Used to join with the RACES table to obtain the year.
   - `"points"`: Points scored by the driver and constructor in each race.

4. **SPRINT_RESULTS**

   - `"driver_id"`: Identifies the driver in each sprint race.
   - `"constructor_id"`: Identifies the constructor in each sprint race.
   - `"race_id"`: Used to join with the RACES table to obtain the year.
   - `"points"`: Points scored in sprint races.

5. **RACES**

   - `"race_id"`: Used to join with RESULTS and SPRINT_RESULTS tables.
   - `"year"`: The year of the race, needed to group results by year.

**Potential Conditions:**

- Joining the RESULTS and SPRINT_RESULTS tables with the RACES table on `"race_id"` to obtain the `"year"` for grouping.
- Aggregating total points per `"driver_id"` and `"year"` to determine the top-scoring driver each year.
- Aggregating total points per `"constructor_id"` and `"year"` to determine the top-scoring constructor each year.
- Joining with the DRIVERS and CONSTRUCTORS tables to retrieve the full names.

```

These queries help in understanding the structure and data distribution within the relevant tables, which is essential for solving the task. They explore the points scored by drivers and constructors, how these points are linked to specific races and years, and how the data from sprint races contributes to the total points.Query:

Task: For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the driver and constructor who scored the most points each year, we aggregate the total points for each driver and constructor per year and select the ones with the highest totals. Below is the formatted result:

```csv
Year,Driver_Full_Name,Constructor_Name
year1:int,driver_name1:str,constructor_name1:str
year2:int,driver_name2:str,constructor_name2:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
