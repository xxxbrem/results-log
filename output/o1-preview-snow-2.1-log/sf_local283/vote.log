After comparing the SQL scripts and their results, the correct SQL script is **"2result.sql"**.

**Reason:**

- **Tie-breaker Handling:** In the case where two or more teams have equal total points in a season, football leagues commonly use goal difference as a tie-breaker to determine the rankings. The script in **"2result.sql"** accounts for this by calculating the goal difference for each team and using it in the ranking.

- **Ranking Logic:** The script applies the `RANK()` function with an `ORDER BY` clause that first considers `total_points` in descending order and then `total_goal_difference` in descending order. This ensures that teams with the same total points are correctly ranked based on their goal difference.

- **Accuracy:** By incorporating goal difference into the ranking, **"2result.sql"** provides a more accurate and realistic determination of the champion teams for each season, aligning with standard practices in football leagues.

- **Consistency with League Rules:** Most football leagues use total points as the primary criterion and goal difference as the secondary criterion for league standings. This script mirrors that approach, making the results reliable.

**Other Scripts:**

- **"0result.sql"** and **"1result.sql"** do not include tie-breakers like goal difference in their ranking logic. They rely solely on total points and may arbitrarily assign rankings when teams have equal points, leading to potential inaccuracies.

Therefore, **"2result.sql"** is the correct script to identify the champion teams accurately.
