**Analysis and Comparison of the SQL Queries and Their Results:**

After reviewing and comparing the three SQL queries and their corresponding results, we can determine which SQL script correctly conducts the weekly cohort analysis for user retention as per the specified task.

**1. `0result.sql`**

- **Approach:**
  - Collects all events from July 9, 2018, to October 2, 2018.
  - Determines the first event date for each user (`first_event_per_user`).
  - Groups users into cohorts based on the week of their first event.
  - Calculates retention by comparing the cohort week to subsequent weeks in which the user had events.
- **Considerations:**
  - Uses the first event date from the available data to determine the cohort. This might not accurately represent the user's actual first app usage if their first event occurred before July 9, 2018.
  - Does not utilize the `user_first_touch_timestamp`, which records the exact timestamp of the user's first interaction with the app.
- **Results:**
  - The retention rates start relatively high (e.g., 39.62% for the first week) and decrease over time.
- **Potential Issue:**
  - By relying solely on the first event date within the data range, it may include returning users whose actual first use was prior to July 9, 2018, thus skewing the cohort assignment and retention calculations.

**2. `1result.sql`**

- **Approach:**
  - Similar to `0result.sql` but includes the `user_first_touch_timestamp` to determine cohorts.
  - Filters users whose `user_first_touch_timestamp` falls between July 9, 2018, and October 2, 2018.
  - Attempts to calculate retention based on event timestamps.
- **Considerations:**
  - Correctly uses `user_first_touch_timestamp` for cohort assignment.
  - However, the retention calculations seem to produce inconsistent or incomplete results.
- **Results:**
  - Retention rates are unusually low or missing (e.g., 5.6180% for Week 1 in the first cohort, with many blanks), indicating a possible issue in the SQL logic.
- **Potential Issue:**
  - The query might not be correctly aggregating user activity across weeks or might have misaligned joins, leading to incomplete retention data.

**3. `2result.sql`**

- **Approach:**
  - Collects all relevant user data from July 9, 2018, onwards.
  - Assigns users to cohorts based on the week of their `user_first_touch_timestamp`.
  - Calculates retention by checking if users had any activity in the subsequent weeks after their cohort week.
- **Considerations:**
  - Correctly filters and includes only users who first used the app starting from July 9, 2018.
  - Utilizes `user_first_touch_timestamp` to accurately determine users' first week of app use, aligning with the task requirements.
  - Retention is calculated based on actual user activity in Weeks 1 and 2 after their initial use.
- **Results:**
  - Retention rates are reasonable and consistent across cohorts (e.g., Week 1 retention rates around 24-29%), showing a logical decline over time.
- **Strengths:**
  - Ensures that cohorts are accurately formed.
  - Provides meaningful retention metrics that reflect user behavior.

**Conclusion:**

The SQL script in **`2result.sql`** correctly addresses the task by:

- Using `user_first_touch_timestamp` to group users by their first week of app use, ensuring accurate cohort assignments.
- Calculating retention rates based on user activity in the subsequent weeks, as required.
- Producing plausible and consistent retention rates that align with expected user behavior patterns.

**Therefore, the correct SQL script is:**
