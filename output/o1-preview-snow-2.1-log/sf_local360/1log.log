This query identifies the sessions with the fewest number of events, considering only sessions with non-empty `"search_type"`. It removes the condition of excluding sessions with `'/detail'` clicks and `'/complete'` conversions since there were no such actions found in the data. The query retrieves the `"session"`, `"path"`, and `"search_type"` for these sessions.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG`
  - **"session"**: Used to identify individual sessions.
  - **"action"**: Represents the actions performed in each session; used to check for '/detail' clicks and '/complete' conversions.
  - **"path"**: Contains the paths associated with each action; provides context for the actions.
  - **"search_type"**: Used to filter sessions with non-empty search types.
  - **"stamp"**: Timestamp of the action; may be used for ordering events chronologically.
  - **"option"**: May provide additional details about the action; potentially useful for further analysis.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Filtering sessions without '/detail' clicks and '/complete' conversions**:
  - Sessions where **"action"** does not equal '/detail' or '/complete'.
- **Considering only non-empty search types**:
  - Sessions where **"search_type"** is not `NULL` and not an empty string.
- **Identifying sessions with the fewest events**:
  - Counting the number of events per session and finding the minimum count.
- **Extracting associated paths and search types**:
  - Selecting **"path"** and **"search_type"** corresponding to the identified sessions.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Select all sessions with their actions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "action"
   FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select distinct sessions with non-empty search types:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "session"
   FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
   WHERE "search_type" IS NOT NULL AND "search_type" <> ''
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find all actions equal to '/detail' clicks:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "action"
   FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
   WHERE "action" = '/detail'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find all actions equal to '/complete' conversions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "action"
   FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
   WHERE "action" = '/complete'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **List sessions that have '/detail' clicks or '/complete' conversions:**

   ```sql

These queries progressively explore the data to understand the sessions, actions, search types, and paths relevant to the task. They help in identifying sessions that lack both '/detail' clicks and '/complete' conversions, have non-empty search types, and have the fewest number of events.Query:

Task: Identify the sessions with the fewest events lacking both '/detail' clicks and '/complete' conversions, considering only non-empty search types. If multiple sessions share the lowest count, include all of them. For each session, display the associated paths and search types.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
session,path,search_type
session1:str,path1:str,search_type1:str
session2:str,path2:str,search_type2:str
...
(Attention: include all sessions with the fewest number of events lacking both '/detail' clicks and '/complete' conversions, considering only non-empty search types.)
```

The result lists all sessions that have the minimal number of events while lacking both '/detail' clicks and '/complete' conversions, and only includes those with non-empty search types. For each session, it displays the associated paths and search types. If multiple sessions share the lowest event count under these conditions, they are all included..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LOG': {'LOG': ['ACCESS_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_IP', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE', 'ACTIVITY_LOG', 'APP1_MST_USERS', 'APP2_MST_USERS', 'DUP_ACTION_LOG', 'FORM_ERROR_LOG', 'FORM_LOG', 'INVALID_ACTION_LOG', 'MST_CATEGORIES', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20161201', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20170101', 'MST_USERS', 'MST_USERS_WITH_CARD_NUMBER', 'PRODUCT_SALES', 'PURCHASE_LOG', 'READ_LOG']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

If multiple sessions share the lowest count, include all of them. For each session, display the associated paths and search types., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
