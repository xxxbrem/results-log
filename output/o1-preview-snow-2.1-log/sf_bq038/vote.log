After comparing the three SQL queries and their corresponding results, it is clear that all three queries correctly calculate the top 10 station IDs with the highest proportion of group rides. A group ride is defined as a trip that starts and ends at the same station within a 2-minute window (i.e., `tripduration` â‰¤ 120 seconds).

**Comparison and Reasoning:**

1. **Option 0 (`0result.sql`):**
   - Uses JOIN operations between two subqueries to calculate total trips and group rides per station.
   - While it produces the correct results, the use of JOINs can be less efficient compared to aggregation functions in a single query.
   - The syntax is correct, but the method is more complex than necessary.

2. **Option 1 (`1result.sql`):**
   - Utilizes aggregation functions with a `CASE WHEN` statement to calculate group rides in a single query.
   - There is a syntax formatting issue due to misplaced parentheses in the `ROUND` function, which could lead to errors when executing the query.
   - Does not include additional ordering criteria to handle ties beyond the proportion values.

3. **Option 2 (`2result.sql`):**
   - Employs aggregation functions with a `CASE WHEN` statement similar to Option 1 but with correct syntax.
   - Orders the results by `proportion_of_group_rides` descending and then by `station_id` ascending to ensure consistent ordering, especially in cases of ties.
   - More efficient and cleaner as it avoids unnecessary JOINs and has correct formatting.

**Conclusion:**

Option 2 provides the correct and most efficient SQL query with proper syntax and ordering. Therefore, **Option 2** is the best choice.
