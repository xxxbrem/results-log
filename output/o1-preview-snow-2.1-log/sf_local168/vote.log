After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice.

**Reason:**

- The task is to find the average salary for **remote Data Analyst jobs requiring the top three most in-demand skills**.
- Based on the data provided, the top three most in-demand skills for these jobs are **'python'**, **'sas'**, and **'confluence'**.
- **`1result.sql`** correctly includes these top three skills in its `WHERE` clause:

  ```sql
  AND sd."skills" IN ('python', 'sas', 'confluence')
  ```

- **`2result.sql`** includes **'javascript'** instead of **'confluence'**, which is not among the top three for this specific subset of jobs:

  ```sql
  AND sd."skills" IN ('python', 'sas', 'javascript')
  ```

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```
