After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- Both SQL queries correctly calculate the average price per liter for each liquor category in Iowa for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.
- They both identify the top 10 categories by average price per liter in 2021 and provide the average prices for the specified years.
- The results produced by both queries are identical, indicating that both correctly implement the required logic.

**Why `2result.sql` is preferred:**

- `2result.sql` uses a more concise and efficient approach by utilizing the `CASE WHEN` statement to pivot the yearly data into columns within a single aggregation step. This method simplifies the query and enhances readability.
- By joining the filtered top categories directly and using `MAX(CASE WHEN ...)`, it avoids multiple `LEFT JOIN` operations, which can be less performant, especially with larger datasets.
- The inclusion of the condition `WHERE "volume_sold_liters" > 0` ensures that division by zero is avoided upfront, enhancing data integrity.

**Output:**
