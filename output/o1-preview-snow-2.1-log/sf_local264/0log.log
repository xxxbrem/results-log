Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine which model category (`L1_model`) appears the most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, we need to analyze the data in the relevant tables and columns.

---

**Relevant Table and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `"STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"`

   - **Column:** `"L1_model"`
     - **Potential Usage:** This column represents the model category used in each step and version. It is essential for identifying and counting different model categories (e.g., traditional models vs. Stack model).

   - **Column:** `"version"`
     - **Potential Usage:** This column indicates the version of the model. It is used to ensure that all versions are included in the analysis.

   - **Column:** `"step"`
     - **Potential Usage:** This column represents the step in the modeling process. It is used to ensure that all steps are considered in the analysis.

   - **Column:** `"name"`
     - **Potential Usage:** This column may represent the name of the model or problem. It can be used to differentiate between different models if necessary.

---

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Comparison Between Traditional Models and Stack Model:**
  - We may need to distinguish between traditional models and the Stack model based on the values in the `"L1_model"` column.
  - Conditions such as `"L1_model" = 'Stack'` for the Stack model or `"L1_model" <> 'Stack'` for traditional models can be used.

- **Ensuring All Steps and Versions Are Included:**
  - No filters on `"step"` or `"version"` are required unless we want to focus on specific steps or versions.

---

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **Query 1: List All Distinct `L1_model` Values**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "L1_model"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Query 2: Count Total Number of Records in the `MODEL` Table**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total_Records"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Query 3: Display All Records from the `MODEL` Table**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Query 4: Count Occurrences of Each `L1_model`**

   ```sql
   SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   GROUP BY "L1_model"
   ORDER BY "Count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Query 5: List All Versions and Steps for Each `L1_model`**

   ```sql
   SELECT "L1_model", "version", "step"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   ORDER BY "L1_model", "version", "step"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Query 6: Count Unique Versions for Each `L1_model`**

   ```sql
   SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(DISTINCT "version") AS "Version_Count"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   GROUP BY "L1_model"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Query 7: Count Unique Steps for Each `L1_model`**

   ```sql
   SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(DISTINCT "step") AS "Step_Count"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   GROUP BY "L1_model"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Query 8: Find Records Where `L1_model` Is Like 'Stack%'**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   WHERE "L1_model" ILIKE 'Stack%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Query 9: Find Records Where `L1_model` Is Not 'Stack' (Traditional Models)**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   WHERE "L1_model" <> 'Stack'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Query 10: Count Occurrences of Traditional Models (Excluding 'Stack')**

    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    WHERE "L1_model" <> 'Stack'
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    ORDER BY "Count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Query 11: Count Occurrences of the 'Stack' Model**

    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    WHERE "L1_model" = 'Stack'
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Query 12: Count Unique `name` Entries for Each `L1_model`**

    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(DISTINCT "name") AS "Name_Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Query 13: List Top 5 `L1_model` Categories by Total Count**

    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    ORDER BY "Count" DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

14. **Query 14: Find Distinct Combinations of `L1_model`, `version`, and `step`**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "L1_model", "version", "step"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Query 15: Find Models Used in the Latest Version**

    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", "version", "step"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    WHERE "version" = (SELECT MAX("version") FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL")
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries allow us to explore the data related to model categories (`L1_model`), their occurrences across different steps and versions, and how traditional models compare to the Stack model. By analyzing the results of these queries, we can gain insights into which model category appears most frequently and determine the total count of its occurrences.

Task: Which model category (L1_model) appears the most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, and what is the total count of its occurrences?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
L1_model,Total_Count
model_name:str,count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To identify the model category (`L1_model`) that appears most frequently across all steps and versions, we count the number of occurrences of each `L1_model` in the `MODEL` table. The one with the highest total count is the most frequently appearing model category..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKING': {'STACKING': ['EDA', 'FEATURE_IMPORTANCE', 'MODEL', 'MODEL_IMPORTANCE', 'MODEL_SCORE', 'PROBLEM', 'SOLUTION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
