After comparing both SQL scripts and their results, I have found that **both SQL statements are identical**. They each perform the following:

- Select the "L1_model" and count the total occurrences across all records in the "MODEL" table.
- Group the results by "L1_model".
- Order the results in descending order based on the total count.
- Limit the results to the top one record, effectively retrieving the model category that appears most frequently.

Since both SQL scripts achieve the same outcome and correctly identify the model category with the highest occurrence, either one can be considered the correct answer.

**Reason for choosing one over the other:**

Given that both SQL scripts are the same, I will choose **`1result.sql`** as the correct answer simply for consistency and to adhere to the naming convention.
