   WHERE "year" = 2017
   ORDER BY "net_migration" DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

6. **List countries with their net migration rates and areas for 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT b."country_name", b."net_migration", c."country_area"
   FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES b
   JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.COUNTRY_NAMES_AREA c
   ON b."country_code" = c."country_code"
   WHERE b."year" = 2017
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Find countries with net migration rates greater than 5 in 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "country_name", "net_migration"
   FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES
   WHERE "year" = 2017 AND "net_migration" > 5
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Retrieve the distinct years available in the net migration data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Get the average net migration rate for 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT AVG("net_migration") AS "average_net_migration"
   FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES
   WHERE "year" = 2017
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **List countries with area greater than 500 and their net migration rates for 2017:**

    ```sql
    SELECT b."country_name", b."net_migration", c."country_area"
    FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES b
    JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL.COUNTRY_NAMES_AREA c
    ON b."country_code" = c."country_code"
    WHERE b."year" = 2017 AND c."country_area" > 500
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Task: Which top 3 countries had the highest net migration in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers? And what are their migration rates?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The top 3 countries with the highest net migration in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers are:

```csv
country_name,net_migration
name1:str,rate1:float
name2:str,rate2:float
name3:str,rate3:float
(Attention: answer in 3 rows)
```

*Note: The net_migration values represent the net number of migrants per 1,000 population.*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL': {'CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL': ['AGE_SPECIFIC_FERTILITY_RATES', 'BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES', 'COUNTRY_NAMES_AREA', 'MIDYEAR_POPULATION', 'MIDYEAR_POPULATION_5YR_AGE_SEX', 'MIDYEAR_POPULATION_AGESPECIFIC', 'MIDYEAR_POPULATION_AGE_SEX', 'MORTALITY_LIFE_EXPECTANCY']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-19 23:28:29 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which top 3 countries had the highest net migration in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers? And what are their migration rates?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The top 3 countries with the highest net migration in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers are:

```csv
country_name,net_migration
name1:str,rate1:float
name2:str,rate2:float

(Attention: answer in 3 rows)
```

*Note: The net_migration values represent the net number of migrants per 1,000 population.* The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
