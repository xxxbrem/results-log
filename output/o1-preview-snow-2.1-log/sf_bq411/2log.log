```

This query identifies the top two Google Trends search terms for each weekday over the first two weeks in September 2024, ordered from most recent to oldest. It accounts for the empty values in the `"score"` column by using the count of occurrences of each term as a proxy for popularity.

This query removes restrictive conditions on `"rank"` and includes all available terms for the specified date range. It orders the results by date from the most recent to the oldest and by ascending rank, allowing you to identify the top terms for each week.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To identify the top two Google Trends search terms for each weekday over the first two weeks in September 2024, I need to consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task.

**Relevant Tables:**

- `"GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"`

**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- `"term"`: The search term; used to retrieve the search terms.
- `"week"`: The date of the search term activity; used to filter the dates to the first two weeks in September 2024.
- `"rank"`: The rank of the term; used to identify the top two terms for each date.
- `"score"`: The popularity score of the term; may be used to order terms if needed.
- `"dma_name"`: Designated Market Area name; could be used if filtering by specific regions is necessary.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filter `"week"` between `'2024-09-01'` and `'2024-09-14'` to get data for the first two weeks of September 2024.
- Filter `"rank" <= 2` to obtain the top two search terms.
- Order the results by `"week"` in descending order to list dates from most recent to oldest.

Below are at least 10 Snowflake SQL queries from simple to complex to explore the data:

---

**Query 1: Select all search terms and weeks.**

```sql
SELECT "term", "week"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 2: Select distinct weeks within the date range.**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "week"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
WHERE "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 3: Select terms and their ranks within the date range.**

```sql
SELECT "term", "rank", "week"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
WHERE "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 4: Select terms with rank less than or equal to 2 within the date range.**

```sql
SELECT "term", "rank", "week"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
WHERE "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14' AND "rank" <= 2
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 5: Select terms with rank less than or equal to 2, ordered by week descending.**

```sql
SELECT "term", "rank", "week"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
WHERE "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14' AND "rank" <= 2
ORDER BY "week" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 6: Select terms with rank less than or equal to 2, including scores, ordered by score descending.**

```sql
SELECT "term", "rank", "score", "week"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
WHERE "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14' AND "rank" <= 2
ORDER BY "score" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 7: Select distinct terms with their ranks and weeks.**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "term", "rank", "week"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 8: Select terms where the term contains a specific keyword within the date range.**

```sql
SELECT "term", "week"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
WHERE "term" ILIKE '%keyword%' AND "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 9: Count the number of distinct terms per week within the date range.**

```sql
SELECT "week", COUNT(DISTINCT "term") AS "number_of_terms"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
WHERE "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14'
GROUP BY "week"
ORDER BY "week" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 10: Select terms with their ranks and Designated Market Area (DMA) names within the date range.**

```sql
SELECT "week", "term", "rank", "dma_name"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
WHERE "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14' AND "rank" <= 2
ORDER BY "week" DESC, "rank" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 11: Select terms and scores, ordered by score descending within the date range.**

```sql
SELECT "term", "score", "week"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
WHERE "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14'
ORDER BY "score" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 12: Calculate the average score per week within the date range.**

```sql
SELECT "week", AVG("score") AS "average_score"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
WHERE "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14'
GROUP BY "week"
ORDER BY "week" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 13: Select terms with rank 1 for each week within the date range.**

```sql
SELECT "week", "term", "rank"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
WHERE "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14' AND "rank" = 1
ORDER BY "week" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 14: Select terms and ranks where the score is above a certain threshold within the date range.**

```sql
SELECT "term", "rank", "score", "week"
FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
WHERE "score" > 80 AND "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14'
ORDER BY "score" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Query 15: Select the top two terms per week based on score within the date range.**

```sql
SELECT "week", "term", "score"
FROM (
  SELECT "week", "term", "score",
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "week" ORDER BY "score" DESC) AS "rn"
  FROM "GOOGLE_TRENDS"."GOOGLE_TRENDS"."TOP_TERMS"
  WHERE "week" BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-14'
) sub
WHERE "rn" <= 2
ORDER BY "week" DESC, "rn" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

Task: Please identify the top two Google Trends search terms for each weekday over the first two weeks in Sept. 2024, and list them by date from most recent to oldest.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Below is the list of the top two Google Trends search terms for each weekday over the first two weeks in September 2024, listed by date from most recent to oldest.

```csv
Date,Term1,Term2
2024-09-13,term1:str,term2:str
2024-09-12,term1:str,term2:str
2024-09-11,term1:str,term2:str
2024-09-10,term1:str,term2:str
2024-09-09,term1:str,term2:str

2024-09-02,term1:str,term2:str
```
(Attention: answer in 10 rows).
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GOOGLE_TRENDS': {'GOOGLE_TRENDS': ['INTERNATIONAL_TOP_RISING_TERMS', 'INTERNATIONAL_TOP_TERMS', 'TOP_RISING_TERMS', 'TOP_TERMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
