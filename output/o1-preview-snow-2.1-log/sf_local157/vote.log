After reviewing the provided SQL queries and their corresponding results, the correct SQL that fulfills the task is **`1result.sql`**.

**Reasoning:**

- **Inclusion of All Dates:** `1result.sql` includes all dates from August 1 to August 10, 2021, even if there's no previous day's data to compare with. This means the first date (August 1) is included with a `NULL` or empty `Percentage_Change`, which is appropriate since there's no prior data for comparison.
  
- **Correct Calculation:** The SQL uses the `LAG` window function to obtain the previous day's total volume for each ticker, partitioned by `"Ticker"` and ordered by `"Date"`. This allows for accurate calculation of the percentage change.

- **Handling Division by Zero:** The use of `NULLIF` ensures that if the previous day's volume is zero (which could lead to a division by zero error), the calculation safely returns `NULL`.

- **Results Alignment:** The results in `1result.csv` match the expected output, showing the daily percentage change in trading volume for both tickers from August 1 to August 10, 2021.

- **Consistency with Requirements:** The SQL correctly filters the data to include only the specified date range and accurately calculates the percentage changes as per the task requirements.

**Conclusion:**

Option `1result.sql` effectively meets the task's criteria by providing a comprehensive and accurate calculation of the daily percentage change in trading volume for all tickers within the specified date range.
