After examining both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that `1result.sql` is the correct SQL for the task. The reasons are:

1. **Correct Table Reference**: `1result.sql` references the table `"NEW_YORK_PLUS"."NEW_YORK_TAXI_TRIPS"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2016"`, which is consistent with the expected table structure. In contrast, `2result.sql` refers to `"NEW_YORK_PLUS"."NEW_YORK_TAXI_TRIPS"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2016"`, which appears to be an incorrect or redundant table path.

2. **Consistent Data Conversion**: Both queries convert the timestamp fields to a readable format, but `1result.sql` uses division by `1e6` (`1,000,000`), which aligns with the data format mentioned in earlier observations. This ensures accurate date filtering between January 1-7, 2016.

3. **Accurate Filtering and Grouping**: Both queries apply the necessary conditions:
   - Trips where the dropoff occurs after the pickup.
   - Passenger count greater than 0.
   - Non-negative values for trip distance, tip amount, tolls amount, MTA tax, fare amount, and total amount.
   - Limiting to specified boroughs.

   However, due to the correct table reference and consistent data handling, `1result.sql` is more reliable for producing accurate results.

Therefore, based on these considerations, `1result.sql` is the correct SQL for this task.
