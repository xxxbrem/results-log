After reviewing both candidate SQL queries and their results, here's the analysis:

**Candidate SQL 0 (`0result.sql`):**

- **Query Analysis:**
  - Filters actions where the previous two actions are `'view'`.
  - Relies on the `'action'` column to determine if the user visited the `'/detail'` page.
  - Does not explicitly check if the `'/detail'` page was visited; it assumes that a `'view'` action corresponds to a `'/detail'` page visit.
- **Result:**
  - Actions: `'view'` occurred 4 times, `'add_cart'` occurred once.
- **Issue:**
  - May include `'view'` actions that are not related to the `'/detail'` page.
  - Does not accurately reflect the requirement to identify actions after two consecutive `'/detail'` page visits.

**Candidate SQL 1 (`1result.sql`):**

- **Query Analysis:**
  - Uses the `'path'` column to check for consecutive visits to the `'/detail'` page.
  - Filters sessions where `prev_path1` and `prev_path2` are `'/detail'` or `'/detail/'`.
  - Counts occurrences of the `'option'` column, which represents the user's action following the consecutive `'/detail'` visits.
- **Result:**
  - Actions:
    - `'detail'` occurred 55 times.
    - `'page'` occurred 4 times.
    - `'search'` occurred once.
- **Reasoning:**
  - Accurately reflects the requirement by checking the `'path'` for `'/detail'` visits.
  - Counts the actions (`'option'`) taken after two consecutive `'/detail'` page visits.
  - Provides the three most common actions with their occurrence counts.

**Conclusion:**

Candidate SQL 1 (`1result.sql`) correctly addresses the task by:

- Specifically checking for consecutive visits to the `'/detail'` page using the `'path'` column.
- Accurately counting the third actions that follow these visits using the `'option'` column.
- Outputting the top three actions with their occurrence counts.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

1result.sql
