Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **ACTIVITY_LOG**
   - **"session"**: Potential usage - Identify individual user sessions.
   - **"stamp"**: Potential usage - Order actions chronologically within each session.
   - **"action"**: Potential usage - Type of action performed by the user.
   - **"path"**: Potential usage - The page or URL visited by the user; crucial for identifying visits to the `/detail` page.

2. **READ_LOG**
   - **"session"**: Potential usage - Identify user sessions.
   - **"stamp"**: Potential usage - Order actions chronologically.
   - **"action"**: Potential usage - Type of action.
   - **"url"**: Potential usage - The URL visited by the user; useful for detecting `/detail` page visits.

3. **ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE**
   - **"session"**: Potential usage - Identify user sessions.
   - **"stamp"**: Potential usage - Order actions chronologically.
   - **"action"**: Potential usage - Type of action performed.
   - **"url"**: Potential usage - The URL visited by the user; necessary for finding `/detail` page visits.
   - *Note*: Contains additional irrelevant data ("noise") that may need to be filtered out.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filter records where **"path"** or **"url"** equals `'/detail'`.
- Order actions by **"stamp"** within each **"session"** to reconstruct the sequence of user actions.
- Identify sequences where a user visits the `/detail` page twice consecutively.
- Extract the third action following the consecutive `/detail` page visits.
- Count the occurrences of each third action to determine the most common ones.

Task: List the three most common third actions users take after visiting the `/detail` page twice in a row, including each action's occurrence count.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Below are the three most common third actions users take after visiting the `/detail` page twice in a row, along with the number of times each action occurred.

```csv
Action,Occurrences
action1:str,count1:int
action2:str,count2:int
action3:str,count3:int
(Attention: answer in three rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LOG': {'LOG': ['ACCESS_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_IP', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE', 'ACTIVITY_LOG', 'APP1_MST_USERS', 'APP2_MST_USERS', 'DUP_ACTION_LOG', 'FORM_ERROR_LOG', 'FORM_LOG', 'INVALID_ACTION_LOG', 'MST_CATEGORIES', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20161201', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20170101', 'MST_USERS', 'MST_USERS_WITH_CARD_NUMBER', 'PRODUCT_SALES', 'PURCHASE_LOG', 'READ_LOG']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
