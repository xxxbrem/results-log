Comparing the two SQL queries and their results:

**First SQL (`1result.sql`):**

- **Approach:**
  - Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to separately extract module names from Python and R scripts.
  - For Python scripts:
    - Handles both `import` and `from ... import ...` statements using regular expressions.
    - Extracts the module name from lines that match these patterns.
  - For R scripts:
    - Searches for `library(...)` and `require(...)` statements.
    - Extracts the package name from within the parentheses.
  - Combines the results from both Python and R modules.
  - Counts the occurrences of each module name.
  - Orders the modules by usage count in descending order.
- **Result:**
  - Provides the top 5 most frequently used module names with their usage counts:
    ```
    Module_Name,Usage_Count
    __future__,24
    os,16
    unittest,9
    numpy,9
    sys,7
    ```
  - The result seems accurate and includes commonly used Python modules.

**Second SQL (`2result.sql`):**

- **Approach:**
  - Attempts to extract module names from Python and R scripts by splitting content lines.
  - For Python scripts:
    - Extracts the second word after `import`.
  - For R scripts:
    - Attempts to extract the package name from `library(...)` and `require(...)` statements.
  - Counts the occurrences of each module name.
  - Orders the modules by usage count in descending order.
- **Result:**
  - Provides only three modules, each with a usage count of 1:
    ```
    MODULE_NAME,USAGE_COUNT
    time,1
    itertools,1
    maec,1
    ```
  - The result seems incomplete and does not capture the most frequently used modules.

**Conclusion:**

- The first SQL query (`1result.sql`) is the correct choice because:
  - It accurately extracts module names from both Python and R scripts using appropriate patterns.
  - It provides meaningful results that reflect the most frequently used modules.
  - The results include commonly used modules like `os`, `numpy`, and `sys`, which is expected.

The second SQL query (`2result.sql`) appears to be incorrect or incomplete because it does not capture the module names effectively, resulting in an incomplete list with low usage counts.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plaintext
1result.sql
```
