After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer. This SQL query efficiently calculates the total number of wins by combining home and away wins using a UNION ALL, and then sums the wins grouped by the team name. It provides a concise and accurate solution to identify the top 10 teams with the most wins across the league.
