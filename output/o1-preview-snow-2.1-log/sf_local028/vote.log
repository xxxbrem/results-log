Upon comparing both SQL queries and their results, I recommend using **SQL Query 1** (`1result.sql`) as the correct solution.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Aggregation:**
  - **SQL Query 1** groups the data by both month and year in the inner query, ensuring that the count of orders (`num_orders`) is accurate for each month within each year before performing the outer aggregation.
  - **SQL Query 2** assigns a value of `1` to `num_orders` for each row and only groups by `month_num` in the outer query. This approach relies on the outer aggregation to separate counts by year, which could be less precise if there are any discrepancies in the data.

- **Clear Structure:**
  - **SQL Query 1** provides a clearer and more robust structure by performing counts within the inner query and then aggregating those counts in the outer query. This makes the query easier to understand and maintain.
  - **SQL Query 2**, while producing similar results, may be less intuitive due to its reliance on summing rows where `num_orders` is always `1`.

- **Consistency in Results:**
  - Both queries yield similar results in this case; however, **SQL Query 1** ensures consistency and accuracy across different datasets due to its comprehensive grouping and counting mechanism.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plain
1result.sql
```
