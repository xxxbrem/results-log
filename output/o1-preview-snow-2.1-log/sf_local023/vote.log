I choose **'1result.sql'** as the correct answer because it utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to structure the query in a more organized and readable manner. The use of CTEs in '1result.sql' breaks down the problem into logical steps:

1. **season5_matches**: Identifies all matches in season 5.
2. **player_runs**: Calculates total runs scored by each player specifically in season 5.
3. **player_matches**: Counts the number of matches each player participated in during season 5.
4. **player_average**: Calculates the average runs per match for each player.

This approach enhances the clarity of the query, making it easier to understand and maintain. Both queries produce the same results, but '1result.sql' is preferred due to its readability and structured format.
