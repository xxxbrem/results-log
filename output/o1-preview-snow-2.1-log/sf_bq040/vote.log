2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

The correct SQL query is `2result.sql`. The key differences between the two SQL queries are in how they calculate the tip rate and handle the data.

**1. Tip Rate Calculation:**

- **`1result.sql`:** Calculates the tip rate as a percentage of the total amount minus the tip amount:
  ```
  Tip Rate = (tip_amount) / (total_amount - tip_amount) * 100
  ```
  This method includes additional charges (taxes, tolls, surcharges) in the denominator, which is not the standard practice for calculating tip percentages.

- **`2result.sql`:** Calculates the tip rate as a percentage of the fare amount:
  ```
  Tip Rate = (tip_amount) / (fare_amount) * 100
  ```
  This aligns with standard tipping practices, where the tip is calculated based on the fare amount before taxes and additional fees.

**2. Data Filtering and Integrity:**

- **`2result.sql`** includes additional checks to ensure data integrity:
  - It explicitly filters out trips where the `fare_amount` is not greater than zero to avoid division by zero or invalid calculations.
  - It ensures that `trip_distance` is greater than zero, which makes sense as a trip should have a positive distance.
  - It checks for `NULL` values in critical fields to prevent errors in calculations.

**3. Alignment with the Task Requirements:**

- The task specifies calculating the tip proportion based on standard tipping practices.
- **`2result.sql`** correctly calculates the tip percentage based on the fare amount, which is how tips are typically assessed.
- It provides a more accurate reflection of tipping behavior by excluding taxes, tolls, and surcharges from the tip calculation.

**Conclusion:**

`2result.sql` is the appropriate SQL query because it:

- Calculates the tip rate using the fare amount, adhering to standard tipping conventions.
- Ensures data quality by filtering out invalid or nonsensical data (e.g., zero or negative fare amounts).
- Aligns closely with the task's requirements to provide an accurate proportion of trips by tip category for each pickup borough.
