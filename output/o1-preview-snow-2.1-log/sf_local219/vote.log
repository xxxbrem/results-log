After reviewing the three SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct script for the following reasons:

1. **Inclusion of Teams with Zero Wins:**
   - **`1result.sql`** explicitly accounts for teams that may have zero wins. It does this by creating a comprehensive list of all teams in each league using the `teams_in_league` Common Table Expression (CTE). It then left joins this list with the `wins_table`, ensuring that teams without wins (i.e., teams not present in `wins_table`) are included with a win count of zero. This is achieved using the `COALESCE` function.
   - In contrast, **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** only consider teams that have at least one win, as they build their datasets based solely on matches where teams have won. This means teams with zero wins would be excluded from their results.

2. **Accurate Determination of Minimum Wins:**
   - By including all teams, **`1result.sql`** accurately identifies the team with the fewest wins in each league, even if that number is zero. This is crucial for leagues where one or more teams did not win any matches.
   - **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** might incorrectly report teams with the minimal positive win count as having the fewest wins, neglecting teams with zero wins.

3. **Robustness and Correctness:**
   - **`1result.sql`** ensures data completeness and correctness by handling all possible cases, making it the most robust solution among the three.
   - It prevents potential data omissions that could lead to inaccurate reporting.

**Therefore, the correct SQL script is:**
