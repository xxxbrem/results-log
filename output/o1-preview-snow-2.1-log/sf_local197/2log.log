Begin Exploring Related Columns
Relevant Tables and Columns:

- Table `"PAYMENT"`:
  - `"customer_id"`: used to identify payments made by each customer.
  - `"amount"`: used to calculate total payments per customer.
  - `"payment_date"`: used to group payments by month.

- Table `"CUSTOMER"`:
  - `"customer_id"`: used to join with the PAYMENT table.
  - `"first_name"`, `"last_name"`: used to obtain customer names.

Below are 10 SQL queries to explore the relevant data:

1. **Retrieve the total payment amount for each customer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_payment"
   FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
   GROUP BY "customer_id"
   ORDER BY "total_payment" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List the top 10 customers by total payment amount:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_payment"
   FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
   GROUP BY "customer_id"
   ORDER BY "total_payment" DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Get the full names of customers along with their total payments:**

   ```sql
   SELECT c."customer_id", c."first_name", c."last_name", SUM(p."amount") AS "total_payment"
   FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."CUSTOMER" c
   JOIN "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT" p ON c."customer_id" = p."customer_id"
   GROUP BY c."customer_id", c."first_name", c."last_name"
   ORDER BY "total_payment" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Display the payment dates and amounts for a specific customer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "payment_date", "amount"
   FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
   WHERE "customer_id" = 1
   ORDER BY "payment_date"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Extract the year and month from payment dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT SUBSTRING("payment_date", 1, 7) AS "year_month", "amount"
   FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate monthly total payments for each customer:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUBSTRING("payment_date", 1, 7) AS "year_month", SUM("amount") AS "monthly_total"
   FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
   GROUP BY "customer_id", "year_month"
   ORDER BY "customer_id", "year_month"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List all payment amounts per customer per month:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUBSTRING("payment_date", 1, 7) AS "year_month", "amount"
   FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
   ORDER BY "customer_id", "year_month"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Determine the maximum and minimum payment amounts per customer per month:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUBSTRING("payment_date", 1, 7) AS "year_month", MAX("amount") AS "max_payment", MIN("amount") AS "min_payment"
   FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
   GROUP BY "customer_id", "year_month"
   ORDER BY "customer_id", "year_month"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate the payment difference (max - min) per customer per month:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "customer_id", SUBSTRING("payment_date", 1, 7) AS "year_month", MAX("amount") - MIN("amount") AS "payment_difference"
   FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
   GROUP BY "customer_id", "year_month"
   ORDER BY "customer_id", "year_month"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find the maximum payment difference for each customer across all months:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "customer_id", MAX("payment_difference") AS "max_monthly_difference"
    FROM (
      SELECT "customer_id", SUBSTRING("payment_date", 1, 7) AS "year_month", MAX("amount") - MIN("amount") AS "payment_difference"
      FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
      GROUP BY "customer_id", "year_month"
    ) AS monthly_differences
    GROUP BY "customer_id"
    ORDER BY "max_monthly_difference" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help explore the data by calculating total payments, grouping payments by month, and finding payment differences, which are relevant steps toward determining which of the top 10 paying customers had the highest payment difference in any given month.Query:
SELECT "customer_id", SUM("amount") AS "total_payment"
   FROM "SQLITE_SAKILA"."SQLITE_SAKILA"."PAYMENT"
   GROUP BY "customer_id"
   ORDER BY "total_payment" DESC
   LIMIT 100;

Task: Can you determine which of our top 10 paying customers had the highest payment difference in any given month? I’d like to know the highest payment difference for this customer, with the result rounded to two decimal places.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Customer_Name,Highest_Payment_Difference
name:str,difference:float>0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

Among the top 10 paying customers, the customer with the highest payment difference in any given month is shown above, with the highest payment difference rounded to two decimal places..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'SQLITE_SAKILA': {'SQLITE_SAKILA': ['ACTOR', 'ADDRESS', 'CATEGORY', 'CITY', 'COUNTRY', 'CUSTOMER', 'FILM', 'FILM_ACTOR', 'FILM_CATEGORY', 'FILM_TEXT', 'INVENTORY', 'LANGUAGE', 'PAYMENT', 'RENTAL', 'STAFF', 'STORE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-22 23:06:58 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you determine which of our top 10 paying customers had the highest payment difference in any given month? I’d like to know the highest payment difference for this customer, with the result rounded to two decimal places., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Customer_Name,Highest_Payment_Difference
name:str,difference:float>0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

Among the top 10 paying customers, the customer with the highest payment difference in any given month is shown above, with the highest payment difference rounded to two decimal places. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
