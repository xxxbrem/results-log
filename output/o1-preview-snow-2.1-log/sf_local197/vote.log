After reviewing the SQL queries and their results, **the correct SQL query is `0result.sql`**. 

**Reasoning:**

- **Understanding the Task:** We're asked to determine which of the top 10 paying customers had the highest payment difference in any given month. The "payment difference" refers to the fluctuation in total payments from one month to another for each customer.

- **Analysis of SQL Queries:**

  - **`0result.sql`:** This query calculates the monthly total payments for each customer and then computes the difference between consecutive months using the `LAG` window function. It finds the maximum absolute difference in monthly totals for each customer, which accurately reflects the largest fluctuation in their spending between months.

  - **`1result.sql` and `2result.sql`:** These queries calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum individual payment amounts within the same month for each customer. This measures the spread of payment amounts in a month rather than the change in total spending from month to month.

- **Conclusion:** Since the task focuses on finding the highest change in total monthly spending (not the difference between individual payments), `0result.sql` correctly addresses the requirement by calculating month-over-month payment differences for each customer.

**Therefore, the correct SQL file is:**

```plaintext
0result.sql
