To determine the correct SQL query that meets the task's requirements, let's compare the three candidate SQLs and their results.

**Task Requirements:**
- Calculate the highest daily balance each customer had within each month.
- Treat any negative daily balances as zero.
- For each month, sum up these maximum daily balances across all customers to get a monthly total.
- Consider all transaction types that affect the balance (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, purchases).

**Comparison of SQL Queries:**

1. **`0result.sql`**:
   - **Adjusts Transactions**:
     - Deposits are treated as positive amounts.
     - Withdrawals are treated as negative amounts.
     - Other transaction types (e.g., purchases) are treated as zero.
   - **Issue**: Ignores 'purchase' transactions, which should decrease the balance.
   - **Result**:
     - Monthly totals are lower because 'purchase' amounts are not subtracted.
     - For example, January total: **389,803**.

2. **`1result.sql`**:
   - **Does Not Adjust Transactions**:
     - Sums up `txn_amount` without adjusting for transaction type.
   - **Issue**: All transaction amounts are considered positive, leading to inflated balances.
   - **Result**:
     - Monthly totals are significantly higher due to overestimation.
     - For example, January total: **749,697**.

3. **`2result.sql`**:
   - **Adjusts Transactions Correctly**:
     - Deposits are treated as positive amounts.
     - Withdrawals and purchases are treated as negative amounts.
   - **Calculates Cumulative Balances**:
     - Computes cumulative balances per customer, ensuring negative balances are treated as zero.
   - **Considers All Relevant Transaction Types**:
     - Accurately reflects the impact of all transaction types on the balance.
   - **Result**:
     - Monthly totals accurately represent the customers' highest daily balances.
     - For example, January total: **356,618**.

**Conclusion:**

The correct SQL query is **`2result.sql`** because it:

- Properly adjusts transaction amounts for all relevant transaction types.
- Accurately calculates cumulative balances, ensuring negative balances are zeroed out.
- Correctly identifies the highest daily balance per customer within each month.
- Provides the accurate monthly totals by summing these balances across all customers.
