After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Readability and Clarity:** `2result.sql` utilizes a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `customer_orders`, which makes the query more readable and easier to understand. By breaking down the query into logical parts, it's clearer how the data is being processed.

- **Functional Equivalence:** Both queries fetch the same results, but structuring the query with a CTE promotes better practices in SQL writing, especially for complex queries.

Therefore, the recommended SQL query is:

2result.sql
