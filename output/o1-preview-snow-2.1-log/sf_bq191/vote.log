After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct query for the following reasons:

1. **Accurate Joins**: The query in `1result.sql` correctly joins the `_2017` table (`t`), which contains repositories active in 2017, with the `SAMPLE_REPOS` table (`s`) and the `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` table (`c`). This ensures that we are selecting repositories active in 2017.

2. **Correct Conditions**:
   - It applies the condition `s."watch_count" > 30` to filter repositories with more than 30 watchers.
   - It uses `c."content" ILIKE '%Copyright (c)%'` to find repositories containing the text 'Copyright (c)' in their content. The use of `ILIKE` ensures case-insensitive matching, which is important for text searches.

3. **Selection of Required Columns**: The query selects the repository name and watch count, which aligns with the task's requirement to find the top repositories by watch count.

4. **Proper Ordering**: The query orders the results by `s."watch_count" DESC NULLS LAST`, ensuring the repositories are sorted from the highest to the lowest watch counts.

5. **Consistent Syntax**: The query uses clear and consistent SQL syntax, making it easy to understand and maintain.

6. **Produces Correct Results**: The results from `1result.sql` match the expected output, listing the top 2 repositories that meet all the criteria.

**Therefore, the most suitable SQL query is:**
