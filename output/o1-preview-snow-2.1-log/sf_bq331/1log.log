This SQL query identifies the **top three users** whose forum message scores are **closest to the average score**, based on the absolute difference between their average message scores and the overall average message score across all forum topics.

**Explanation:**

- **Handling Empty Values:** The query uses `COALESCE` to replace `NULL` values with zero (`0`) for messages that have no votes. This ensures that messages without any votes are included in the calculations as having zero votes rather than being ignored.

- **Calculating Vote Counts per Message:**

  - The inner subquery calculates the vote count for each message by counting the number of votes in the `FORUMMESSAGEVOTES` table grouped by `"ForumMessageId"`.
  - Messages without votes are accounted for using a `LEFT JOIN` with the `FORUMMESSAGES` table.

- **Calculating Average Message Score per User:**

  - The average score for each user is computed by taking the average of the vote counts (`"VoteCount"`) for all messages posted by that user.
  - Users are joined with their messages using the `USERS` and `FORUMMESSAGES` tables.

- **Calculating Overall Average Message Score:**

  - The overall average message score across all messages is calculated, including messages with zero votes.
  - This average is used to compute the absolute difference for each user.

- **Ordering and Limiting Results:**

  - The results are ordered by the `"AbsoluteDifference"` in ascending order.
  - The `TOP 3` clause ensures that only the top three users closest to the average are returned.

**Note:** By carefully handling messages with zero votes and ensuring that all messages and users are included in the calculations, this query accurately identifies the users whose message scores are closest to the overall average.

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

Begin Exploring Related Columns
First, we will identify the tables and columns that are relevant to the task:

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **USERS**
  - `"Id"`: User's unique identifier. Used to link with messages and identify users.
  - `"UserName"`: The username of the user.
  - `"DisplayName"`: The display name of the user.

- **FORUMMESSAGES**
  - `"Id"`: Message identifier. Used to link messages with votes.
  - `"PostUserId"`: The user who posted the message. Used to associate messages with users.

- **FORUMMESSAGEVOTES**
  - `"ForumMessageId"`: The ID of the message that received the vote. Used to count votes per message.
  - `"Id"`: Vote identifier. Each vote is a record, so counting votes per message.
  - `"VoteDate"`: Date when the vote was made (could be used if time filtering is needed).

**Potential Conditions and Usage:**

- **Join Conditions:**
  - Join `FORUMMESSAGES` and `FORUMMESSAGEVOTES` on `"Id"` and `"ForumMessageId"` to link messages with their votes.
  - Join `FORUMMESSAGES` and `USERS` on `"PostUserId"` and `"Id"` to link messages with the users who posted them.

- **Aggregations:**
  - Count the number of votes per message to determine message scores.
  - Calculate the average message score for each user.
  - Compute the overall average message score across all messages.
  - Calculate the absolute difference between each user's average message score and the overall average.

---

Now, here are **10 SQL queries**, from simple to more complex, to explore and understand the data:

1. **Retrieve the first 100 users to understand the user data.**

   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.USERS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve the first 100 forum messages to see message data.**

   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve the first 100 forum message votes to understand vote data.**

   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get the total number of messages posted by each user.**

   ```sql
   SELECT "PostUserId", COUNT(*) AS "TotalMessages"
   FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES
   GROUP BY "PostUserId"
   ORDER BY "TotalMessages" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get the total number of votes received by each message.**

   ```sql
   SELECT "ForumMessageId", COUNT(*) AS "VoteCount"
   FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES
   GROUP BY "ForumMessageId"
   ORDER BY "VoteCount" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Calculate the average number of votes per message (overall average message score).**

   ```sql
   SELECT AVG("VoteCount") AS "OverallAverageScore"
   FROM (
     SELECT "ForumMessageId", COUNT(*) AS "VoteCount"
     FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES
     GROUP BY "ForumMessageId"
   ) AS MessageVotes;
   ```

7. **Calculate the average message score for each user.**

   ```sql
   SELECT m."PostUserId", AVG(v."VoteCount") AS "AverageUserScore"
   FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES m
   LEFT JOIN (
     SELECT "ForumMessageId", COUNT(*) AS "VoteCount"
     FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES
     GROUP BY "ForumMessageId"
   ) v ON m."Id" = v."ForumMessageId"
   GROUP BY m."PostUserId"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Retrieve user details along with their average message scores.**

   ```sql
   SELECT u."Id" AS "UserId", u."UserName", u."DisplayName", AVG(v."VoteCount") AS "AverageUserScore"
   FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.USERS u
   JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES m ON u."Id" = m."PostUserId"
   LEFT JOIN (
     SELECT "ForumMessageId", COUNT(*) AS "VoteCount"
     FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES
     GROUP BY "ForumMessageId"
   ) v ON m."Id" = v."ForumMessageId"
   GROUP BY u."Id", u."UserName", u."DisplayName"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Calculate the absolute difference between each user's average score and the overall average score.**

   ```sql
   SELECT u."Id" AS "UserId", u."UserName", u."DisplayName",
          AVG(v."VoteCount") AS "AverageUserScore",
          ABS(AVG(v."VoteCount") - OverallAvg."OverallAverageScore") AS "AbsoluteDifference"
   FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.USERS u
   JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES m ON u."Id" = m."PostUserId"
   LEFT JOIN (
     SELECT "ForumMessageId", COUNT(*) AS "VoteCount"
     FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES
     GROUP BY "ForumMessageId"
   ) v ON m."Id" = v."ForumMessageId"
   CROSS JOIN (
     SELECT AVG("VoteCount") AS "OverallAverageScore"
     FROM (
       SELECT "ForumMessageId", COUNT(*) AS "VoteCount"
       FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES
       GROUP BY "ForumMessageId"
     ) AS MessageVotes
   ) OverallAvg
   GROUP BY u."Id", u."UserName", u."DisplayName", OverallAvg."OverallAverageScore"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Identify the users whose average message scores are closest to the overall average (ordered by absolute difference).**

    ```sql
    SELECT u."Id" AS "UserId", u."UserName", u."DisplayName",
           AVG(v."VoteCount") AS "AverageUserScore",
           ABS(AVG(v."VoteCount") - OverallAvg."OverallAverageScore") AS "AbsoluteDifference"
    FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.USERS u
    JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES m ON u."Id" = m."PostUserId"
    LEFT JOIN (
      SELECT "ForumMessageId", COUNT(*) AS "VoteCount"
      FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES
      GROUP BY "ForumMessageId"
    ) v ON m."Id" = v."ForumMessageId"
    CROSS JOIN (
      SELECT AVG("VoteCount") AS "OverallAverageScore"
      FROM (
        SELECT "ForumMessageId", COUNT(*) AS "VoteCount"
        FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES
        GROUP BY "ForumMessageId"
      ) AS MessageVotes
    ) OverallAvg
    GROUP BY u."Id", u."UserName", u."DisplayName", OverallAvg."OverallAverageScore"
    ORDER BY "AbsoluteDifference" ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Note:** These queries progressively build upon each other to gather the necessary data:

- **Queries 1-3**: Basic retrieval to understand the data structure.
- **Queries 4-5**: Aggregations to understand message and vote counts.
- **Query 6**: Calculation of the overall average message score.
- **Queries 7-8**: Calculation of each user's average message score.
- **Queries 9-10**: Calculation of the absolute difference and ordering users based on proximity to the overall average.

These SQL queries will help in extracting and understanding the data needed to identify the top three users whose forum message scores are closest to the average score, based on the absolute difference between their scores and the overall average across all forum topics.

Task: Who are the top three users whose forum message scores are closest to the average score, based on the absolute difference between their scores and the average score across all forum topics?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
UserId,UserName,DisplayName,Average_Message_Score,Absolute_Difference
user1_id:int,user1_name:str,display_name1:str,average_score1:float,difference1:float
user2_id:int,user2_name:str,display_name2:str,average_score2:float,difference2:float
user3_id:int,user3_name:str,display_name3:str,average_score3:float,difference3:float
```

We calculated the average message score for each user based on the votes their forum messages received. Then, we computed the overall average message score across all messages. The top three users listed above have average message scores closest to the overall average, based on the smallest absolute difference..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'META_KAGGLE': {'META_KAGGLE': ['COMPETITIONS', 'COMPETITIONTAGS', 'DATASETS', 'DATASETTAGS', 'DATASETTASKS', 'DATASETTASKSUBMISSIONS', 'DATASETVOTES', 'DATASOURCES', 'EPISODEAGENTS', 'EPISODES', 'FORUMMESSAGES', 'FORUMMESSAGEVOTES', 'FORUMS', 'FORUMTOPICS', 'KERNELLANGUAGES', 'KERNELS', 'KERNELTAGS', 'KERNELVERSIONCOMPETITIONSOURCES', 'KERNELVERSIONDATASETSOURCES', 'KERNELVERSIONKERNELSOURCES', 'KERNELVERSIONS', 'KERNELVOTES', 'SUBMISSIONS', 'TAGS', 'TEAMMEMBERSHIPS', 'USERACHIEVEMENTS', 'USERFOLLOWERS', 'USERORGANIZATIONS', 'USERS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 20:30:07 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Who are the top three users whose forum message scores are closest to the average score, based on the absolute difference between their scores and the average score across all forum topics?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
UserId,UserName,DisplayName,Average_Message_Score,Absolute_Difference
user1_id:int,user1_name:str,display_name1:str,average_score1:float,difference1:float
user2_id:int,user2_name:str,display_name2:str,average_score2:float,difference2:float
user3_id:int,user3_name:str,display_name3:str,average_score3:float,difference3:float
```

We calculated the average message score for each user based on the votes their forum messages received. Then, we computed the overall average message score across all messages. The top three users listed above have average message scores closest to the overall average, based on the smallest absolute difference. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
