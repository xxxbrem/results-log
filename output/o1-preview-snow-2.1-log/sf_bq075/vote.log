After comparing the two SQL queries and their respective results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here's the reasoning:

**1. Comprehensive Data Integration:**
- **Gender Categorization:** The second SQL script explicitly filters for valid gender categories (`'women'` and `'men'`) using `LOWER("gender_us") IN ('women', 'men')`, ensuring the data is accurate and relevant.
- **Industry Mapping:** It correctly maps the BLS industry names to the specified technology sectors, specifically handling `'Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals'` by renaming it to `'Internet Content Broadcasting'` for clarity.

**2. Accurate Percentage Calculations:**
- The script calculates intersectional percentages for BLS data by multiplying the gender and race percentages, providing a more precise comparison with Google's intersectional data.
- It rounds the percentages to four decimal places using `ROUND`, enhancing the readability and precision of the results.

**3. Organized and Readable Output:**
- The final output combines Google and BLS data using `UNION ALL` and orders the results by `Data_Source`, `Industry`, `Gender`, and `Race`. This structured approach allows for a straightforward comparison across data sources.
- The script ensures all necessary columns (`Data_Source`, `Industry`, `Gender`, `Race`, `Percentage`) are included and properly labeled.

**4. Consistency with User's Requirements:**
- The user requested a consolidated report focusing on the overall workforce for the year 2021, including data from Google's hiring and workforce representation initiatives, as well as BLS reports for specified technology sectors.
- `2result.sql` meets these requirements by pulling in relevant data from both Google and BLS datasets, applying appropriate filters, and aligning the industries for an accurate comparison.

**5. Correct Handling of NULL Values:**
- The script checks for `NULL` values in critical fields to ensure that only complete and meaningful data is included in the final report.

Given these reasons, **`2result.sql`** provides a more accurate, comprehensive, and user-aligned consolidated report.
