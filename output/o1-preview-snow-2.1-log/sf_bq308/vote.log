After reviewing both SQL queries and their results, **1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **1result.sql** accurately identifies the first answer to each question by using the `MIN("creation_date")` in the `first_answers` CTE (Common Table Expression). This approach ensures that we're considering only the earliest answer when determining if a question was answered within one hour.
  
- It calculates the exact time difference between the question's creation and the first answer, using `(fa.first_answer_date - q.question_creation_date) / 1000000 AS time_to_answer_seconds`. This precise calculation allows for an accurate assessment of whether the first answer was posted within one hour (3600 seconds).

- The query then counts the number of questions answered within one hour by using a condition: `COUNT(CASE WHEN qwa.first_answer_date IS NOT NULL AND qwa.time_to_answer_seconds <= 3600 THEN 1 END)`. This method ensures that only questions with answers posted within the specified time frame are counted.

- In contrast, **0result.sql** checks for the existence of any answers within one hour by counting the number of answers joined on the condition. While it generally works, it might not be as precise because it doesn't specifically focus on the first answer. It could potentially count multiple answers for the same question within the hour, although the `CASE WHEN COUNT(a."id") > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END` aims to prevent that.

- The slight discrepancies in the "Answered_Within_One_Hour" counts (e.g., 94,921 vs. 94,923 for Monday) suggest that **1result.sql** provides a more accurate result by precisely calculating the time to the first answer.

- Both queries yield very similar results, but the method used in **1result.sql** is more robust and precise for the task at hand.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plain
1result.sql
