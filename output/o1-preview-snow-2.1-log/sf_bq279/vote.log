The correct SQL is:

```plain
2result.sql
```

**Reason:**

To determine the number of distinct active and closed bike share stations for each year 2013 and 2014, we must consider the status of each station during those specific years. The key is to accurately associate each station's status with the correct year.

**Analysis of the Provided SQL Queries:**

**1. 0result.sql**

This query calculates the number of stations used in trips for each year and assumes that all other stations are closed. Here's why this approach is less accurate:

- **Assumptions Made:**
  - It assumes that stations not used in trips during a given year are closed, which may not be true.
  - It does not account for the actual status of the stations (`'active'` or `'closed'`) during those years.
  
- **Issues:**
  - The total number of stations (`ts."Total_stations"`) is fetched without considering the years 2013 and 2014. This means it includes stations that may not have existed during those years.
  - Subtracting the count of stations used in trips from the total number of stations can lead to incorrect counts of closed stations.

**Result from 0result.csv:**

```
Year,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_closed
2013,11,90
2014,47,54
```

These numbers suggest a total of 101 stations (which seems too high for the early years of the bike share program) and may not accurately reflect the actual number of active and closed stations in 2013 and 2014.

**2. 2result.sql**

This query provides a more accurate count by:

- **Steps Taken:**
  - Extracting all unique station IDs used in trips during 2013 and 2014, considering both start and end stations.
  - Joining this list with the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table to get the current status of each station.
  - Counting distinct stations marked as `'active'` and `'closed'`.

- **Considerations:**
  - Although the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table might contain the current status of stations, without historical status data, this method assumes that the current status reflects the status during 2013 and 2014.
  - Given that the `modified_date` does not contain data for 2013 and 2014, this is a reasonable approach with the available data.

**Result from 2result.csv:**

```
YEAR,Number_of_Stations_active,Number_of_Stations_closed
2013,10,1
2014,38,9
```

These results are plausible and suggest that:

- In **2013**:
  - There were **11** stations used in trips.
  - **10** stations are currently marked as `'active'`.
  - **1** station is currently marked as `'closed'`.

- In **2014**:
  - There were **47** stations used in trips.
  - **38** stations are currently marked as `'active'`.
  - **9** stations are currently marked as `'closed'`.

**Conclusion:**

- **2result.sql** provides a more accurate and realistic count of active and closed stations for the years 2013 and 2014, based on the available data.
- It directly relates station usage to their current statuses and accounts for both start and end stations.
- While recognizing the limitation that we cannot confirm the historical status due to lack of data in `modified_date`, this method offers the best possible answer given the constraints.
