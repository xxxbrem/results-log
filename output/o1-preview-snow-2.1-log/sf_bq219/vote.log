After analyzing the three provided SQL queries and their respective results, I have determined that **Option 2** (`2result.sql`) is the correct SQL query that effectively answers the task.

---

**Reasons:**

1. **Accurate Date Range Selection**:
   - **Option 2** dynamically calculates the latest month available in the dataset (`latest_month`) and then determines the start month (`start_month`) by subtracting 23 months to cover a total of 24 months (`DATEADD(month, -23, latest_month)`).
   - This ensures that the data used is always the most recent 24 months available, which aligns precisely with the task requirements.

2. **Correct Calculation of Average Monthly Percentages**:
   - The query calculates the total monthly sales and the monthly sales per category within the 24-month period.
   - It then computes each category's monthly percentage contribution to the total sales.
   - The average of these monthly percentages is calculated for each category, ensuring that only categories contributing **an average of at least 1%** are considered, as specified in the task.

3. **Precise Filtering of Categories**:
   - **Option 2** filters categories based on the calculated average monthly percentage, retaining only those that meet or exceed the 1% threshold.
   - This filtering is essential to focus the Pearson correlation calculation on the relevant categories.

4. **Comprehensive Pearson Correlation Calculation**:
   - The query pairs each of the selected categories and calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between their monthly sales percentages over the 24-month period.
   - By using `CORR(fp1.volume_percentage, fp2.volume_percentage)`, it ensures that the correlation is based on the fluctuations in sales percentages, as required.

5. **Correct Identification of Categories with Lowest Correlation**:
   - **Option 2** correctly identifies the pair of categories with the lowest (most negative) Pearson correlation coefficient.
   - The result shows that **"AMERICAN FLAVORED VODKA"** and **"CREAM LIQUEURS"** have the lowest Pearson correlation coefficient of **-0.7626**, indicating a strong inverse relationship in their sales percentages.

6. **Logical and Valid SQL Structure**:
   - The SQL query in **Option 2** is structured logically with clear and meaningful CTEs (Common Table Expressions).
   - Each step of data transformation is appropriately segmented, making the query readable and maintainable.

7. **Alignment with the Task Requirements**:
   - **Option 2** fully aligns with the task by:
     - Considering only the last 24 months of data.
     - Filtering categories based on average monthly percentage contributions of at least 1%.
     - Calculating Pearson correlation coefficients between the sales percentages of these categories.
     - Identifying the two categories with the lowest Pearson correlation coefficient.
