To determine the top 5 countries with the highest average runs per match, including their batting averages, we need to accurately calculate:

1. **Total Runs per Country**: The sum of all runs scored by players from each country.
2. **Total Matches per Country**: The total number of matches in which at least one player from the country participated.
3. **Total Dismissals per Country**: The total number of times players from each country were dismissed.

**Analysis of the Provided SQL Queries:**

**Option 0 (`0result.sql`):**

- **Total Runs**: Correctly calculated by summing runs per player and aggregating by country.
- **Total Matches**: Incorrectly calculated by counting the number of player-match records. This leads to an overestimation because if multiple players from the same country play in the same match, the match is counted multiple times for that country.
- **Average Runs per Match**: Underestimated due to inflated match counts.
- **Conclusion**: The average runs per match values are unrealistically low.

**Option 1 (`1result.sql`):**

- **Total Runs**: Correctly calculated.
- **Total Matches**: Calculated by counting the distinct match IDs from the `BALL_BY_BALL` table where players from the country batted. This counts every match where any player from the country faced a ball, which inadvertently includes almost all matches for countries like India.
- **Average Runs per Match**: Overestimated for countries with players who participate in most matches (e.g., India with 310.2201 runs per match).
- **Conclusion**: The average runs per match values are unrealistically high and skewed due to improper match counting.

**Option 2 (`2result.sql`):**

- **Total Runs**: Correctly calculated by summing all runs scored by players from each country.
- **Total Matches**: Correctly calculated by counting distinct match IDs from the `PLAYER_MATCH` table where players from the country participated. This ensures each match is counted only once per country, regardless of how many players from that country played.
- **Total Dismissals**: Correctly calculated by counting dismissals of players from each country.
- **Average Runs per Match**: Accurately reflects the total runs divided by the number of matches played by the countryâ€™s players.
- **Batting Average**: Correctly calculated as total runs divided by total dismissals.
- **Conclusion**: This approach provides a realistic and accurate calculation of average runs per match and batting average for each country.

**Decision:**

Option 2 (`2result.sql`) is the correct SQL query because it accurately calculates the total runs, appropriately counts the number of matches (ensuring each match is counted once per country), and correctly computes the batting average. The results derived are realistic and correctly identify the top 5 countries as per the task requirements.

**Output:**

2result.sql
