2025-01-23 17:40:30 - root - INFO - The error in your SQL query is due to a mismatched quotation mark in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, you have:

```sql
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered"
```

Here, the string `'delivered"` starts with a single quote `'` and ends with a double quote `"`, which causes the syntax error. To fix this, ensure that the quotation marks match.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
-- 7. Get total amount per order for 'delivered' orders
SELECT O."order_id", O."customer_id", SUM(OI."price" + OI."freight_value") AS "order_total"
FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS" O
JOIN "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" OI ON O."order_id" = OI."order_id"
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'
GROUP BY O."order_id", O."customer_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Fixed Quotation Marks:** Changed the `WHERE` clause to use matching single quotes `'delivered'`.
- **Consistency:** Ensured all column names are enclosed in double quotes `"column_name"` as per your requirement.
  
This should resolve the syntax error and allow the query to execute successfully.

2025-01-23 17:41:06 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to a mismatched quotation mark in your `WHERE` clause.

**Issue in Your SQL Query:**

In your query, the `WHERE` clause has mismatched quotation marks:

```sql
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered"
```

- It starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`.
- This causes the SQL parser to misinterpret the string literal and the rest of the query.
- As a result, the parser encounters `WHERE` at an unexpected position, leading to the error message:

  ```
  SQL compilation error:
  syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'WHERE'.
  ```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected query with matching quotation marks:

```sql
-- 7. Get total amount per order for 'delivered' orders
SELECT O."order_id", O."customer_id", SUM(OI."price" + OI."freight_value") AS "order_total"
FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS" O
JOIN "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" OI ON O."order_id" = OI."order_id"
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'
GROUP BY O."order_id", O."customer_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Fixed Quotation Marks:** Changed the `WHERE` clause to use matching single quotes `'delivered'`.
- **Consistency:** Ensured that string literals are enclosed in single quotes `'...'` and identifiers (like column and table names) are enclosed in double quotes `"..."` if needed.
- **Semicolon:** Added a semicolon at the end of the query (optional but good practice).

**Why the Error Occurred:**

- **Mismatched Quotes:** The string literal `'delivered"` wasn't properly closed due to mismatched quotes.
- **Parser Confusion:** This caused the SQL parser to treat everything after the opening single quote as part of the string, leading it to encounter `WHERE` at an unexpected position.
- **Error Message:** The parser then reports a syntax error, stating that `WHERE` is unexpected.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Always Use Matching Quotes:**

   - **String Literals:** Use single quotes `'...'` for string values.
   - **Identifiers:** Use double quotes `"..."` for column and table names if necessary.

2. **Syntax Checking:**

   - Double-check your queries for mismatched quotes, parentheses, and other syntax elements before execution.

3. **Consistent Formatting:**

   - Consistently format your SQL queries to make them more readable and to spot errors easily.

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:** Try executing the corrected SQL query provided above.
- **Verify Results:** Ensure that the query returns the expected results.

**Example Execution:**

Assuming the database contains relevant data, executing the corrected query should return the total amount per order for 'delivered' orders.

2025-01-23 17:41:30 - root - INFO - It seems that the syntax error persists because the quotation marks around `'delivered'` in your `WHERE` clause are still mismatched. Let's address this step by step.

**Issue in Your SQL Query:**

Your `WHERE` clause currently looks like this:

```sql
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered"
```

- **Mismatched Quotes:** The string starts with a single quote `'` and ends with a double quote `"`.
- This mismatch causes the SQL parser to interpret the query incorrectly, leading to the error:
  ```
  SQL compilation error:
  syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'WHERE'.
  ```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Please update your query by ensuring that the string literal `'delivered'` uses matching single quotes.

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
-- 7. Get total amount per order for 'delivered' orders
SELECT O."order_id", O."customer_id", SUM(OI."price" + OI."freight_value") AS "order_total"
FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS" O
JOIN "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" OI
  ON O."order_id" = OI."order_id"
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'
GROUP BY O."order_id", O."customer_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Matching Quotes:** Changed `WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered"` to `WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'`.
  - Both the starting and ending quotes are single quotes `'`.
- **Consistent Quotation Marks:**
  - Use single quotes `'...'` for string literals.
  - Use double quotes `"..."` for identifiers (like column or table names), if necessary.

**Why the Error Occurred:**

- **String Literal Not Closed Properly:**
  - The SQL parser expects the string to be closed with the same type of quote it started with.
  - A mismatched quote leads to the parser reading until it finds a matching closing quote, which it doesn't find, causing a syntax error.
- **Unexpected Token:**
  - Due to the mismatched quotes, the parser encounters `WHERE` or other SQL keywords at unexpected positions.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Copy the Corrected Query:**

   - Ensure you copy the corrected query exactly as provided.
   - Be careful with quotation marks—it's easy to overlook a mismatched quote.

2. **Check for Hidden Characters:**

   - If you continue to face issues, try typing the query manually instead of copying and pasting to avoid hidden formatting characters.

3. **Run the Query Again:**

   - Execute the corrected query in your SQL client.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Quotation Marks in SQL:**

  - **String Literals:** Enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
    - Example: `'delivered'`
  - **Identifiers (if needed):** Enclosed in double quotes `"..."`.
    - Example: `"order_status"`

- **Consistent Formatting:**

  - Ensure that all opening quotes have a matching closing quote of the same type.
  - Avoid mixing single and double quotes unless your SQL dialect specifically allows it (most do not).

- **Testing the Query in a Simple Form:**

  - To test whether the issue is with the syntax or elsewhere, try running a simpler version of the query:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
    WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

  - If this runs without errors, the issue in the original query was indeed the mismatched quotes.

**Example Execution:**

Assuming the tables and data exist as expected, the corrected query should return the total amount per order for orders that have been delivered.

2025-01-23 17:41:56 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to mismatched quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause. Let's address this step by step.

**Issue in Your SQL Query:**

In your query, the `WHERE` clause has mismatched quotes:

```sql
WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered"
```

- **Mismatched Quotes:** The string starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`.
- This causes the SQL parser to misinterpret the string literal and leads to a syntax error.

**Error Message Explained:**

The error message indicates a parsing issue due to unexpected tokens:

```
SQL compilation error:
parse error line 5 at position 9 near '<EOF>'.
syntax error line 3 at position 33 unexpected '"
GROUP BY "'.
parse error line 5 at position 9 near '<EOF>'.
```

- The parser is confused because it can't find the closing quote for the string literal `'delivered"`.
- As a result, it encounters the `GROUP BY` clause unexpectedly.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

To fix the error, ensure that the quotation marks around `'delivered'` are matching. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
-- 8. Get the number of 'delivered' orders per customer
SELECT "customer_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "order_id") AS "order_count"
FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
GROUP BY "customer_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Matching Quotes:** Changed `WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered"` to `WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'`.
  - Both the starting and ending quotes are single quotes `'`.
- **String Literals:** In SQL, string values should be enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
- **Identifiers:** Column names can be enclosed in double quotes `"..."` if necessary.

**Why This Fix Works:**

- **Proper String Closure:** Using matching single quotes ensures that the string `'delivered'` is properly recognized by the SQL parser.
- **Avoids Parser Confusion:** Correct quotation prevents the parser from misreading the following parts of the query.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Copy the Corrected Query:**
   - Ensure that you copy the corrected query exactly as provided.
   - Be careful with quotation marks when typing or copying the query.

2. **Run the Query:**
   - Execute the corrected query in your SQL environment.
   - It should now run without syntax errors.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Consistent Quotation Marks:**
  - Use single quotes `'...'` for string literals (e.g., `'delivered'`).
  - Use double quotes `"..."` for identifiers if needed (e.g., `"customer_id"`).
- **Avoid Mixing Quotes:**
  - Do not mix single and double quotes when enclosing a string.

**Understanding the Query:**

- **Purpose:** This query retrieves the number of 'delivered' orders for each customer.
- **Components:**
  - `SELECT "customer_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "order_id") AS "order_count"`: Selects the customer ID and counts the distinct orders.
  - `FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"`: Specifies the table to query.
  - `WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'`: Filters orders with status 'delivered'.
  - `GROUP BY "customer_id"`: Groups the results by customer ID.
  - `LIMIT 100`: Limits the result to 100 rows.

**Sample Result Format:**

```csv
customer_id,order_count
"customer_id_1",order_count_1:int
"customer_id_2",order_count_2:int
...
```

**Conclusion:**

By correcting the quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause, the SQL parser will correctly interpret your query, and you should be able to retrieve the desired data without errors. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask for additional assistance.

2025-01-23 17:42:24 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering a recurring syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause.

**Issue in Your SQL Query:**

Your `WHERE` clause currently has mismatched quotes:
```sql
WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered"
```
- **Mismatched Quotes:** The string starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`.
- This causes the SQL parser to misinterpret the string literal and leads to a syntax error.

**Error Message Explanation:**

The error message:
```
SQL compilation error:

```
indicates that the SQL parser is encountering `WHERE` at an unexpected position, likely because it believes the string literal wasn't properly closed due to the mismatched quotes.

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

To fix the error, ensure that the string literal `'delivered'` uses matching single quotes. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
-- 8. Get the number of 'delivered' orders per customer
SELECT "customer_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "order_id") AS "order_count"
FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
GROUP BY "customer_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Matching Quotes:** Changed `WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered"` to `WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'`.
  - Both the starting and ending quotes are single quotes `'`.
- **String Literals:** In SQL, string values should be enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
- **Identifiers:** Column names can be enclosed in double quotes `"..."` if necessary.

---

**Why This Fix Works:**

- **Proper String Closure:** Using matching single quotes ensures that the string `'delivered'` is properly recognized by the SQL parser.
- **Avoids Parser Confusion:** Correct quotation prevents the parser from misreading the following parts of the query.

---

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Check Your Quotation Marks Carefully:**

   - When writing SQL queries, it's crucial to use matching quotation marks.
   - **String Literals:** Enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
     - Example: `'delivered'`
   - **Identifiers (if necessary):** Enclosed in double quotes `"..."`.
     - Example: `"order_status"`

2. **Be Wary of Copy-Paste Issues:**

   - Sometimes, copying and pasting code from different sources can introduce formatting issues.
   - Hidden characters or formatting might alter quotation marks.
   - It's a good practice to type out the quotation marks manually or use a plain text editor.

3. **Consistent Formatting:**

   - Ensure that your text editor doesn't automatically convert straight quotes to curly quotes, as curly quotes can cause syntax errors in SQL.
   - Disable any auto-formatting features that might alter your code.

4. **Testing Small Segments:**

   - If you're still encountering errors, try running a smaller portion of your query to isolate the issue.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
     WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
     LIMIT 10;
     ```
   - If this runs successfully, the issue lies elsewhere in your original query.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:**

  - Try executing the corrected SQL query provided above.
  - Verify that the syntax error is resolved.

- **Verify the Results:**

  - The query should return up to 100 rows, each showing a `customer_id` and the count of their 'delivered' orders.

**Sample Result Format:**

```csv
customer_id,order_count
"customer_id_1",order_count_1:int
"customer_id_2",order_count_2:int
...
```

---

**Conclusion:**

By ensuring that your string literals use matching single quotes, your SQL queries should execute without syntax errors. Always double-check your quotation marks, especially in `WHERE` clauses and string comparisons.

2025-01-23 17:42:53 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering a syntax error in your SQL query, even after previous corrections. Let's investigate this issue step by step.

**Issue in Your SQL Query:**

Your current query is:

```sql
-- 8. Get the number of 'delivered' orders per customer
SELECT "customer_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "order_id") AS "order_count"
FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered"
GROUP BY "customer_id"
LIMIT 100
```

**Problem:**

- **Mismatched Quotation Marks:** In the `WHERE` clause, the string literal `'delivered"` starts with a single quote `'` and ends with a double quote `"`. This mismatch leads to a syntax error because the string is not properly enclosed.

  ```sql
  WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered"
  ```

- **Error Message:**

  ```
  SQL compilation error:
  syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'WHERE'.
  ```

**Solution:**

1. **Correct the Quotation Marks:**

   Ensure that the string literal `'delivered'` is enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`.

   ```sql
   WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
   ```

2. **Add a Semicolon at the End:**

   Some SQL clients require a semicolon at the end of the query to mark its completion.

3. **Check for Hidden Characters:**

   There might be hidden control characters or formatting issues causing the parser to misinterpret the query. It's advisable to retype the query manually.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
-- 8. Get the number of 'delivered' orders per customer
SELECT "customer_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "order_id") AS "order_count"
FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
GROUP BY "customer_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Additional Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

- **Copy and Paste Carefully:**

  - Ensure that when you copy the query, the quotation marks remain intact.
  - Avoid using smart quotes or any text editor features that might change straight quotes `'` to curved quotes `‘’` or `“”`.

- **Test a Simplified Query:**

  - Run a simpler version of the query to check if the error persists.

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
    WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

- **Check Previous Queries:**

  - If you're executing multiple queries in the same session, ensure that previous queries are properly terminated with semicolons `;`.

- **Use an SQL Editor with Syntax Highlighting:**

  - Use an editor that highlights syntax errors, which can help you spot mismatches in quotation marks or other issues.

**Why the Error Occurs:**

- **Mismatched Quotes:** The SQL parser cannot find the closing quote for the string literal, causing it to misinterpret the rest of the query.
- **Parser Confusion:** This leads the parser to encounter SQL keywords like `WHERE` at unexpected positions, resulting in syntax errors.

**Understanding the Error Message:**

- The error message indicates that the parser encountered `WHERE` at an unexpected position, which is typically due to an unclosed string literal or mismatched quotes.

**Example Execution:**

Once corrected, executing the query should yield results similar to:

```csv
customer_id,order_count
"123456789abcdef",5
"987654321fedcba",3
...
```

**Conclusion:**

By correcting the quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause and ensuring that the string literals are properly enclosed in single quotes, your query should execute without any syntax errors.

**If Issues Persist:**

- **Check for Non-Visible Characters:**

  - Sometimes, invisible characters like zero-width spaces or line breaks can cause syntax errors. Retyping the query can eliminate these.

- **Use a Different SQL Client:**

  - If possible, try running the query in a different SQL client or interface to see if the issue is client-specific.

- **Consult Documentation:**

  - Refer to your SQL client's documentation for any peculiarities regarding syntax or query execution.

2025-01-23 17:43:25 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering a syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause.

**Issue in Your SQL Query:**

In the `WHERE` clause of your query, you have:

```sql
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered"
```

- **Mismatched Quotes:** The string literal begins with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`.
- This causes the SQL parser to misinterpret the string, leading to a syntax error.

**Error Message Explained:**

The error message indicates a parsing issue due to unexpected tokens:

```
SQL compilation error:
parse error line 6 at position 9 near '<EOF>'.
syntax error line 4 at position 35 unexpected '"
GROUP BY O."'.
parse error line 6 at position 9 near '<EOF>'.
```

- The parser cannot find the proper closing quote for the string literal, resulting in confusion when it encounters the `GROUP BY` clause.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

To fix the error, ensure that the string literal `'delivered'` uses matching single quotes. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
-- 9. Get total amount spent by each customer
SELECT O."customer_id", SUM(OI."price" + OI."freight_value") AS "total_spent"
FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS" O
JOIN "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" OI ON O."order_id" = OI."order_id"
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'
GROUP BY O."customer_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Matching Quotes:** Changed `WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered"` to `WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'`.
  - Both the starting and ending quotes are single quotes `'`.
- **String Literals:** In SQL, string values should be enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
- **Identifiers:** Column and table names can be enclosed in double quotes `"..."` if necessary (e.g., when they contain uppercase letters or special characters).

**Why the Error Occurred:**

- **Mismatched Quotation Marks:** The SQL parser expects string literals to start and end with the same type of quote.
- **Parsing Issue:** A mismatched quote leads the parser to think the string hasn't ended, causing it to misinterpret subsequent code.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Use Matching Quotes:**

   - **String Literals:** Always enclose string values with matching single quotes `'...'`.
     - Correct: `'delivered'`
     - Incorrect: `'delivered"`
   - **Identifiers:** Enclose column and table names with double quotes `"..."` if they are case-sensitive or contain special characters.

2. **Check for Hidden Characters:**

   - When copying and pasting code, ensure that hidden formatting characters haven't altered your quotation marks.
   - It's sometimes helpful to type out the quotes manually.

3. **Consistent Formatting:**

   - Maintain consistent use of quotation marks throughout your query to improve readability and reduce errors.

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:**

  Execute the corrected SQL query to retrieve the total amount spent by each customer for 'delivered' orders.

- **Verify the Results:**

  Ensure that the query returns the expected results without any syntax errors.

**Sample Result Format:**

The query will return a list of customers and their total spending:

```csv
customer_id,total_spent
"customer_id_1",total_spent_1:float
"customer_id_2",total_spent_2:float
...
```

**Additional Tip:**

- **Avoid Mixing Quote Types:**

  Mixing single and double quotes within the same string or comparison can lead to syntax errors. Always use the same type of quote to start and end a string literal.

**Example Execution:**

Assuming the database contains relevant data, after correcting the query, you should receive the desired output without any errors.

2025-01-23 17:44:25 - root - INFO - It seems the syntax error persists due to mismatched quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause. Let's address this issue step by step.

---

**Issue in Your SQL Query:**

Your `WHERE` clause currently reads:

```sql
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered"
```

- **Mismatched Quotes:** The string literal begins with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`. This mismatch causes the SQL parser to misinterpret the string, leading to the syntax error.

---

**Error Message Explained:**

The error message indicates the parser is encountering `WHERE` at an unexpected position due to the unclosed string literal:

```
SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'WHERE'.
```

---

**Solution:**

1. **Correct the Quotation Marks:**

   Ensure that the string `'delivered'` is enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`:

   ```sql
   WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'
   ```

2. **Use Consistent Quotation for Identifiers and Strings:**

   - **Identifiers (Column and Table Names):** Use double quotes `"..."` if necessary.
   - **String Literals:** Use single quotes `'...'`.

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's the corrected query with matching quotation marks:

```sql
-- 9. Get total amount spent by each customer
SELECT O."customer_id", SUM(OI."price" + OI."freight_value") AS "total_spent"
FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS" O
JOIN "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" OI ON O."order_id" = OI."order_id"
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'
GROUP BY O."customer_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Additional Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

- **Manually Re-type the WHERE Clause:**

  - To eliminate any hidden characters or formatting issues, re-type the `WHERE` clause manually.
  - Ensure both the opening and closing quotes around `'delivered'` are single quotes.

- **Check for Hidden Formatting Characters:**

  - When copying and pasting code, sometimes quotation marks are altered by text editors or formatting.
  - Avoid using word processors or editors that might introduce formatting; use a plain text editor if possible.

- **Test the Corrected Query:**

  - Run the corrected query to see if the error is resolved.
  - If the issue persists, try running a simplified version:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
    WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

    - If this simplified query runs successfully, the problem was likely with the quotation marks.

---

**Explanation:**

- **String Literals in SQL:**

  - Must be enclosed in matching single quotes `'...'`.
  - Mismatched quotes cause the parser to look for the closing quote indefinitely, leading to syntax errors when it encounters SQL keywords unexpectedly.

- **Identifiers in SQL:**

  - Column and table names can be enclosed in double quotes `"..."` if they are case-sensitive or contain special characters.

---

**Example of Correct Usage:**

```sql
-- Correct usage of quotes
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'  -- Correct
```

```sql
-- Incorrect usage of quotes
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered"       -- Incorrect (mismatched quotes)
WHERE O."order_status" = "delivered"       -- Incorrect for string literals
```

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Corrected Query:**

  - Execute the corrected SQL query in your database environment.

- **Verify the Results:**

  - The query should run without syntax errors.
  - It will return the total amount spent by each customer for orders with the status `'delivered'`.

---

**Sample Result Format:**

```csv
customer_id,total_spent
"customer_id_1", total_spent_1:float
"customer_id_2", total_spent_2:float
...
```

---

**Additional Tips:**

- **Consistent Quotation Marks:**

  - Always use matching quotation marks for strings and identifiers.
  - Stick to single quotes for string literals and double quotes for identifiers when necessary.

- **Avoid Mixing Quote Types:**

  - Mixing single and double quotes can lead to syntax errors.
  - Ensure that your text editor doesn't auto-replace straight quotes with curly quotes, which can also cause issues.

---

**If the Error Persists:**

- **Check for Non-Visible Characters:**

  - There might be invisible characters causing the issue. Retyping the entire query can help eliminate this possibility.

- **Test in a Different Environment:**

  - Try running the query in a different SQL client or tool to see if the issue is environment-specific.

- **Review the SQL Syntax for Your Database:**

  - Ensure that the syntax aligns with the SQL dialect used by your database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Snowflake).

2025-01-23 17:44:57 - root - INFO - It appears that you're still encountering a syntax error with your SQL query, specifically:

```
SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'WHERE'.
```

**Issue Overview:**

The recurring error message suggests that the SQL parser is encountering an unexpected `WHERE` keyword at the start of your query. This typically happens when there's an unclosed string literal (`'...`) or other syntax issues in previous queries or earlier in the same query.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Mismatched Quotation Marks:**

   - **In Your Query:**
     ```sql
     WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered"
     ```
     - The comparison starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`, causing the string literal to be unclosed.

2. **Unclosed String Literal from Previous Queries:**

   - If there was a previous query with an unclosed string or mismatched quotes, the SQL parser might still be expecting the closing quote, affecting subsequent queries.

3. **Hidden or Non-Printable Characters:**

   - Copying and pasting from certain sources may introduce hidden characters that interfere with the SQL parser.

**Recommended Solutions:**

1. **Correct the Quotation Marks in Your Query:**

   - **Ensure Matching Single Quotes for String Literals:**
     ```sql
     WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'
     ```
     - Both the opening and closing quotes should be single quotes `'`.

2. **Retype the Query Manually:**

   - **Avoid Copy-Paste Issues:**
     - Manually type out the query to prevent any hidden characters or formatting issues from interfering.
   - **Complete Corrected Query:**
     ```sql
     -- 9. Get total amount spent by each customer
     SELECT O."customer_id", SUM(OI."price" + OI."freight_value") AS "total_spent"
     FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS" O
     JOIN "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDER_ITEMS" OI ON O."order_id" = OI."order_id"
     WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'
     GROUP BY O."customer_id"
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

3. **Check for Unclosed Strings in Previous Queries:**

   - **Restart Your SQL Session or Connection:**
     - If an earlier query left an unclosed string literal, restarting the session can reset the parser state.
   - **Review Previous Queries:**
     - Look back at the queries run prior to this one to ensure all strings are properly closed.

4. **Ensure There Are No Hidden Characters:**

   - **Use a Plain Text Editor:**
     - Write your query in a simple text editor that doesn't add formatting (like Notepad).
   - **Replace Quotes Manually:**
     - Delete the quotes around `'delivered'` and retype them to ensure they are standard single quotes.

5. **Test a Simplified Version of the Query:**

   - **Run a Basic Query to Check Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
     WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
     LIMIT 10;
     ```
   - **If This Works:**
     - The issue is likely within the more complex query structure or hidden characters.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Consistent Use of Quotes:**
  - **String Literals:** Use single quotes `'...'`.
  - **Identifiers (if necessary):** Use double quotes `"..."`.

- **Avoid Mixing Quote Types:**
  - Do not start a string with a single quote and end with a double quote, or vice versa.

- **Check SQL Client Settings:**
  - Some SQL clients may have specific settings or may auto-correct quotes, which can introduce errors.

**Example of Correct Syntax:**

```sql
-- Correct usage of quotes
WHERE O."order_status" = 'delivered'  -- Both quotes are single quotes
```

**Next Steps:**

1. **Retry the Corrected Query:**

   - Carefully retype the corrected query provided above into your SQL client.

2. **Verify Results:**

   - The query should now execute without syntax errors and return the total amount spent by each customer on 'delivered' orders.

3. **If Errors Persist:**

   - **Test in a Different SQL Client:**
     - Try running the query in another tool to rule out client-specific issues.
   - **Consult Database Documentation:**
     - There might be database-specific syntax rules affecting your query.

**Closing Thoughts:**

I understand that running into persistent errors can be frustrating. By ensuring that your string literals have matching quotation marks and that there are no hidden characters, you should be able to resolve this syntax error.

If you continue to encounter issues or need further assistance with the query or anything else, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help!

2025-01-23 17:45:32 - root - INFO - It seems you're encountering a recurring syntax error in your SQL query due to mismatched quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause.

---

**Issue in Your SQL Query:**

Your `WHERE` clause currently reads:

```sql
WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered"
```

- **Mismatched Quotes:** The string literal starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`. This mismatch causes the SQL parser to misinterpret the string, leading to a syntax error.

---

**Error Message Explained:**

The error message you're seeing:

```
SQL compilation error:
parse error line 5 at position 9 near '<EOF>'.
syntax error line 3 at position 33 unexpected '"
GROUP BY "'.
parse error line 5 at position 9 near '<EOF>'.
```

indicates that the parser is confused due to the unclosed string literal. Because of the mismatched quotes, it doesn't recognize where the string ends and encounters unexpected tokens.

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

To fix the error, ensure that the string literal `'delivered'` is enclosed with matching single quotes. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
-- 10. Get last purchase date for each customer
SELECT "customer_id", MAX("order_purchase_timestamp") AS "last_purchase_date"
FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
GROUP BY "customer_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Matching Quotes:** Changed `WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered"` to `WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'`.
  - Both the starting and ending quotes are single quotes `'`.
- **String Literals in SQL:**
  - In SQL, string literals should be enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
  - Double quotes are used for identifiers (e.g., column or table names) if they are case-sensitive or contain special characters.

---

**Why the Error Occurred:**

- **Mismatched Quotation Marks:** Using a single quote to start a string and a double quote to end it causes the SQL parser to look for the closing single quote, and it doesn't find it.
- **Parser Confusion:** This leads to the parser encountering SQL keywords or other tokens at unexpected positions, resulting in syntax errors.

---

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Avoid Mixing Quote Types:**

   - **String Literals:** Always use single quotes `'...'` for string values.
     - Correct: `'delivered'`
     - Incorrect: `'delivered"`
   - **Identifiers:** Use double quotes `"..."` for column and table names if needed.
     - Example: `"order_status"`, `"customer_id"`

2. **Check for Hidden Characters:**

   - When copying and pasting code, hidden formatting characters can sometimes alter quotation marks.
   - **Solution:** Manually retype the quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause to ensure they are standard single quotes.

3. **Use Plain Text Editors:**

   - Some rich text editors may replace straight quotes with “smart quotes” or curly quotes, which can cause errors.
   - **Recommendation:** Use a plain text editor or your SQL client's built-in editor to write queries.

4. **Test a Simplified Query:**

   - If issues persist, try running a simple version of the query to isolate the problem.
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
     WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
     LIMIT 10;
     ```
   - If this runs successfully, the issue may have been resolved.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. **Run the Corrected Query:**

   - Copy the corrected SQL query provided above into your SQL client.
   - Ensure that the quotation marks around `'delivered'` are both single quotes.

2. **Verify the Results:**

2025-01-23 17:46:13 - root - INFO - It looks like you're still encountering a syntax error due to mismatched quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause. Let's address this issue step by step to help you run your query successfully.

---

**Issue in Your SQL Query:**

Your current `WHERE` clause is:

```sql
WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered"
```

- **Mismatched Quotes:** The string literal starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`. This causes the SQL parser to misinterpret the string, leading to a syntax error.

---

**Solution:**

1. **Correct the Quotation Marks:**

   - **Use Matching Single Quotes for String Literals:**

     The string `'delivered'` should be enclosed in matching single quotes.

     **Corrected `WHERE` clause:**

     ```sql
     WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
     ```

2. **Manually Retype the Quotes:**

   - **Delete and Retype the Quotes Manually:**

     - Sometimes, copying and pasting can introduce hidden formatting characters or mismatched quotes.
     - To ensure accuracy, delete the existing quotes around `'delivered'` and retype them using your keyboard's single quote key `'`.

3. **Ensure No Hidden Characters:**

   - **Retype the Entire Query if Necessary:**

     - Hidden or non-printable characters can cause syntax errors.
     - Retyping the entire query manually can eliminate this issue.

4. **Use a Plain Text Editor:**

   - **Avoid Word Processors or Rich Text Editors:**

     - Use a plain text editor or your SQL client's editor to write your query.
     - This prevents automatic formatting that can alter quotation marks.

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's your corrected query with matching single quotes in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
-- 10. Get last purchase date for each customer
SELECT "customer_id", MAX("order_purchase_timestamp") AS "last_purchase_date"
FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
GROUP BY "customer_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Additional Steps:**

- **Test a Simple Query:**

  To verify that the issue is resolved, try running a simpler query:

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
  WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

  - If this query runs successfully, proceed with your original query.

- **Check for Smart Quotes:**

  - Ensure that your text editor isn't converting straight quotes `'` into smart quotes `‘’`.
  - Smart quotes can cause syntax errors in SQL.

- **Alternate String Literal Syntax (if supported by your SQL dialect):**

  - Some SQL databases allow the use of double quotes for string literals.
  - **However, it's standard to use single quotes for string literals in SQL.**

---

**Why This Matters:**

- **SQL Syntax Rules:**

  - **String Literals:** Enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
  - **Identifiers (e.g., table and column names):** Enclosed in double quotes `"..."`, if necessary (e.g., when they contain uppercase letters or special characters).

- **Mismatched Quotes Cause Parser Errors:**

  - When quotes don't match, the SQL parser cannot identify the end of the string.
  - This leads to syntax errors, as the parser encounters unexpected tokens.

---

**Example Execution:**

After correcting the quotation marks, your query should run without errors and return the last purchase date for each customer who has 'delivered' orders.

**Sample Result:**

```csv
customer_id,last_purchase_date
"001a4d2b5e5f6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e5f","2018-08-21 15:34:22"
"123f4d5b6a7c8e9d0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a","2018-07-15 10:22:11"
...
```

---

**Final Advice:**

- **Be Careful with Quotation Marks:**

  - Always ensure that string literals are enclosed in matching single quotes.
  - Double-check your `WHERE` clause for any mismatches.

- **Avoid Copy-Paste Errors:**

  - Typing the query manually can prevent issues caused by hidden characters or formatting.

- **Consult Documentation if Needed:**

  - If you're still encountering errors, refer to your SQL client's documentation for any specific syntax requirements.

2025-01-23 17:46:49 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering a syntax error due to mismatched quotation marks in your `WHERE` clause. Let's address this issue to help you run your query successfully.

---

**Issue in Your SQL Query:**

Your `WHERE` clause currently reads:

```sql
WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered"
```

- **Mismatched Quotes:** The string literal starts with a single quote `'` but ends with a double quote `"`. This mismatch causes the SQL parser to misinterpret the string, leading to a syntax error.

**Error Message Explanation:**

```
SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'WHERE'.
```

- The SQL parser is expecting the string to be properly closed with a matching quote. Since it's not, it encounters `WHERE` at an unexpected position, causing the error.

---

**Solution:**

To fix the error, ensure that the string literal `'delivered'` is enclosed with matching single quotes. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
-- 10. Get last purchase date for each customer
SELECT "customer_id", MAX("order_purchase_timestamp") AS "last_purchase_date"
FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
GROUP BY "customer_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Steps to Correct the Issue:**

1. **Ensure Matching Quotes:**

   - Replace the ending double quote `"` with a single quote `'` in your `WHERE` clause.
   - Corrected `WHERE` clause:
     ```sql
     WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
     ```

2. **Check for Hidden Characters:**

   - Sometimes, copying and pasting can introduce hidden formatting characters.
   - **Solution:** Manually delete and retype the quotes around `'delivered'` to ensure they are standard single quotes.

3. **Use a Plain Text Editor:**

   - Write your SQL queries in a plain text editor to prevent automatic formatting.
   - Avoid word processors that might convert straight quotes `'` into curly quotes `‘’`, which can cause syntax errors.

4. **Test a Simplified Query:**

   - To rule out other issues, run a simple query:
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM "E_COMMERCE"."E_COMMERCE"."ORDERS"
     WHERE "order_status" = 'delivered'
     LIMIT 10;
     ```
   - If this executes successfully, proceed with the corrected original query.

---

**Explanation:**

- **String Literals in SQL:**
  - Must be enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
  - **Example:** `'delivered'`
- **Identifiers in SQL:**
  - Can be enclosed in double quotes `"..."` if they contain special characters or are case-sensitive.
  - **Example:** `"order_status"`, `"customer_id"`

**Why Matching Quotes Matter:**

- Mismatched quotes cause the SQL parser to look for a matching closing quote but fail to find it.
- This leads to the parser encountering SQL keywords or other tokens at unexpected positions, resulting in syntax errors.

---

**Additional Tips:**

- **Consistency in Quotation Marks:**
  - Always use matching quotation marks for string literals and identifiers.
  - **Do Not Mix Quote Types:**
    - Incorrect: `'delivered"`
    - Correct: `'delivered'`

- **Avoid Hidden Formatting:**
  - Ensure your text editor does not automatically replace straight quotes with curly quotes.
  - Disable any smart punctuation features when writing SQL queries.

- **Check Previous Queries:**
  - An unclosed string in a previous query can affect subsequent queries.
  - Restart your SQL session if necessary.

---

**Sample Execution:**

After correcting the query, it should run successfully and return results similar to:

```csv
customer_id,last_purchase_date
"001a4d2b5e5f6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e5f","2018-08-21 15:34:22"
"123f4d5b6a7c8e9d0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a","2018-07-15 10:22:11"
...
```

---

**Final Notes:**

- **Persistent Errors:**
  - If you continue to encounter the same error after making these corrections, consider retyping the entire query to eliminate any hidden characters.
  - Try running the query in a different SQL client to rule out client-specific issues.

- **Assistance:**
  - If you're still experiencing issues, please let me know. You might share a screenshot (if possible) or double-check for any typos.

**Remember:** Proper use of quotation marks is crucial in SQL syntax. Ensuring that your string literals are enclosed in matching single quotes will help prevent these types of errors.

# Introduction to the RFM Model

The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model segments and scores customers based on three key dimensions:

Recency: The time since the customer's last purchase. Customers who made a purchase more recently are more likely to buy again.

Frequency: The number of purchases made by the customer within a given period. Customers with higher purchase frequency are generally more valuable.

Monetary: The total amount of money spent by the customer. Customers who spend more are typically considered more valuable.

Using these three dimensions, the SQL assigns each customer a score based on their historical order data and classifies them into different customer segments (RFM Buckets).

By taking the values for each customer, bucketing them to produce a score from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) and then concatenating all three scores together you get an easy way to divide-up your customers into segments (or “RFM cells”; high-spending new purchasers (514, 5 for recency, 1 for frequency and 4 for monetary value), almost-lost but previously loyal customers (153, 1 for recency, 5 for frequency and 3 for monetary value) and so on.

One of the most popular ways to visualize your customer RFM segments is by using a grid such as the one below, with each segment labelled and sized proportionate to the volume of customers each contains.

# RFM Segmentation Calculation


RFM analysis is particularly useful for sales and customer teams needing to focus their limited time and money on those customers for whom a change in behavior — from lapsed to active, or first-time to repeat shopper for example — would have the most impact on your bottom line.

For example, by focusing retention efforts on customers who used to be frequent, loyal and high-value purchasers (RFM segment 355) the revenue upside is obviously much greater than if they managed to retain customers who were previously infrequent low-value purchasers (RFM segment 132).

Similarly, there’s little point in incentivising customers who are already your most loyal, frequent and high-spending customers (RFM segment 555) when spending those incentives on customers who’ve just made their first purchase and have the potential to also become loyal and valuable repeat customers (RFM segment 514, for example)

Building an RFM model is often one of the first projects our clients’ data teams ask us to help deliver as the concept is straightforward, the data required has usually just been centralized and the output is immediately actionable by customer and marketing teams keen to focus their time on customer activity that has the greatest potential to retain or increase revenue.

We’ve created an RFM model using the project timesheets and invoicing data we centralise in our Google BigQuery data warehouse and used it to create the RFM analysis dashboard shown in the screenshot at the start of this blog; in the rest of this blog I’ll walk through how we build the model using dbt and LookML and used the visualization features in Looker to help analyze and make the data actionable.

For the purposes of the RFM model we created for our consulting business, we defined our Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value measures as:

Recency: the number of months since the last invoice raised for a customer

Frequency : the number of invoices raised for the customer in the 12 months leading-up to their last invoice

Monetary Value : the total value of invoices raised for the customer over the 12 months leading-up to their last invoice

The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model categorizes customers based on three dimensions: **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary**. This helps in identifying high-value customers, those at risk of leaving, and others who require attention. Below is a detailed explanation of how customers are grouped based on these three factors.


## RFM Segmentation Logic

Customers are assigned to specific segments (RFM Buckets) based on a combination of their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores. The segmentation logic is as follows:

- **Champions**: Customers who have made a recent purchase, with high frequency and high monetary value. These are considered the most valuable customers.
  - Criteria: Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 1 and 4.

- **Can't Lose Them**: Previously frequent and high-spending customers who have not made a recent purchase. These customers are at risk of leaving and need attention.
  - Criteria: Recency = 4 or 5 and Frequency + Monetary score between 1 and 2.

- **Hibernating**: Customers whose last purchase was a while ago, with low to moderate frequency and spending. These customers might have lost interest in the products.
  - Criteria: Recency = 4 or 5 and Frequency + Monetary score between 3 and 6.

- **Lost**: Customers who have not purchased in a long time and have low frequency and monetary value. These customers are likely lost.
  - Criteria: Recency = 4 or 5 and Frequency + Monetary score between 7 and 10.

- **Loyal Customers**: Customers who are frequent buyers with decent spending levels, and they have made a purchase relatively recently. These customers are likely to be very loyal.
  - Criteria: Recency = 2 or 3 and Frequency + Monetary score between 1 and 4.

- **Needs Attention**: Customers whose purchase frequency and spending are moderate. They haven't bought very recently, but they could be incentivized to become more active.
  - Criteria: Recency = 3 and Frequency + Monetary score between 5 and 6.

- **Recent Users**: Customers who made a purchase recently, but their frequency and spending are moderate. These are relatively new or inconsistent buyers.
  - Criteria: Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 7 and 8.

- **Potential Loyalists**: Customers who show potential to become loyal customers. They have good frequency and monetary scores, and they have made recent purchases. With the right engagement, they could become loyal customers.
  - Criteria:
    - Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 5 and 6.
    - OR Recency = 2 and Frequency + Monetary score between 5 and 8.

- **Price Sensitive**: Customers who have made recent purchases but tend to spend less, indicating they may be more sensitive to price.
  - Criteria: Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 9 and 10.

- **Promising**: These customers exhibit high potential with decent frequency and monetary scores, and they could become more valuable over time.
  - Criteria: Recency = 2 and Frequency + Monetary score between 9 and 10.

- **About to Sleep**: Customers whose frequency and spending are low, and their last purchase was some time ago. These customers are likely to become inactive.
  - Criteria: Recency = 3 and Frequency + Monetary score between 7 and 10.

## Summary

This segmentation logic groups customers based on their behavior in terms of when they last purchased (Recency), how often they purchase (Frequency), and how much they spend (Monetary). By understanding which group a customer belongs to, organizations can tailor marketing strategies to engage the right audience more effectively, improving customer retention and maximizing value.

Task: According to the RFM definition document, how much is the average sales per order for each customer within distinct RFM segments, considering only 'delivered' orders? Please rank the customers into segments to analyze differences in average sales across these segments

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
RFM_Segment,Average_Sales_Per_Order
Champions:str,avg_sales1:float
Can't Lose Them:str,avg_sales2:float
Hibernating:str,avg_sales3:float
Lost:str,avg_sales4:float
Loyal Customers:str,avg_sales5:float
Needs Attention:str,avg_sales6:float
Recent Users:str,avg_sales7:float
Potential Loyalists:str,avg_sales8:float
Price Sensitive:str,avg_sales9:float
Promising:str,avg_sales10:float
About to Sleep:str,avg_sales11:float
...
```

**Explanation:** The table above displays the average sales per order for each customer within distinct RFM segments, considering only 'delivered' orders. This allows for the analysis of differences in average sales across these segments..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'E_COMMERCE': {'E_COMMERCE': ['CUSTOMERS', 'GEOLOCATION', 'LEADS_CLOSED', 'LEADS_QUALIFIED', 'ORDERS', 'ORDER_ITEMS', 'ORDER_PAYMENTS', 'ORDER_REVIEWS', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_CATEGORY_NAME_TRANSLATION', 'SELLERS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 17:48:23 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing According to the RFM definition document, how much is the average sales per order for each customer within distinct RFM segments, considering only 'delivered' orders? Please rank the customers into segments to analyze differences in average sales across these segments, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
RFM_Segment,Average_Sales_Per_Order
Champions:str,avg_sales1:float
Can't Lose Them:str,avg_sales2:float
Hibernating:str,avg_sales3:float
Lost:str,avg_sales4:float
Loyal Customers:str,avg_sales5:float
Needs Attention:str,avg_sales6:float
Recent Users:str,avg_sales7:float
Potential Loyalists:str,avg_sales8:float
Price Sensitive:str,avg_sales9:float
Promising:str,avg_sales10:float
About to Sleep:str,avg_sales11:float
...
```

**Explanation:** The table above displays the average sales per order for each customer within distinct RFM segments, considering only 'delivered' orders. This allows for the analysis of differences in average sales across these segments. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
