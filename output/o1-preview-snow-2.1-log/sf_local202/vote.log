After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct and more efficient query.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Query Structure and Efficiency:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses an explicit `JOIN` between the `top_states` CTE and the `ALIEN_DATA` table, which can be more efficient than using a `WHERE IN` clause as in **`0result.sql`**.
   - Joining tables directly is generally preferred for performance optimization, especially when dealing with large datasets.

2. **Consistency and Clarity:**
   - **`2result.sql`** consistently uses quoted identifiers and aliases (`ts` for `top_states` and `ad` for `ALIEN_DATA`), enhancing readability and maintainability.
   - The query follows best practices in SQL coding style, making it clearer and easier to understand.

3. **Correctness of Results:**
   - Both queries return the same result (`number_of_states = 5`), indicating they are functionally equivalent in this context.
   - However, given the above points, **`2result.sql`** is the preferable choice.

Therefore, the correct SQL to use is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
