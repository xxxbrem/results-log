First, the tables and columns relevant to the task are:

**Table:** `FDA.FDIC_BANKS.INSTITUTIONS`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"institution_name"**: To filter institutions whose names start with 'Bank'.
- **"established_date"**: To filter institutions established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000.
- **"total_assets"**: To calculate the sum of assets for the institutions.
- **"state_name"**: To group assets by state and identify the state with the highest total assets.
- **"fdic_certificate_number"**: To count the total number of distinct banking institutions.
- **"state"**: May be used for filtering or grouping by state code.
- **Conditions that may be used:**
  - `"institution_name" LIKE 'Bank%'`: To select institutions whose names start with 'Bank'.
  - `"established_date" BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'`: To select institutions established within the specified date range.
  - `GROUP BY "state_name"`: To aggregate data by state.
  - `ORDER BY SUM("total_assets") DESC`: To identify the state with the highest sum of assets.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Select institution names starting with 'Bank':**

   ```sql
   SELECT "institution_name"
   FROM FDA.FDIC_BANKS.INSTITUTIONS
   WHERE "institution_name" LIKE 'Bank%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select institutions established between 1900 and 2000:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "institution_name", "established_date"
   FROM FDA.FDIC_BANKS.INSTITUTIONS
   WHERE "established_date" BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select institutions starting with 'Bank' established between 1900 and 2000:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "institution_name", "established_date"
   FROM FDA.FDIC_BANKS.INSTITUTIONS
   WHERE "institution_name" LIKE 'Bank%'
     AND "established_date" BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Sum of total assets for institutions starting with 'Bank' established between 1900 and 2000, grouped by state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state_name", SUM("total_assets") AS "total_assets_sum"
   FROM FDA.FDIC_BANKS.INSTITUTIONS
   WHERE "institution_name" LIKE 'Bank%'
     AND "established_date" BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   GROUP BY "state_name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **State with the highest sum of assets for qualifying institutions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state_name", SUM("total_assets") AS "total_assets_sum"
   FROM FDA.FDIC_BANKS.INSTITUTIONS
   WHERE "institution_name" LIKE 'Bank%'
     AND "established_date" BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   GROUP BY "state_name"
   ORDER BY "total_assets_sum" DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

6. **Count total number of institutions in each state:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "state_name", COUNT(DISTINCT "fdic_certificate_number") AS "total_institutions"
   FROM FDA.FDIC_BANKS.INSTITUTIONS
   GROUP BY "state_name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **List all institutions in the state with the highest sum of assets (replace 'StateName' with the actual state from query 5):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "institution_name", "fdic_certificate_number"
   FROM FDA.FDIC_BANKS.INSTITUTIONS
   WHERE "state_name" = 'StateName'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count total number of institutions in the state with the highest sum of assets:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "fdic_certificate_number") AS "total_institutions"
   FROM FDA.FDIC_BANKS.INSTITUTIONS
   WHERE "state_name" = 'StateName'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List institutions starting with 'Bank' established between 1900 and 2000 with their total assets:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "institution_name", "established_date", "total_assets"
   FROM FDA.FDIC_BANKS.INSTITUTIONS
   WHERE "institution_name" LIKE 'Bank%'
     AND "established_date" BETWEEN '1900-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Total assets of institutions in each state:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "state_name", SUM("total_assets") AS "total_assets_sum"
    FROM FDA.FDIC_BANKS.INSTITUTIONS
    GROUP BY "state_name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: What is the total number of all banking institutions in the state that has the highest sum of assets from banks established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000, with institution names starting with 'Bank'?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Total_number_of_banking_institutions
number:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine this, we identify the state with the highest total assets from banks established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000, whose names start with 'Bank'. Then, we count all banking institutions in that state regardless of their establishment date or name..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 09:25:37 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the total number of all banking institutions in the state that has the highest sum of assets from banks established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000, with institution names starting with 'Bank'?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Total_number_of_banking_institutions
number:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To determine this, we identify the state with the highest total assets from banks established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000, whose names start with 'Bank'. Then, we count all banking institutions in that state regardless of their establishment date or name. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
