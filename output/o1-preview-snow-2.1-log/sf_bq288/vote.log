The correct SQL query is `1result.sql`.

**Reasoning:**

- **Alignment with the Task Requirements:**
  
  The task requires us to find:
  
  1. **State with the highest sum of assets** from institutions:
     - Whose names start with 'Bank'.
     - Established between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2000.
     - Consider only institutions where "total_assets" is not null.

  2. **Total number of all banking institutions** (not just those starting with 'Bank' or within the date range) in that state.

- **Comparison of SQL Queries:**

  - **First SQL (`0result.sql`):**
    - Identifies the state correctly.
    - When counting institutions, it uses `COUNT(*)`, which counts all rows, potentially including multiple entries for the same institution if duplicates or multiple records exist.
    - May overcount the actual number of distinct institutions.

  - **Second SQL (`1result.sql`):**
    - Correctly identifies the state with the highest sum of assets, applying all specified conditions.
    - Counts the total number of **distinct institutions** using `COUNT(DISTINCT "fdic_certificate_number")`, ensuring each institution is counted only once.
    - Aligns precisely with the task requirement to find the total number of **all banking institutions** in that state.

  - **Third SQL (`2result.sql`):**
    - Does not include the condition `"total_assets" IS NOT NULL` when identifying the top state.
    - This deviation may lead to identifying a different state or incorrect calculation of total assets, not fully meeting the task requirements.

- **Conclusion:**

  - **`1result.sql`** is the most accurate and precise query for the task.
  - It applies all necessary conditions for identifying the correct state and counts the total number of distinct banking institutions, ensuring an accurate result.
