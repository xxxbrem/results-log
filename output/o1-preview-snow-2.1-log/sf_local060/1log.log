Task: What is the change in each product’s share of total sales in the top 20% of products (by sales), between Q4 of 2019 and 2020, in the US? Include only products with no promotions in Q4 2019 or Q4 2020, and provide results in decreasing order of the change in sales share.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the change in each product’s share of total sales among the top 20% of products (by sales) between Q4 of 2019 and Q4 of 2020 in the US, while including only products with no promotions in those periods, the results are presented below in decreasing order of the change in sales share:

```csv
Product_ID,Change_in_Sales_Share
product_id1:int,change1:float
product_id2:int,change2:float
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Product_ID**: The unique identifier for each product.
- **Change_in_Sales_Share**: The difference in the product's share of total sales between Q4 2019 and Q4 2020. This value is calculated as:
  
  \[
  \text{Change\_in\_Sales\_Share} = \left( \frac{\text{Product Sales in Q4 2020}}{\text{Total Sales in Q4 2020}} \right) - \left( \frac{\text{Product Sales in Q4 2019}}{\text{Total Sales in Q4 2019}} \right)
  \]

The products are listed in order from the greatest positive change in sales share to the least. Only products that were in the top 20% by sales and had no promotions in either Q4 2019 or Q4 2020 are included..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'COMPLEX_ORACLE': {'COMPLEX_ORACLE': ['CHANNELS', 'COSTS', 'COUNTRIES', 'CURRENCY', 'CUSTOMERS', 'PRODUCTS', 'PROMOTIONS', 'SALES', 'SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'TIMES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

This query performs the following steps:

1. **Identifies Products with Promotions:** The `products_with_promotions` CTE selects products that had promotions in Q4 2019 or Q4 2020 to exclude them from the analysis.

2. **Calculates Total Sales per Product in Each Period:** The `q4_2019_sales` and `q4_2020_sales` CTEs aggregate sales amounts for each product in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, respectively, for sales in the US without promotions.

3. **Determines the Top 20% Products:** The `q4_2019_ranked` and `q4_2020_ranked` CTEs rank products by total sales, and the `q4_2019_top_20_percent` and `q4_2020_top_20_percent` CTEs select the top 20% of products.

4. **Calculates Sales Shares:** The `q4_2019_shares` and `q4_2020_shares` CTEs calculate each product's share of total sales among the top 20% products in each period.

5. **Computes Change in Sales Share:** The `combined_shares` CTE joins the sales shares from both periods and calculates the change in sales share for each product.

6. **Returns the Final Results:** The final `SELECT` statement retrieves the product IDs and their corresponding changes in sales share, ordering the results in decreasing order of the change.

**Note:** The query ensures that only products without promotions in either Q4 2019 or Q4 2020 are included, as required.

2025-01-23 09:54:18 - root - INFO - Apologies for the confusion earlier. Based on the data you've provided, it appears that sales without promotions have a `promo_id` of `999` rather than `NULL`. Therefore, we need to adjust the query to reflect this.

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Adjusted Promotion Condition:** We changed `s."promo_id" IS NULL` to `s."promo_id" = 999` to correctly identify sales without promotions.

- **Updated Products with Promotions:** In the `products_with_promotions` CTE, we updated the condition to `s2."promo_id" <> 999` to capture products that had promotions.

- **Handled Division by Zero:** Added `NULLIF` in the division to prevent division by zero in case the total sales are zero:
  
  ```sql
  (qp.total_sales / NULLIF((SELECT total_sales FROM total_top_20_sales_2019), 0)) AS sales_share
  ```

**Note:** Ensure that the `promo_id` value representing no promotions is indeed `999`. If a different value is used in your data to indicate no promotions, please adjust the value accordingly.

This corrected query should now return the desired results. It calculates the change in each product's share of total sales among the top 20% of products (by sales) between Q4 of 2019 and Q4 of 2020 in the US, including only products with no promotions during those periods.

2025-01-23 09:54:22 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the change in each product’s share of total sales in the top 20% of products (by sales), between Q4 of 2019 and 2020, in the US? Include only products with no promotions in Q4 2019 or Q4 2020, and provide results in decreasing order of the change in sales share., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the change in each product’s share of total sales among the top 20% of products (by sales) between Q4 of 2019 and Q4 of 2020 in the US, while including only products with no promotions in those periods, the results are presented below in decreasing order of the change in sales share:

```csv
Product_ID,Change_in_Sales_Share
product_id1:int,change1:float
product_id2:int,change2:float
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Product_ID**: The unique identifier for each product.
- **Change_in_Sales_Share**: The difference in the product's share of total sales between Q4 2019 and Q4 2020. This value is calculated as:
  
  \[
  \text{Change\_in\_Sales\_Share} = \left( \frac{\text{Product Sales in Q4 2020}}{\text{Total Sales in Q4 2020}} \right) - \left( \frac{\text{Product Sales in Q4 2019}}{\text{Total Sales in Q4 2019}} \right)
  \]

The products are listed in order from the greatest positive change in sales share to the least. Only products that were in the top 20% by sales and had no promotions in either Q4 2019 or Q4 2020 are included. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

This SQL query calculates the change in each product's sales share by:

1. **Excluding Products with Promotions:** The `products_with_promotions` CTE identifies products that had promotions in Q4 2019 or Q4 2020, ensuring they are excluded from the analysis.

2. **Calculating Total Sales per Product:** The `q4_2019_sales` and `q4_2020_sales` CTEs compute total sales for each product in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, respectively, considering only sales in the US without promotions (`"promo_id" = 999`).

3. **Selecting Top 20% Products:** The `q4_2019_ranked` and `q4_2020_ranked` CTEs rank products based on total sales. The `q4_2019_top_20_percent` and `q4_2020_top_20_percent` CTEs then select the top 20% of products from each period.

4. **Calculating Sales Shares:** The `q4_2019_shares` and `q4_2020_shares` CTEs calculate each product's share of the total sales among the top 20% products in their respective periods.

5. **Computing the Change:** The `combined_shares` CTE combines the sales shares from both periods and calculates the change in sales share for each product.

6. **Presenting the Results:** The final `SELECT` statement retrieves the product IDs and the change in their sales shares, rounding the values to four decimal places and ordering the results in decreasing order.

**Note:** This query ensures that only products without promotions in both Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 are included, matching the specified criteria.
