Upon comparing the two SQL scripts, **`0result.sql`** and **`1result.sql`**, we can analyze their approach to fulfilling the task requirements and determine which one is the correct answer.

### **Comparison of SQL Scripts:**

**1. Joining Data on Sample IDs and Gene Symbols:**

- **`0result.sql`:**
  - Joins the proteomics data (`p`) with the mapping table (`m`) on `p."sample_id" = m."sample_id"`.
  - Joins the mapping table (`m`) with the RNAseq data (`r`) on `m."case_submitter_id" = r."case_barcode"` and `p."gene_symbol" = r."gene_name"`.
  - Uses `m."sample_type" = r."sample_type_name"` in the join condition.

- **`1result.sql`:**
  - Joins the proteomics data (`p`) with the mapping table (`m`) on `p."aliquot_submitter_id" = m."aliquot_submitter_id"`.
  - Joins the mapping table (`m`) with the RNAseq data (`r`) on `m."sample_submitter_id" = r."sample_barcode"` and `p."gene_symbol" = r."gene_name"`.
  - Applies `LOWER` and `TRIM` functions to standardize the sample IDs and gene symbols for consistent matching.

**2. Handling of Sample Types and Data Filtering:**

- **Both scripts** filter for `'Primary Tumor'` and `'Solid Tissue Normal'` sample types and ensure that the `primary_site` is `'Kidney'`.
- **`1result.sql`** explicitly checks for non-null and non-empty `sample_submitter_id` and uses standardized sample IDs, improving the robustness of the data join.

**3. Calculation of Correlations:**

- **Both scripts** calculate the correlation between `protein_abundance_log2ratio` and `log_fpkm` for each gene and sample type, ensuring that there are at least two data points (`HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2`).
- **They both** filter out correlations with an absolute value greater than `0.5` before computing the average correlation for each sample type.

### **Reason for Choosing `1result.sql`:**

- **Improved Matching of Sample IDs:**
  - **`1result.sql`** uses `LOWER(TRIM(...))` to standardize the sample IDs (`aliquot_submitter_id`, `sample_submitter_id`, and `sample_barcode`) and gene symbols, ensuring accurate joins even if there are discrepancies in casing or leading/trailing spaces.
  - This approach reduces the risk of missing matches due to inconsistent formatting, leading to a more reliable dataset for analysis.

- **Direct Use of Aliquot and Sample Submitter IDs:**
  - **`1result.sql`** aligns with the task requirement to join datasets on **sample submitter IDs** and **gene symbols**.
  - By joining on `aliquot_submitter_id` and `sample_submitter_id`, it directly connects the proteomics and RNAseq data through the mapping table, accurately associating the samples.

- **Consistent Filtering and Data Integrity:**
  - **`1result.sql`** ensures that all joined data have non-null and valid sample IDs and sample types before proceeding with the correlation calculations.
  - The use of explicit filtering and data standardization enhances the integrity of the analysis.

### **Conclusion:**

Based on the above analysis, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script as it more accurately fulfills the task requirements by properly joining the datasets on sample submitter IDs and gene symbols, handling data inconsistencies, and ensuring robust data matching.
