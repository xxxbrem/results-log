After comparing the SQL queries and their respective results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct and most robust SQL script for calculating the growth rates. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Use of NULLIF Function**: `1result.sql` incorporates the `NULLIF` function in the denominator of each growth rate calculation. This function prevents division by zero errors by returning `NULL` if the base value is zero. This ensures the query executes without errors even if any of the base values are zero.

   ```sql
   ROUND((("race_asian_2024" - "race_asian_2014") / NULLIF("race_asian_2014", 0)) * 100, 4) AS "Asian_Growth_Rate",
   ```

2. **Consistent and Accurate Results**: The growth rates calculated in `1result.sql` match those in the other queries, ensuring the accuracy of the results.

3. **Clear and Maintainable Code**: The query clearly labels each alias and maintains consistent naming conventions, making it easier to read and maintain.

4. **Proper Filtering of Data**: The script correctly filters data for the workforce category `'overall'` and the years 2014 and 2024.

Considering these points, **`1result.sql`** is the preferred choice for calculating the growth rates safely and accurately.
