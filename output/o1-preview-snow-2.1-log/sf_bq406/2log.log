Task: Please calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Asian_Growth_Rate,Black_Growth_Rate,Latinx_Growth_Rate,Native_American_Growth_Rate,White_Growth_Rate,US_Women_Growth_Rate,US_Men_Growth_Rate,Global_Women_Growth_Rate,Global_Men_Growth_Rate
rate1:float in [0,100],rate2:float in [0,100],rate3:float in [0,100],rate4:float in [0,100],rate5:float in [0,100],rate6:float in [0,100],rate7:float in [0,100],rate8:float in [0,100],rate9:float in [0,100]
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The growth rates for the specified demographic groups from 2014 to the latest available year are calculated as the percentage change in their representation concerning the overall workforce during this period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 13:42:05 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Please calculate the growth rates for Asians, Black people, Latinx people, Native Americans, White people, US women, US men, global women, and global men from 2014 to 2024 concerning the overall workforce., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Asian_Growth_Rate,Black_Growth_Rate,Latinx_Growth_Rate,Native_American_Growth_Rate,White_Growth_Rate,US_Women_Growth_Rate,US_Men_Growth_Rate,Global_Women_Growth_Rate,Global_Men_Growth_Rate

(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The growth rates for the specified demographic groups from 2014 to the latest available year are calculated as the percentage change in their representation concerning the overall workforce during this period. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
