After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I recommend using `1result.sql` as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Focus on Images with URLs:** The task specifically asks for a count of how many **image URLs** are categorized as 'cat' and how many contain no such cat labels. The query in `1result.sql` includes a condition to ensure that only images with valid URLs are considered:

  ```sql
  WHERE images."original_url" IS NOT NULL AND images."original_url" != ''
  ```

  This aligns with the task requirement by filtering out images that do not have URLs, ensuring accurate counts based on available image URLs.

- **Accurate Categorization:** The query correctly categorizes images as 'Cat' if they have the label '/m/01yrx' with full confidence (`confidence = 1.0`), and as 'Other' if they do not. It achieves this by performing a `LEFT JOIN` between the `IMAGES` and `LABELS` tables and checking if the `image_id` from the labels subquery is `NULL`.

- **Efficient and Clear SQL Structure:** The query uses SQL best practices by utilizing a subquery to select the relevant `image_id`s from the `LABELS` table, then joins them efficiently. This makes the query clear and optimized for performance.

**Therefore, the suitable SQL query is:**

1result.sql
