After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Unnecessary Concatenation in `1result.sql`:**
   - In `1result.sql`, the difference in average output values is concatenated with a '+' sign:
     ```sql
     '+' || ROUND(ABS(t."Avg_Output_Value_Transactions" - o."Avg_Output_Value_Outputs"), 4)
     ```
     This concatenation is unnecessary because the `ABS()` function always returns a non-negative value. Adding a '+' sign to a positive number does not add meaningful information and can complicate further data processing or interpretation.

   - In `0result.sql`, the difference is calculated and presented as a numeric value without any additional characters:
     ```sql
     ROUND(ABS(o."Average_Output_Value" - t."Average_Output_Value"), 4)
     ```
     This approach is cleaner and more appropriate for numerical analysis.

2. **Clarity and Consistency in Alias Naming:**
   - In `0result.sql`, the aliases used for average output values are consistent (`"Average_Output_Value"`), and any potential confusion is avoided by qualifying them with the table aliases (`o.` and `t.`):
     ```sql
     o."Average_Output_Value" - t."Average_Output_Value"
     ```
   - In `1result.sql`, different aliases are used (`"Avg_Output_Value_Transactions"` and `"Avg_Output_Value_Outputs"`), which is acceptable, but the inclusion of the '+' sign detracts from the clarity.

3. **Data Representation and Usability:**
   - The output from `0result.sql` provides numerical values that are ready for further computation, charting, or reporting without the need to parse out any extra characters.
   - Including a '+' sign in `1result.sql` can lead to issues in data processing, especially if the results are exported to CSV or used in software that expects pure numeric values.

4. **Focus on Relevant Information:**
   - The task is to determine the annual differences in average output values. `0result.sql` directly calculates and presents these differences without unnecessary embellishments.
   - `1result.sql` introduces an additional character that does not contribute meaningfully to the analysis.

**Conclusion:**

For the reasons above, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script as it effectively calculates the required differences and presents the results in a clear, concise, and usable format.
