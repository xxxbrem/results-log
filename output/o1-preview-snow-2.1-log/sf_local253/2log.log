**Relevant Table:**

- **Table Name:** SALARYDATASET (in "EDUCATION_BUSINESS"."EDUCATION_BUSINESS")

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"CompanyName"**: Used to identify companies and calculate average salaries per company.
- **"Location"**: Used to filter records for specific locations (Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, Hyderabad) and include location in the report.
- **"Salary"**: Contains salary information in VARCHAR format; used to calculate average salaries. May need to process or extract numeric values for computation.
- **"SalariesReported"**: Could be used to determine the number of salaries reported for weighting averages, if necessary.
- **"JobTitle"**: May not be directly relevant unless filtering by job title.

**Possible Conditions:**

- Filtering "Location" to include only Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad.
- Handling "Salary" values to extract numeric amounts.
- Filtering out null or invalid "Salary" entries.
- Using string matching with "Location" and "CompanyName" using `ILIKE` and `'%'` for pattern matching.

Task: For the salary dataset, create a detailed SQL report that compares the top 5 companies by average salary in Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad to the national average salary. The report should include the following columns: Location, Company Name, Average Salary in State, and Average Salary in Country.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Location,Company Name,Average Salary in State,Average Salary in Country
Mumbai,company1:str,average_salary_state1:float,average_salary_country1:float
Pune,company2:str,average_salary_state2:float,average_salary_country2:float
...
```

This report compares the top 5 companies by average salary in Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad to the national average salary. It includes the location, company name, average salary in the state, and average salary across the country..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': {'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': ['HARDWARE_DIM_CUSTOMER', 'HARDWARE_DIM_PRODUCT', 'HARDWARE_FACT_GROSS_PRICE', 'HARDWARE_FACT_MANUFACTURING_COST', 'HARDWARE_FACT_PRE_INVOICE_DEDUCTIONS', 'HARDWARE_FACT_SALES_MONTHLY', 'SALARYDATASET', 'STAFFHOURS', 'UNIVERSITY_COURSE', 'UNIVERSITY_ENROLLMENT', 'UNIVERSITY_FACULTY', 'UNIVERSITY_OFFERING', 'UNIVERSITY_STUDENT', 'WEB_ACCOUNTS', 'WEB_EVENTS', 'WEB_ORDERS', 'WEB_REGION', 'WEB_SALES_REPS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
