After reviewing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **2result.sql** is the correct SQL for the task. Here's why:

- **Accurate Salary Parsing:** The SQL in `2result.sql` carefully parses the "Salary" column by:
  - Extracting numeric values while handling numbers with commas (e.g., "₹1,23,456").
  - Converting monthly salaries to annual by multiplying by 12.
  - Considering only the salaries that are in Indian Rupees (`₹`) and valid numeric formats.
- **Correct National Average Calculation:** It calculates the national average salary across all records in the dataset, which is essential for a valid comparison with state averages.
- **Fulfillment of Task Requirements:** The query:
  - Identifies the top 5 companies by average salary in each of the specified cities (Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Hyderabad).
  - Includes the required columns: Location, Company Name, Average Salary in State, and Average Salary in Country.
  - Orders the results appropriately and presents the data in a clear format.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:
