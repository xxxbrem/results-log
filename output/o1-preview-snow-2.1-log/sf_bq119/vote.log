After reviewing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Distance Calculation**: `1result.sql` uses geospatial functions `ST_MAKEPOINT` and `ST_DISTANCE` to calculate the distances between consecutive coordinates accurately.

- **Correct Ranking**: It computes the total travel distance for each hurricane and correctly ranks them using the `RANK()` window function, selecting the hurricane with the third longest total distance.

- **Comprehensive Data Retrieval**: The query retrieves the travel coordinates, cumulative travel distance at each point, and the maximum sustained wind speed (`wmo_wind`) at those times.

- **Detailed Results**: The corresponding results in `1result.csv` provide the cumulative distances and wind speeds for each point in a clear and precise manner, aligning with the task's requirements.

- **No Limitations**: Unlike `2result.sql`, which limits the output to 11 rows, `1result.sql` provides the full dataset for the selected hurricane.

**Conclusion**:
