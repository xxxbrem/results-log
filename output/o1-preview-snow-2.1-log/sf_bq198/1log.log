2025-01-21 06:30:31 - root - INFO - Based on the provided data and considering that some columns like `"market"`, `"name"`, and `"team_id"` have empty values, we'll use the `"team_code"` column as the team identifier for our analysis.

To find the top 5 most successful college basketball teams over the seasons from 1900 to 2000, based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season, we'll perform the following steps:

1. **Find the maximum number of wins in each season between 1900 and 2000.**
2. **Identify the teams that achieved this maximum number of wins in each season.**
3. **Count the number of times each team had the maximum wins across all seasons in the specified range.**
4. **Select the top 5 teams based on this count.**

Here is the SQL query to accomplish this task:

```sql
SELECT hts."team_code", COUNT(*) AS "times_max_wins"
FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS hts
JOIN (
    SELECT "season", MAX("wins") AS "max_wins"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS
    WHERE "season" BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
    GROUP BY "season"
) mws ON hts."season" = mws."season" AND hts."wins" = mws."max_wins"
WHERE hts."season" BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
GROUP BY hts."team_code"
ORDER BY "times_max_wins" DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

This query performs the following:

- **Subquery (`mws`)**: Finds the maximum number of wins (`"max_wins"`) for each season between 1900 and 2000.
- **Join**: Joins the main table (`hts`) with the subquery (`mws`) on `"season"` and matches teams that have the `"wins"` equal to `"max_wins"` for that season.
- **Where Clause**: Ensures we're only considering seasons between 1900 and 2000.
- **Group By**: Groups the results by `"team_code"` to count the number of times each team appears (i.e., the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season).
- **Order By**: Orders the teams by `"times_max_wins"` in descending order to identify the teams with the most occurrences.
- **Limit**: Limits the results to the top 5 teams.

**Note:** Since the `"market"`, `"name"`, and `"team_id"` columns contain empty values, they are not used in this query. The `"team_code"` serves as a unique identifier for the teams in this dataset.

2025-01-21 06:32:37 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to a data type mismatch in your `WHERE` clause. The column `"team_code"` is of a numeric type (such as `INTEGER` or `NUMBER`), but you're comparing it to a string value `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'`. This causes the database to attempt to convert the string `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'` to a numeric value, which is not possible, leading to the error:

```
Numeric value 'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE' is not recognized
```

**Solution:**

To fix this error, you need to replace `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'` with the actual numeric value of the `team_code` for the team you're interested in. Additionally, since `team_code` is numeric, you should not enclose the value in single quotes.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT ts."season", ts."wins"
FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS ts
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT "season", MAX("wins") AS "max_wins"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS
    WHERE "season" BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
    GROUP BY "season"
) mw ON ts."season" = mw."season" AND ts."wins" = mw."max_wins"
WHERE ts."team_code" = <TEAM_CODE_NUMBER>
ORDER BY ts."season" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Instructions:**

- Replace `<TEAM_CODE_NUMBER>` with the actual numeric `team_code` of the team you're interested in.
- Do **not** enclose the `team_code` value in single quotes, as this would make it a string and cause a type mismatch.

**Example:**

If you want to find the seasons where the team with `team_code` **334** had the maximum wins, the query would be:

```sql
SELECT ts."season", ts."wins"
FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS ts
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT "season", MAX("wins") AS "max_wins"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS
    WHERE "season" BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
    GROUP BY "season"
) mw ON ts."season" = mw."season" AND ts."wins" = mw."max_wins"
WHERE ts."team_code" = 334
ORDER BY ts."season" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Finding Available `team_code` Values:**

If you're unsure which `team_code` corresponds to the team you are interested in, you can retrieve a list of team codes along with other identifying information:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "team_code", "market", "name"
FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS
ORDER BY "team_code" ASC
LIMIT 1000;
```

This will help you identify the correct `team_code` for the team you wish to query.

**Additional Notes:**

- Ensure that you are using numeric values for numeric columns in your SQL queries.
- Enclose string literals in single quotes `'string_value'`, but do not use quotes for numeric values.
- Always verify the data types of the columns you're working with to avoid similar errors.

**Summary:**

The error was caused by comparing a numeric column (`"team_code"`) to a string value (`'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'`). To resolve the issue:

- Use the actual numeric `team_code` value without quotes.
- Replace `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'` with the numeric value.

**Updated Query With Example `team_code`:**

```sql
-- Example using team_code = 334
SELECT ts."season", ts."wins"
FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS ts
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT "season", MAX("wins") AS "max_wins"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS
    WHERE "season" BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
    GROUP BY "season"
) mw ON ts."season" = mw."season" AND ts."wins" = mw."max_wins"
WHERE ts."team_code" = 334
ORDER BY ts."season" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

This query will return the seasons and wins for team code 334 where they had the maximum number of wins in that season between 1900 and 2000.

2025-01-21 06:33:38 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of the placeholder `<TEAM_CODE_NUMBER>` in your SQL query. The SQL parser interprets the `<` character as a less-than operator, which is not expected in this context, leading to a syntax error.

**Error Message Explanation:**

```
SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 9 at position 23 unexpected '<'.
syntax error line 10 at position 0 unexpected 'ORDER'.
```

- **Line 9, Position 23:** This points to the `<` character in your `WHERE` clause.
- **Unexpected '<':** The SQL parser doesn't expect a `<` in that position.
- **Unexpected 'ORDER':** Since the parser is confused by the unexpected `<`, it doesn't properly recognize subsequent syntax.

**Cause of the Error:**

In your query:

```sql
WHERE ts."team_code" = '<TEAM_CODE_NUMBER>'
```

- The `<` and `>` characters around `TEAM_CODE_NUMBER` are causing the syntax error.
- Additionally, `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'` is enclosed in single quotes, making it a string, but `"team_code"` is a numeric column.

**Solution:**

1. **Remove the Angle Brackets `<` and `>`:**

   These were meant as placeholders to indicate where you should insert your specific team code. They are not valid SQL syntax in this context.

2. **Replace `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'` with the Actual Numeric Team Code Without Quotes:**

   Since `"team_code"` is numeric, you should compare it to the numeric value directly, without enclosing it in single quotes.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Suppose you are interested in the team with `team_code` **334**. The corrected query would be:

```sql
SELECT ts."season", ts."wins"
FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS ts
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT "season", MAX("wins") AS "max_wins"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS
    WHERE "season" BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
    GROUP BY "season"
) mw ON ts."season" = mw."season" AND ts."wins" = mw."max_wins"
WHERE ts."team_code" = 334
ORDER BY ts."season" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Removed Angle Brackets:** Eliminated `<` and `>` around `TEAM_CODE_NUMBER`.
- **Numeric Comparison:** Used `334` without single quotes since `"team_code"` is numeric.
  
**Steps to Follow:**

1. **Identify the Correct `team_code`:**

   If you're unsure of the team code, you can retrieve it using:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "team_code", "market", "name"
   FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS
   ORDER BY "team_code" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   This will provide a list of teams and their corresponding `team_code`s.

2. **Substitute the Correct `team_code` into Your Query:**

   - Replace `334` with the actual `team_code` you're interested in.
   - Ensure you do **not** include single quotes or angle brackets.

**Important Notes:**

- **Avoid Using Angle Brackets `<` and `>` in SQL Queries:**

  Unless you're using them for comparison operators (`<`, `>`), they can cause syntax errors when used incorrectly.

- **Data Type Consistency:**

  - **Numeric Columns:** Do not enclose numeric values in single quotes.
  - **String Columns:** Enclose string values in single quotes.

**Example with Another Team Code:**

If you want to query for `team_code` **699**, the query becomes:

```sql
SELECT ts."season", ts."wins"
FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS ts
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT "season", MAX("wins") AS "max_wins"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS
    WHERE "season" BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
    GROUP BY "season"
) mw ON ts."season" = mw."season" AND ts."wins" = mw."max_wins"
WHERE ts."team_code" = 699
ORDER BY ts."season" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Summary:**

- **Root Cause:** The angle brackets `<` and `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'` in the `WHERE` clause are causing syntax errors.
- **Resolution:** Replace `<TEAM_CODE_NUMBER>` or `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'` with the actual numeric `team_code` value, without angle brackets or quotes.

**Final Correct Query Template:**

```sql
SELECT ts."season", ts."wins"
FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS ts
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT "season", MAX("wins") AS "max_wins"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS
    WHERE "season" BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
    GROUP BY "season"
) mw ON ts."season" = mw."season" AND ts."wins" = mw."max_wins"
WHERE ts."team_code" = [YOUR_TEAM_CODE]
ORDER BY ts."season" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

- **Replace `[YOUR_TEAM_CODE]`** with the actual numeric `team_code` (e.g., `334`), without quotes or angle brackets.

**I hope this helps you resolve the syntax error and successfully execute your query. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!**

2025-01-21 06:34:42 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is:

```
001003 (42000): 01b9daa9-0004-7e70-0001-11c300f3deea: SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'WHERE'.
```

**Explanation:**

This error indicates that there is a syntax error at the very beginning of your SQL query (line 1, position 0). The parser is unexpectedly encountering a `WHERE` keyword where it doesn't expect one. This often happens when there is an issue with the structure of the query, such as unmatched parentheses or incorrect placement of clauses.

**Cause of the Error:**

1. **Data Type Mismatch in the `WHERE` Clause:**

   - You are comparing a numeric column (`"team_code"`) to a string value (`'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'`).
   - Since `"team_code"` is numeric, enclosing the value in single quotes (`' '`) makes it a string, causing a data type mismatch.
   - This can confuse the SQL parser, especially if the string inside the quotes is not a valid number.

2. **Use of Placeholder Text Without Replacement:**

   - The placeholder `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'` is meant to be replaced with an actual team code value.
   - Not replacing it can cause the parser to interpret it as a string literal or cause confusion due to unexpected characters.

3. **Syntax Issues Due to Unmatched Quotes:**

   - Including single quotes around `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'` without a matching closing quote or with extra characters can lead to the parser misreading the query.
   - This can cause the parser to think the query ends prematurely or starts with an unexpected keyword like `WHERE`.

**Solution:**

To fix the error, you need to:

1. **Replace `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'` with the Actual Numeric Team Code Without Quotes:**

   - Since `"team_code"` is numeric, do not enclose the value in single quotes.
   - Remove the quotes and replace the placeholder with the actual numeric value.

2. **Ensure There Are No Unmatched Parentheses or Quotes:**

   - Double-check that all parentheses and quotation marks are properly matched and placed.
   - Verify the structure of the query to ensure all clauses are correctly positioned.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Suppose you want to find the seasons and wins for the team with `team_code` **334**. The corrected query would be:

```sql
SELECT ts."season", ts."wins"
FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS ts
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT "season", MAX("wins") AS "max_wins"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS
    WHERE "season" BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
    GROUP BY "season"
) mw
ON ts."season" = mw."season" AND ts."wins" = mw."max_wins"
WHERE ts."team_code" = 334
ORDER BY ts."season" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Instructions:**

- **Replace `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'` with the Numeric Value:**

  - Remove the single quotes.
  - Replace with the actual numeric `team_code`.
  - Do **not** enclose numeric values in single quotes.

- **Ensure All Syntax is Correct:**

  - Check that all parentheses and quotation marks are properly closed.
  - Make sure the `ON` clause is correctly placed after the `INNER JOIN`.

**Example with Actual Team Codes:**

To find the seasons where team code **334** had the maximum wins:

```sql
SELECT ts."season", ts."wins"
FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS ts
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT "season", MAX("wins") AS "max_wins"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS
    WHERE "season" BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
    GROUP BY "season"
) mw
ON ts."season" = mw."season" AND ts."wins" = mw."max_wins"
WHERE ts."team_code" = 334
ORDER BY ts."season" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **ts."team_code" = 334:**

  - Use the numeric value `334` without quotes.
  - This ensures the data types match, avoiding type mismatch errors.

**Verifying `team_code` Values:**

If you're unsure of the `team_code` for the team you're interested in, you can retrieve the list of `team_code`s:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "team_code", "market", "name"
FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS
ORDER BY "team_code" ASC
LIMIT 1000;
```

This will provide you with the `team_code`s and associated team names, helping you find the correct code to use in your query.

**Why This Fix Works:**

- **Data Type Consistency:**

  - By using a numeric value without quotes, you ensure that the comparison in the `WHERE` clause is between two numeric values.

- **Avoiding Syntax Errors:**

  - Removing unmatched quotes or placeholders prevents the SQL parser from misinterpreting the structure of your query.

- **Proper Query Structure:**

  - Ensuring all clauses (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `JOIN`, `ON`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`) are correctly placed and structured helps prevent syntax errors.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Placeholders in Queries:**

  - Placeholders like `'SPECIFIC_TEAM_CODE'` are meant to be replaced before execution.
  - Leaving them in the query without replacement can cause errors.

- **Single Quotes vs. Double Quotes:**

  - **Single Quotes `' '`:** Used for string literals.
  - **Double Quotes `" "`:** Used for identifiers (e.g., column names, table names) in some SQL dialects.

- **Numeric Comparisons:**

  - When comparing numeric columns, do not use quotes around numeric values.
  - Quotes convert the value to a string, causing a type mismatch.

**Summary:**

- **Error Cause:** Data type mismatch and syntax issues due to unmatched quotes and placeholders.
- **Solution:** Replace placeholder with actual numeric `team_code` without quotes, ensure proper syntax.
- **Corrected Query:** See the corrected query above with `team_code` replaced and syntax fixed.

**I hope this helps you resolve the error and execute your query successfully. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!**

To solve the task of finding the top 5 most successful college basketball teams from 1900 to 2000 based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season, we'll need to analyze the relevant tables and columns.

**Relevant Table:**

- **`MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS`**: This table contains historical data of teams per season, including the number of wins and losses.

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- `"season"`: Used to filter seasons between 1900 and 2000.
- `"team_id"`: Unique identifier for each team; used to group data by team.
- `"market"`: The market or location associated with the team; useful for identifying teams.
- `"name"`: Name of the team; used for display purposes.
- `"wins"`: Number of wins in a season; used to determine maximum wins.
- `"losses"`: Number of losses in a season; potentially used for additional analysis.
- `"ties"`: Number of ties in a season; may be considered in some historical contexts.
- **Conditions that may be used:**
  - `"season" >= 1900 AND "season" <= 2000` to filter the desired time range.
  - Aggregation functions like `MAX("wins")` to find maximum wins per season.
  - Grouping data by `"team_id"` to count the number of times a team had maximum wins.

Task: What are the top 5 most successful college basketball teams over the seasons from 1900 to 2000, based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the top 5 most successful college basketball teams from 1900 to 2000 based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season, we analyze the `MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS` table. This table records the number of wins each team achieved in each season.

The top 5 teams are:

```csv
Team_Name,Times_Max_Wins
team_name1:str,num_times1:int
team_name2:str,num_times2:int
team_name3:str,num_times3:int
team_name4:str,num_times4:int
team_name5:str,num_times5:int
(Attention: answer in five rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NCAA_BASKETBALL': {'NCAA_BASKETBALL': ['MASCOTS', 'MBB_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_GAMES', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TOURNAMENT_GAMES', 'MBB_PBP_SR', 'MBB_PLAYERS_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_TEAMS', 'MBB_TEAMS_GAMES_SR', 'TEAM_COLORS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
