The correct SQL query is in **1result.sql**.

**Reasoning:**

- **Unique Identification of LaGuardia Airport:**
  - Candidate 1's SQL query includes both the station number (`"stn" = '725030'`) and the WBAN code (`"wban" = '14732'`) to uniquely identify LaGuardia Airport.
  - This ensures that only data from LaGuardia Airport is retrieved.
- **Potential Issue with WBAN Code Alone:**
  - Candidates 0 and 2 filter only on `"wban" = '14732'` without specifying the station number.
  - Since WBAN codes can sometimes be shared among different stations or reused over time, relying solely on the WBAN code may include data from other stations.
- **Data Accuracy:**
  - By using both `"stn"` and `"wban"` codes, Candidate 1's query accurately targets LaGuardia Airport and excludes any unrelated data.
- **Data Formatting:**
  - Candidate 1 properly handles data types by converting string values to numbers before using `DATE_FROM_PARTS`, ensuring correct date formation.

**Conclusion:**

Candidate 1's SQL query is the most accurate and reliable for analyzing the weather conditions at NYC's LaGuardia Airport on June 12, from 2011 to 2020.
