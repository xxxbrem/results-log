After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for the task.

**Explanation:**

- **`0result.sql` and `2result.sql`:**

  - In both of these queries, the condition to identify users who uninstalled within seven days **does not ensure that the uninstall happened *after* the first open event**. They only check if the uninstall time is less than or equal to seven days after the first open, but they do not confirm that the uninstall occurred **after** the first open.

    - For example, in `0result.sql`, the condition is:
      ```sql
      WHERE ue."event_timestamp" <= fe."first_open_time" + 7*24*60*60*1000000
      ```
      This condition allows for uninstall events that occurred **before** the first open, which is logically incorrect.

    - Similarly, in `2result.sql`, the condition is:
      ```sql
      WHERE ar."app_remove_timestamp" <= fo."first_open_timestamp" + (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000000)
      ```
      Again, it does not ensure that the uninstall happened **after** the first open event.

  - As a result, these queries might include users who uninstalled the app **before** they first opened it, leading to inaccurate calculations.

- **`1result.sql`:**

  - This query correctly identifies users who first opened the app in September 2018 and then uninstalled within seven days **by ensuring that the uninstall event happened after the first open event**.

  - The condition used in `1result.sql` is:
    ```sql
    WHERE un."uninstall_time" BETWEEN fo."first_open_time" AND fo."first_open_time" + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000000
    ```
    This condition ensures that:
    - The uninstall time is **after or equal to** the first open time.
    - The uninstall occurred within seven days **after** the first open.
  
  - By correctly filtering the users based on the proper time frame, `1result.sql` provides an accurate calculation of the percentage of users who experienced an app crash between their first open and uninstall within seven days.

**Conclusion:**

- **`1result.sql`** accurately fulfills the task requirements by correctly identifying the user cohort and calculating the desired percentage.
