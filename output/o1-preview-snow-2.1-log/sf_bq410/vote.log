After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL to answer the task. Here's the reasoning:

### Task Requirement:

- **Objective**: Identify the **top three states** with the least number of people not in the labor force.
- **Details to Provide**:
  - The amount increase in their total median income from 2015 to 2018.
  - The number of people not in the labor force in both 2015 and 2018.
  - The proportion they represent in both years according to the census tract data.

### Comparison of SQL Queries:

#### **`0result.sql`**:

- **State Extraction**: Uses `LEFT(t2015."geo_id", 2)` to extract the state FIPS code from the `"geo_id"` field and joins with the `STATE_FIPS` table to get state names.
- **Data Scope**: Considers U.S. **states** by excluding territories.
- **Results**:
  - **States Identified**: Wyoming, Alaska, North Dakota (all U.S. states).
  - **Calculations**:
    - Computes total not in labor force and total population for 2015 and 2018.
    - Calculates the proportion of people not in labor force for each state.
    - Determines the median income increase from 2015 to 2018.

#### **`1result.sql`**:

- **State Extraction**: Uses `SUBSTRING("geo_id", 10, 2)` to extract the state FIPS code correctly based on the standard `"geo_id"` format.
- **Data Scope**: Includes U.S. territories (e.g., Northern Mariana Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico).
- **Results**:
  - **States Identified**: Northern Mariana Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico (U.S. territories, not states).
  - **Calculations**:
    - While accurate, the results focus on territories rather than states, which doesn't align with the task requirement.

#### **`2result.sql`**:

- **State Extraction**: Uses `SUBSTRING("geo_id", 1, 2)` to extract the state code, which may not accurately reflect the state FIPS code due to `"geo_id"` format variations.
- **Data Scope**: Similar to `0result.sql`, but the state extraction method might be unreliable.
- **Results**:
  - **States Identified**: Wyoming, Alaska, North Dakota (same as `0result.sql`).
  - **Calculations**:
    - Provides similar data to `0result.sql`, but the state code extraction is less precise.

### Reason for Choosing **`0result.sql`**:

- **Alignment with Task**: Focuses on U.S. **states** as requested, excluding territories.
- **Accurate State Identification**: While the `LEFT` function might not be the standard way to extract state codes from `"geo_id"`, in this context, it correctly identifies the states.
- **Comprehensive Calculations**: Accurately computes the required metrics:
  - Number of people not in labor force for 2015 and 2018.
  - Proportion of people not in labor force for both years.
  - Median income for both years and the increase over time.
- **Appropriate Ordering**: Orders the results by the least number of people not in labor force, matching the task's objective.

### Conclusion:

**`0result.sql`** effectively fulfills the task requirements by focusing on U.S. states, accurately calculating the needed metrics, and providing the requested information for the top three states with the least people not in labor force.
