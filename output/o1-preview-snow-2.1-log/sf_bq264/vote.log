After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct query.

**Reason:**

Both queries aim to calculate the difference between the number of the oldest and youngest users registered between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022. They both produce the same result of **9**. However, **`2result.sql`** presents the conditions in a clearer and more structured manner:

- It first filters the users within the specified date range using the `WHERE "created_at" BETWEEN...` clause.
- Then, it calculates the maximum and minimum ages within that date range.
- Finally, it counts the number of users with those maximum and minimum ages within the same date range.

This structure ensures that all calculations are consistently applied to the same subset of data, enhancing readability and maintainability.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

2result.sql
