1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

After comparing both SQL queries (`0result.sql` and `1result.sql`) and their respective results, here's why **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice:

1. **Correct Parsing of Coordinates:**
   - **`1result.sql`** uses `ST_MakePoint` function, which constructs a geometry point from the provided longitude and latitude. It correctly parses the "coordinates" field by removing parentheses and splitting the string to extract longitude and latitude values.
   - **`0result.sql`** also parses the coordinates but uses `ST_GeogFromText` with Well-Known Text (WKT) format. While this method works, it involves additional string manipulation and formatting, which could introduce parsing errors if not handled carefully.

2. **Direct Use of Geometry Functions:**
   - **`1result.sql`** employs `ST_MakePoint` and `ST_Distance` functions directly, which are standard geometry functions in many SQL dialects. This makes the query more readable and straightforward.
   - **`0result.sql`** uses `ST_GeogFromText`, which requires constructing WKT strings. This adds complexity and can be less efficient due to string processing overhead.

3. **Efficiency and Performance:**
   - By using `ST_MakePoint`, **`1result.sql`** potentially offers better performance, as it avoids the overhead of parsing WKT strings and directly creates geometry objects.
   - **`0result.sql`** may have additional overhead due to string concatenation and parsing involved in creating WKT representations.

4. **Consistent and Clear Logic:**
   - **`1result.sql`** clearly outlines each step: obtaining Abakan's point, identifying connected airports, parsing their coordinates, calculating distances, and selecting the maximum distance.
   - The logic in **`0result.sql`** is similar but involves more complex string manipulation, which might make the query harder to maintain or modify.

5. **Same Correct Result:**
   - Both queries return the same result, identifying **Grozny** as the city connected to Abakan by the longest route, with a distance of approximately **3484.1559 km**.
   - This confirms that the logic in **`1result.sql`** is correct and efficient.

**Conclusion:**

Given the reasons above, **`1result.sql`** is chosen as the correct SQL query because it provides a more efficient, readable, and straightforward solution to determine the distance of the longest route where Abakan is either the departure or destination city.
