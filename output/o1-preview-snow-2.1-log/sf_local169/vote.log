After analyzing the three SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`0result.sql`** is the correct query for calculating the annual retention rate for Colorado legislators who started their first term between 1917 and 1999, tracked up to 20 years later. Here's the reasoning:

**Comparison of SQL Queries and Results:**

---

**Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**

- **Approach:**
  - **Cohort Selection:** Selects legislators from Colorado who started their **first term** between 1917 and 1999 using `"term_number" = 1`.
  - **Service Calculation:** Calculates the duration of service for each legislator by finding the **maximum term end date**.
  - **Retention Calculation:** For each year from 1 to 20, checks if each legislator's service duration covers that year. Counts the number of legislators remaining and calculates the retention rate.

- **Results:**
  - The retention rates decrease steadily over time, which is expected.
  - Retention rates do **not increase** at any point, which aligns with the logical expectation that the number of remaining legislators should not increase over time.
  
- **Example of Results:**
  ```
  Year, Retention_Rate
  1, 100.0000
  2, 100.0000
  3, 92.1053
  4, 92.1053
  5, 86.8421
  ...
  20, 10.5263
  ```

**Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`):**

- **Approach:**
  - **Cohort Selection:** Similar to Candidate 0, selects legislators from Colorado who started their first term between 1917 and 1999.
  - **Retention Calculation:** For each year, counts legislators whose last term end date is beyond the first term start date plus the number of years.

- **Results:**
  - The retention rates drop **rapidly**, with a significant decrease from 100% at year 1 to 47.37% at year 2 and 18.42% at year 3.
  - By year 7, the retention rate drops to 0%, which is unlikely in practice.

- **Example of Results:**
  ```
  Year, Retention_Rate
  1, 100.0000
  2, 47.3684
  3, 18.4211
  ...
  7, 0.0000
  20, 0.0000
  ```

- **Concerns:**
  - The instant drop to 0% suggests a flaw in the query logic, possibly not accounting for legislators who served non-consecutive terms or missing data.

**Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):**

- **Approach:**
  - **Cohort Selection:** Selects legislators whose **earliest term start** date is between 1917 and 1999.
  - **Per Legislator Year Calculation:** For each legislator and each year (1 to 20), checks if they were in office by verifying if any term covers the date calculated by adding the number of years to the first term start date.
  - **Retention Calculation:** Counts legislators in office at each year and calculates the retention rate.

- **Results:**
  - The retention rates **fluctuate**, with rates increasing at certain years.
  - This is illogical because the retention rate should **not increase** over time; once a legislator leaves, they cannot re-enter the cohort for retention calculation.

- **Example of Results:**
  ```
  Year, Retention_Rate
  5, 59.6154
  6, 71.1538 (increase)
  7, 50.0000
  8, 61.5385 (increase)
  ```

- **Concerns:**
  - The increasing retention rates indicate that the query might be incorrectly including legislators who re-entered office after a gap, or there might be overlapping terms causing miscalculations.

---

**Conclusion and Reasoning:**

- **`0result.sql`** provides a logical and consistent calculation of the retention rate.
- The retention rates decrease monotonically, which aligns with the expectation that legislators retire, lose elections, or otherwise leave office over time.
- The approach correctly identifies the initial cohort and tracks whether each legislator remains in office each subsequent year up to 20 years.
- The query handles the data accurately, ensuring that once a legislator leaves office, they are not counted as retained in later years.

**Final Answer:**

```plaintext
0result.sql
