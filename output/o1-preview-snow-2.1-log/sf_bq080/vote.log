After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL for the task. Here's the reasoning:

- **Comprehensive Date Range Handling:** `1result.sql` includes all dates from August 30, 2018, to September 30, 2018, by generating a date range using a generator function. This ensures that even dates with zero contracts created are represented in the output.

- **Correct Distinction Between User-Created and Contract-Created Contracts:**

  - **User-Created Contracts:** The query uses the `TRANSACTIONS` table to identify contracts created by users (Externally Owned Accounts) by checking where `receipt_contract_address` is not null and the `from_address` is not in the `CONTRACTS` table.

  - **Contract-Created Contracts:** It identifies contracts created by other contracts by checking the `TRACES` table where `trace_type` is 'create' and the `from_address` exists in the `CONTRACTS` table.

- **Cumulative Summation:** The query calculates the cumulative sum of contracts over the specified date range using window functions, providing an accurate daily summary of the cumulative counts.

- **Output Alignment with the Task:** The results from `1result.sql` match the expected pattern based on the earlier exploratory queries, showing the cumulative counts on the specific dates within the date range.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**
