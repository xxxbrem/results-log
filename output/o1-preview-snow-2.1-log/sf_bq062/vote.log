```plaintext
0result.sql
```

The reason for choosing `0result.sql` as the correct answer is that it includes a filtering condition in the `LicenseCounts` CTE to exclude NULL or empty license values. Specifically, the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
WHERE TRIM(REPLACE(f.value::STRING, '"', '')) IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(REPLACE(f.value::STRING, '"', '')) != ''
```

This ensures that only valid, non-empty license strings are considered when counting the number of packages per license per system. Excluding NULL or empty licenses is important because they do not represent meaningful license information and should not influence the determination of the most frequently used license in each system.

On the other hand, `2result.sql` does not include this filtering condition, which means it may include NULL or empty license values in the counts. Although the final results are the same in this case, it's better practice to explicitly exclude invalid data to ensure accuracy and reliability of the results.

By including the filtering condition, `0result.sql` provides a more robust and precise query, aligning closely with the task's objective to identify the most frequently used valid license by packages in each system.
