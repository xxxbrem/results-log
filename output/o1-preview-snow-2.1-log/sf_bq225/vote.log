After reviewing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here are the reasons for this choice:

1. **Comprehensive Extension Mapping**: The SQL in `1result.sql` provides a more extensive mapping of file extensions to programming languages. It includes multiple extensions for each language, capturing a wider range of files. For example, for C++ it includes `'cpp', 'c++', 'cxx', 'hpp', 'h++', 'cc', 'hh'`, ensuring more C++ files are counted.

2. **Accurate File Counts**: The file counts in the results of `1result.sql` are higher for languages with multiple extensions, indicating a more accurate representation. For instance, C++ has a higher file count compared to `2result.sql`, reflecting the inclusion of more file extensions.

3. **Consistent Methodology**: The use of regular expressions and `REGEXP_SUBSTR` in `1result.sql` provides a consistent approach to extract file extensions, improving the reliability of the results.

4. **Better Representation of Popular Languages**: The results from `1result.sql` align well with commonly known language popularity, with C, JavaScript, Java, and C++ appearing at the top, which is expected given their widespread use.

Based on these reasons, **`1result.sql`** is the most appropriate SQL query to determine the top 10 widely used languages according to file counts.
