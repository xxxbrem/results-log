Based on the comparison of the three SQL queries and their results, I choose `1result.sql` as the correct answer.

All three SQL queries aim to identify the census tracts in the 36047 area (Kings County) that made both the top 20 lists for the biggest population and median income increases from 2011 to 2018, while ensuring that each tract had over 1000 residents each year. They all produce the same results, highlighting the tracts with GEOIDs:

- 36047055500
- 36047051900
- 36047003300

However, I prefer `1result.sql` because:

1. **Modularity and Clarity**: The query separates the calculation of population increases and median income increases into distinct Common Table Expressions (CTEs), namely `pop_increase` and `income_increase`. This modular approach makes the query easier to read and understand.

2. **Use of ROW_NUMBER()**: It uses `ROW_NUMBER()` for ranking tracts based on their increases. This function assigns a unique sequential integer to each row, even in the case of ties, ensuring that exactly 20 tracts are selected for each top 20 list. This is important to meet the exact limit specified in the task.

3. **Handling NULL Values**: The use of `COALESCE` functions ensures that any NULL values in `total_pop` or `median_income` are treated as zeros, preventing potential errors in calculations.

4. **Joining Top 20 Lists**: By creating separate CTEs for the top 20 population increases (`top20_pop`) and the top 20 median income increases (`top20_income`), the query then performs an inner join to find tracts that are common to both lists, which directly addresses the task requirement.

5. **Comprehensive Filtering**: The query ensures that only tracts from county '047' with more than 1000 residents in both years are considered, and it also excludes tracts with NULL median income values.

Therefore, the structure and clarity of `1result.sql` make it the most suitable answer.
