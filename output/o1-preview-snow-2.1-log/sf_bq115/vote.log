After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **Option 2 (`2result.sql`)** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Joining**: Option 2 joins the subqueries on the `"country_code"` field, which uniquely identifies each country. This ensures accurate matching between the population under 25 and the total midyear population. Joining solely on `"country_name"` (as in Option 1) can lead to mismatches due to variations or duplicates in country names.
  
- **Simplicity and Clarity**: The query in Option 2 is straightforward and clear. It directly calculates the percentage without unnecessary casting or additional conditions. This makes the query easier to read and maintain.
  
- **Consistent Results**: Option 2 produces the correct result, identifying **Uganda** as the country with the highest percentage of population under the age of 25 in 2017, with a percentage of **69.1458%**. This matches the results from the other queries but does so with more reliable joins and calculations.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
