Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant tables and columns:**

- **Table:** `"COLLISIONS"`
  - **Column:** `"collision_date"`: potential usage - extract the year of each collision.
  - **Column:** `"primary_collision_factor"`: potential usage - identify the primary cause of each collision.
  - **Column:** `"pcf_violation_code"`: potential usage - specific violation code associated with the collision.
  - **Column:** `"pcf_violation_category"`: potential usage - categorize the type of violation.
  
**Conditions that may be used:**

- Extract the year from `"collision_date"` (since it's stored as `VARCHAR`).
- Filter out records where `"primary_collision_factor"` is null.
- Group data by year and collision factor to count occurrences.
- Order results to identify the most frequent causes per year.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve collision dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     "collision_date"
   FROM
     "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve primary collision factors:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM
     "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List distinct primary collision factors:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     DISTINCT "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM
     "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve collisions with non-null primary collision factors:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     "collision_date",
     "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM
     "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   WHERE
     "primary_collision_factor" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Extract year from collision dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     SUBSTR("collision_date", 1, 4) AS "year",
     "collision_date"
   FROM
     "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count collisions per year:**
   ```sql

Task: In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year
year:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

The year provided indicates when the two most common causes of traffic accidents differed from those in other years..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
