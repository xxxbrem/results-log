Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"`

  - `"collision_date"`: To extract the year of each collision.
  - `"primary_collision_factor"`: To identify the cause of each collision.

- **Conditions and Usage:**

  - Extract the year from `"collision_date"` using date functions.
  - Group data by year and `"primary_collision_factor"` to count occurrences.
  - Identify the top two most common causes per year.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Select collision dates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "collision_date"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Extract and select collision years:**
   ```sql
   SELECT TO_DATE("collision_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS "parsed_date",
          YEAR(TO_DATE("collision_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS "collision_year"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select primary collision factors:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count collisions per primary collision factor:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "collision_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Extract collision year and primary collision factor:**
   ```sql
   SELECT YEAR(TO_DATE("collision_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS "collision_year",
          "primary_collision_factor"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count collisions per year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT YEAR(TO_DATE("collision_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS "collision_year",
          COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   GROUP BY "collision_year"
   ORDER BY "collision_year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count collisions per primary collision factor per year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT YEAR(TO_DATE("collision_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS "collision_year",
          "primary_collision_factor",
          COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   GROUP BY "collision_year", "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "collision_year", "collision_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Select top collision causes for a specific year (e.g., 2020):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "primary_collision_factor", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   WHERE YEAR(TO_DATE("collision_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) = 2020
   GROUP BY "primary_collision_factor"
   ORDER BY "collision_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List all distinct collision years:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT YEAR(TO_DATE("collision_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS "collision_year"
   FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
   ORDER BY "collision_year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count collisions per month:**
    ```sql
    SELECT MONTH(TO_DATE("collision_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS "collision_month",
           COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    GROUP BY "collision_month"
    ORDER BY "collision_month"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Count collisions per collision severity:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "collision_severity", COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    GROUP BY "collision_severity"
    ORDER BY "collision_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Select collisions where the primary collision factor contains a specific keyword (e.g., 'Speeding'):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "primary_collision_factor", "collision_date"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    WHERE "primary_collision_factor" ILIKE '%Speeding%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Count collisions involving alcohol:**
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS "alcohol_related_collisions"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    WHERE "alcohol_involved" = 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Count collisions per day of the week:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DAYOFWEEK(TO_DATE("collision_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS "collision_weekday",
           COUNT(*) AS "collision_count"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    GROUP BY "collision_weekday"
    ORDER BY "collision_weekday"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Select collision dates and times:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "collision_date", "collision_time"
    FROM "CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION"."COLLISIONS"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in exploring the data related to collision causes and their frequency over the years, which is essential for determining in which year the two most common causes of traffic accidents were different from those in other years.Query:

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year
year:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```

The year provided indicates when the two most common causes of traffic accidents differed from those in other years..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
