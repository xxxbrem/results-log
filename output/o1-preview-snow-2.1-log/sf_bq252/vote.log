After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **2result.sql** is the correct answer. The reason is that it provides an alias `"file_id"` for the file identifier column, which enhances clarity by explicitly indicating that the ID corresponds to a file. This makes the output more readable and aligns with the requirement to ensure each file is uniquely identified by its ID.

2result.sql
