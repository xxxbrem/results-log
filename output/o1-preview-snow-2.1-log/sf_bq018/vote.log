After analyzing the SQL queries and their methods for calculating the growth rate, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for determining the day with the highest COVID-19 confirmed case growth rate in the United States during March and April.

**Explanation:**

- **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** calculate the growth rate using the formula:

  \[
  \text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{"new\_confirmed"}}{\text{"cumulative\_confirmed"}} \right) \times 100
  \]

  However, this approach divides the number of new confirmed cases by the cumulative confirmed cases **on the same day**, which **includes** the new confirmed cases of that day. This can lead to an **underestimation** of the growth rate, especially on days when the cumulative cases are low, because the denominator already incorporates the new cases, diluting the growth rate calculation.

- **`1result.sql`** calculates the growth rate by comparing the number of new confirmed cases to the **previous day's** cumulative confirmed cases. It uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) with the `LAG` function to obtain the previous day's cumulative confirmed cases (`prev_cumulative_confirmed`) and computes the growth rate as:

  \[
  \text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{"new\_confirmed"}}{\text{"prev\_cumulative\_confirmed"}} \right)
  \]

  This method provides a more accurate representation of the daily growth rate because it measures the percentage increase of new cases relative to the total cases up to the **previous day**, aligning with the standard definition of growth rate.

**Conclusion:**

- **`1result.sql`** correctly calculates the daily growth rate by comparing new cases to the prior cumulative total, thus accurately identifying the day with the highest growth rate.
- Both **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** use a less accurate method by dividing by the same day's cumulative cases, which could lead to misleading results.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plain
1result.sql
