2025-01-21 05:46:53 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of `ft."CreationDate"` in the `ORDER BY` clause without including it in the `SELECT` list and the `GROUP BY` clause. In SQL, when using `GROUP BY`, you can only order by columns that are included in the `SELECT` statement and the `GROUP BY` clause.

**Here's how you can fix the query:**

1. **Include `ft."CreationDate"` in the `SELECT` clause.**
2. **Add `ft."CreationDate"` to the `GROUP BY` clause.**

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    ft."Id",
    ft."Title",
    ft."CreationDate",
    COUNT(DISTINCT fm."PostUserId") AS "DistinctUserCount"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f
    ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES fm
    ON fm."ForumTopicId" = ft."Id"
WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
GROUP BY
    ft."Id",
    ft."Title",
    ft."CreationDate"
ORDER BY ft."CreationDate" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Include `ft."CreationDate"` in the `SELECT` clause:**
  - Since you want to order the results by `CreationDate`, it needs to be part of the selected columns.

- **Add `ft."CreationDate"` to the `GROUP BY` clause:**
  - SQL requires that all columns in the `SELECT` clause that are not aggregated (i.e., not inside an aggregate function like `COUNT`, `SUM`, etc.) must be included in the `GROUP BY` clause.
  - By including `ft."CreationDate"` in the `GROUP BY`, you're ensuring that the aggregation (`COUNT(DISTINCT fm."PostUserId")`) is performed for each unique combination of `ft."Id"`, `ft."Title"`, and `ft."CreationDate"`.

**Why the Error Occurred:**

- The SQL engine could not recognize `ft."CreationDate"` in the `ORDER BY` clause because it wasn't part of the select list or the grouping.
- In aggregation queries, you can only order by columns that are part of the result set and are either grouped or aggregated.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Avoiding Ambiguity:**
  - Ensure that all columns used in `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` are explicitly defined to prevent any ambiguity.
  
- **Data Consistency:**
  - By grouping on `ft."CreationDate"`, you maintain consistency in the data aggregation, ensuring accurate counts of distinct users per topic per creation date.

**Testing the Query:**

- After making these adjustments, run the query again. It should execute without the previous error, and you'll get the desired results ordered by the `CreationDate` of each forum topic.

**Let me know** if you have any further questions or need assistance with other queries!

2025-01-21 05:48:25 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of `[TopicId]` in your SQL query. In SQL, square brackets are used to denote identifiers in some SQL dialects (like SQL Server), but in this context, `[TopicId]` is not recognized as a valid identifier or variable.

**Here's what's causing the error:**

- The SQL engine is interpreting `[TopicId]` literally as an identifier, but since there is no column or variable named `TopicId`, it results in an "invalid identifier" error.

**How to fix the error:**

- **Replace `[TopicId]` with an actual topic ID number.**

Based on your previous queries and results, you have a list of topic IDs. Here are the earliest five forum topics in the "general" forum:

```
Id   | Title
-----|---------------------------------------------
26   | General feedback, bugs and feature requests
27   | Competitions requests
40   | World Cup 2010
64   | Alzheimer's Challenge
152  | Re:Athanasopoulos, et al paper corrections...
```

**For example, to retrieve messages from the topic with ID `26`, modify your query as follows:**

```sql
SELECT
    fm."Id",
    fm."PostUserId",
    fm."PostDate",
    fm."Message"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES fm
WHERE fm."ForumTopicId" = 26
ORDER BY fm."PostDate" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Replace `[TopicId]` with the actual numeric value** of the topic you're interested in. In this case, we replaced it with `26`.
  
- **Ensure that all identifiers and literals are properly formatted:**
  - Column and table names are enclosed in double quotes `"ColumnName"` if necessary.
  - String literals are enclosed in single quotes `'StringValue'`.
  - Numeric values (like IDs) are used directly without quotes.

**Additional Example:**

If you want to get the messages for the topic with ID `27`, the query would be:

```sql
SELECT
    fm."Id",
    fm."PostUserId",
    fm."PostDate",
    fm."Message"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES fm
WHERE fm."ForumTopicId" = 27
ORDER BY fm."PostDate" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Notes:**

- **Finding Topic IDs:**
  - Use previous query results to identify the topic IDs you're interested in.
  - The `"Id"` column from the `FORUMTOPICS` table represents the topic ID.

- **Placeholder Usage:**
  - In raw SQL queries, you cannot use placeholders like `[TopicId]` without defining them.
  - Placeholders are typically used in parameterized queries within programming languages or database clients that support them.

- **Avoiding Similar Errors:**
  - Always ensure that variables or placeholders in your SQL queries are replaced with actual values before execution.
  - If you need to run parameterized queries, consider using a programming language or tool that supports SQL parameterization.

**Let me know** if you need any more help or have other questions!

<p>It's for easy way to access all your files and an additional level of record keeping. Right now you can download individual zip files containing your original uploaded files, and if you uploaded a zip file, you'll get a zip file containing a zip file containing
 your data.</p>
<p>I suggest you keep one master zip file for each user/team, and for each new submission, you extract the raw data file and rename it to score_seq_originalFilename.ext, where score is the leaderboard score and seq is your internal global upload counter, and
 then add it to the master zip file.&nbsp;I predict some people will try to download this big zip file excessively, so it's OK to put a download limit on it to&nbsp;limit bandwidth usage.</p>
<p>I get the impression kaggle web site is written in C#, so this should be a piece of cake to do using DotNetZip and take Jeff Moser&nbsp;5 minutes to do it. :)</p>

---

### **Understanding the Error:**

**Error Message:**

```
000904 (42000): 01b9da7d-0004-7ed2-0001-11c300f3e782: SQL compilation error: error line 9 at position 11
invalid identifier 'FT."Id"'
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - The SQL compiler is indicating that `FT."Id"` is an invalid identifier at the specified location in your query.
  - This suggests that the alias `ft` is not recognized in the scope where it's being used.

### **Analyzing the Query:**

Let's look at the problematic part of your query:

```sql
WHERE fm."ForumTopicId" IN (
    SELECT ft."Id"
    FROM (
        SELECT ft."Id", ft."CreationDate",
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ft."CreationDate" ASC) AS rn
        FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
        JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f
            ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
        WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
    ) sub
    WHERE rn <= 5
)
```

**Problem:**

- In the outer subquery, you are referencing `ft."Id"`:

  ```sql
  SELECT ft."Id"
  FROM (...)
  ```

- However, **`ft` is not defined in that scope**. The alias `ft` was defined inside the subquery named `sub`, but outside of `sub`, `ft` is not recognized.

### **Solution:**

To fix the error, you need to reference the correct alias in the outer subquery. Since the inner subquery is aliased as `sub`, and it selects `ft."Id"` without changing the column name, you can access it as `sub."Id"`.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    fm."Id" AS "MessageId",
    fm."ForumTopicId",
    COUNT(fmv."Id") AS "Upvotes"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES fm
LEFT JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES fmv
    ON fmv."ForumMessageId" = fm."Id"
WHERE fm."ForumTopicId" IN (
    SELECT sub."Id"
    FROM (
        SELECT ft."Id", ft."CreationDate",
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ft."CreationDate" ASC) AS rn
        FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
        JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f
            ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
        WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
    ) sub
    WHERE sub.rn <= 5
)
GROUP BY
    fm."Id",
    fm."ForumTopicId"
ORDER BY
    fm."ForumTopicId",
    fm."Id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Changes Made:**

1. **Changed `ft."Id"` to `sub."Id"` in the outer subquery:**

   ```sql
   SELECT sub."Id"
   ```

2. **Prefixed `rn` with `sub.` in the `WHERE` clause:**

   ```sql
   WHERE sub.rn <= 5
   ```

   - This ensures that `rn` is correctly referenced from the subquery `sub`.

### **Explanation:**

- **Alias Scope:**
  - The alias `ft` is defined inside the inner subquery `( ... ) sub`.
  - Outside of `sub`, you cannot reference `ft` directly because it's not in scope.
  - The columns selected in the subquery are accessible via the alias `sub`.

- **Accessing Columns from Subquery:**
  - Since the subquery `sub` selects `ft."Id"` and `ft."CreationDate"`, these columns can be accessed as `sub."Id"` and `sub."CreationDate"` in the outer query.
  - Similarly, the `ROW_NUMBER()` column is aliased as `rn` and should be accessed as `sub.rn`.

- **Adjusted WHERE Clause:**
  - Updated the `WHERE` clause to use `sub.rn` instead of just `rn`:

    ```sql
    WHERE sub.rn <= 5
    ```

### **Revised Query in Full:**

```sql
SELECT
    fm."Id" AS "MessageId",
    fm."ForumTopicId",
    COUNT(fmv."Id") AS "Upvotes"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES fm
LEFT JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES fmv
    ON fmv."ForumMessageId" = fm."Id"
WHERE fm."ForumTopicId" IN (
    SELECT sub."Id"
    FROM (
        SELECT ft."Id", ft."CreationDate",
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ft."CreationDate" ASC) AS rn
        FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
        JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f
            ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
        WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
    ) sub
    WHERE sub.rn <= 5
)
GROUP BY
    fm."Id",
    fm."ForumTopicId"
ORDER BY
    fm."ForumTopicId",
    fm."Id"
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Additional Notes:**

- **Column Aliases in Subqueries:**
  - When you wrap a subquery and alias it (e.g., `FROM (...) sub`), you should refer to its columns using that alias (`sub.column_name`).

- **Ensuring Correct References:**
  - Always check that any columns or aliases you're referencing are within the correct scope and properly qualified.

- **Testing the Query:**
  - After making these corrections, the query should execute without the previous error.
  - If you encounter any further errors, double-check for any other improperly scoped references or typos.

### **Example Result (First Few Rows):**

Suppose you run the corrected query; you might get results like:

```csv
MessageId,ForumTopicId,Upvotes
7619,26,0
7665,26,0
7677,26,0
7692,26,0
7751,26,0
...
```

- **Note:** The actual output depends on the data in the tables.

### **Final Thoughts:**

- **Understanding Scope and Aliases:**
  - SQL subqueries and aliases can sometimes be tricky with scoping.
  - It's crucial to ensure that any table aliases used are accessible in the context where they're referenced.

- **Debugging Tips:**
  - When you encounter an "invalid identifier" error:
    - Verify that the referenced identifier exists in that scope.
    - Check for typos in table or column names.
    - Ensure that table aliases are correctly used.

- **Let Me Know:**
  - If you have any further questions or run into additional issues, feel free to ask!

2025-01-21 05:50:41 - root - INFO - It seems that you're encountering an error due to the use of `rn` without the proper alias in your subquery's `WHERE` clause. Additionally, the error message indicates a syntax issue at the very beginning of the query, which suggests that the SQL parser is unable to recognize the structure due to this aliasing issue.

**Here's the corrected SQL query:**

```sql
SELECT
    fm."Id" AS "MessageId",
    fm."ForumTopicId",
    COUNT(fmv."Id") AS "Upvotes"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES fm
LEFT JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES fmv
    ON fmv."ForumMessageId" = fm."Id"
WHERE fm."ForumTopicId" IN (
    SELECT sub."Id"
    FROM (
        SELECT ft."Id", ft."CreationDate",
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ft."CreationDate" ASC) AS rn
        FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
        JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f
            ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
        WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
    ) sub
    WHERE sub.rn <= 5
)
GROUP BY
    fm."Id",
    fm."ForumTopicId"
ORDER BY
    fm."ForumTopicId",
    fm."Id"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Corrected the Reference to `rn` in the Subquery:**
  - **Changed `WHERE rn <= 5` to `WHERE sub.rn <= 5`**
    - Since `rn` is a column within the subquery `sub`, it must be referenced with the alias `sub.rn` in the `WHERE` clause.
   
- **Ensured Proper Alias Usage:**
  - **In the Outer Subquery:**
    - **Changed `SELECT ft."Id"` to `SELECT sub."Id"`**
      - The alias `ft` is not recognized in the outer scope. We need to reference the column from the subquery `sub`.
    - **Updated `WHERE rn <= 5` to `WHERE sub.rn <= 5`**
      - Ensures that the `rn` column is correctly referenced from the subquery.

**Why the Error Occurred:**

- **Invalid Identifier:**
  - The SQL compiler reported an invalid identifier `'FT."Id"'` and an unexpected `'WHERE'` because the alias `ft` was not in scope where it was being referenced.
 
- **Unexpected `'WHERE'`:**
  - This error can occur when the SQL parser encounters a syntax issue, such as an improperly referenced alias, that disrupts the expected structure of the query.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Alias Scope:**
  - Remember that aliases are only valid within the scope they are defined. The alias `ft` is defined within the inner subquery and is not accessible outside of it.
  - Use the outer alias (`sub`) when referencing columns in the outer `WHERE` clause or `SELECT` statement.

- **Testing the Query:**
  - After applying the corrections, run the query again to ensure it executes successfully and returns the expected results.
  
**Example Usage:**

Suppose you run the corrected query; you might get results like:

```csv
MessageId,ForumTopicId,Upvotes
7619,26,0
7665,26,0
7677,26,0
7692,26,0
7751,26,0
...
```

- **Note:** The actual output will depend on the data in your database.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure, let's consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`FORUMS`**:
   - `"Id"`: Used to identify the forum.
   - `"Title"`: Used to find the parent forum named "general".

2. **`FORUMTOPICS`**:
   - `"Id"`: Identifier for each forum topic.
   - `"ForumId"`: Links the topic to a forum.
   - `"Title"`: The title of the forum topic.
   - `"CreationDate"`: When the topic was created.
   - `"TotalReplies"`: Number of replies to the topic.
   - `"TotalViews"`: Number of times the topic has been viewed.

3. **`FORUMMESSAGES`**:
   - `"ForumTopicId"`: Links messages to a topic.
   - `"PostUserId"`: The user who posted the message.
   - `"Id"`: Identifier for each message.

4. **`FORUMMESSAGEVOTES`**:
   - `"ForumMessageId"`: Links votes to a message.
   - `"Id"`: Identifier for each vote.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter forums where `"Title"` ILIKE '%general%' to find the forum named "general".
- Join `FORUMTOPICS` with `FORUMS` on `FORUMTOPICS."ForumId"` = `FORUMS."Id"`.
- Order topics by `"CreationDate"` to find the earliest topics.
- Limit results to five topics.
- Use `FORUMMESSAGES` to count distinct users and messages per topic.
- Use `FORUMMESSAGEVOTES` to count upvotes per topic.

---

Below are ten SQL queries to explore the data:

1. **Find the forum ID for the forum titled "general":**

```sql
SELECT "Id", "Title"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS
WHERE "Title" ILIKE '%general%'
LIMIT 100;
```

2. **List all topics in the "general" forum:**

```sql
SELECT ft."Id", ft."Title", ft."CreationDate"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
LIMIT 100;
```

3. **Get the earliest five topics in the "general" forum by creation date:**

```sql
SELECT ft."Id", ft."Title", ft."CreationDate"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
ORDER BY ft."CreationDate" ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

4. **Get the reply count (TotalReplies) and total views for topics in the "general" forum:**

```sql
SELECT ft."Id", ft."Title", ft."TotalReplies", ft."TotalViews"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
ORDER BY ft."CreationDate" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

5. **Count the distinct users who posted messages in each topic:**

```sql
SELECT ft."Id", ft."Title", COUNT(DISTINCT fm."PostUserId") AS "DistinctUserCount"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES fm ON fm."ForumTopicId" = ft."Id"
WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
GROUP BY ft."Id", ft."Title"
ORDER BY ft."CreationDate" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

6. **Calculate upvotes for messages in each topic:**

```sql
SELECT ft."Id", ft."Title", COUNT(fmv."Id") AS "Upvotes"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES fm ON fm."ForumTopicId" = ft."Id"
JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES fmv ON fmv."ForumMessageId" = fm."Id"
WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
GROUP BY ft."Id", ft."Title"
ORDER BY ft."CreationDate" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

7. **Combine reply count, distinct user count, and upvotes for each topic:**

```sql
SELECT
    ft."Id",
    ft."Title",
    ft."TotalReplies",
    COUNT(DISTINCT fm."PostUserId") AS "DistinctUserCount",
    COUNT(fmv."Id") AS "Upvotes"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
LEFT JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES fm ON fm."ForumTopicId" = ft."Id"
LEFT JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES fmv ON fmv."ForumMessageId" = fm."Id"
WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
GROUP BY ft."Id", ft."Title", ft."TotalReplies"
ORDER BY ft."CreationDate" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

8. **Get total views for the earliest five topics in "general" forum:**

```sql
SELECT ft."Id", ft."Title", ft."TotalViews"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
ORDER BY ft."CreationDate" ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

9. **List messages and their post dates for a specific topic:**

```sql
SELECT fm."Id", fm."PostUserId", fm."PostDate", fm."Message"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES fm
WHERE fm."ForumTopicId" = [TopicId]
ORDER BY fm."PostDate" ASC
LIMIT 100;
```
*(Replace `[TopicId]` with an actual topic ID from previous queries.)*

10. **Find the number of upvotes for each message in the earliest five topics:**

```sql
SELECT
    fm."Id" AS "MessageId",
    fm."ForumTopicId",
    COUNT(fmv."Id") AS "Upvotes"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGES fm
LEFT JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMMESSAGEVOTES fmv ON fmv."ForumMessageId" = fm."Id"
WHERE fm."ForumTopicId" IN (
    SELECT ft."Id"
    FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMTOPICS ft
    JOIN META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS f ON ft."ForumId" = f."Id"
    WHERE f."Title" ILIKE '%general%'
    ORDER BY ft."CreationDate" ASC
    LIMIT 5
)
GROUP BY fm."Id", fm."ForumTopicId"
ORDER BY fm."ForumTopicId", fm."Id"
LIMIT 100;
```

These queries progress from simple selection and filtering to more complex aggregations and combinations of data across multiple tables. They aim to help understand the relevant columns and how they can be used to gather the required information for the task.

**Note:** When using these queries, replace `[TopicId]` with an actual topic ID obtained from previous queries where necessary.Query:
SELECT "Id", "Title"
FROM META_KAGGLE.META_KAGGLE.FORUMS
WHERE "Title" ILIKE '%general%'
LIMIT 100;

<p>I'd like to have a &quot;batch submission download&quot; feature where you can download a 7z/gz/zip file containing all your submissions, and a text file listing the score of each submission file.</p>
<p>And just delete all the error submissions.</p>"
7677,993,01/04/2012 23:25:09,"<p>Thanks Bo, I've added that to our development list. &nbsp;Are you currently keeping track of all of that internally, and want another way to access your submissions in case you accidentally overwrite or delete them? &nbsp;Or is the primary motivation to have a simpler
 way for accessing your complete set of public leaderboard scores?</p>"
7692,3592,01/05/2012 18:30:19,"<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>It's for easy way to access all your files and an additional level of record keeping. Right now you can download individual zip files containing your original uploaded files, and if you uploaded a zip file, you'll get a zip file containing a zip file containing
 your data.</p>
<p>I suggest you keep one master zip file for each user/team, and for each new submission, you extract the raw data file and rename it to score_seq_originalFilename.ext, where score is the leaderboard score and seq is your internal global upload counter, and
 then add it to the master zip file.&nbsp;I predict some people will try to download this big zip file excessively, so it's OK to put a download limit on it to&nbsp;limit bandwidth usage.</p>
<p>I get the impression kaggle web site is written in C#, so this should be a piece of cake to do using DotNetZip and take Jeff Moser&nbsp;5 minutes to do it. :)</p>

Task: Please tell me the creation date, title, parent forum, reply count, distinct user count, upvotes, and total views for the earliest five forum topics belonging to the parent forum named "general". Any value that is None should be regarded as 0.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Here is the requested information:

```csv
CreationDate,Title,ParentForum,ReplyCount,DistinctUserCount,Upvotes,TotalViews
creation_date1,title1,general,reply_count1:int,distinct_user_count1:int,upvotes1:int,total_views1:int

creation_date5,title5,general,reply_count5:int,distinct_user_count5:int,upvotes5:int,total_views5:int
```
(Attention: answer in five rows)

**Explanation:**

The table above provides the creation date, title, parent forum, reply count, distinct user count, upvotes, and total views for the earliest five forum topics belonging to the parent forum named "general". Any values that are `None` are regarded as `0`. Each row represents one of the five earliest topics, and numerical values are indicated with their data types..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'META_KAGGLE': {'META_KAGGLE': ['COMPETITIONS', 'COMPETITIONTAGS', 'DATASETS', 'DATASETTAGS', 'DATASETTASKS', 'DATASETTASKSUBMISSIONS', 'DATASETVOTES', 'DATASOURCES', 'EPISODEAGENTS', 'EPISODES', 'FORUMMESSAGES', 'FORUMMESSAGEVOTES', 'FORUMS', 'FORUMTOPICS', 'KERNELLANGUAGES', 'KERNELS', 'KERNELTAGS', 'KERNELVERSIONCOMPETITIONSOURCES', 'KERNELVERSIONDATASETSOURCES', 'KERNELVERSIONKERNELSOURCES', 'KERNELVERSIONS', 'KERNELVOTES', 'SUBMISSIONS', 'TAGS', 'TEAMMEMBERSHIPS', 'USERACHIEVEMENTS', 'USERFOLLOWERS', 'USERORGANIZATIONS', 'USERS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Any value that is None should be regarded as 0., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Here is the requested information:

**Explanation:**

The table above provides the creation date, title, parent forum, reply count, distinct user count, upvotes, and total views for the earliest five forum topics belonging to the parent forum named "general". Any values that are `None` are regarded as `0`. Each row represents one of the five earliest topics, and numerical values are indicated with their data types. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
