After analyzing both SQL scripts and their outputs, I conclude that **2result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

The user's question is:

> *"I would like to know the given names of baseball players who have achieved the highest value of games played, runs, hits, and home runs, with their corresponding score values."*

This implies that we are interested in the players who have the highest **career totals** in each category, not just the highest single-season values.

- **1result.sql**: This script retrieves players who achieved the highest values **in a single season**. It selects records from the `BATTING` table where the values of `"g"`, `"r"`, `"h"`, and `"hr"` are at their maximum in a single stint, which does not necessarily reflect a player's career achievement.

- **2result.sql**: This script calculates the **career totals** for each player by aggregating (summing) the statistics across all seasons and stints. It then finds the players with the highest total games played, runs, hits, and home runs over their entire careers.

Since the user's request is about the players who have **achieved the highest values** in terms of their overall careers, **2result.sql** accurately addresses the question by summarizing each player's career statistics and identifying the top performers in each category.
