This query calculates, for each year, the total number of films and the number of films that had no male actors. By adjusting the conditions to only check for the absence of male actors (regardless of unknown genders), we simplify the query to produce results even when some actors have missing gender information. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures all films are included, and the `HAVING` clause filters movies with zero male actors.

This query calculates, for each year, the total number of films (`Total_Films`), the number of films that had exclusively female actors (`Female_Only_Films`), and the proportion of these female-only films (`Proportion_Female_Only_Films`). It considers only actors with known genders ('Female' or 'Male') and includes movies where all known actors are female.

This query calculates, for each year, the total number of films (`Total_Films`), the number of films that had exclusively female actors (`Female_Only_Films`), and the proportion of these female-only films (`Proportion_Female_Only_Films`). It considers movies where there are no male actors (`"Male_Count" = 0`) and at least one female actor (`"Female_Count" > 0`), simplifying previous conditions to include more results.

This query selects actors (`"PID"` and `"Name"`) from the `PERSON` table who have appeared in movies (ensured by using an `INNER JOIN` with `M_CAST` on `"PID"`). It filters out any entries where `"PID"` or `"Name"` are `NULL` or empty strings to avoid empty values in the result. The `COUNT(mc."MID")` gives the number of movies each actor has appeared in (`"Movie_Count"`). The `LIMIT 100` restricts the output to the first 100 records.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **MOVIE**
  - `"MID"`: Movie ID - used to identify each movie.
  - `"year"`: Year of the movie - used to group movies by year.
- **M_CAST**
  - `"MID"`: Movie ID - used to link actors to movies.
  - `"PID"`: Person ID - used to identify actors in each movie.
- **PERSON**
  - `"PID"`: Person ID - used to identify each actor.
  - `"Gender"`: Gender of the actor - used to determine if actors are female.

**Conditions:**

- To identify female actors: `"Gender" = 'Female'`.
- To find movies where **all** actors are female: Ensure that all actors associated with a movie have `"Gender" = 'Female'`.
- To calculate proportions per year: Need total number of movies per year and number of all-female-actor movies per year.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List the first 100 movies with their IDs, titles, and years:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "MID", "title", "year"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."MOVIE"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get the first 100 entries from the M_CAST table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."M_CAST"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get the first 100 entries from the PERSON table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "PID", "Name", "Gender"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."PERSON"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find all distinct genders in the PERSON table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Gender"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."PERSON";
   ```

5. **Count the number of actors by gender:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "Gender", COUNT(*) AS "Actor_Count"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."PERSON"
   GROUP BY "Gender";
   ```

6. **List the first 100 movies along with their cast members and actor genders:**

   ```sql
   SELECT mc."MID", p."PID", p."Gender"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."M_CAST" mc
   JOIN "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."PERSON" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find the total number of movies released each year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "year", COUNT(*) AS "Total_Movies"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."MOVIE"
   GROUP BY "year"
   ORDER BY "year" ASC;
   ```

8. **Find movies that have only female actors (limit 100):**

   ```sql
   SELECT mc."MID"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."M_CAST" mc
   JOIN "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."PERSON" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
   GROUP BY mc."MID"
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p."Gender") = 1 AND MIN(p."Gender") = 'Female'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List movies that have at least one male actor (limit 100):**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT mc."MID"
   FROM "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."M_CAST" mc
   JOIN "DB_IMDB"."DB_IMDB"."PERSON" p ON mc."PID" = p."PID"
   WHERE p."Gender" = 'Male'

Task: I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Proportion of Female-Actor-Only Films,Total Number of All Films
year1:int,proportion1:float, total_films1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float, total_films2:int
...
```

This table shows, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors, along with the total number of all films released in those years..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'DB_IMDB': {'DB_IMDB': ['COUNTRY', 'GENRE', 'LANGUAGE', 'LOCATION', 'MOVIE', 'M_CAST', 'M_COUNTRY', 'M_DIRECTOR', 'M_GENRE', 'M_LANGUAGE', 'M_LOCATION', 'M_PRODUCER', 'PERSON']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 17:09:38 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing I'm interested in knowing the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors for each year. Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Proportion of Female-Actor-Only Films,Total Number of All Films
year1:int,proportion1:float, total_films1:int
year2:int,proportion2:float, total_films2:int
...
```

This table shows, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors, along with the total number of all films released in those years. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

Show the proportion of female-actor-only films and the total number of all films for each of those years., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

This table shows, for each year, the proportion of films that had exclusively female actors, along with the total number of all films released in those years. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
