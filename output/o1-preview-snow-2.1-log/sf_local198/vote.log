After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL.

**Reasoning:**

- **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**
  - This query calculates the total sales per **customer's country** by joining the `CUSTOMERS` and `INVOICES` tables on `"CustomerId"` and grouping by `c."Country"`.
  - It considers the total sales associated with customers from countries with more than 4 customers.
  - However, it sums the sales based on the customer's country, not necessarily where the sale was **made**.

- **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`):**
  - This query calculates the total sales per **billing country** (`"BillingCountry"` in the `INVOICES` table), which represents where the sales were **made**.
  - It selects invoices where the billing country is in the list of countries with more than 4 customers.
  - Then, it computes the median of the total sales made **in** those countries.
  - This aligns perfectly with the task: *"Using the sales data, what is the median value of total sales made in countries where the number of customers is greater than 4?"*

- **Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):**
  - Similar to Candidate 0, it calculates total sales per **customer's country** by joining `CUSTOMERS` and `INVOICES` and grouping by `c."Country"`.
  - It sums sales based on the customers' countries, not where the sales were **made**.
  - This does not directly address the task's requirement.

**Conclusion:**

Candidate 1's SQL (`1result.sql`) correctly computes the median value of total sales **made in countries** where the number of customers is greater than 4 by considering the billing country in the `INVOICES` table. It aligns with the task's requirements, making it the correct choice.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plain
1result.sql
