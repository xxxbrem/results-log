After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have chosen **`1result.sql`** as the correct answer. 

**Reason:**

- **Explicit Casting:** In `1result.sql`, the `WHERE` clause includes explicit casting to `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` (`::TIMESTAMP_NTZ`). This ensures that the timestamp conversions are handled correctly and unambiguously, which is important for accurate date comparisons.
  
- **Consistency and Clarity:** Using explicit casting improves the clarity of the query, making it easier to understand and maintain. It ensures that the dates are compared using the intended timestamp data type.

- **Correctness of Results:** Both queries produce the same results; however, the explicit casting in `1result.sql` makes it more reliable, especially when dealing with different time zones or timestamp interpretations.
