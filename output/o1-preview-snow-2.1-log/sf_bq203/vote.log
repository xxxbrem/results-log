After comparing both SQL queries and their corresponding results, it's clear that **`1result.sql`** is the more accurate query for determining the percentage of subway stations with at least one ADA-compliant entrance in each New York borough. Here's why:

### Reasons:

1. **Consideration of `exit_only` Entrances:**
   - **`1result.sql`** explicitly excludes entrances that are **`exit_only`** by adding the condition `se."exit_only" = FALSE` in the `CASE WHEN` clause. This ensures that only entrances allowing entry are counted towards ADA compliance.
   - **`0result.sql`** does not consider the `exit_only` flag, which may incorrectly count stations that have ADA-compliant exits but no ADA-compliant entrances. This could overestimate the accessibility of a station.

2. **Accurate Counting of Stations:**
   - **`1result.sql`** uses `COUNT(DISTINCT s."station_id")` to accurately count unique stations in both the numerator and the denominator, ensuring the percentages are correctly calculated.
   - Both queries produce the same percentages because the data in this case did not include discrepancies due to `exit_only` entrances. However, **`1result.sql`** is more robust and accurate for datasets where such discrepancies may exist.

3. **SQL Structure and Readability:**
   - **`1result.sql`** consolidates the calculation into a single query without using additional common table expressions (CTEs), making it more straightforward and efficient.
   - **`0result.sql`** uses CTEs, which can be useful, but in this case, add unnecessary complexity without addressing the `exit_only` concern.

### Conclusion:

Given that **`1result.sql`** accounts for both ADA compliance and whether an entrance allows entry, it provides a more accurate and comprehensive solution to the task.
