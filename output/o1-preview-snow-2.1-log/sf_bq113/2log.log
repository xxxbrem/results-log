These queries explore different aspects of the data relevant to the task, such as employment levels, wages, and county information, without directly answering the original question. They use various SQL clauses and functions, including `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `AVG()`, and `UNION ALL`.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT "county_name", "county_fips_code"
   FROM BLS.GEO_US_BOUNDARIES."COUNTIES"
   WHERE "state_fips_code" = '49'
   LIMIT 100;

Task: Which Utah county has witnessed the greatest percentage increase of construction jobs from 2000 to 2018? And what is the corresponding increase rate?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
County,Percentage_Increase
Washington County,250.0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

Between 2000 and 2018, Washington County in Utah experienced the greatest percentage increase in construction jobs. The number of construction jobs grew by 250% during this period, reflecting significant growth in the county's construction industry..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.'

2025-01-22 21:41:05 - root - INFO - Apologies for the inconvenience. The error message "No data found for the specified query" suggests that the `JOIN` conditions are not matching any records, likely due to mismatches in the formatting of the `area_fips` codes between the datasets.

In the `COUNTIES` table, the `state_fips_code` and `county_fips_code` may not be properly padded, causing the concatenated `area_fips` to not match those in the BLS QCEW tables.

Here's the corrected SQL query with adjustments to ensure that the FIPS codes are correctly padded:

    WHERE "state_fips_code" = '49'
)
SELECT cn."county_name" AS "County",
    ROUND(((e18."avg_emplvl_2018" - e00."avg_emplvl_2000") / e00."avg_emplvl_2000") * 100, 4) AS "Percentage_Increase"

ORDER BY "Percentage_Increase" DESC NULLS LAST

```

**Explanation:**

- **Padding FIPS Codes:** The key change is in the `county_names` CTE. We use `LPAD` to ensure that both the `state_fips_code` (2 digits) and `county_fips_code` (3 digits) are properly padded with leading zeros to match the format of `area_fips` in the BLS QCEW tables.
    ```sql
    SELECT LPAD("state_fips_code", 2, '0') || LPAD("county_fips_code", 3, '0') AS "area_fips", "county_name"
    ```
- **Data Type Consistency:** Ensure that all FIPS codes are treated as strings to maintain consistency when concatenating and comparing.
- **Filtering Out NULL Values:** We include `WHERE "month3_emplvl_23_construction" IS NOT NULL` to exclude any records with null employment levels, which could affect the average calculations.
- **Ordering Results:** Adding `NULLS LAST` to the `ORDER BY` clause ensures that any null percentage increases are placed at the end of the result set.

**Result Format:**

After running the query, you should receive a single row with the county in Utah that experienced the greatest percentage increase in construction jobs from 2000 to 2018, along with the corresponding increase rate.

Example output:

```csv
County,Percentage_Increase
Wasatch,632.0513
```

*Note:* The actual county name and percentage increase may vary based on the data.

```

**Explanation:**

- **Issue Resolution:**
  - The previous attempts resulted in "No data found" because there was a mismatch in the formatting of the `"area_fips"` codes between the datasets.
  - The `"county_fips_code"` in the `COUNTIES` table already includes the state FIPS code, so concatenating or padding was causing mismatches.
  - By using `"county_fips_code"` directly as `"area_fips"`, the join conditions now correctly match the `"area_fips"` in the BLS QCEW tables.

- **Adjustments Made:**
  - **Removed Unnecessary Padding:**
    - In the `county_names` CTE, we now select `"county_fips_code"` directly without padding:
      ```sql
      SELECT "county_fips_code" AS "area_fips", "county_name"
      ```
  - **Ensured Data Types Match:**
    - Confirmed that `"area_fips"` in BLS QCEW tables and `"county_fips_code"` are in the same format and data type.
  - **Moved Filtering Conditions:**
    - Moved the `"area_fips" LIKE '49%'` condition inside each subquery in the `empl_2000` and `empl_2018` CTEs to ensure only Utah counties are selected before aggregation.
  - **Verified Non-Null Averages:**
    - Added `"month3_emplvl_23_construction" IS NOT NULL` to exclude null values from the averages.

- **Why This Should Work Now:**
  - **Matching FIPS Codes:**
    - By properly aligning the FIPS codes without unnecessary formatting, the joins should now successfully match records across the datasets.
  - **Data Exists:**
    - Since we have confirmed that data exists for Utah counties in both the BLS QCEW tables and the `COUNTIES` table, the query should return results.
  - **Handling Zero or Null Averages:**
    - The `WHERE e00."avg_emplvl_2000" > 0` clause ensures we don't divide by zero or include counties without employment data in 2000.

**Expected Output:**

After executing the query, you should receive one row indicating the Utah county with the greatest percentage increase in construction jobs from 2000 to 2018, along with the calculated increase rate.

Example:

```csv
County,Percentage_Increase
Wasatch,632.0513
```

*Note:* The actual county and percentage increase may vary depending on the data in your database.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Testing the Query:**
  - If you still encounter issues, try removing the `LIMIT 1` clause to see all counties and their percentage increases.
  - Verify that the `empl_2000` and `empl_2018` CTEs contain data by running them separately.
- **Data Consistency:**
  - Ensure that the data in the BLS QCEW tables and the `COUNTIES` table is up to date and correctly loaded.
- **Possible Discrepancies:**
  - If certain counties have zero or negligible employment in 2000, the percentage increase may be disproportionately high. Consider setting thresholds or minimum employment levels if needed.

2025-01-22 21:42:23 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which Utah county has witnessed the greatest percentage increase of construction jobs from 2000 to 2018? And what is the corresponding increase rate?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
County,Percentage_Increase
Washington County,250.0
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

Between 2000 and 2018, Washington County in Utah experienced the greatest percentage increase in construction jobs. The number of construction jobs grew by 250% during this period, reflecting significant growth in the county's construction industry. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
