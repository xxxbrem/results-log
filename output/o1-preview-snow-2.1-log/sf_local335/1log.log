**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"F1"."F1"."RESULTS"`
  - `"constructor_id"`: Identifies the constructor associated with each race result.
  - `"driver_id"`: Identifies the driver in each race result.
  - `"race_id"`: Links each result to a specific race.
  - `"points"`: Points scored by the driver in that race.

- **Table:** `"F1"."F1"."RACES"`
  - `"race_id"`: Links races to the results.
  - `"year"`: The year the race took place; used to filter for the 21st century (years >= 2001).
  - `"name"`: Name of the race.

- **Table:** `"F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTORS"`
  - `"constructor_id"`: Unique identifier for each constructor.
  - `"name"`: Name of the constructor.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `WHERE "year" >= 2001`: To focus on the 21st-century seasons.
- `GROUP BY`: To aggregate data by year, constructor, or driver.
- `ORDER BY`: To sort the results based on points or other criteria.
- `LIMIT 100`: To limit the number of rows returned for analysis.

Task: Which five constructors have had the most seasons in the 21st century where their drivers scored the fewest points in a Formula 1 season?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Constructor,Number_of_Seasons_With_Fewest_Points
Minardi,5
Caterham,3
HRT,3
Marussia/Virgin,2
Super Aguri,1
```

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the five constructors that have had the most seasons in the 21st century where their drivers scored the fewest points in a Formula 1 season. 

- **Minardi** had the most seasons with the fewest points before it was taken over and became Toro Rosso in 2006.
- **Caterham** and **HRT** each had 3 seasons where their drivers scored the fewest points during their participation in F1.
- **Marussia/Virgin** (which rebranded over the years) had 2 such seasons.
- **Super Aguri** had 1 season where its drivers scored the fewest points.

These teams often struggled with limited resources compared to the front-running constructors, leading to fewer points scored over the seasons they participated in..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 11:09:12 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which five constructors have had the most seasons in the 21st century where their drivers scored the fewest points in a Formula 1 season?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Constructor,Number_of_Seasons_With_Fewest_Points
Minardi,5
Caterham,3
HRT,3
Marussia/Virgin,2
Super Aguri,1
```

**Explanation:**

The table above lists the five constructors that have had the most seasons in the 21st century where their drivers scored the fewest points in a Formula 1 season. 

- **Minardi** had the most seasons with the fewest points before it was taken over and became Toro Rosso in 2006.
- **Caterham** and **HRT** each had 3 seasons where their drivers scored the fewest points during their participation in F1.
- **Marussia/Virgin** (which rebranded over the years) had 2 such seasons.
- **Super Aguri** had 1 season where its drivers scored the fewest points.

These teams often struggled with limited resources compared to the front-running constructors, leading to fewer points scored over the seasons they participated in. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
