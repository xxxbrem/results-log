After analyzing both SQL queries, we can determine which one is more suitable for identifying the hubs that saw more than a 20% increase in finished orders from February to March.

**Comparison of the SQL Queries:**

1. **`1result.sql`**:
   - Filters orders with status `'FINISHED'` and created in February or March.
   - Joins the `ORDERS`, `STORES`, and `HUBS` tables to associate orders with their respective hubs.
   - Calculates the number of finished orders per hub for February (`feb_finished_orders`) and March (`mar_finished_orders`).
   - Determines the percentage increase and selects hubs with more than a 20% increase.
   - **Note**: Does **not** specify the year in the query.

2. **`2result.sql`**:
   - Performs the same operations as `1result.sql`.
   - **Additionally**, includes a condition to filter orders from the year `2021` using `orders."order_created_year" = 2021`.
   - This ensures that only orders from the specified year are considered in the calculations.

**Reasoning:**

- Including the year in the filter is crucial to ensure data accuracy, especially if the database contains multiple years of data.
- By specifying `orders."order_created_year" = 2021`, `2result.sql` ensures that only orders from the relevant year are included, avoiding any potential discrepancies due to data from other years.
- This makes `2result.sql` more precise and reliable for the analysis.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above comparison, **`2result.sql`** is the correct choice because it includes an additional condition to filter the data by the specific year, ensuring the accuracy of the results.
