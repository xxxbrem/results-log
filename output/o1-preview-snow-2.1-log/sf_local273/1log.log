**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve product IDs and names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List distinct product IDs from order lines:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get total quantity ordered per product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_quantity_ordered"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES"
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve total quantity picked per product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_quantity_picked"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE"
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Fetch product names with their total ordered quantities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."name", SUM(ol."qty") AS "total_quantity_ordered"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" ol
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" p ON ol."product_id" = p."id"
   GROUP BY p."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Fetch product names with their total picked quantities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."name", SUM(pl."qty") AS "total_quantity_picked"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" p ON pl."product_id" = p."id"
   GROUP BY p."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **View inventory quantities by product and purchase date:**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", pu."purchased", i."qty" AS "inventory_quantity"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pu ON i."purchase_id" = pu."id"
   ORDER BY pu."purchased" ASC, i."qty" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List product names with total ordered and picked quantities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."name", 
          SUM(ol."qty") AS "total_quantity_ordered", 
          SUM(pl."qty") AS "total_quantity_picked"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" p
   LEFT JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" ol ON p."id" = ol."product_id"
   LEFT JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl ON p."id" = pl."product_id"
   GROUP BY p."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve inventory details for a specific product (e.g., product ID = 1):**

   ```sql
   SELECT i."product_id", pu."purchased", i."qty" AS "inventory_quantity"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."INVENTORY" i
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PURCHASES" pu ON i."purchase_id" = pu."id"
   WHERE i."product_id" = 1
   ORDER BY pu."purchased" ASC, i."qty" ASC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate pick percentage for each product:**

    ```sql
    SELECT p."name",
           SUM(ol."qty") AS "total_quantity_ordered",
           SUM(pl."qty") AS "total_quantity_picked",
           (SUM(pl."qty") / SUM(ol."qty")) * 100 AS "pick_percentage"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" p
    LEFT JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."ORDERLINES" ol ON p."id" = ol."product_id"
    LEFT JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PICKING_LINE" pl ON p."id" = pl."product_id"
    GROUP BY p."name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: What is the average pick percentage for each product (by name), considering the quantity picked from inventory locations that are ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity, while ensuring that the picked quantity matches the overlapping range between the order quantity and the available inventory?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product_name1:str,pick_percentage1:float
product_name2:str,pick_percentage2:float
...
```

**Explanation:** 

For each product, the average pick percentage is calculated by dividing the total quantity picked from inventory by the total quantity ordered for that product. The picking process considers inventory locations ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity, ensuring that the picked quantities match the overlapping range between the order quantities and the available inventory..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 17:20:19 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the average pick percentage for each product (by name), considering the quantity picked from inventory locations that are ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity, while ensuring that the picked quantity matches the overlapping range between the order quantity and the available inventory?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product_name1:str,pick_percentage1:float
product_name2:str,pick_percentage2:float
...
```

**Explanation:** 

For each product, the average pick percentage is calculated by dividing the total quantity picked from inventory by the total quantity ordered for that product. The picking process considers inventory locations ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity, ensuring that the picked quantities match the overlapping range between the order quantities and the available inventory. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
