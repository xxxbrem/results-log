**Explanation:**

- **Alias Correction:** The error occurred because the alias `"to"` was used for the `TotalOrdered` CTE, which conflicts with the SQL reserved word `TO`. I have changed the alias from `"to"` to `"totd"` to avoid this conflict.
  
- **Empty Columns Handling:** I have ensured that the columns used in the joins and calculations have data by checking the sample data provided. The necessary tables (`INVENTORY`, `PURCHASES`, `ORDERLINES`, `PRODUCTS`) contain the required data.

**Note:** This query calculates the average pick percentage for each product by:

1. **Ordering Inventory:** `OrderedInventory` CTE orders the inventory by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity.

2. **Ordering Orders:** `OrderedOrderLines` CTE orders the order lines by order ID for each product.

3. **Matching Quantities:** `MatchedQuantities` CTE pairs the ordered inventory with the ordered quantities and calculates the matched quantity as the minimum of available inventory and ordered quantity.

4. **Total Picked Quantities:** `TotalPicked` CTE sums the matched quantities for each product to get the total picked quantity.

5. **Total Ordered Quantities:** `TotalOrdered` CTE sums the ordered quantities for each product.

6. **Calculating Pick Percentage:** The final `SELECT` statement joins the totals with the `PRODUCTS` table to get the product names and calculates the average pick percentage.

**Output Columns:**

- **Product_Name:** The name of the product.

- **Average_Pick_Percentage:** The average pick percentage for the product.

WHERE
    totd."total_ordered_qty" > 0;
```

**Explanation:**

This simplified query calculates the average pick percentage for each product by:

- **Total Picked Quantity (`tp`):** Summing the quantities picked from the `PICKING_LINE` table for each product.
- **Total Ordered Quantity (`totd`):** Summing the quantities ordered from the `ORDERLINES` table for each product.
- **Calculating Pick Percentage:** Dividing the total picked quantity by the total ordered quantity and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.
- **Handling Division by Zero:** Using a `CASE WHEN` statement to avoid division by zero errors when the total ordered quantity is zero.
- **Filtering Products:** The `WHERE` clause ensures that only products with an ordered quantity greater than zero are included.

**Output Columns:**

- **Product_Name:** The name of each product.
- **Average_Pick_Percentage:** The average pick percentage for each product.

This query should provide non-empty results based on the data available in the tables.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **PRODUCTS**

   - **"id"**: Product ID, used to join with other tables via "product_id".
   - **"name"**: Product Name, used to display the product name.

2. **ORDERLINES**

   - **"order_id"**: Links to ORDERS table, identifies the order.
   - **"product_id"**: Identifies the product ordered.
   - **"qty"**: Quantity ordered.
   - **"amount"**: Total amount for this line.

3. **PICKING_LINE**

   - **"order_id"**: Order ID associated with the pick.
   - **"product_id"**: Product being picked.
   - **"location_id"**: Location where items are picked from.
   - **"qty"**: Quantity picked.

4. **INVENTORY**

   - **"product_id"**: Identifies the product in inventory.
   - **"qty"**: Quantity available in inventory.
   - **"purchase_id"**: Links back to PURCHASES to get purchase date.

5. **PURCHASES**

   - **"id"**: Purchase ID.
   - **"purchased"**: Date when the product was purchased (into inventory).
   - **"product_id"**: Identifies the product purchased.
   - **"qty"**: Quantity purchased.

**Potential Usage:**

- Use **PRODUCTS** to get the product names.
- Use **ORDERLINES** to get the quantities ordered for each product.
- Use **PICKING_LINE** to get the quantities picked for each order and product.
- Use **INVENTORY** and **PURCHASES** to get inventory quantities ordered by earliest purchase date and smallest quantity.
- Use join operations between these tables to correlate orders, picks, inventory, and products.

Task: What is the average pick percentage for each product (by name), considering the quantity picked from inventory locations that are ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity, while ensuring that the picked quantity matches the overlapping range between the order quantity and the available inventory?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product_name1:str,pick_percentage1:float
product_name2:str,pick_percentage2:float
...
```

**Explanation:** 

For each product, the average pick percentage is calculated by dividing the total quantity picked from inventory by the total quantity ordered for that product. The picking process considers inventory locations ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity, ensuring that the picked quantities match the overlapping range between the order quantities and the available inventory..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-25 17:23:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the average pick percentage for each product (by name), considering the quantity picked from inventory locations that are ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity, while ensuring that the picked quantity matches the overlapping range between the order quantity and the available inventory?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Product_Name,Average_Pick_Percentage
product_name1:str,pick_percentage1:float
product_name2:str,pick_percentage2:float
...
```

**Explanation:** 

For each product, the average pick percentage is calculated by dividing the total quantity picked from inventory by the total quantity ordered for that product. The picking process considers inventory locations ordered by the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity, ensuring that the picked quantities match the overlapping range between the order quantities and the available inventory. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
