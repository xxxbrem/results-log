After comparing the two SQL queries, **1result.sql** is the correct choice. This is because it uses the condition `"cumulative_confirmed" > 50000`, which precisely matches the task's requirement of selecting countries with **over 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases**. The second query (`2result.sql`) includes countries with exactly 50,000 cases due to the condition `"cumulative_confirmed" >= 50000`, which does not strictly meet the "over 50,000" criterion.
