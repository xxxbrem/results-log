Comparing the three SQL queries:

**Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**

- Filters blocks mined in 2023 using `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ...) = 2023`.
- Calculates intervals between blocks within 2023.
- Does **not** include the interval between the first block of 2023 and the last block of 2022.
- May slightly skew the average intervals, especially on the first day of the year.

**Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`):**

- Calculates intervals between all consecutive blocks in the dataset.
- Filters intervals where the current block's date is in 2023.
- Intervals include the time between the first block of 2023 and the last block of 2022.
- Ensures all intervals are associated with blocks mined in 2023.

**Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`):**

- Uses a self-join on block numbers to find consecutive blocks (`b1."number" = b2."number" + 1`).
- Filters blocks where the current block (`b1`) is mined in 2023.
- Includes intervals where the previous block (`b2`) could be from 2022.
- Provides accurate intervals for blocks mined in 2023, including the transition from 2022 to 2023.

**Reason for Choosing Candidate 2:**

Candidate 2's SQL query accurately computes the average block intervals for blocks mined in 2023 by:

- Including the time difference between each block in 2023 and its immediate predecessor, even if the predecessor block was mined in 2022.
- Ensuring all intervals are associated with blocks mined in 2023.
- Providing a more accurate representation of block intervals, especially on the first day of 2023.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

```plaintext
2result.sql
```
