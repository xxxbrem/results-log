1result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

We choose **`1result.sql`** as the correct SQL because it accurately computes the difference in the average number of deaths among white people due to discharges (excluding urethral discharge, firework discharge, and legal intervention involving firearm discharge) compared to vehicle-related incidents, averaged across different ages.

**Explanation:**

- **Explicit Race Identification:** The query joins the `DEATH.DEATH.RACE` table to accurately obtain the race code for 'White' (`r."Description" = 'White'`). This ensures that the race filter is dynamic and not hard-coded, enhancing the query's reliability.

- **Computation of Averages:**
  - It calculates the **total number of deaths** (`COUNT(*) AS total_deaths`) and the **total number of distinct ages** (`COUNT(DISTINCT dr."Age") AS total_ages`) for both discharges and vehicle-related incidents.
  - The **average number of deaths** is computed by dividing the total deaths by the total ages (`average_deaths`), which is mathematically accurate for calculating the mean deaths per age group.

- **Exclusion of Specific Discharges:** The query properly excludes deaths due to urethral discharge, firework discharge, and legal intervention involving firearm discharge by using `NOT ILIKE` conditions.

- **Clarity and Accuracy:** The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) (`discharge_stats` and `vehicle_stats`) makes the query readable and logically organized. Each step of the computation is clear, facilitating easier verification and maintenance.

- **Consistent Results:** The result from `1result.sql` matches with that of `2result.sql` (both yielding a difference of approximately **42.5447**), indicating consistency and correctness. The slight discrepancy with `0result.sql` suggests that `1result.sql` is more precise, possibly due to the method of calculating averages.

- **Mathematical Correctness:** By computing the average deaths per age as **total deaths divided by total ages**, the query aligns with the standard definition of an average, ensuring mathematical accuracy.

**Conclusion:**

**`1result.sql`** is selected as it provides a precise, reliable, and methodologically sound calculation in line with the task's requirements, effectively answering how much higher the average number of deaths due to discharges is compared to vehicle-related incidents among white people across different ages.
