After reviewing the SQL queries and their corresponding results, here is the comparison and reasoning for selecting the correct SQL:

### **Comparison of the SQL Queries:**

#### **Option 1: `0result.sql`**

- **Approach:**
  - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank compositions per interest category (`interest_id`).
  - Selects the highest composition per interest category where `rn = 1`.
  - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` again to rank the top and bottom compositions across all categories.
  - Outputs exactly one record per interest category, even if there are ties in composition values.

- **Potential Issue:**
  - If multiple records for an interest category have the same highest composition value (ties), only one record will be selected, potentially missing other records with the same maximum composition.

#### **Option 2: `1result.sql`**

- **Approach:**
  - Uses `RANK()` to rank compositions per interest category.
  - Selects all records with the highest composition per interest category where `comp_rank = 1`.
  - This means if there are ties (multiple records with the same highest composition), all of them are included.
  - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank the overall top and bottom compositions across all categories.
  - Ensures that all interest categories with the same highest composition are considered, and ties are accurately reflected.

- **Advantage:**
  - Accurately handles ties by including all records with the highest composition for each interest category.
  - Provides a more comprehensive result set, especially when multiple categories share the same composition values.

#### **Option 3: `2result.sql`**

- **Approach:**
  - Similar to Option 1, it uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to select the highest composition per interest category.
  - Does not account for ties in the highest composition values within an interest category.

- **Potential Issue:**
  - Like Option 1, it may exclude additional records that have the same maximum composition due to the use of `ROW_NUMBER()`.

### **Reason for Selecting `1result.sql`:**

- **Accurate Handling of Ties:**
  - By using `RANK()`, `1result.sql` includes all interest categories that have the same highest composition value.
  - This aligns with the task's requirement to identify interest categories based on their highest compositions without arbitrarily excluding tied values.

- **Comprehensive Results:**
  - Ensures that no interest category is overlooked when multiple categories share the same top or bottom composition values.
  - Provides a fair representation of the data by considering all tied records.

- **Adherence to Requirements:**
  - The task specifies identifying interest categories based on their highest composition values across all months.
  - `1result.sql` fulfills this by accurately capturing all top and bottom categories, including those with tied compositions.

### **Conclusion:**

Considering the need to accurately reflect ties and provide a comprehensive result set that aligns with the task's requirements, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice.
