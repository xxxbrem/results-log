Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we'll start by identifying the relevant tables and columns, considering the conditions that may be used. Then, we'll provide at least 10 different Snowflake SQL queries to explore the data and understand the values in related columns.

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

**Table:** `BANK_SALES_TRADING.BANK_SALES_TRADING.CLEANED_WEEKLY_SALES`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"week_date"**: Used to identify the dates of each week's sales data.
- **"week_number"**: Helps in filtering data for specific weeks before and after June 15, 2020.
- **"calendar_year"**: Used to filter data for the year 2020.
- **"region"**: Attribute to analyze sales performance impact by different regions.
- **"platform"**: Attribute to analyze sales performance impact by different platforms.
- **"age_band"**: Attribute to analyze sales performance impact by different age bands.
- **"demographic"**: Attribute to analyze sales performance impact by different demographics.
- **"customer_type"**: Attribute to analyze sales performance impact by different customer types.
- **"sales"**: Numeric value representing sales, used to calculate average sales and percentage changes.
  
**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Date Range Filtering**: Select data for 12 weeks before and after June 15, 2020. Assuming week 25 corresponds to June 15, 2020, we'll use weeks 13-24 (before) and weeks 26-37 (after).
- **Grouping**: Group data by attributes like region, platform, age_band, demographic, and customer_type to calculate average sales.
- **Calculations**: Compute the average percentage change in sales for each attribute.

    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help us understand the structure of the data and gather the necessary information to analyze the sales performance impact across various attributes before and after June 15, 2020.

**Note:** The date ranges are determined based on the assumption that week 25 corresponds to the week of June 15, 2020. Weeks 13-24 represent the 12 weeks before, and weeks 26-37 represent the 12 weeks after. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual week numbering in the data.

By executing these queries, you can collect the data required to compute the average percentage change in sales for each attribute and identify the one with the highest negative impact.Query:
SELECT * 
   FROM BANK_SALES_TRADING.BANK_SALES_TRADING.CLEANED_WEEKLY_SALES 
   LIMIT 100;

Task: Analyze the average sales performance impact 12 weeks before and after June 15, 2020, across various attributes like regions, platforms, age bands, demographics, and customer types. Identify and provide the attribute with the highest negative impact on sales, detailing the average percentage change in sales for that attribute.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Attribute,Average_Percentage_Change
attribute_name:str,average_percentage_change:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The attribute with the highest negative impact on sales is **attribute_name**, with an average percentage change of **average_percentage_change%** over the analyzed period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'BANK_SALES_TRADING': {'BANK_SALES_TRADING': ['BITCOIN_MEMBERS', 'BITCOIN_PRICES', 'BITCOIN_TRANSACTIONS', 'CLEANED_WEEKLY_SALES', 'CUSTOMER_NODES', 'CUSTOMER_REGIONS', 'CUSTOMER_TRANSACTIONS', 'INTEREST_MAP', 'INTEREST_METRICS', 'SHOPPING_CART_CAMPAIGN_IDENTIFIER', 'SHOPPING_CART_EVENTS', 'SHOPPING_CART_EVENT_IDENTIFIER', 'SHOPPING_CART_PAGE_HIERARCHY', 'SHOPPING_CART_USERS', 'VEG_CAT', 'VEG_LOSS_RATE_DF', 'VEG_TXN_DF', 'VEG_WHSLE_DF', 'WEEKLY_SALES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
