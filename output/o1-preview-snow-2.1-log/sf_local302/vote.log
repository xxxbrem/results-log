After reviewing the provided SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL that addresses the task effectively.

**Reasoning:**

- **Objective:** The task is to identify the attribute with the highest negative impact on sales by calculating the average percentage change in sales before and after June 15, 2020, across various attributes (regions, platforms, age bands, demographics, and customer types).

- **Analysis of the SQL Queries:**

  - **`0result.sql`:** This query calculates the average percentage change in sales for each attribute value within each attribute category. It combines the results using `UNION ALL` and selects the attribute with the highest negative percentage change (most negative value). According to the results (`0result.csv`), the attribute **'Age Band - unknown'** has the highest negative impact on sales with an average percentage change of **-3.3423%**.

  - **`1result.sql`:** Similar to the first query, this SQL also calculates the average percentage change for each attribute value but identifies **'Region: ASIA'** as having the highest negative impact with a percentage change of **-3.1156%**. However, this is less negative than the percentage change for 'Age Band - unknown' from `0result.sql`.

  - **`2result.sql`:** This query calculates the average percentage change for each attribute category as a whole (not for individual attribute values). It identifies **'demographic'** as the attribute category with the highest negative impact, with an average percentage change of **-1.9841%**. However, the task requires identifying a specific attribute (attribute value), not the entire category.

- **Conclusion:** The task specifically asks for the attribute (attribute value) that experienced the highest negative impact on sales. **`0result.sql`** correctly identifies the attribute 'Age Band - unknown' with the highest negative average percentage change of -3.3423%, which aligns with the data provided earlier in the conversation. Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is the appropriate choice.
