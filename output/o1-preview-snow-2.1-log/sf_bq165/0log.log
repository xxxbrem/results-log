This query counts the number of distinct cases per chromosome for the selected samples with morphology code `'3111'` (breast cancer) or topology code `'0401'` (adenocarcinoma). By concatenating `"RefNo"` and `"CaseNo"` using `||`, we ensure that each unique combination of these identifiers is treated as a distinct case. This adjustment resolves the issue of the previous query returning no data due to the `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` syntax.

This corrected query handles cases where the `"Start"` and `"End"` positions are zero by assigning the value `'Entire Chromosome'` to the `"cytoband_name"` column. It uses a `CASE` statement to check for these conditions and ensures that all columns have appropriate values. The `LEFT JOIN` with `"CYTOBANDS_HG38"` allows the query to include all abnormalities, even if they don't map to a specific cytoband, assigning `'Unknown'` when no match is found.

**Explanation:**

The error occurred because `"b"."hg38_start"` was used in the `ORDER BY` clause without being included in either the `SELECT` list or the `GROUP BY` clause. In SQL, when using `GROUP BY`, the `ORDER BY` clause can only reference columns that are included in the `SELECT` list or the `GROUP BY` clause.

To resolve this issue, `COALESCE(b."hg38_start", 0) AS "hg38_start"` was added to the `SELECT` list and included in the `GROUP BY` clause. This ensures that `"hg38_start"` is available for use in the `ORDER BY` clause, allowing the results to be correctly sorted by chromosome and starting base-pair position.

-- 20. Retrieve cases with gains involving specific chromosomes
SELECT c."RefNo", c."CaseNo", c."Chr", c."Type"
FROM "MITELMAN"."PROD"."CYTOCONVERTED" c
JOIN "MITELMAN"."PROD"."CYTOGEN" g
    ON c."RefNo" = g."RefNo" AND c."CaseNo" = g."CaseNo"

LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

The error occurred because the query starts with a `WHERE` clause, which is not valid SQL syntax. In SQL, every query must begin with a `SELECT` statement. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records and must be part of a `SELECT` statement.

To fix the error:

- Begin the query with `SELECT` and include the columns you want to retrieve.
- Ensure that the `FROM` clause specifies the tables you're querying.
- Place the `WHERE` clause after the `FROM` and any `JOIN` clauses.

Additionally, make sure that the chromosome values in the `IN` clause match the format in your data:

- If chromosomes are represented as `'1'`, `'2'`, `'3'` in the `Chr` column, use those values.
- If they are represented with the `'chr'` prefix (e.g., `'chr1'`, `'chr2'`, `'chr3'`), adjust the values accordingly.

In this corrected query, we've started with the `SELECT` statement and ensured that the `WHERE` clause follows it, which resolves the syntax error.

Task: Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'MITELMAN': {'PROD': ['AUTHORREFERENCE', 'CYTOBANDS_HG38', 'CYTOCONVERTED', 'CYTOCONVERTEDLOG', 'CYTOGEN', 'CYTOGENINV', 'CYTOGENINVVALID', 'KARYABNORM', 'KARYBIT', 'KARYBREAK', 'KARYCLONE', 'KODER', 'MOLBIOLCLINASSOC', 'MOLCLINABNORM', 'MOLCLINBREAK', 'MOLCLINGENE', 'RECURRENTDATA', 'RECURRENTNUMDATA', 'REFERENCE']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 05:31:12 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:31:53 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:34:01 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:35:12 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:36:52 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

**Explanation:**

Upon reviewing the data and the available columns in the tables, it appears that the `"Type"` column in the `"CYTOCONVERTED"` table contains only `'Gain'` and `'Loss'` as distinct values. There are no entries labeled as `'Amplification'` or `'Homozygous Deletion'`. Additionally, there are no columns indicating the number of copies gained or lost, such as `"CopyNumber"`, which would allow us to distinguish between simple gains/losses and amplifications or homozygous deletions.

Given this limitation, we cannot compute the counts and frequencies for amplifications and homozygous deletions directly from the available data. Therefore, in the query above, the counts and frequencies for `amplifications` and `hom_del` are set to zero.

The query calculates the counts and frequencies for gains and losses per chromosomal band, as requested. It joins the necessary tables and groups the data accordingly, sorting the results by chromosome ordinal and start/end positions of each band in ascending order.

**Note:** If additional data becomes available that allows for distinguishing amplifications and homozygous deletions from simple gains and losses—such as specific indicators in another table or additional columns in the existing tables—the query would need to be adjusted to incorporate that information.

2025-01-27 05:38:41 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:40:22 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-27 05:42:12 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you use CytoConverter genomic coordinates to calculate the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology='3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology='0401') samples? Concretely, please include the number and frequency (2 decimals in percentage) of amplifications (gains of more than 1 copy), gains (1 extra copy), losses (1 copy) and homozygous deletions (loss of 2 copies) for each chromosomal band. And sort the result by the ordinal of each chromosome and the starting-ending base-pair position of each band in ascending order., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
chromosome_ord,chromosome,band,start_pos,end_pos,amplifications_count,amplifications_frequency,gains_count,gains_frequency,losses_count,losses_frequency,hom_del_count,hom_del_frequency
chr_ord:int,chr:str,band:str,start:int,end:int,amp_count:int,amp_freq:float[0-100],gain_count:int,gain_freq:float[0-100],loss_count:int,loss_freq:float[0-100],hom_del_count:int,hom_del_freq:float[0-100]
...
```

This table lists the frequency of chromosomal gains and losses across a cohort of breast cancer (morphology code '3111') and adenocarcinoma (topology code '0401') samples. Each row represents a chromosomal band, sorted by chromosome ordinal and base-pair positions. The counts and frequencies (as percentages with two decimal points) are provided for amplifications, gains, losses, and homozygous deletions within each band. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
