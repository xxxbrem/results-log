After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL.

**Reason:**

- **`2result.sql`** uses the unique team IDs for the Wildcats (`'2267a1f4-68f6-418b-aaf6-2aa0c4b291f1'`) and the Fighting Irish (`'80962f09-8821-48b6-8cf0-0cf0eea56aa8'`), ensuring accurate cumulative scores for each team.
- By referencing team IDs instead of team names, it avoids ambiguity in cases where multiple teams share the same name (e.g., "Wildcats").
- The query provides all the required details:
  - **Period**
  - **Game Clock**
  - **Team Scores** (cumulative, formatted as "Wildcats Score - Fighting Irish Score")
  - **Scoring Team**
  - **Event Description**
- The results are arranged chronologically by period and elapsed time, fulfilling the requirement for an orderly summary.
