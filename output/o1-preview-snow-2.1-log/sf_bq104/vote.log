After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query that identifies which DMA had the highest search scores for the terms that were top rising one year ago is **`1result.sql`**.

**Explanation:**

- **`0result.sql`**:
  - This query selects data from the `TOP_RISING_TERMS` table.
  - It sums the `"score"` values for each DMA from the `TOP_RISING_TERMS` table for the specified date range.
  - **Issue**: The `"score"` in `TOP_RISING_TERMS` represents the score related to rising terms, which might not reflect the actual search volumes from `TOP_TERMS`. We need the search scores from `TOP_TERMS` to accurately calculate total search scores for the top rising terms.

- **`1result.sql`**:
  - This query correctly identifies terms that were top rising one year ago from `TOP_RISING_TERMS`.
  - It then retrieves the corresponding search scores for those terms from `TOP_TERMS` for the same week.
  - The query sums the `"score"` values from `TOP_TERMS` for each DMA, providing an accurate total search score per DMA for the top rising terms.
  - **This approach aligns perfectly with the task requirements**, as it calculates the total search scores from `TOP_TERMS` for the terms that were top rising one year ago.

- **`2result.sql`**:
  - While this query selects terms from `TOP_RISING_TERMS` for the correct date range, it does **not** filter the `TOP_TERMS` data by the same date range.
  - As a result, it sums the search scores from `TOP_TERMS` across **all time periods**, not just from one year ago.
  - This leads to an inaccurate total, as it includes search scores outside the intended time frame.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct query because it accurately calculates the total search scores per DMA for the terms that were top rising one year ago, using the appropriate data from both `TOP_RISING_TERMS` and `TOP_TERMS` for the same time period.
