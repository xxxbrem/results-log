After reviewing the provided SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct query for determining the highest number of page views for different pages under the website `"shop.googlemerchandisestore.com"` in December 2020.

**Reasoning:**

- **`0result.sql`** aggregates page views for all pages under `"shop.googlemerchandisestore.com"` by using a `LIKE` condition that matches any URL containing the domain.
- It groups the results by `"Page_URL"`, allowing for a comparison of page views across all different pages within the website.
- The query then orders the results in descending order of page views and limits the output to the top result, effectively identifying the page with the highest number of views.
- In contrast, **`2result.sql`** filters for a specific URL (`'https://shop.googlemerchandisestore.com/'`), which doesn't account for other pages under the domain and doesn't answer the question regarding different pages.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** correctly identifies the page with the highest number of page views among all pages under `"shop.googlemerchandisestore.com"` in December 2020.
