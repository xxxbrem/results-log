After analyzing the three SQL queries and their results, we can determine which one correctly answers the question:

**Question:** *What's the most popular other purchased product in July 2017 with consumers who bought products relevant to YouTube?*

**Analysis:**

1. **First SQL (`0result.sql`):**
   - This query identifies all visitors who purchased YouTube-related products during July 2017.
   - It then retrieves all other products purchased by these visitors throughout July 2017, regardless of whether the purchases were made in the same transaction or session.
   - The result shows a very high purchase count for the most popular product ("Google Men's 100% Cotton Short Sleeve Hero Tee White") because it includes all purchases made by these visitors, not just those associated with YouTube product purchases.
   - **Limitation:** It may include purchases made by these visitors in separate sessions or transactions where no YouTube products were involved, which does not precisely answer the question.

2. **Second SQL (`1result.sql`):**
   - This query refines the approach by considering the specific sessions (`fullVisitorId` and `visitId`) where YouTube products were purchased.
   - It identifies other products purchased in those same sessions, excluding YouTube products.
   - While this is more precise than the first query, it still includes all products from the sessions where YouTube products were viewed or interacted with, not necessarily purchased together.
   - **Limitation:** It may capture products browsed or added to the cart but not necessarily purchased in conjunction with YouTube products.

3. **Third SQL (`2result.sql`):**
   - This query focuses on the exact transactions where YouTube products were purchased by identifying `transactionId`s associated with YouTube product purchases.
   - It then finds other products purchased within those same transactions, ensuring they were bought together with YouTube products.
   - The result ("Google Spiral Journal with Pen" with a purchase count of 502) reflects products that were most frequently purchased in the same transactions as YouTube products.
   - **Strength:** This approach precisely answers the question by identifying products purchased alongside YouTube products in the same transaction, providing an accurate measure of association.

**Conclusion:**

The **third SQL query (`2result.sql`)** is the most accurate and appropriate for answering the question. It directly identifies the most popular other product purchased **together** with YouTube-related products in the same transactions during July 2017.

**Output:**
