```

**Explanation:**

This query calculates the total length of each highway type within the `PLANET_FEATURES` table. Here's how it works:

- **Extract Highway Types:**
  - `"all_tags":'highway'::STRING AS "highway_type"` extracts the specific type of highway from the `all_tags` VARIANT column.
  - The `WHERE` clause filters only those features where the `highway` tag exists.

- **Calculate Lengths:**
  - `ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKB("geometry")` converts the binary `geometry` column into a GEOMETRY object.
  - `ST_LENGTH(...)` computes the length of the geometry.

- **Aggregate Lengths:**
  - `SUM(ST_LENGTH(...))` sums up the lengths of all geometries for each highway type.

- **Group and Order Results:**
  - `GROUP BY "highway_type"` groups the results by highway type.
  - `ORDER BY "total_length_meters" DESC` sorts the highway types by total length in descending order.

- **Limit Results:**
  - `LIMIT 5` restricts the output to the top five highway types by total length.

**Note:**

- This query assumes that the functions `ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKB` and `ST_LENGTH` are available in your Snowflake environment.
- If you encounter errors due to unsupported functions or data types, you may need to check your Snowflake version or enable the necessary GIS functions.
- Since we do not have the exact geometry of Denmark or the ability to use `ST_MAKEENVELOPE` or other spatial functions that are causing errors, this query does not limit the features to those within Denmark. To include only highways within Denmark, you'd need to join with a table containing Denmark's boundary geometry and use spatial predicates like `ST_WITHIN`, provided the functions are available.

LIMIT 5;
```

**Explanation:**

The error you're encountering indicates that the function `ST_LENGTH` cannot process a `BINARY` data type directly. Here's how the query addresses this issue:

1. **Convert 'geometry' from BINARY to GEOMETRY:**
   - The `geometry` column is stored as `BINARY(8388608)` (Well-Known Binary format).
   - Use `ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKB(t."geometry")` to convert the binary data into a GEOMETRY object that spatial functions can work with.

2. **Compute the Length of Each Feature:**
   - `ST_LENGTH(ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKB(t."geometry"))` calculates the length of each geometry feature.

3. **Extract Highway Types:**
   - `LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => t."all_tags") k` unpacks the `all_tags` VARIANT column to access key-value pairs.
   - The `WHERE` clause `k.KEY = 'highway'` filters for features that have the `highway` tag.
   - `k.VALUE::STRING AS "highway_type"` extracts the specific type of highway (e.g., 'motorway', 'trunk').

4. **Aggregate Total Lengths:**
   - `SUM(ST_LENGTH(...)) AS "total_length_meters"` sums up the lengths of all features grouped by highway type.

5. **Group and Order Results:**
   - `GROUP BY "highway_type"` groups the data by each highway type.
   - `ORDER BY "total_length_meters" DESC` sorts the results in descending order of total length.

6. **Limit to Top Five:**
   - `LIMIT 5` ensures that only the top five highway types by total length are returned.

**Note on Denmark Boundary:**

To limit the results to highways within the boundary of Denmark (Wikidata ID 'Q35'), you would need to have the polygon geometry of Denmark available in your database. Assuming you have a table or a way to represent Denmark's geometry (let's call it `denmark_geometry`), you can modify the query as follows:

```sql
WITH denmark AS (
    -- Replace this with the actual method to obtain Denmark's geometry.
    SELECT ST_GEOMETRYFROMTEXT('MULTIPOLYGON(((...)))') AS geom
)
SELECT 
    k.VALUE::STRING AS "highway_type",
    SUM(ST_LENGTH(
        ST_INTERSECTION(
            ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKB(t."geometry"), denmark.geom
        )
    )) AS "total_length_meters"
FROM 
    "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES" t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => t."all_tags") k,
    denmark
WHERE 
    k.KEY = 'highway'
    AND ST_INTERSECTS(ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKB(t."geometry"), denmark.geom)
GROUP BY 
    "highway_type"
ORDER BY 
    "total_length_meters" DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Important:**

- Replace `'MULTIPOLYGON(((...)))'` with the actual WKT representation of Denmark's boundary.
- If you have the geometry in another table, join it accordingly.
- Ensure that all spatial functions (`ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKB`, `ST_LENGTH`, `ST_INTERSECTION`, `ST_INTERSECTS`) are available in your Snowflake environment.

**Handling Errors:**

- If you receive an error like `Unknown function ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKB`, it indicates that the spatial functions are not enabled in your Snowflake account.
- To use spatial functions, you may need to have the **Geospatial Data feature** enabled. Contact your Snowflake administrator or support to enable this feature.

**Alternate Approach Without Spatial Functions:**

If you cannot use spatial functions, you might need to limit your analysis to counting the number of features per highway type:

```sql
SELECT 
    k.VALUE::STRING AS "highway_type",
    COUNT(*) AS "feature_count"
FROM 
    "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES" t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => t."all_tags") k
WHERE 
    k.KEY = 'highway'
GROUP BY 
    "highway_type"
ORDER BY 
    "feature_count" DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

This query will give you the top five highway types by the number of features, not by total length.

---

**Summary:**

To solve your task:

- Use `ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKB` to convert binary geometries to GEOMETRY objects.
- Use spatial functions like `ST_LENGTH`, `ST_INTERSECTION`, and `ST_INTERSECTS` to calculate lengths and filter by geographic boundaries.
- Ensure that the spatial data features are enabled in your Snowflake environment.

The error you're encountering is due to the placeholder `'POLYGON((...))'` in the `ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMTEXT` function, which is not a valid Well-Known Text (WKT) representation of a polygon. The `ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMTEXT` or `ST_GEOMETRYFROMTEXT` functions require a valid WKT string that defines a geometry object.

To resolve this issue, we need to replace the placeholder with the actual geometry of Denmark. Since we might not have the WKT representation readily available, we can extract Denmark's geometry directly from the `PLANET_FEATURES` table using its Wikidata ID `'Q35'`.

**Steps in the Corrected Query:**

1. **Extract Denmark's Geometry:**

   - We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `denmark` that selects the geometry of Denmark from the `PLANET_FEATURES` table.
   - We filter the features where the `all_tags` contain `'wikidata'` equal to `'Q35'`.
   - The `GET` function extracts the value associated with the `'wikidata'` key from the `all_tags` VARIANT column.
   - We limit the result to one record since there should be only one geometry for Denmark.

2. **Select Highway Features Within Denmark:**

   - We join the `denmark` CTE with the `PLANET_FEATURES` table to access other features.
   - We use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to extract key-value pairs from the `all_tags` column of the features.
   - We filter for features where the key is `'highway'`, indicating that the feature is a type of highway.

3. **Filter Features Within Denmark's Boundary:**

   - We use `ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKB` to convert the binary `geometry` columns into GEOMETRY objects.
   - We apply `ST_INTERSECTS` to check if the feature geometry intersects with Denmark's geometry.
   - Alternatively, `ST_WITHIN` can be used if we want features entirely within Denmark.

4. **Calculate Lengths and Aggregate:**

   - We compute the intersection of each highway feature with Denmark's geometry using `ST_INTERSECTION`.
   - We calculate the length of these intersections with `ST_LENGTH`.
   - We sum the lengths for each `highway_type` to get the total length per type.

5. **Group and Order Results:**

   - We group the results by `highway_type`.
   - We order the results by `total_length_meters` in descending order to get the longest types first.
   - We limit the output to the top five highway types using `LIMIT 5`.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the spatial functions `ST_LENGTH`, `ST_INTERSECTION`, `ST_INTERSECTS`, and `ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKB` are available in your Snowflake environment. If they are not enabled, you may need to contact your Snowflake administrator to enable geospatial features.
- If you still encounter "No data found" errors, it might be due to the absence of the Denmark geometry or highway features in your dataset. Consider verifying the data or adjusting the query accordingly.
- The `GET` function is used instead of directly accessing the `all_tags` with square brackets to avoid syntax issues and ensure compatibility.

**Final Result Format:**

The query will return the five longest highway types within Denmark by total length:

```csv
highway_type,total_length_meters
type1,float_value1
type2,float_value2
type3,float_value3
type4,float_value4
type5,float_value5
```

(Attention: answer in five rows)

By extracting Denmark's geometry from the dataset and using it within the query, we resolve the parsing error and accurately filter highway features within Denmark's boundaries.

## ST_DWITHIN

Returns TRUE if the minimum geodesic distance between two points (two GEOGRAPHY objects) is within the specified distance. Otherwise, returns FALSE.
If the parameters are GEOGRAPHY values that are not points (e.g. lines or polygons), this returns TRUE or FALSE based on the minimum geodesic distance between the two closest points of the two values.

Tip You can use the search optimization service to improve the performance of queries that call this function.
For details, see Search Optimization Service.

## Syntax

ST_DWITHIN( <geography_expression_1> , <geography_expression_2> , <distance_in_meters> )


## Arguments


geography_expression_1The argument must be an expression of type GEOGRAPHY.

geography_expression_2The argument must be an expression of type GEOGRAPHY.

distance_in_metersThe argument must be an expression of type REAL. The distance is in meters.


## Returns

Returns a BOOLEAN.

## Usage notes


Returns NULL if any input is NULL.


## Examples

This returns TRUE because the distance in meters between two points 1 degree apart along the equator is less than 150,000 meters:

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `GEO_OPENSTREETMAP.GEO_OPENSTREETMAP.PLANET_FEATURES`
    - `"feature_type"`: Potential usage - to filter features of type 'highway'.
    - `"all_tags"`: Potential usage - to extract specific highway types (e.g., 'motorway', 'trunk') from the tags.
    - `"geometry"`: Potential usage - to calculate the length of highway features.
    - `"osm_id"`: Potential usage - unique identifier for features.
    - `"osm_way_id"`: Potential usage - to link features if needed.
    - `"osm_version"`: Potential usage - to consider the latest version of features.
    - `"osm_timestamp"`: Potential usage - to filter data based on time if necessary.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter where `"feature_type"` = 'highway'.
- Extract highway types from `"all_tags"` where the key is 'highway'.
- Limit features to those within the geographic boundary of Denmark (Wikidata ID 'Q35'). This would require a geometry representing Denmark's boundary.
- Calculate and sum the lengths of highway segments.
- Group by highway type to aggregate total lengths.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct feature types in the dataset:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "feature_type"
    FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

2. **Select features where the feature type is 'highway':**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
    WHERE "feature_type" = 'highway'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

3. **Explore the "all_tags" column for highway features:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "osm_id", "all_tags"
    FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
    WHERE "feature_type" = 'highway'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4. **Flatten the "all_tags" to see available tags for highway features:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "osm_id", f.value:key::STRING AS "tag_key", f.value:value::STRING AS "tag_value"
    FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES",
         LATERAL FLATTEN(input => "all_tags") f
    WHERE "feature_type" = 'highway'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

5. **Extract highway types from "all_tags":**

    ```sql
    SELECT "osm_id", "all_tags":"highway"::STRING AS "highway_type"
    FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
    WHERE "feature_type" = 'highway'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

6. **Find distinct highway types:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "all_tags":"highway"::STRING AS "highway_type"
    FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
    WHERE "feature_type" = 'highway'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

7. **Calculate lengths of highway features (assuming "geometry" is GEOGRAPHY type):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "osm_id", ST_LENGTHGEOG(ST_GEOGFROMWKB("geometry")) AS "length_meters"
    FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
    WHERE "feature_type" = 'highway'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

8. **List highway features with their types and lengths:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "osm_id", "all_tags":"highway"::STRING AS "highway_type",
           ST_LENGTHGEOG(ST_GEOGFROMWKB("geometry")) AS "length_meters"
    FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
    WHERE "feature_type" = 'highway'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

9. **Summarize total length per highway type (without considering Denmark boundary):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "all_tags":"highway"::STRING AS "highway_type",
           SUM(ST_LENGTHGEOG(ST_GEOGFROMWKB("geometry"))) AS "total_length_meters"
    FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
    WHERE "feature_type" = 'highway'
    GROUP BY "all_tags":"highway"::STRING
    ORDER BY "total_length_meters" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

10. **Attempt to filter features within Denmark's boundary (assuming we have Denmark's geometry as variable GEOGRAPHY 'denmark_geography'):**

    ```sql
    SELECT "osm_id", "all_tags":"highway"::STRING AS "highway_type",
           ST_LENGTHGEOG(ST_GEOGFROMWKB("geometry")) AS "length_meters"
    FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES"
    WHERE "feature_type" = 'highway'
      AND ST_WITHIN(ST_GEOGFROMWKB("geometry"), denmark_geography)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    *(Note: In this query, 'denmark_geography' represents the GEOGRAPHY object of Denmark's boundary, which would need to be defined or obtained from another table.)*

Task: What are the five longest types of highways within the multipolygon boundary of Denmark (as defined by Wikidata ID 'Q35') by total length,  analyzed through planet features?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the analysis of planet features within the multipolygon boundary of Denmark (as defined by Wikidata ID 'Q35'), the five longest types of highways by total length are:

```csv
highway_type,total_length_meters
motorway,length1:float
trunk,length2:float
primary,length3:float
secondary,length4:float
tertiary,length5:float
```

(Attention: answer in five rows)

**Explanation:**

We analyzed the "PLANET_FEATURES" table to identify all highway features within Denmark. By filtering for features where `feature_type` is 'highway' and aggregating by the specific highway types (e.g., 'motorway', 'trunk', 'primary'), we calculated the total length of each type. The lengths were summed based on the geometry of each feature, and the highway types were then ranked by their total lengths to identify the top five..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'GEO_OPENSTREETMAP': {'GEO_OPENSTREETMAP': ['HISTORY_CHANGESETS', 'HISTORY_LAYERS', 'HISTORY_NODES', 'HISTORY_RELATIONS', 'PLANET_FEATURES', 'PLANET_FEATURES_POINTS', 'PLANET_LAYERS', 'PLANET_NODES', 'PLANET_RELATIONS', 'PLANET_WAYS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

```

**Explanation:**

We analyzed the "PLANET_FEATURES" table to identify all highway features within Denmark by matching the 'highway' key in the 'all_tags' column. We retrieved Denmark's multipolygon boundary using the Wikidata ID 'Q35'. By calculating the intersection between each highway feature's geometry and Denmark's geometry, we summed the lengths of these intersections for each highway type. The query aggregates total lengths per highway type and orders them to find the top five longest types.

Usage of ST_INTERSECTS: ST_INTERSECTS(geometry1, ST_GEOGFROMWKB(geometry2)) This function checks if the two geometries intersect. The first argument, geometry1, is compared with the second argument, geometry2, which is converted from its WKB (Well-Known Binary) representation to a geography type using ST_GEOGFROMWKB. If the two geometries share any portion of space, the function returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE. Usage of ST_CONTAINS: ST_CONTAINS(r1.geometry, r2.geometry) This function checks if the geometry r1.geometry completely contains the geometry r2.geometry. It returns TRUE if all points of r2.geometry are within r1.geometry and FALSE otherwise. This is useful for spatial containment queries, such as verifying whether one region is entirely within another. ARRAY_INTERSECTION(nodes1, nodes2): This function computes the intersection of the two arrays, returning a new array containing only the elements that are present in both nodes1 and nodes2. ARRAY_SIZE(...): This function then determines the size (or number of elements) in the resulting array from the intersection.

**Explanation:**

We analyzed the "PLANET_FEATURES" table to identify all highway features within Denmark. By filtering for features where the `highway` tag is present and intersecting their geometries with the multipolygon boundary of Denmark (as defined by Wikidata ID 'Q35'), we calculated the total length of each highway type within Denmark's borders. The lengths were summed based on the geometry of each feature within Denmark, and then the highway types were ranked by their total lengths to identify the top five.

Here is the SQL query used:

```sql
WITH denmark AS (
  SELECT ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB("geometry") AS denmark_geom
  FROM "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES" t, 
       LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => PARSE_JSON(t."all_tags")) f
  WHERE f.value:"key"::STRING = 'wikidata' AND f.value:"value"::STRING = 'Q35'
  LIMIT 1
),
highway_features AS (
  SELECT
    ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB(t."geometry") AS geom_geog,
    f_highway.value:"value"::STRING AS highway_type
  FROM
    "GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."GEO_OPENSTREETMAP"."PLANET_FEATURES" t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => PARSE_JSON(t."all_tags")) f_highway
  WHERE
    f_highway.value:"key"::STRING = 'highway'
)
SELECT
  hf.highway_type,
  ROUND(SUM(ST_LENGTH(ST_INTERSECTION(hf.geom_geog, denmark.denmark_geom))), 4) AS total_length_meters
FROM
  highway_features hf
  JOIN denmark ON ST_INTERSECTS(hf.geom_geog, denmark.denmark_geom)
GROUP BY
  hf.highway_type
ORDER BY
  total_length_meters DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 5;
```

**Notes:**

- We used `ST_INTERSECTION` to compute the portions of each highway feature that lie within Denmark's boundaries.
- `ST_LENGTH` calculates the length of these intersected geometries.
- The results are aggregated (`SUM`) for each `highway_type`.
- We ensured that all decimals are kept to four decimal places using the `ROUND` function.
- The `ORDER BY total_length_meters DESC NULLS LAST` sorts the highway types by their total lengths in descending order while placing any `NULL` values at the end.

This query provides the total length of each highway type within Denmark, allowing us to identify the five longest types by total length.
