After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Explanation:**

1. **Inclusion of All Overs:**
   - The query in `0result.sql` uses a **FULL OUTER JOIN** between the batsman runs and extra runs per over. This ensures that **all overs are included**, even those where no batsman runs were scored but extra runs were conceded.
   - In contrast, `2result.sql` uses a **LEFT JOIN** from the `BATSMAN_SCORED` table to the `EXTRA_RUNS` table. This means that overs where no batsman runs were recorded but extra runs were conceded might be **excluded** from the total runs calculation.

2. **Accuracy in Total Runs Calculation:**
   - By including overs with only extra runs, `0result.sql` provides a more accurate calculation of the total runs conceded per over. This is crucial for identifying the highest runs conceded in any over for each match.
   - Overs with only extra runs can still contribute to high total runs in an over, especially if there are multiple wides or no-balls in an over. Excluding these overs would underestimate the maximum runs conceded.

3. **Alignment with Cricket Scoring Principles:**
   - In cricket, all runs conceded in an over—whether from the bat or as extras—contribute to the bowler's over and the team's total runs conceded. Therefore, it's essential to consider both batsman runs and extras fully.
   - The approach in `0result.sql` aligns with this principle by aggregating all possible runs in an over.

4. **Consistency with Expected Results:**
   - The average obtained in `0result.sql` is **19.4261**, which is slightly higher than that in `2result.sql`. This suggests that `0result.sql` is capturing additional overs with high extra runs that `2result.sql` might be missing.
   - Considering these extra runs ensures that the average reflects all possible scenarios of runs conceded in overs across matches.

**Conclusion:**

Given the need to accurately calculate the maximum runs conceded in any over for each match by including all overs—whether they contain batsman runs, extra runs, or both—**`0result.sql`** is the appropriate and correct SQL query.
