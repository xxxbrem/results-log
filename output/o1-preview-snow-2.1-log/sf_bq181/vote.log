The correct SQL query is **0result.sql**.

**Reasoning:**

Candidate **0result.sql** accurately computes the percentage of weather stations that recorded temperature data for at least 90% of the days in 2022 by:

- **Filtering by Year**: It includes the condition `"year" = '2022'` in both the numerator and denominator, ensuring that only data from the year 2022 is considered.
- **Accounting for Non-Null Temperature Data**: It uses `"temp" IS NOT NULL` to include only days where temperature data was actually recorded.
- **Grouping by Station**: It groups the data by `"stn"`, aggregating records per weather station.
- **Calculating Proper Counts**:
  - **Numerator**: Counts the number of stations (`COUNT(DISTINCT "stn")`) that have recorded temperature data for at least 329 days (`HAVING COUNT(*) >= 329`), which represents 90% of the 365 days in a year.
  - **Denominator**: Counts the total number of distinct stations (`COUNT(DISTINCT "stn")`) that have any data for the year 2022.
- **Correct Calculation**: It divides the numerator by the denominator, multiplies by 100 to get a percentage, and rounds the result to four decimal places.

Candidate **1result.sql** lacks the necessary filter for the year 2022 in both the numerator and denominator, which means it might include data from other years, leading to an inaccurate percentage for 2022.

Candidate **2result.sql** groups data by both `"stn"` and `"wban"`, potentially counting the same station multiple times if it has different `"wban"` codes. It also does not filter for the year 2022, which can include irrelevant data.

Therefore, **0result.sql** is the most appropriate SQL query that addresses the task correctly.
