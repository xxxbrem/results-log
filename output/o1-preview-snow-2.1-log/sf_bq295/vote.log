After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for the following reasons:

1. **Exclusion of Binary Files:**
   - The task specifies that binary files should be excluded by checking that `"binary"` is `FALSE`.
   - `2result.sql` includes the condition `AND c."binary" = FALSE` in the `WHERE` clause, ensuring that only non-binary files are considered.
   - `0result.sql` does not include this condition, potentially including binary files in the results.

2. **Alignment with the Specified Conditions:**
   - Both queries filter for Python files (`"path" LIKE '%.py'`), files smaller than 15,000 bytes (`"size" < 15000`), and files containing the keyword `'def'` in their content (`"content" LIKE '%def%'`).
   - However, only `2result.sql` fully aligns with all the specified conditions by also excluding binary files.

3. **Correct Use of JOINs and Subquery:**
   - While both queries join the necessary tables, `2result.sql` uses a subquery to first identify the relevant repositories and then selects the top 3 based on the highest watch counts.
   - This approach ensures clarity and logical flow in retrieving the desired repositories.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**
