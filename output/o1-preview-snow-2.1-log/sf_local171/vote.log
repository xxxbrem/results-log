After comparing both SQL queries, I recommend using **`1result.sql`** as the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Robust Date Conversion:**
   - **`1result.sql`** uses `TRY_TO_DATE` function which safely attempts to convert strings to dates. If the conversion fails (e.g., due to invalid date formats or null values), it returns `NULL` without causing an error.
   - The query includes checks `TRY_TO_DATE(t."term_start", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL` and `TRY_TO_DATE(t."term_end", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL` to ensure that only valid dates are used in calculations.
   - **`2result.sql`** uses `TO_DATE`, which can raise errors if the date strings are invalid or null, potentially causing the query to fail.

2. **Data Integrity:**
   - By excluding records with invalid or null date values, **`1result.sql`** ensures accurate and reliable calculation of years of service.
   - **`2result.sql`** may inadvertently include invalid data, leading to incorrect years of service calculations.

3. **Consistency in Calculations:**
   - Both queries produce the same final results. However, **`1result.sql`** achieves this with added safety checks, making it more reliable for datasets with potential inconsistencies.

**Conclusion:**

- **`1result.sql`** is preferable due to its robust handling of date conversions and potential null values, ensuring accurate and error-free execution.
