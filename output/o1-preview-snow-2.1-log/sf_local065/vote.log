After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that all of them calculate the total income as **$142**. However, I recommend **`1result.sql`** as the correct answer for the following reasons:

- **Accurate Calculation of Extra Toppings**: The SQL in `1result.sql` uses a reliable method to count the number of extra toppings by computing the difference in string lengths:

  ```sql
  (LENGTH(c."extras") - LENGTH(REPLACE(c."extras", ',', ''))) + 1
  ```

  This method accurately counts the number of items in a comma-separated list, even when there are multiple extras.

- **Proper Handling of Canceled Orders**: It correctly filters out canceled orders by checking if the `"cancellation"` field is `NULL` or empty.

- **Clear Structure**: The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) like `completed_orders` and `price_per_pizza` makes the query more readable and easier to understand.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
