2025-01-20 18:19:33 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to comparing a numeric column (`"customer_id"`) with an empty string `''`, which is not valid in SQL. Numeric columns cannot contain empty strings—if there's no value, it will be `NULL`.

To fix the error, you should remove the condition `"customer_id" <> ''` from your `WHERE` clause. The condition `"customer_id" IS NOT NULL` is sufficient to filter out any `NULL` values.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "order_id", "customer_id", "pizza_id"
FROM MODERN_DATA.MODERN_DATA.PIZZA_CUSTOMER_ORDERS
WHERE "customer_id" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;

**Relevant tables and columns:**

- **PIZZA_CUSTOMER_ORDERS**
  - `"order_id"`: Used to identify each order.
  - `"pizza_id"`: Determines the type of pizza ordered.
  - `"exclusions"`: Toppings to be excluded from the pizza.
  - `"extras"`: Extra toppings added to the pizza.
- **PIZZA_RUNNER_ORDERS**
  - `"order_id"`: Used to link with customer orders.
  - `"cancellation"`: Indicates if an order was canceled.
- **PIZZA_NAMES**

Task: Calculate the total income from Meat Lovers pizzas priced at $12 and Vegetarian pizzas at $10. Include any extra toppings charged at $1 each. Ensure that canceled orders are filtered out. How much money has Pizza Runner earned in total?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
total_income
value:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

We calculated the total income by summing the prices of all non-canceled pizza orders. Each order's price is determined by the base price of the pizza—$12 for Meat Lovers and $10 for Vegetarian—plus $1 for each extra topping added. We ensured that canceled orders were filtered out by checking the `cancellation` field in the `PIZZA_RUNNER_ORDERS` table..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'MODERN_DATA': {'MODERN_DATA': ['COMPANIES_DATES', 'COMPANIES_FUNDING', 'COMPANIES_INDUSTRIES', 'INCOME_TREES', 'PIZZA_CLEAN_CUSTOMER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_CLEAN_RUNNER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_CUSTOMER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_GET_EXCLUSIONS', 'PIZZA_GET_EXTRAS', 'PIZZA_NAMES', 'PIZZA_RECIPES', 'PIZZA_RUNNERS', 'PIZZA_RUNNER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_TOPPINGS', 'STATISTICS', 'TREES', 'WORD_LIST']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 18:21:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Calculate the total income from Meat Lovers pizzas priced at $12 and Vegetarian pizzas at $10. Include any extra toppings charged at $1 each. Ensure that canceled orders are filtered out. How much money has Pizza Runner earned in total?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
total_income
value:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

We calculated the total income by summing the prices of all non-canceled pizza orders. Each order's price is determined by the base price of the pizza—$12 for Meat Lovers and $10 for Vegetarian—plus $1 for each extra topping added. We ensured that canceled orders were filtered out by checking the `cancellation` field in the `PIZZA_RUNNER_ORDERS` table. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

WHERE base_price > 0;Usage of ST_INTERSECTS: ST_INTERSECTS(geometry1, ST_GEOGFROMWKB(geometry2)) This function checks if the two geometries intersect. The first argument, geometry1, is compared with the second argument, geometry2, which is converted from its WKB (Well-Known Binary) representation to a geography type using ST_GEOGFROMWKB. If the two geometries share any portion of space, the function returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE. Usage of ST_CONTAINS: ST_CONTAINS(r1.geometry, r2.geometry) This function checks if the geometry r1.geometry completely contains the geometry r2.geometry. It returns TRUE if all points of r2.geometry are within r1.geometry and FALSE otherwise. This is useful for spatial containment queries, such as verifying whether one region is entirely within another. ARRAY_INTERSECTION(nodes1, nodes2): This function computes the intersection of the two arrays, returning a new array containing only the elements that are present in both nodes1 and nodes2. ARRAY_SIZE(...): This function then determines the size (or number of elements) in the resulting array from the intersection.
