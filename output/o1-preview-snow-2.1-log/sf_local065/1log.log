**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **PIZZA_CUSTOMER_ORDERS**
  - **"order_id"**: To uniquely identify each order and join with other tables.
  - **"pizza_id"**: To determine the type of pizza ordered (Meat Lovers or Vegetarian) for pricing.
  - **"extras"**: To calculate the number of extra toppings added to each pizza ($1 each).
  - **"exclusions"**: May not affect pricing but useful to understand order modifications.

- **PIZZA_RUNNER_ORDERS**
  - **"order_id"**: To join with customer orders and determine the status of each order.
  - **"cancellation"**: To filter out canceled orders from the total income calculation.

- **PIZZA_NAMES**
  - **"pizza_id"**: To link with pizza orders.
  - **"pizza_name"**: To identify whether the pizza is a Meat Lovers ($12) or Vegetarian ($10).

- **PIZZA_GET_EXTRAS**
  - **"order_id"**: To link with orders.
  - **"extras_count"**: The number of extra toppings added to each order for additional charges.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **Filter out canceled orders**: Where **"cancellation"** is `NULL` or empty.
- **Identify pizza types**: Where **"pizza_name"** is 'Meat Lovers' or 'Vegetarian' to apply correct base prices.
- **Calculate extra toppings charges**: Use **"extras_count"** from **PIZZA_GET_EXTRAS** or parse **"extras"** from **PIZZA_CUSTOMER_ORDERS**.
- **Join tables on "order_id" and "pizza_id"** to combine necessary data for calculations.

Task: Calculate the total income from Meat Lovers pizzas priced at $12 and Vegetarian pizzas at $10. Include any extra toppings charged at $1 each. Ensure that canceled orders are filtered out. How much money has Pizza Runner earned in total?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
total_income
value:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

We calculated the total income by summing the prices of all non-canceled pizza orders. Each order's price is determined by the base price of the pizza—$12 for Meat Lovers and $10 for Vegetarian—plus $1 for each extra topping added. We ensured that canceled orders were filtered out by checking the `cancellation` field in the `PIZZA_RUNNER_ORDERS` table..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'MODERN_DATA': {'MODERN_DATA': ['COMPANIES_DATES', 'COMPANIES_FUNDING', 'COMPANIES_INDUSTRIES', 'INCOME_TREES', 'PIZZA_CLEAN_CUSTOMER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_CLEAN_RUNNER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_CUSTOMER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_GET_EXCLUSIONS', 'PIZZA_GET_EXTRAS', 'PIZZA_NAMES', 'PIZZA_RECIPES', 'PIZZA_RUNNERS', 'PIZZA_RUNNER_ORDERS', 'PIZZA_TOPPINGS', 'STATISTICS', 'TREES', 'WORD_LIST']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Include any extra toppings charged at $1 each. Ensure that canceled orders are filtered out. How much money has Pizza Runner earned in total?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

(Attention: answer in one row)
```

We calculated the total income by summing the prices of all non-canceled pizza orders. Each order's price is determined by the base price of the pizza—$12 for Meat Lovers and $10 for Vegetarian—plus $1 for each extra topping added. We ensured that canceled orders were filtered out by checking the `cancellation` field in the `PIZZA_RUNNER_ORDERS` table. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
