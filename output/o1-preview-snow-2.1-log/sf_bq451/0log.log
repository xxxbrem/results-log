# Explanation of Alleles Types

## homozygous reference alleles
- When both alleles are 0.

## homozygous alternate alleles
- When both alleles are identical and greater than 0.

## heterozygous alternate alleles
- When alleles are different or one is NULL with at least one greater than 0.

## callable sites
- Including homozygous reference, homozygous alternate, and heterozygous alleles.

## Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs)
- Including homozygous and heterozygous alternate alleles.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we first need to identify which tables and columns are relevant and consider the conditions that need to be applied.

**Relevant Table and Columns**:

- **Table**: `_1000_GENOMES._1000_GENOMES.VARIANTS`

  - **"reference_name"**: Used to filter variants on chromosome X.
  - **"start"**: Used to filter out specified genomic regions.
  - **"call"**: Contains per-sample genotype data in a VARIANT (nested JSON) format.
  - **"reference_bases"** and **"alternate_bases"**: Used to identify SNPs.
  - **"alternate_bases"**: Contains the alternate alleles in a VARIANT format.

**Conditions to be Used**:

- Filter variants where `"reference_name"` is `'X'`.
- Exclude positions where `"start"` is between `59999` and `2699519`, and `154931042` and `155260559`.
- Extract and analyze the per-sample genotype data from the `"call"` column.
- Classify genotypes into homozygous reference, homozygous alternate, and heterozygous alternate alleles.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data**:

Below are 10 SQL queries designed to understand the structure and contents of the relevant columns.

---

1. **List all distinct chromosomes in the VARIANTS table**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "reference_name"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve variants located on chromosome X**:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
   WHERE "reference_name" = 'X'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **View start positions on chromosome X outside the excluded regions**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "start", "end", "reference_name"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
   WHERE "reference_name" = 'X'
     AND NOT ("start" BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519)
     AND NOT ("start" BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Inspect the structure of the "call" column for genotype information**:

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" AS t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."call") f
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Extract sample IDs from the nested "call" column**:

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:"call_set_name"::STRING AS "sample_id"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" AS t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."call") f
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Extract genotype arrays for each sample**:

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:"call_set_name"::STRING AS "sample_id",
          f.value:"genotype" AS "genotype_array"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" AS t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."call") f
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Identify how genotype data corresponds to allele types**:

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:"call_set_name"::STRING AS "sample_id",
          f.value:"genotype"::STRING AS "genotype_string"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" AS t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."call") f
   WHERE t."reference_name" = 'X'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Filter genotype data on chromosome X excluding specific regions**:

   ```sql
   SELECT t."reference_name",
          t."start",
          f.value:"call_set_name"::STRING AS "sample_id",
          f.value:"genotype" AS "genotype_array"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" AS t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."call") f
   WHERE t."reference_name" = 'X'
     AND NOT (t."start" BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519)
     AND NOT (t."start" BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count the number of variants per sample on chromosome X**:

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:"call_set_name"::STRING AS "sample_id",
          COUNT(*) AS "variant_count"
   FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" AS t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."call") f
   WHERE t."reference_name" = 'X'
     AND NOT (t."start" BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519)
     AND NOT (t."start" BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559)
   GROUP BY "sample_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Classify genotypes into allele types for each sample**:

    ```sql
    SELECT f.value:"call_set_name"::STRING AS "sample_id",
           f.value:"genotype" AS "genotype_array",
           CASE
             WHEN f.value:"genotype"[0] = 0 AND f.value:"genotype"[1] = 0 THEN 'homozygous_reference'
             WHEN f.value:"genotype"[0] > 0 AND f.value:"genotype"[0] = f.value:"genotype"[1] THEN 'homozygous_alternate'
             WHEN f.value:"genotype"[0] != f.value:"genotype"[1] THEN 'heterozygous_alternate'
             ELSE 'other'
           END AS "allele_type"
    FROM "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" AS t,
         LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."call") f
    WHERE t."reference_name" = 'X'
      AND NOT (t."start" BETWEEN 59999 AND 2699519)
      AND NOT (t."start" BETWEEN 154931042 AND 155260559)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries serve to:

- **Query 1**: Identify all chromosomes present to confirm the representation of chromosome X.
- **Query 2**: Retrieve all variants on chromosome X to understand the dataset's scope.
- **Query 3**: Examine variant positions on chromosome X while excluding specified genomic regions.
- **Query 4**: Explore the nested structure of the `"call"` column to understand how genotype data is stored.
- **Query 5**: Extract `sample_id` from the nested `"call"` data to identify individual samples.
- **Query 6**: Retrieve the genotype arrays for each sample to see how genotypes are represented.
- **Query 7**: Convert genotype arrays to strings for easier interpretation of allele combinations.
- **Query 8**: Combine filters to narrow down genotype data to the required subset of chromosome X.
- **Query 9**: Calculate the total number of variants per sample to understand variant distribution.
- **Query 10**: Classify each genotype into allele types (homozygous reference, homozygous alternate, heterozygous alternate) for further analysis.

By executing these queries, we can gain insights into:

- The representation of genotype data.
- How to extract and interpret the nested JSON structures.
- The distribution of different allele types across samples.
- The necessary computations to perform for the final task.

**Note**: All column names are enclosed in double quotations as per Snowflake SQL syntax, and `LIMIT 100` is used to restrict the number of rows returned for exploratory purposes.

This systematic exploration prepares us to perform the required calculations and outputs for the original task, ensuring a thorough understanding of the data and its structure.Query:

Task: Extract genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from chromosome X , ensuring that the start positions are not between 59999 and 2699519 nor between 154931042 and 155260559.   Output the sample ID, counts of homozygous reference alleles, homozygous alternate alleles, heterozygous alternate alleles, the total number of callable sites, the total number of SNVs,  the percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs, and the percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To extract the genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from chromosome X, excluding the specified regions, we would compile the counts and percentages for each sample as follows:

```csv
sample_id,homozygous_reference_alleles,homozygous_alternate_alleles,heterozygous_alternate_alleles,total_callable_sites,total_SNVs,percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles,percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles
sample_id1:str,count1:int,count2:int,count3:int,total_sites1:int,total_snvs1:int,percentage1:float (0<=float<=100),percentage2:float (0<=float<=100)
sample_id2:str,count1:int,count2:int,count3:int,total_sites2:int,total_snvs2:int,percentage1:float (0<=float<=100),percentage2:float (0<=float<=100)
...
```

- **sample_id**: The identifier for each sample (string).
- **homozygous_reference_alleles**: Count of sites where the sample has homozygous reference alleles (integer).
- **homozygous_alternate_alleles**: Count of sites where the sample has homozygous alternate alleles (integer).
- **heterozygous_alternate_alleles**: Count of sites where the sample has heterozygous alternate alleles (integer).
- **total_callable_sites**: Total number of sites that are callable (integer).
- **total_SNVs**: Total number of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) observed in the sample (integer).
- **percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles**: Percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs (float between 0 and 100).
- **percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles**: Percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs (float between 0 and 100).

This format provides a clear and concise representation of the genotype data per sample, adhering to the specified requirements..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'_1000_GENOMES': {'_1000_GENOMES': ['PEDIGREE', 'SAMPLE_INFO', 'VARIANTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-25 06:33:08 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Extract genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from chromosome X , ensuring that the start positions are not between 59999 and 2699519 nor between 154931042 and 155260559.   Output the sample ID, counts of homozygous reference alleles, homozygous alternate alleles, heterozygous alternate alleles, the total number of callable sites, the total number of SNVs,  the percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs, and the percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To extract the genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from chromosome X, excluding the specified regions, we would compile the counts and percentages for each sample as follows:

```csv
sample_id,homozygous_reference_alleles,homozygous_alternate_alleles,heterozygous_alternate_alleles,total_callable_sites,total_SNVs,percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles,percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles
sample_id1:str,count1:int,count2:int,count3:int,total_sites1:int,total_snvs1:int,percentage1:float (0<=float<=100),percentage2:float (0<=float<=100)
sample_id2:str,count1:int,count2:int,count3:int,total_sites2:int,total_snvs2:int,percentage1:float (0<=float<=100),percentage2:float (0<=float<=100)
...
```

- **sample_id**: The identifier for each sample (string).
- **homozygous_reference_alleles**: Count of sites where the sample has homozygous reference alleles (integer).
- **homozygous_alternate_alleles**: Count of sites where the sample has homozygous alternate alleles (integer).
- **heterozygous_alternate_alleles**: Count of sites where the sample has heterozygous alternate alleles (integer).
- **total_callable_sites**: Total number of sites that are callable (integer).
- **total_SNVs**: Total number of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) observed in the sample (integer).
- **percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles**: Percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs (float between 0 and 100).
- **percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles**: Percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs (float between 0 and 100).

This format provides a clear and concise representation of the genotype data per sample, adhering to the specified requirements. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-25 06:38:56 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Extract genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from chromosome X , ensuring that the start positions are not between 59999 and 2699519 nor between 154931042 and 155260559.   Output the sample ID, counts of homozygous reference alleles, homozygous alternate alleles, heterozygous alternate alleles, the total number of callable sites, the total number of SNVs,  the percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs, and the percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To extract the genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from chromosome X, excluding the specified regions, we would compile the counts and percentages for each sample as follows:

```csv
sample_id,homozygous_reference_alleles,homozygous_alternate_alleles,heterozygous_alternate_alleles,total_callable_sites,total_SNVs,percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles,percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles
sample_id1:str,count1:int,count2:int,count3:int,total_sites1:int,total_snvs1:int,percentage1:float (0<=float<=100),percentage2:float (0<=float<=100)
sample_id2:str,count1:int,count2:int,count3:int,total_sites2:int,total_snvs2:int,percentage1:float (0<=float<=100),percentage2:float (0<=float<=100)
...
```

- **sample_id**: The identifier for each sample (string).
- **homozygous_reference_alleles**: Count of sites where the sample has homozygous reference alleles (integer).
- **homozygous_alternate_alleles**: Count of sites where the sample has homozygous alternate alleles (integer).
- **heterozygous_alternate_alleles**: Count of sites where the sample has heterozygous alternate alleles (integer).
- **total_callable_sites**: Total number of sites that are callable (integer).
- **total_SNVs**: Total number of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) observed in the sample (integer).
- **percentage_heterozygous_alternate_alleles**: Percentage of heterozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs (float between 0 and 100).
- **percentage_homozygous_alternate_alleles**: Percentage of homozygous alternate alleles among all SNVs (float between 0 and 100).

This format provides a clear and concise representation of the genotype data per sample, adhering to the specified requirements. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
