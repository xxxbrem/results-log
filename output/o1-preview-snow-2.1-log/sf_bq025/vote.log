After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, we can determine which query best fulfills the task requirements and ensures accurate results.

**Task Summary:**
- Provide a list of the **top 10 countries** for the year **2020**.
- Order by the **highest percentage** of their population under **20 years old**.
- For each country, include:
  - **Total population under 20 years old**.
  - **Total midyear population**.
  - **Percentage** of the population under 20 years old.

**Comparison of the SQL Queries:**

1. **0result.sql:**
   - Joins the tables using only `"country_name"`.
   - Does not use `"country_code"` in the join condition.
   - Potential risk of mismatching countries if `"country_name"` is inconsistent or duplicated.

2. **1result.sql:**
   - Joins the tables using both `"country_code"` and `"country_name"`.
   - Ensures a more accurate join by matching on a unique identifier (`"country_code"`).
   - Reduces the risk of incorrect matches due to variations in `"country_name"`.

3. **2result.sql:**
   - Similar to `0result.sql`, it joins using only `"country_name"`.
   - Adds an additional sorting criterion on `"population_under_20"`, which is not necessary for the task.

**Reason for Choosing `1result.sql`:**

- **Accuracy in Joining:**
  - Using `"country_code"` in addition to `"country_name"` ensures that the join between the two tables is accurate.
  - `"country_code"` is a unique identifier for each country, eliminating ambiguities that may arise from country names.

- **Data Integrity:**
  - By matching on both fields, we prevent potential mismatches due to countries with similar or identical names.
  - This is especially important in international datasets where naming conventions may vary.

- **Compliance with Task Requirements:**
  - The query correctly calculates the percentage of the population under 20 years old.
  - It orders the results by the highest percentage, as required.
  - It limits the output to the top 10 countries.

**Conclusion:**

The query in `1result.sql` is the most appropriate choice because it ensures accurate data retrieval by joining on both `"country_code"` and `"country_name"`, thus reducing the risk of mismatches and maintaining data integrity.
