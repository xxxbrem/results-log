After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the best match for the task.

**Reasoning:**

- **Consistent Data Types:** In `0result.sql`, the `"start_station_id"` is consistently cast to `INT` in the `SELECT`, `JOIN`, and `GROUP BY` clauses. This ensures accurate joins and groupings between the trips and stations tables, as station IDs are integers in the stations table.

  ```sql
  CAST(t."start_station_id" AS INT) AS "station_id"
  ```

- **Accurate Percentage Calculation:** The query calculates the percentage of total trips correctly by dividing the trip count of each station by the total number of trips from active stations.

  ```sql
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (
      SELECT COUNT(*)
      FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS t2
      JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS s2
        ON CAST(t2."start_station_id" AS INT) = s2."station_id"
      WHERE s2."status" = 'active'
  ), 4) AS "percentage_of_total_trips"
  ```

- **Ordering Results Appropriately:** The query orders the results by `"total_number_of_trips"` in descending order, which aligns with the task requirement to list the top 15 stations based on trip starts.

  ```sql
  ORDER BY "total_number_of_trips" DESC NULLS LAST
  ```

- **Limiting to Top 15 Stations:** The `LIMIT 15` clause ensures that only the top 15 stations are returned.

- **Rounded Averages and Percentages:** The use of `ROUND` functions provides a cleaner presentation of the average durations and percentages.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

0result.sql
