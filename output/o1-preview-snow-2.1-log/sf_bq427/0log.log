# Score Intervals and Coordinates Logic

## Score Delta Intervals

To categorize the score deltas into intervals, the following conditions are used:

- **<-20**: When `score_delta < -20`
- **-20 — -11**: When `score_delta` is between -20 (inclusive) and -10 (exclusive)
- **-10 — -1**: When `score_delta` is between -10 (inclusive) and 0 (exclusive)
- **0**: When `score_delta` equals 0
- **1 — 10**: When `score_delta` is between 1 (inclusive) and 10 (inclusive)
- **11 — 20**: When `score_delta` is between 11 (exclusive) and 20 (inclusive)
- **>20**: When `score_delta > 20`

These intervals help in analyzing the performance based on the difference in team scores.

## X and Y Coordinates Calculation

Coordinates are adjusted based on the `event_coord_x` and `event_coord_y` values as follows:

- **X Coordinate**: 
  - If `event_coord_x < 564`: Use `event_coord_x` directly.
  - Otherwise: Calculate as `1128 - event_coord_x`.

- **Y Coordinate**: 
  - If `event_coord_x < 564`: Calculate as `600 - event_coord_y`.
  - Otherwise: Use `event_coord_y` directly.

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

**Table:** `MBB_PBP_SR` (Men's Basketball Play-by-Play Data)

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

1. **"event_type"**: Used to identify events of type "shot". Potentially used to filter shot attempts.
2. **"shot_type"**: Specifies the type of shot (e.g., "jump shot", "layup"). Used to categorize shots.
3. **"shot_made"**: Indicates whether the shot was successful (`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`).
4. **"event_coord_x"**: X-coordinate of the shot event. Used to calculate average x-coordinate.
5. **"event_coord_y"**: Y-coordinate of the shot event. Used to calculate average y-coordinate.
6. **"scheduled_date"**: Date of the game. Used to filter shots taken before March 15, 2018.
7. **"team_basket"**: Indicates which basket the team is shooting towards ("left", "right"). Used to ensure shots are on the correct side of the court.
8. **"team_id"**: Team identifier. Used to associate shots with the correct team.
9. **"timestamp"**: Time of the event. May be used to determine the sequence of events.
10. **"points_scored"**: Points scored from the shot. Could be used to calculate score deltas (though cumulative score data per team is not directly available).

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filter for shot events: `"event_type" = 'shot'`
- Filter shots taken before March 15, 2018: `"scheduled_date" < '2018-03-15'`
- Ensure coordinates are not null: `"event_coord_x" IS NOT NULL AND "event_coord_y" IS NOT NULL`
- Verify shots are on the correct side of the court based on `"team_basket"` and `"event_coord_x"`
- Categorize by `"shot_type"` to analyze different types of shots

Task: Can you find the average x and y coordinates, the average number of shot attempts, and the average number of successful shots for the most frequent score delta interval in each shot type, considering only shots taken before March 15, 2018, and ensuring that the shots are on the correct side of the court based on the team's basket?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Unfortunately, the necessary data to compute the score delta intervals is not available in the provided tables. The `MBB_PBP_SR` table does not include the running scores needed to calculate the score difference (`score_delta`) at each shot attempt. Without this information, we cannot determine the most frequent score delta interval for each shot type, and therefore cannot compute the requested averages within those intervals.

As such, we are unable to fulfill your request with the given data..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NCAA_BASKETBALL': {'NCAA_BASKETBALL': ['MASCOTS', 'MBB_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_GAMES', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TOURNAMENT_GAMES', 'MBB_PBP_SR', 'MBB_PLAYERS_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_TEAMS', 'MBB_TEAMS_GAMES_SR', 'TEAM_COLORS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
