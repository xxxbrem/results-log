After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is `2result.sql`.

**Reason:**

- **Uses Stop Names for Clarity:** `2result.sql` filters trips based on the exact stop names `'Clay St & Drumm St'` and `'Sacramento St & Davis St'`. This makes the query more readable and less prone to errors if stop IDs change.

- **Ensures One Direction Only:** By checking that the start stop's sequence is less than the end stop's sequence (`start_st."stop_sequence" < end_st."stop_sequence"`), the query selects trips where `'Clay St & Drumm St'` comes before `'Sacramento St & Davis St'`, effectively filtering for one direction only.

- **Includes Trip Headsign:** The query retrieves the `trip_headsign` for each trip, providing the necessary route information as requested.

- **Correct Time Format:** The query selects `departure_time` and `arrival_time` directly, which are in the `HH:MM:SS` format, satisfying the requirement to display times in this format.

- **Ordered Results:** Results are ordered by the `start_time`, making it easier to read and interpret the schedule.
