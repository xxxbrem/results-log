**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **Table:** `FORM_LOG`
  - **"session"**: To identify unique sessions.
  - **"path"**: To determine the pages visited (`'/regist/input'` and `'/regist/confirm'`).
  - **"stamp"**: To order the actions chronologically within each session.

- **Possible Conditions:**
  - **Filter "path"** where it equals `'/regist/input'` or `'/regist/confirm'`.
  - **Order by "stamp"** to analyze the sequence of page visits.
  - **Group by "session"** to isolate individual user sessions.

Task: How many unique sessions visited the /regist/input page and then the /regist/confirm page, in that order?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of unique sessions that visited the `/regist/input` page and then the `/regist/confirm` page in that specific order, we focus on sessions where these two pages were accessed sequentially. The result is a single integer representing this count.

```csv
number_of_unique_sessions
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LOG': {'LOG': ['ACCESS_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_IP', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE', 'ACTIVITY_LOG', 'APP1_MST_USERS', 'APP2_MST_USERS', 'DUP_ACTION_LOG', 'FORM_ERROR_LOG', 'FORM_LOG', 'INVALID_ACTION_LOG', 'MST_CATEGORIES', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20161201', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20170101', 'MST_USERS', 'MST_USERS_WITH_CARD_NUMBER', 'PRODUCT_SALES', 'PURCHASE_LOG', 'READ_LOG']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 21:55:25 - root - INFO - To determine the number of unique sessions that visited the `/regist/input` page and then the `/regist/confirm` page in that specific order, we compare the earliest timestamps when each page was visited per session, ensuring that the `/regist/input` page was visited before the `/regist/confirm` page. The result is a single integer representing this count.

```sql

FROM input_times

2025-01-20 21:55:27 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many unique sessions visited the /regist/input page and then the /regist/confirm page, in that order?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of unique sessions that visited the `/regist/input` page and then the `/regist/confirm` page in that specific order, we focus on sessions where these two pages were accessed sequentially. The result is a single integer representing this count.

```csv
number_of_unique_sessions
num:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
