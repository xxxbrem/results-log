Task: Provide a detailed web sales report for each region, including the number of orders, total sales amount, and the name and sales amount of the top-selling sales representative in each region

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Region_Name,Number_of_Orders,Total_Sales_Amount,Top_Sales_Representative_Name,Top_Sales_Amount
region1:str,orders1:int,sales_amount1:float,rep_name1:str,rep_sales_amount1:float
region2:str,orders2:int,sales_amount2:float,rep_name2:str,rep_sales_amount2:float
...
```

This report provides, for each region, the number of orders (`Number_of_Orders`), the total sales amount (`Total_Sales_Amount`), and details of the top-selling sales representative in that region, including their name (`Top_Sales_Representative_Name`) and sales amount (`Top_Sales_Amount`)..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': {'EDUCATION_BUSINESS': ['HARDWARE_DIM_CUSTOMER', 'HARDWARE_DIM_PRODUCT', 'HARDWARE_FACT_GROSS_PRICE', 'HARDWARE_FACT_MANUFACTURING_COST', 'HARDWARE_FACT_PRE_INVOICE_DEDUCTIONS', 'HARDWARE_FACT_SALES_MONTHLY', 'SALARYDATASET', 'STAFFHOURS', 'UNIVERSITY_COURSE', 'UNIVERSITY_ENROLLMENT', 'UNIVERSITY_FACULTY', 'UNIVERSITY_OFFERING', 'UNIVERSITY_STUDENT', 'WEB_ACCOUNTS', 'WEB_EVENTS', 'WEB_ORDERS', 'WEB_REGION', 'WEB_SALES_REPS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-21 15:42:31 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Provide a detailed web sales report for each region, including the number of orders, total sales amount, and the name and sales amount of the top-selling sales representative in each region, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Region_Name,Number_of_Orders,Total_Sales_Amount,Top_Sales_Representative_Name,Top_Sales_Amount
region1:str,orders1:int,sales_amount1:float,rep_name1:str,rep_sales_amount1:float
region2:str,orders2:int,sales_amount2:float,rep_name2:str,rep_sales_amount2:float
...
```

This report provides, for each region, the number of orders (`Number_of_Orders`), the total sales amount (`Total_Sales_Amount`), and details of the top-selling sales representative in that region, including their name (`Top_Sales_Representative_Name`) and sales amount (`Top_Sales_Amount`). The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
