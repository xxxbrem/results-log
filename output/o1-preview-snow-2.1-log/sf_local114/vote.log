After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Accuracy and Correctness:** `1result.sql` accurately computes the required report by:

  - Calculating the number of orders and total sales amount per region using appropriate joins and groupings.
  - Identifying the top-selling sales representative in each region by using a window function (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER`) partitioned by region and ordered by total sales amount in descending order.
  - Joining the regional totals with the top sales representatives to provide a comprehensive report.

- **Proper Use of Schema and Quotation Marks:** The query in `1result.sql` properly uses double quotes around table and column names and includes the fully qualified schema names. This ensures that the query adheres to the database's naming conventions and avoids any potential conflicts or ambiguities.

- **Consistency:** The results produced by `1result.sql` match the expected output for the detailed web sales report, providing the correct number of orders, total sales amounts, and top-selling sales representatives for each region.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**
