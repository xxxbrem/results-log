After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Unique Vaccine Site Counts:** The query in `0result.sql` uses `COUNT(DISTINCT c."facility_provider_id")` to count the number of unique vaccine sites per county. This ensures that each vaccine site is counted only once, providing an accurate count.

- **Avoiding Duplicates:** In contrast, the query in `2result.sql` uses `COUNT(*)`, which counts all records in the dataset for each county. This can inflate the vaccine site count if there are multiple entries for the same site (e.g., due to data duplication or multiple services at the same location).

- **Accurate Rates:** By using the distinct count of vaccine sites, `0result.sql` correctly calculates the number of vaccine sites per 1000 people, providing a reliable metric for comparison across counties.

- **Data Integrity:** The method in `0result.sql` aligns with best practices for data aggregation when unique counts are required, ensuring the integrity of the analysis.
