2025-01-23 10:45:47 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the placeholder `<specific_packaging_id>` in your SQL query. The SQL interpreter does not recognize `<` and `>` as part of a placeholder; instead, it interprets them as comparison operators, which leads to a syntax error.

To fix this issue, you need to replace `<specific_packaging_id>` with an actual packaging ID value from your dataset.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

For example, if you want to find the items contained within the packaging with ID `531`, you can modify your query as follows:

```sql
SELECT pr."contains_id", p_contained."name" AS "contained_item_name", pr."qty"
FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING" p_contained
  ON pr."contains_id" = p_contained."id"
WHERE pr."packaging_id" = 531
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Replace Placeholder:** Substitute `<specific_packaging_id>` with an actual numeric ID, such as `531`.
- **Packaging IDs Available:**

  Based on your previous results, the final packaging combinations (those not contained within any other packaging) have the following IDs:

  - `531` (Pallet of L)
  - `532` (Pallet of M)
  - `533` (Pallet Mix MS)
  - `534` (Pallet Mix SG)

- **Choosing a Packaging ID:** Select the packaging ID you wish to inspect. For example, using `533` will show you the items contained within "Pallet Mix MS".

**Example Results Using Packaging ID 533:**

If you run the query with `pr."packaging_id" = 533`, you might get results like:

```csv
contains_id,contained_item_name,qty
522,Box Medium,10
523,Box Small,20
```

This indicates that "Pallet Mix MS" contains 10 units of "Box Medium" and 20 units of "Box Small".

**Additional Notes:**

- **Understanding the Error Message:**
  
  - The error mentions `syntax error line 5 at position 29 unexpected '<'` because the `<` character is interpreted as a less-than operator, not as part of a placeholder.
  - Similarly, it reports an error at `line 6 at position 9 unexpected '100'` because the syntax is broken due to the unresolved placeholder.

- **Avoid Using Angle Brackets in SQL:**

  Placeholders in SQL queries should not use angle brackets. Instead, just replace them with the actual values.

- **Exploring Multiple Packaging IDs:**

  If you want to see the contents for all final packaging combinations, you can remove the `WHERE` clause:

  ```sql
  SELECT pr."packaging_id", p_final."name" AS "final_packaging_name",
         pr."contains_id", p_contained."name" AS "contained_item_name", pr."qty"
  FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
  JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING" p_contained
    ON pr."contains_id" = p_contained."id"
  JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING" p_final
    ON pr."packaging_id" = p_final."id"
  WHERE pr."packaging_id" IN (531, 532, 533, 534)
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

  This will display the contents of all final packaging combinations.

**Summary:**

- Replace `<specific_packaging_id>` with an actual packaging ID number.
- Ensure all placeholders are replaced before executing the query.
- The error is due to SQL syntax expecting a value, not a placeholder with angle brackets.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **PACKAGING**
   - `"id"`: Packaging item identifier (used to identify packaging combinations)
   - `"name"`: Packaging item name
   
2. **PACKAGING_RELATIONS**
   - `"packaging_id"`: Identifier of the packaging item (used to find packaging combinations)
   - `"contains_id"`: Identifier of an item contained within the packaging item (used to find contained items)
   - `"qty"`: Quantity of the contained item within the packaging item (used to calculate total quantities)

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Packaging items that are not contained within any other packaging (i.e., final packaging combinations).
- Summing quantities of all items contained within each packaging combination.
- Joining tables to get names of packaging items and their contained items.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all packaging items:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   
2. **List all packaging relations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "packaging_id", "contains_id", "qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   
3. **Find all unique contained item IDs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   
4. **Find final packaging combinations (not contained in any other packaging):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING"
   WHERE "id" NOT IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
     FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   
5. **List direct contents of final packaging combinations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT p."id" AS "final_packaging_id", p."name" AS "final_packaging_name", pr."contains_id", pr."qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING" p
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
     ON p."id" = pr."packaging_id"
   WHERE p."id" NOT IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
     FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
   )
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   
6. **Find names of contained items within packaging combinations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT pr."packaging_id", p_main."name" AS "packaging_name", pr."contains_id", p_contained."name" AS "contained_item_name", pr."qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING" p_main
     ON pr."packaging_id" = p_main."id"
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING" p_contained
     ON pr."contains_id" = p_contained."id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   
7. **Identify packaging items that are both containers and contained (nested packaging):**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT pr1."contains_id" AS "nested_packaging_id"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr1
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr2
     ON pr1."contains_id" = pr2."packaging_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   
8. **Calculate total quantity for each final packaging combination (one level deep):**
   ```sql
   SELECT p."id" AS "final_packaging_id", p."name" AS "final_packaging_name", SUM(pr."qty") AS "total_quantity"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING" p
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
     ON p."id" = pr."packaging_id"
   WHERE p."id" NOT IN (
     SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
     FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
   )
   GROUP BY p."id", p."name"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   
9. **List all items and their quantities contained within a specific packaging combination:**
   ```sql
   SELECT pr."contains_id", p_contained."name" AS "contained_item_name", pr."qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING" p_contained
     ON pr."contains_id" = p_contained."id"
   WHERE pr."packaging_id" = <specific_packaging_id>
   LIMIT 100;
   ```
   *(Replace `<specific_packaging_id>` with an actual packaging ID)*
   
10. **Find average quantity of directly contained items across all final packaging combinations:**
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(total_qty) AS "average_direct_quantity"
    FROM (
      SELECT p."id", SUM(pr."qty") AS total_qty
      FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING" p
      JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
        ON p."id" = pr."packaging_id"
      WHERE p."id" NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
        FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
      )
      GROUP BY p."id"
    ) sub
    LIMIT 100;
    ```
    
11. **List packaging items that do not contain any other items (leaf items):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "name"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING"
    WHERE "id" NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "packaging_id"
      FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```
    
12. **Find total quantities, considering two levels of nesting (if applicable):**
    ```sql
    SELECT p."id" AS "final_packaging_id", p."name" AS "final_packaging_name", SUM(pr_inner."qty" * pr_outer."qty") AS "total_quantity"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING" p
    JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr_outer
      ON p."id" = pr_outer."packaging_id"
    JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr_inner
      ON pr_outer."contains_id" = pr_inner."packaging_id"
    WHERE p."id" NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
      FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
    )
    GROUP BY p."id", p."name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```
    *(This query assumes two levels of nesting and multiplies quantities accordingly.)*

13. **Identify the deepest level of nesting in packaging relations:**
    ```sql
    SELECT MAX(nesting_level) AS "max_nesting_level"
    FROM (
      SELECT pr."packaging_id", pr."contains_id", 1 AS nesting_level
      FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
      UNION ALL
      SELECT pr1."packaging_id", pr2."contains_id", 2 AS nesting_level
      FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr1
      JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr2
        ON pr1."contains_id" = pr2."packaging_id"
    ) sub;
    ```
    *(Note: This query provides insight into the depth of nesting.)*

14. **List all final packaging combinations along with their total quantities (assuming no nesting):**
    ```sql
    SELECT p."id" AS "final_packaging_id", p."name" AS "final_packaging_name", pr."contains_id", pr."qty" AS "quantity"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING" p
    LEFT JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS" pr
      ON p."id" = pr."packaging_id"
    WHERE p."id" NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
      FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
    )
    LIMIT 100;
    ```
    
15. **Count the number of final packaging combinations:**
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS "number_of_final_packaging_combinations"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING"
    WHERE "id" NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id"
      FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL."PACKAGING_RELATIONS"
    )
    LIMIT 100;

Task: What is the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering all items contained within each combination?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
average_total_quantity
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The average total quantity across all final packaging combinations is calculated by summing the quantities of all items contained within each final packaging combination, including all nested items and their quantities, and then computing the average of these totals across all final packaging combinations..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
average_total_quantity
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The average total quantity across all final packaging combinations is calculated by summing the quantities of all items contained within each final packaging combination, including all nested items and their quantities, and then computing the average of these totals across all final packaging combinations. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-23 10:49:46 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering all items contained within each combination?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
average_total_quantity
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The average total quantity across all final packaging combinations is calculated by summing the quantities of all items contained within each final packaging combination, including all nested items and their quantities, and then computing the average of these totals across all final packaging combinations. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
