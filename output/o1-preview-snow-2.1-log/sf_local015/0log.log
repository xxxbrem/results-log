This query adjusts the previous conditions to ensure data is returned:

- **Vehicle Type Condition Simplified:** Instead of checking for `p."statewide_vehicle_type" = 'Motorcycle'`, we use `LOWER(p."statewide_vehicle_type") LIKE '%motorcycle%'` to include all entries containing the word "motorcycle".

- **Helmet Usage Condition Simplified:** We check if `"victim_safety_equipment_1"` contains the word "helmet" using `LOWER(v."victim_safety_equipment_1") LIKE '%helmet%'`.

- **Removed Injury Severity Condition:** We removed the condition on `"victim_degree_of_injury"` to include all injury levels, in case the previous condition was too restrictive.

This should return data on motorcycle accidents involving victims, grouped by whether they were wearing helmets or not.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
Tables and columns relevant to the task:

**PARTIES Table:**

- `"case_id"`: Used to join with the `VICTIMS` table.
- `"party_number"`: Used to join with the `VICTIMS` table.
- `"statewide_vehicle_type"`: To identify motorcycle accidents (e.g., where the vehicle type is 'Motorcycle').

**VICTIMS Table:**

- `"case_id"`: Used to join with the `PARTIES` table.
- `"party_number"`: Used to join with the `PARTIES` table.
- `"victim_degree_of_injury"`: To identify fatalities (e.g., where the degree of injury indicates a fatality).
- `"victim_safety_equipment_1"`: To determine if the victim was wearing a helmet.
- `"victim_safety_equipment_2"`: To determine if the victim was wearing a helmet.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `"statewide_vehicle_type"` = 'Motorcycle' (to filter motorcycle accidents).
- `"victim_degree_of_injury"` indicating a fatality (e.g., 'Fatal Injury').
- `"victim_safety_equipment_1"` and `"victim_safety_equipment_2"` values indicating helmet usage or non-usage.

Here are 10 SQL queries to explore the relevant data:

1. **List all vehicle types in the PARTIES table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "statewide_vehicle_type"
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.PARTIES
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select all records of motorcycle parties:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.PARTIES
   WHERE "statewide_vehicle_type" = 'Motorcycle'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List all victim degrees of injury:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "victim_degree_of_injury"
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.VICTIMS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Select all fatality records from the VICTIMS table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.VICTIMS
   WHERE "victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Fatal Injury'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Join PARTIES and VICTIMS tables on "case_id" and "party_number":**
   ```sql
   SELECT v.*
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.VICTIMS v

     AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Fatal Injury'
   GROUP BY v."victim_safety_equipment_1"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Select cases where the victim was not wearing a helmet:**
   ```sql
   SELECT v.*
   FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.VICTIMS v
   JOIN CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.PARTIES p
   ON v."case_id" = p."case_id" AND v."party_number" = p."party_number"

     AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Fatal Injury'
     AND v."victim_safety_equipment_1" = 'None Used'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate total fatalities and percentage of helmet usage among motorcycle fatalities:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      CASE
        WHEN v."victim_safety_equipment_1" = 'Helmet Worn' THEN 'Wearing Helmet'
        ELSE 'Not Wearing Helmet'
      END AS "Helmet_Status",
      COUNT(*) AS "Fatalities"
    FROM CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION.VICTIMS v

    WHERE p."statewide_vehicle_type" = 'Motorcycle'
      AND v."victim_degree_of_injury" = 'Fatal Injury'
    GROUP BY
      CASE
        WHEN v."victim_safety_equipment_1" = 'Helmet Worn' THEN 'Wearing Helmet'
        ELSE 'Not Wearing Helmet'
      END
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Help me respectively caulculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Helmet_Status,Percentage
Wearing_Helmet,percentage1:float
Not_Wearing_Helmet,percentage2:float
```

To calculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we analyze the data from the `VICTIMS` and `PARTIES` tables. We identify motorcycle accidents by selecting records where the `statewide_vehicle_type` in the `PARTIES` table is "Motorcycle". We then join this with the `VICTIMS` table on `case_id` and `party_number` to find victims with a `victim_degree_of_injury` indicating fatal injuries. By grouping these fatalities based on `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` to determine helmet usage, we calculate the respective percentages of fatalities for riders wearing helmets and those who weren't..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['CASE_IDS', 'COLLISIONS', 'PARTIES', 'VICTIMS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 07:05:06 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Help me respectively caulculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Helmet_Status,Percentage
Wearing_Helmet,percentage1:float
Not_Wearing_Helmet,percentage2:float
```

To calculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't, we analyze the data from the `VICTIMS` and `PARTIES` tables. We identify motorcycle accidents by selecting records where the `statewide_vehicle_type` in the `PARTIES` table is "Motorcycle". We then join this with the `VICTIMS` table on `case_id` and `party_number` to find victims with a `victim_degree_of_injury` indicating fatal injuries. By grouping these fatalities based on `victim_safety_equipment_1` and `victim_safety_equipment_2` to determine helmet usage, we calculate the respective percentages of fatalities for riders wearing helmets and those who weren't. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
