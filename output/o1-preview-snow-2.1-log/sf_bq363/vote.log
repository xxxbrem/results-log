The correct SQL query is **`1result.sql`**.

**Reasoning:**

- The task requires dividing taxi trips with a duration rounded to the nearest minute (between 1 and 50 minutes) into **10 quantiles based on trip duration**. This means that each quantile should contain an approximately equal number of trips, based on the sorted trip durations.

- **`1result.sql`** correctly uses the `NTILE(10)` window function to divide the trips into 10 quantiles based on the sorted `trip_minutes`. Specifically, it assigns each trip to a quantile in a way that each quantile contains an equal number of trips:

  ```sql
  NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY "trip_minutes") AS quantile
  ```

- The results from **`1result.sql`** show that each quantile has approximately the same number of trips (~19,188,211 trips per quantile), confirming that the trips are evenly distributed among the quantiles based on trip duration.

- Additionally, the trip duration ranges (`min_minutes` to `max_minutes`) in the results gradually increase with each quantile, reflecting the correct division based on trip duration percentiles.

- In contrast, **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** use fixed trip duration ranges to define quantiles (e.g., 1-5 minutes for Quantile 1, 6-10 minutes for Quantile 2, etc.). This approach does not ensure an equal number of trips per quantile and therefore does not correctly implement quantiles based on the distribution of the data.

**Conclusion:**

- **`1result.sql`** is the only query among the three that accurately divides the trips into 10 quantiles based on trip duration, as required by the task.
