Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **ORDERS**
  - `"id"`: The order ID. Used to identify order 421.

- **ORDERLINES**
  - `"order_id"`: References the order ID. Used to find products in order 421.
  - `"product_id"`: The ID of the products ordered.
  - `"qty"`: Quantity of each product ordered.

- **PICKING_LINE**
  - `"order_id"`: References the order ID. Used to find picking lines for order 421.
  - `"product_id"`: The ID of the products picked.
  - `"qty"`: Quantity of each product picked.
  - `"location_id"`: The location from which the product was picked.
  - `"picklist_id"`: References the pick list.

- **PRODUCTS**
  - `"id"`: The product ID.
  - `"name"`: The name of the product.

- **INVENTORY**
  - `"product_id"`: The ID of the product in inventory.
  - `"purchase_id"`: References the purchase batch (used for FIFO).
  - `"location_id"`: The inventory location ID.
  - `"qty"`: Quantity available in the inventory batch.

- **PURCHASES**
  - `"id"`: Purchase ID.
  - `"product_id"`: The ID of the purchased product.
  - `"purchased"`: Purchase date (used to determine FIFO sequence).
  - `"qty"`: Quantity purchased.

**Conditions and Usage:**

- Filter records where `"order_id"` equals 421 to focus on the specific order.
- Use `"product_id"` to link between `ORDERLINES`, `PICKING_LINE`, `INVENTORY`, and `PURCHASES`.
- Employ FIFO logic by ordering purchases by `"purchased"` date.
- Calculate average units picked per inventory batch for each product.

Task: Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
product_id,product_name,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,average_units2:float
...
```

The table above lists the products picked for order 421, including their product IDs, names, and the average number of units picked per inventory batch using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-21 02:39:37 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which products were picked for order 421, and what is the average number of units picked for each product, using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
product_id,product_name,average_units_picked_per_batch
product_id1:int,product_name1:str,average_units1:float
product_id2:int,product_name2:str,average_units2:float
...
```

The table above lists the products picked for order 421, including their product IDs, names, and the average number of units picked per inventory batch using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
