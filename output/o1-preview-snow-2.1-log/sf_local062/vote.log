After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I conclude that `0result.sql` is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

Both SQL queries aim to segment Italian customers into ten profitability buckets for December 2021, using equal profit intervals, and calculate the number of customers, maximum profit, and minimum profit for each bucket.

The `0result.sql` query includes an additional check in the `CASE` statement to handle scenarios where the profit interval might be zero, which adds robustness to the code. Specifically, it includes:

```sql
CASE
    WHEN pi."profit_interval" = 0 THEN 1
    WHEN tpc."total_profit" = pi."max_profit" THEN 10
    ELSE FLOOR((tpc."total_profit" - pi."min_profit") / pi."profit_interval") + 1
END AS "profit_bucket"
```

This condition ensures that if the profit interval is zero (which could happen if all customers have the same profit), the bucket assignment defaults to 1, preventing division by zero errors.

On the other hand, `2result.sql` does not include this check. Although both queries produce the same results in this case, `0result.sql` is more robust and better handles edge cases.
