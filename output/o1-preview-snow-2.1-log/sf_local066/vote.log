0result.sql
```

**Reason:**

The SQL query in `0result.sql` correctly calculates the total quantity of each ingredient used in the delivered pizzas by accurately accounting for exclusions and extras, especially when a customer adds an extra topping that is already included in the base recipe.

Upon reviewing both SQL queries and their results:

- **`0result.sql`** properly handles cases where an extra topping duplicates a base topping. It increments the ingredient count appropriately, which aligns with standard practice (i.e., if a customer adds an extra of a topping already on the pizza, it should be counted twice).

- The counts in **`0result.csv`** closely match the expected counts based on manual calculations of the delivered orders, taking into account all exclusions and extras.

- **`1result.sql`** appears to overcount some ingredients, such as Bacon and Cheese, suggesting it may have incorrectly aggregated extras or did not handle exclusions accurately.

Overall, **`0result.sql`** provides the correct summary by:

- Excluding toppings properly when specified in the `exclusions`.
- Including extra toppings, even when they duplicate base toppings, thereby increasing the total quantity used.
- Correctly accounting for the delivered orders by filtering out canceled orders.
