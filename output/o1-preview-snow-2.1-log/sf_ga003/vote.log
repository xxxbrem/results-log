I choose `1result.sql` as the correct SQL because it is more robust in extracting and averaging the score values. This query handles different data types for the score by using `COALESCE` to accommodate `double_value`, `int_value`, and attempts to convert `string_value` to a numeric type if necessary. This ensures that all possible score values are considered, providing a more accurate average for each board type.
