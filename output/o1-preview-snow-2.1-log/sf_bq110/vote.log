After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasons:**

1. **Coverage of New York CoC Regions:**
   - **`1result.sql`** uses the condition `"CoC_Number" LIKE 'NY%'` in the `WHERE` clause. This pattern ensures that all Continuum of Care (CoC) regions in New York are included, as their `CoC_Number` starts with 'NY'.
   - **`0result.sql`** uses `"CoC_Number" LIKE 'NY-%'`, which matches `CoC_Number` values starting with 'NY-' followed by any characters. While in this dataset both patterns may capture the same records, using `'NY%'` is more comprehensive and accounts for any CoC numbers that might start with 'NY' but do not have a hyphen.

2. **Data Type Consistency:**
   - **`1result.sql`** casts the results of the `SUM` and arithmetic operations to `INTEGER` using the `CAST` function. This ensures that the counts of homeless veterans are represented as whole numbers, which is appropriate since you cannot have a fraction of a person.
   - **`0result.sql`** does not include casting, which could result in data types that are not integers, potentially leading to misleading representations of the counts.

**Conclusion:**

By ensuring comprehensive data selection and proper data type representation, **`1result.sql`** provides a more accurate and reliable answer to the question about the change in the number of homeless veterans in each CoC region of New York between 2012 and 2018.
