After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for the following reasons:

### **Comparison and Reasoning:**

1. **Objective Alignment:**
   - Both queries aim to find the user whose forum message upvotes in 2019 are closest to the average number of upvotes received by users in that year.
   - Both queries handle ties by selecting the user with the alphabetically first username.

2. **Handling Ties:**
   - **`0result.sql`**:
     - Orders the results by the absolute difference from the average (`"DifferenceFromAverage"`) and then by `"UserName"` ascending.
     - Uses `LIMIT 1` to select the top result.
     - This method may not handle cases where multiple users have the same minimal difference because it relies on sorting and limiting, potentially excluding other users with the same minimal difference before sorting by username.
   - **`1result.sql`**:
     - Calculates the minimum difference (`"MinDiff"`) using a separate Common Table Expression (CTE).
     - Filters the users whose difference equals the minimum difference (`UPU."Diff" = MD."MinDiff"`), ensuring all users with the minimal difference are considered.
     - Orders the filtered results by `"UserName"` ascending and uses `LIMIT 1` to select the alphabetically first username among those tied.
     - This approach accurately handles ties by first identifying all users with the minimal difference and then applying the alphabetical order.

3. **Query Structure and Clarity:**
   - **`1result.sql`**:
     - Provides a clear separation of concerns by dividing the calculation of the average, the computation of differences, and the determination of the minimum difference into separate CTEs.
     - Enhances readability and makes the logic explicit, which helps ensure the correctness of the query.

4. **Result Consistency:**
   - Both queries produce the same result (`a1850961785` with `14` upvotes received against an average of approximately `14.4009`).
   - However, **`1result.sql`** achieves this result through a logic that better aligns with the task's requirement, particularly in handling ties.

### **Conclusion:**

Based on the above reasoning, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query as it accurately implements the task requirements and properly handles potential ties by selecting the user with the alphabetically first username among those with the minimal difference from the average.
