After analyzing the provided SQL queries and their results, it's clear that `0result.sql` is the correct SQL query that answers the task effectively.

**Reasoning:**

- **`0result.sql`**:
  - Accurately extracts module names from both Python (`.py`) and R (`.R`) files using regular expressions.
  - Counts the frequency of each imported module across all files.
  - Correctly identifies the second most frequently used module as `sys` with a frequency of `134`, which is plausible given the common use of the `sys` module in Python scripts.

- **`1result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`**:
  - Both queries result in modules with a frequency of `1` (`cybox.core` and `copy`, respectively) as the second most frequent, which is improbable.
  - This suggests that these queries do not aggregate the module imports correctly or fail to consider all relevant files and patterns.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is the SQL query that correctly determines the second most frequently used module across Python, R, and IPython script files in the GitHub sample dataset.
