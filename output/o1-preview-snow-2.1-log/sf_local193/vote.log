After carefully comparing both SQL queries and their respective results, I have determined that `2result.sql` is the correct query for the task. Here is the reasoning behind this decision:

**1. Handling of Time Periods Precisely:**

The task specifies that the 7- and 30-day periods should be based on the exact number of hours, minutes, and seconds, and not on calendar days. This means we need to consider precise time intervals of 7 * 24 hours and 30 * 24 hours from the initial purchase date.

- **`1result.sql`** uses the condition:

  ```sql
  TO_TIMESTAMP(p."payment_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3') >= c.initial_purchase_date
  AND TO_TIMESTAMP(p."payment_date", 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF3') < c.initial_purchase_date + INTERVAL '7 DAYS'
  ```

  While this condition captures payments within the first 7 days, it doesn't consider the exact number of seconds and lacks precision at the boundary of the 7-day period.

- **`2result.sql`** employs a more precise method by converting days into seconds and subtracting one second to ensure inclusivity:

  ```sql
  SUM(
      CASE
          WHEN cp."payment_date" <= DATEADD('second', 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 - 1, fp."first_payment_date")
          THEN cp."amount"
          ELSE 0
      END
  )
  ```

  This calculation converts 7 days into seconds (7 * 24 * 60 * 60) and subtracts 1 second, ensuring that the period covers the exact time frame specified.

**2. Accurate Boundary Conditions:**

- **In `2result.sql`**, the use of `<=` in combination with precise second calculations ensures that payments made exactly at the 7-day mark (to the precise second) are included.

- **In `1result.sql`**, the use of `<` may exclude payments made exactly at the 7- or 30-day mark, potentially omitting relevant data from the calculations.

**3. Error Handling with `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP`:**

- **`2result.sql`** uses `TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP`, which safely attempts to convert strings to timestamps without failing if the format is incorrect. This function returns `NULL` for invalid formats instead of throwing an error.

- **`1result.sql`** uses `TO_TIMESTAMP`, which may result in errors if the `payment_date` format doesn't precisely match the expected format, potentially causing the query to fail.

**4. Consistency in Conditions:**

- **`2result.sql`** applies consistent logic in both the 7-day and 30-day calculations, ensuring that the same level of precision is maintained throughout the query.

**Conclusion:**

Given the requirement for exact time calculations and precise handling of the time boundaries, `2result.sql` is better suited to accurately compute the average percentage of the total lifetime sales (LTV) that occur within the first 7 and 30 days after a customer's initial purchase.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

2result.sql
