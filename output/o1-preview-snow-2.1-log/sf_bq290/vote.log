0result.sql
```

**Reason:**

After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct script for calculating the differences in maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and average temperature between US and UK weather stations for each day in October 2023, excluding records with missing temperature values.

Here are the reasons:

1. **Accurate Aggregation:**
   - `0result.sql` calculates the **average** maximum temperature (`Avg_Max_Temp`), minimum temperature (`Avg_Min_Temp`), and average temperature (`Avg_Temp`) for each country on each day.
   - This approach accounts for all valid temperature readings from multiple stations, providing a representative daily temperature for each country.

2. **Proper Data Handling:**
   - The query excludes records with missing temperature values by checking that `"GSOD"."temp"`, `"GSOD"."max"`, and `"GSOD"."min"` are **not null**.
   - This ensures that only valid data is used in the calculations, avoiding skewed results due to missing or invalid entries.

3. **Direct Comparison:**
   - By using a **common table expression (CTE)**, the query aggregates temperatures for each country separately and then joins them on the date.
   - This allows for a straightforward calculation of the differences between US and UK temperatures for each day.

4. **Meaningful Results:**
   - The differences calculated in `0result.csv` are consistent with expected climatic variations between the US and UK in October.
   - The temperature differences are within reasonable ranges, indicating the query correctly captures the daily variations.

In contrast, **`2result.sql`** has some issues:

- It uses `MAX` and `MIN` functions directly on the temperature values without averaging, which can be affected by outliers and may not reflect typical daily temperatures.
- It filters out temperatures with specific placeholder values (e.g., `9999.9`), which might exclude valid data or not sufficiently handle missing values.
- The resulting temperature differences in `2result.csv` show extreme and inconsistent values, suggesting potential inaccuracies in the calculations.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** provides a more accurate and reliable method for calculating the daily temperature differences between the US and UK, making it the correct SQL script for this task.
