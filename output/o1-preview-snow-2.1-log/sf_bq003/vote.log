The correct SQL script is **0result.sql**.

**Reason:**

- **Clarity and Organization:** The `0result.sql` script clearly separates the data for each month by creating individual Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for April, May, June, and July. This organization makes it easier to understand and verify the data processing steps for each month.

- **Accurate Computation:** By creating separate CTEs for purchase and non-purchase sessions within each month, the script ensures that pageviews are correctly aggregated per visitor for each session type. It calculates the sum of pageviews per visitor in purchase and non-purchase sessions separately, which aligns with the task's requirement.

- **Explicit Averaging:** The final SELECT statement explicitly computes the average pageviews per visitor for both purchase and non-purchase sessions by taking the average of the summed pageviews per visitor. This method accurately reflects the "average pageviews per visitor" as it averages over the visitors, not sessions.

- **Avoidance of NULL Issues:** The script avoids potential NULL value complications by ensuring that only relevant data is included in each calculation. It handles cases where visitors may not have pageviews or transactions in a straightforward manner.
