After carefully comparing both SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL to compile the critical details on traffic accidents in 2015. Here are the reasons for this choice:

1. **Consistent Aliasing and Clarity**:
   - In `2result.sql`, the tables are aliased as `ACC` (Accident), `VEH` (Vehicle), and `PER` (Person), which makes the SQL script more readable and the relationships between tables clearer.
   - The consistent use of aliases improves the maintainability and understanding of the query.

2. **Accurate Use of String Functions**:
   - The script utilizes the `UPPER()` function for case-insensitive string comparisons, ensuring that values like `"Yes"` and `"YES"` are treated equally.
   - For example, in the calculation of the `alcohol` and `drugs` columns:
     ```sql
     CASE WHEN UPPER(PER."police_reported_alcohol_involvement") LIKE '%YES%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS "alcohol",
     ```
     This ensures consistency regardless of the text case in the data.

3. **Simplified CASE Statements**:
   - The `restraint` calculation uses a straightforward `CASE` expression without unnecessary casting, which simplifies the logic:
     ```sql
     CASE PER."restraint_system_helmet_use"
       WHEN 0 THEN 0.0000
       WHEN 1 THEN 0.3300
       WHEN 2 THEN 0.6700
       WHEN 3 THEN 1.0000
       ELSE 0.5000
     END AS "restraint",
     ```
   - This improves readability and reduces the potential for errors.

4. **Improved Rollover Calculation**:
   - The `rollover` field checks for the presence of the word `"ROLLOVER"` in any context, which is more robust:
     ```sql
     CASE WHEN UPPER(VEH."rollover") LIKE '%ROLLOVER%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS "rollover",
     ```
   - This approach accounts for any variation in the `rollover` field that includes the word `"ROLLOVER"`.

5. **Use of ROUND Function for Numeric Precision**:
   - The delay calculations use the `ROUND` function, which is appropriate for numeric precision in time differences:
     ```sql
     ROUND(ACC."hour_of_ems_arrival_at_hospital" - ACC."hour_of_crash", 4) AS "delay_to_hospital",
     ```
   - This provides more accurate results, especially if the times are not whole numbers.

6. **Accurate JOIN Conditions**:
   - The script ensures that all relevant keys are used in the `JOIN` conditions, including `vehicle_number` when joining `PERSON_2015` and `VEHICLE_2015`:
     ```sql
     JOIN NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES.NHTSA_TRAFFIC_FATALITIES."PERSON_2015" PER
       ON ACC."state_number" = PER."state_number" AND ACC."consecutive_number" = PER."consecutive_number" AND VEH."vehicle_number" = PER."vehicle_number";
     ```
   - This ensures that each person is correctly associated with their respective vehicle and accident.

7. **Comprehensive Data Compilation**:
   - The script includes all the critical details listed in the info document, ensuring that no important data is omitted.

**Conclusion**:

Based on the above reasons, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL script as it provides a more accurate, readable, and maintainable query to compile the critical details on traffic accidents in 2015.
