After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have concluded that **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice.

**Reason:**

- **Comprehensive Month Generation:** `1result.sql` accurately generates all months between the minimum and maximum transaction dates using a recursive CTE. This ensures that every month within the range is included, even if there are no transactions in certain months.

- **Complete Customer-Month Combinations:** By performing a cross join between all customers and all generated months, it creates a complete set of customer-month combinations. This guarantees that every customer has an entry for each month, satisfying the requirement to include months with no account activity.

- **Correct Monthly Changes Calculation:** It calculates the monthly changes by appropriately signing the transaction amounts based on the transaction type (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals and purchases). This is crucial for accurately reflecting the changes in balances.

- **Accurate Cumulative Balances:** The use of window functions allows for the correct computation of cumulative balances over time for each customer, ensuring that the balances are rolled up month over month.

- **Handling of Zero Activity Months:** `1result.sql` assigns a monthly change of zero for months where no transactions occurred for a customer, while still correctly carrying forward the cumulative balance.

**Conclusion:**

`1result.sql` best meets the requirements by providing a complete and accurate summary of monthly closing balances, changes, and cumulative balances for each customer, including months with no transaction activity.
