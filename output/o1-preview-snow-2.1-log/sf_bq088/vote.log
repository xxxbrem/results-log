After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I recommend selecting **`2result.sql`** as the correct SQL to answer your question. Here's the reasoning:

### Comparison of the SQL Queries:

1. **`0result.sql`:**
   - **Data Filtering:** Filters data to only include records from 2019 and 2020 using `EXTRACT(year FROM TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) IN (2019, 2020)` in the `WHERE` clause.
   - **Year Extraction:** Uses `EXTRACT(year FROM TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD'))` to extract the year from the date.
   - **Type Casting:** Uses `CAST("symptom_anxiety" AS FLOAT)` to convert symptom values to `FLOAT`.
   - **Potential Issue:** If there are any non-numeric values in the symptom columns, `CAST` may result in an error.

2. **`1result.sql`:**
   - **Data Filtering:** Does **not** filter data in the `WHERE` clause, so it includes all available years for the United States.
   - **Year Extraction:** Uses `SUBSTR("date", 1, 4)` to extract the year as a string.
   - **Type Casting:** Uses `CAST("symptom_anxiety" AS FLOAT)` to convert symptom values to `FLOAT`.
   - **Potential Issue:** Including all years might introduce unintended data into calculations. Also, `CAST` may result in errors with non-numeric values.

3. **`2result.sql`:**
   - **Data Filtering:** Filters data to only include records from 2019 and 2020 using `YEAR(TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) IN (2019, 2020)` in the `WHERE` clause.
   - **Year Extraction:** Uses `YEAR(TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD'))` to extract the year as an integer.
   - **Type Casting:** Uses `TRY_CAST("symptom_anxiety" AS FLOAT)` to safely convert symptom values to `FLOAT`, returning `NULL` if conversion fails instead of throwing an error.
   - **Advantage:** Provides robust error handling and precise data filtering.

### Reason for Selecting `2result.sql`:

- **Precise Data Filtering:** By including the condition `YEAR(TO_DATE("date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')) IN (2019, 2020)` in the `WHERE` clause, `2result.sql` ensures that only data from the years 2019 and 2020 are considered in all calculations. This prevents any unintended data from other years from affecting the results.

- **Robust Error Handling:** Using `TRY_CAST` instead of `CAST` safely handles any non-numeric values in the symptom columns by returning `NULL` instead of causing an error. This makes the query more reliable.

- **Accurate Year Extraction:** The use of `YEAR(TO_DATE(...))` ensures that the year is accurately extracted as an integer, which is suitable for comparison in both the `WHERE` clause and `CASE` statements.

- **Clarity and Maintainability:** The query is structured in a way that is clear and easy to understand, which is beneficial for future maintenance or modifications.

### Conclusion:

Considering the above points, **`2result.sql`** best fulfills the requirements of calculating the average levels of anxiety and depression symptoms in the United States for 2019 and 2020 and determining the percentage increase between these years.

**Output:**
