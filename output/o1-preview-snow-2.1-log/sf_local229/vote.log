After analyzing the provided SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script that satisfies the task requirements.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Accurate Partnership Identification:**
   - The script correctly partitions the data to identify partnerships, considering when a wicket falls using the `WICKET_TAKEN` table.
   - It assigns a unique `partnership_no` to each partnership within a match and innings.

2. **Calculation of Partnership Runs:**
   - It sums up the runs scored during each partnership accurately.
   - The script considers only the deliveries where both batsmen are part of the partnership.

3. **Individual Scores Within Partnerships:**
   - It calculates the individual runs scored by each batsman during the partnership.
   - This allows for comparing individual scores to determine `player1` and `player2` as per the specified rules.

4. **Player Ordering Rules Implementation:**
   - The script correctly assigns `player1` and `player2` based on the higher individual score.
   - In case of equal individual scores, it orders players by their IDs, assigning the higher ID as `player1`.

5. **Selection of Highest Partnership Per Match:**
   - It identifies the highest partnership per match by runs scored.
   - The final output includes the match ID, player IDs, individual scores, and the total partnership score, exactly as required.

6. **Handling Multiple Rows for a Match:**
   - The script allows for multiple partnerships with the highest score if there is a tie, adhering to the task condition that there can be multiple rows per match.

**Output:**
