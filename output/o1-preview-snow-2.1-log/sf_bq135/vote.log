After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I recommend selecting **`0result.sql`** as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

The primary difference between the two SQL queries is the inclusion of the condition `AND "amount" > 0` in `0result.sql`. This condition ensures that only transactions with a positive amount are considered in the total sum. Including this condition is important for the following reasons:

1. **Accuracy in Calculation:** By explicitly filtering out transactions with zero or negative amounts (if any), we ensure that the total transaction amount reflects the actual value transferred on that date.

2. **Data Integrity:** Although transactions with a `"success"` status of `TRUE` and `"accepted"` status of `TRUE` are likely to have positive amounts, including the `AND "amount" > 0` condition adds an extra layer of validation to the query, safeguarding against any anomalies or edge cases in the data.

3. **Clarity and Explicitness:** The additional condition makes the query's intent clearer to anyone reading it. It explicitly states that only positive transaction amounts are to be summed, which enhances the readability and maintainability of the SQL script.

Therefore, `0result.sql` is the better choice as it provides a more precise and accurate result for the task.
