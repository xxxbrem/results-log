After analyzing the three SQL queries and their results, I recommend choosing the third SQL query (`2result.sql`) as the correct answer. Here's the reasoning:

**Reasoning:**

1. **Dynamic Identification of Top 5 Minor Categories:**
   - **`2result.sql`**: Dynamically identifies the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 using a subquery. This ensures that the query remains accurate even if the data changes, and the top categories are different.
   - **`1result.sql`**: Hardcodes the minor categories ('Other Theft', 'Theft From Motor Vehicle', etc.). This approach is less robust, as it assumes these categories are always the top 5 in 2008, which may not be the case with updated data.
   - **`0result.sql`**: Also dynamically identifies the top 5 minor categories, but the query is more complex and less concise than `2result.sql`.

2. **Simplicity and Clarity:**
   - **`2result.sql`**: Provides a clear and straightforward approach using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate total crimes per year, identify top categories, and compute percentages.
   - **`0result.sql`**: While it achieves the same result, the query is more convoluted with multiple nested CTEs and pivoting logic, making it harder to read and maintain.

3. **Accurate Calculation of Percentages:**
   - All three queries produce the same percentage results, ensuring that they accurately calculate the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes.

4. **Alignment with the Task Requirements:**
   - **`2result.sql`** meets all the task requirements by:
     - Dynamically finding the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008.
     - Calculating the annual percentage shares for each of these categories in subsequent years.
     - Rounding the percentages to two decimal places (after adjusting the `ROUND` function if necessary).
     - Displaying each year in one row.

**Output:**

```plain
2result.sql
