Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure! Let's first identify the relevant tables, columns, and potential conditions for the task.

**Relevant Table:**
- **Table**: `CRIME_BY_LSOA` from the `LONDON_CRIME` schema in the `LONDON` database.

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**
- `"minor_category"`: To identify and group crimes by minor crime categories.
- `"value"`: To sum up the number of crimes (crime counts).
- `"year"`: To filter data for specific years (e.g., 2008) and to group crimes annually.
- `"borough"`: (Optional) To analyze crimes by borough if needed.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**
- Filter records where `"year"` = 2008 to find the top 5 minor crime categories for that year.
- Group data by `"minor_category"` and `"year"` to aggregate crime counts.
- Order results to identify top categories based on crime counts.

Now, here are 10 simple, short, non-nested Snowflake SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

```sql
-- 1. Get all distinct minor crime categories
SELECT DISTINCT "minor_category"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
LIMIT 1000;

-- 2. Get the total number of crimes per minor category in 2008
SELECT "minor_category", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
WHERE "year" = 2008
GROUP BY "minor_category"
ORDER BY "total_crimes" DESC
LIMIT 1000;

-- 3. Get the total number of crimes per year
SELECT "year", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
GROUP BY "year"
ORDER BY "year" ASC
LIMIT 1000;

-- 4. Get the total number of crimes per borough in 2008
SELECT "borough", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
WHERE "year" = 2008
GROUP BY "borough"
ORDER BY "total_crimes" DESC
LIMIT 1000;

-- 5. Get the years available in the dataset
SELECT DISTINCT "year"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
ORDER BY "year" ASC
LIMIT 1000;

-- 6. Get the monthly crime counts for 2008
SELECT "month", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
WHERE "year" = 2008
GROUP BY "month"
ORDER BY "month" ASC
LIMIT 1000;

-- 7. Get the total number of crimes per major category in 2008
SELECT "major_category", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
WHERE "year" = 2008
GROUP BY "major_category"
ORDER BY "total_crimes" DESC
LIMIT 1000;

-- 8. Get crime counts for a specific minor category over the years
SELECT "year", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
WHERE "minor_category" = 'Theft From Motor Vehicle'
GROUP BY "year"
ORDER BY "year" ASC
LIMIT 1000;

-- 9. Get the top 5 minor categories with the highest crime counts across all years
SELECT "minor_category", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
GROUP BY "minor_category"
ORDER BY "total_crimes" DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 10. Get crime counts per minor category and year
SELECT "year", "minor_category", SUM("value") AS "total_crimes"
FROM LONDON.LONDON_CRIME.CRIME_BY_LSOA
GROUP BY "year", "minor_category"
ORDER BY "year" ASC, "total_crimes" DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

These queries will help in understanding the distribution of crime data across different minor categories, years, and other dimensions. This understanding is essential for calculating the annual percentage shares of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row.Query:

Task: Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Sure, here's the format for the requested information:

```csv
Year,Minor_Category_1_Percentage,Minor_Category_2_Percentage,Minor_Category_3_Percentage,Minor_Category_4_Percentage,Minor_Category_5_Percentage
year1:int,percentage1:float [0,100],percentage2:float [0,100],percentage3:float [0,100],percentage4:float [0,100],percentage5:float [0,100]
year2:int,percentage1:float [0,100],percentage2:float [0,100],percentage3:float [0,100],percentage4:float [0,100],percentage5:float [0,100]
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: The year of the recorded crime data (integer).
- **Minor_Category_1_Percentage** to **Minor_Category_5_Percentage**: The annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of each of the top 5 minor crime categories identified from 2008, in London's total crimes for that year. The percentages are numeric values between 0 and 100.

Each row represents a year, displaying the percentage shares for each of the top 5 minor crime categories in that specific year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LONDON': {'LONDON_CRIME': ['CRIME_BY_LSOA'], 'LONDON_FIRE_BRIGADE': ['FIRE_BRIGADE_SERVICE_CALLS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 06:41:51 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide the annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of the top 5 minor crime categories from 2008 in London's total crimes, with each year displayed in one row?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Sure, here's the format for the requested information:

```csv
Year,Minor_Category_1_Percentage,Minor_Category_2_Percentage,Minor_Category_3_Percentage,Minor_Category_4_Percentage,Minor_Category_5_Percentage
year1:int,percentage1:float [0,100],percentage2:float [0,100],percentage3:float [0,100],percentage4:float [0,100],percentage5:float [0,100]
year2:int,percentage1:float [0,100],percentage2:float [0,100],percentage3:float [0,100],percentage4:float [0,100],percentage5:float [0,100]
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Year**: The year of the recorded crime data (integer).
- **Minor_Category_1_Percentage** to **Minor_Category_5_Percentage**: The annual percentage shares, rounded to two decimal places, of each of the top 5 minor crime categories identified from 2008, in London's total crimes for that year. The percentages are numeric values between 0 and 100.

Each row represents a year, displaying the percentage shares for each of the top 5 minor crime categories in that specific year. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
