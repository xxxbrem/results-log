After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is `2result.sql`.

**Reason:**

The task requires calculating, for each month, the total balance from all users for the **previous month**, measured as of the 1st of each month. Negative balances should be replaced with zero, and data from the first month should be used only as a baseline and excluded from the final output. The results should be sorted in ascending order by month.

The SQL in `2result.sql` correctly:

- **Calculates cumulative balances** per customer up to each transaction date, considering deposits as positive amounts and withdrawals/purchases as negative amounts.
- **Determines end-of-month balances** for each customer and adjusts any negative balances to zero.
- **Shifts the balances to the next month**, so each month's balance reflects the total balance from the **previous month**.
- **Excludes the first month's data** from the final output, as required.
- **Aggregates the adjusted balances** per month and sorts the results in ascending order.

The results in `2result.csv` display the total balances starting from the month following the first month, which aligns with the task's requirements. Therefore, `2result.sql` is the correct SQL.
