**Reason:**

The SQL query in `0result.sql` correctly implements the requirements specified in the task. Here's why:

- **FirstHop CTE:**
  - Selects transactions sent from the starting address (`'zil1jrpjd8pjuv50cfkfr7eu6yrm3rn5u8rulqhqpz'`), capturing potential intermediary addresses (`"to_addr"`).

- **IntermediaryTxCounts CTE:**
  - Calculates the number of outgoing transactions for each intermediary address by grouping on `"sender"` and applies the condition `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 50` to exclude intermediaries with more than 50 outgoing transactions.

- **ValidIntermediaries CTE:**
  - Joins `FirstHop` and `IntermediaryTxCounts` on the intermediary address to filter out intermediaries exceeding the transaction threshold, ensuring only valid intermediaries are considered.

- **SecondHop CTE:**
  - Selects transactions where the intermediary addresses (from `ValidIntermediaries`) send to the ending address (`'zil19nmxkh020jnequql9kvqkf3pkwm0j0spqtd26e'`), capturing the second hop of the path.

- **Final SELECT Statement:**
  - Joins `ValidIntermediaries` and `SecondHop` on the intermediary address.
  - Constructs the required path format by concatenating the starting address, intermediary address, and ending address, including the first 5 characters of each transaction ID.

**Conclusion:**

The `0result.sql` script effectively:

- Identifies all 2-hop paths from the specified starting address to the ending address via valid intermediaries.
- Excludes intermediaries with more than 50 outgoing transactions.
- Formats the output as per the specified requirements.

The other SQL scripts (`1result.sql` and `2result.sql`) attempt similar objectives but may have differences in implementation or may not align perfectly with the specified conditions. The `0result.sql` script provides a clear, concise, and accurate solution to the task.
