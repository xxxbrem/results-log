After reviewing the three SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have compared them based on how well they address the given task:

**Task Summary:**
- Identify the number of common autosomal variants (with allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared by different combinations of super populations.
- Include total population size for each super population combination.
- Include variant types and sample counts.
- Exclude sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) from the analysis.

**Comparison of the SQL Queries:**

1. **`0result.sql`:**
   - **Approach:**
     - Calculates the number of common autosomal variants for each super population individually.
     - Does not consider combinations of super populations.
     - Combines 'EAS' (East Asian) and 'SAS' (South Asian) into a single 'ASN' (Asian) super population for sample counts.
   - **Limitations:**
     - Does not identify variants shared by combinations of super populations.
     - Does not fully satisfy the requirement to analyze different combinations of super populations.

2. **`1result.sql`:**
   - **Approach:**
     - Constructs combinations of super populations by checking where the allele frequency (AF) of a variant is ≥ 0.05 in those populations.
     - Uses arrays to build super population combinations dynamically.
     - Calculates the number of common autosomal variants shared by these combinations.
     - Computes total population sizes and sample counts for each combination by summing the counts of constituent super populations.
   - **Strengths:**
     - Addresses the requirement to identify variants shared by different combinations of super populations.
     - Considers variant types and excludes sex chromosomes.
   - **Limitations:**
     - Uses 'EAS' instead of 'ASN' for the Asian super population, which may not align with the allele frequency columns ('ASN_AF') available in the `VARIANTS` table.
     - May not accurately represent the population sizes if 'SAS' is excluded from 'ASN' in the analysis.

3. **`2result.sql`:**
   - **Approach:**
     - Similar to `1result.sql`, but explicitly treats 'ASN' as a combination of 'EAS' and 'SAS' super populations.
     - Constructs super population combinations using 'AFR', 'AMR', 'EUR', and 'ASN'.
     - Calculates the number of common autosomal variants shared by these combinations.
     - Includes total population sizes and sample counts for each combination.
   - **Strengths:**
     - Correctly aligns with the allele frequency columns in the `VARIANTS` table, which uses 'ASN_AF'.
     - Accurately reflects the combined Asian super population by including both 'EAS' and 'SAS' in the sample counts.
     - Addresses all requirements of the task, including variant types, sample counts, and excluding sex chromosomes.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above comparison, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL script because it accurately fulfills the task requirements by:

- Identifying common autosomal variants shared by different combinations of super populations.
- Correctly handling the 'ASN' super population by including both 'EAS' and 'SAS' samples and allele frequencies.
- Excluding sex chromosomes from the analysis.
- Providing total population sizes, sample counts, and variant types for each super population combination.
