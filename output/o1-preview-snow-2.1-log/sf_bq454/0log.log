Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table: VARIANTS**

   - **"reference_name"**: Chromosome name; used to exclude sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) by selecting autosomal chromosomes only.
   - **"AF"**: Allele Frequency; used to filter variants with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05.
   - **"VT"**: Variant Type; used to identify the type of variant (e.g., SNP, INDEL).
   - **"alternate_bases"**: Alternate alleles; defines the variant alleles.
   - **"call"**: Genotype calls for samples; may be used to link variants to samples.
   - **"names"**: Variant identifiers; useful for identifying unique variants.
   - **"AC"**: Allele Count; potential use in calculating allele frequencies.
   - **"AN"**: Allele Number; total number of alleles in samples, used with "AC".
   - **Other Columns**: Additional variant annotations that may be relevant.

2. **Table: SAMPLE_INFO**

   - **"Sample"**: Sample ID; used to link genotype calls to sample information.
   - **"Super_Population"**: Indicates the super population each sample belongs to.
   - **"Super_Population_Description"**: Description of the super population.
   - **"Population"**: Specific population within a super population.
   - **"Gender"**: May be used if gender-based analysis is required.
   - **Other Columns**: Additional sample metadata that may be relevant.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- **Exclude Sex Chromosomes**: `"reference_name" NOT IN ('X', 'Y', 'MT')`.
- **Filter for Common Variants**: `"AF" >= 0.05`.
- **Filter by Variant Type**: `"VT" = 'SNP'` (or other variant types as needed).
- **Join Conditions**: Linking variants to samples via genotype calls and sample IDs.
- **Group By Super Populations**: Aggregate data by different super population combinations.
- **Sample Counts**: Counting the number of samples in each super population.
- **Exclude Specific Populations**: Conditions to exclude or include certain populations.

These queries are designed to explore the relevant data and understand the values in the columns related to the task. Each query selects specific columns, applies conditions, or performs aggregations to help analyze the data necessary for identifying common autosomal variants shared by different combinations of super populations.

**Note:** Adjustments may be needed based on the actual data and relationships between tables. For more complex analyses, additional joins or data transformations might be required.Query:

Task: Identify the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared by different combinations of super populations, total population size for each super population, variant types, and sample counts. Exclude sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) from the analysis.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Super_Population_Combination,Total_Population_Size,Variant_Type,Sample_Count,Number_of_Common_Autosomal_Variants
super_population_combination:str,total_population_size:int,variant_type:str,sample_count:int,number_of_variants:int
...
```

**Explanation:**
The table lists the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared among different combinations of super populations. Each row represents a unique combination of super populations, providing the total population size for that combination, the types of variants considered, the sample counts, and the number of common autosomal variants identified. Sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) have been excluded from the analysis to focus solely on autosomal variants..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'_1000_GENOMES': {'_1000_GENOMES': ['PEDIGREE', 'SAMPLE_INFO', 'VARIANTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 11:20:52 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Identify the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared by different combinations of super populations, total population size for each super population, variant types, and sample counts. Exclude sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) from the analysis., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Super_Population_Combination,Total_Population_Size,Variant_Type,Sample_Count,Number_of_Common_Autosomal_Variants
super_population_combination:str,total_population_size:int,variant_type:str,sample_count:int,number_of_variants:int
...
```

**Explanation:**
The table lists the number of common autosomal variants (with an allele frequency ≥ 0.05) shared among different combinations of super populations. Each row represents a unique combination of super populations, providing the total population size for that combination, the types of variants considered, the sample counts, and the number of common autosomal variants identified. Sex chromosomes (X, Y, MT) have been excluded from the analysis to focus solely on autosomal variants. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
