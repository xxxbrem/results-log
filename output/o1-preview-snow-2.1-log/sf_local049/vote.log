After reviewing both SQL queries, here's a comparison and the reasoning for selecting the correct one:

---

### **First Query (1result.sql):**

```sql
WITH
top_industry AS (
    SELECT
        i."industry"
    FROM
        "MODERN_DATA"."MODERN_DATA"."COMPANIES_FUNDING" f
        JOIN "MODERN_DATA"."MODERN_DATA"."COMPANIES_DATES" d
            ON f."company_id" = d."company_id"
        JOIN "MODERN_DATA"."MODERN_DATA"."COMPANIES_INDUSTRIES" i
            ON f."company_id" = i."company_id"
    WHERE
        f."valuation" >= 1000000000
        AND TO_DATE(SUBSTRING(d."date_joined", 1, 10), 'YYYY-MM-DD') BETWEEN TO_DATE('2019-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') AND TO_DATE('2021-12-31', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    GROUP BY
        i."industry"
    ORDER BY
        COUNT(DISTINCT f."company_id") DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 1
),
per_year AS (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(year FROM TO_DATE(SUBSTRING(d."date_joined", 1, 10), 'YYYY-MM-DD')) AS "year",
        COUNT(DISTINCT f."company_id") AS "company_count"
    FROM
        "MODERN_DATA"."MODERN_DATA"."COMPANIES_FUNDING" f
        JOIN "MODERN_DATA"."MODERN_DATA"."COMPANIES_DATES" d
            ON f."company_id" = d."company_id"
        JOIN "MODERN_DATA"."MODERN_DATA"."COMPANIES_INDUSTRIES" i
            ON f."company_id" = i."company_id"
    WHERE
        f."valuation" >= 1000000000
        AND i."industry" = (SELECT "industry" FROM top_industry)
        AND EXTRACT(year FROM TO_DATE(SUBSTRING(d."date_joined", 1, 10), 'YYYY-MM-DD')) BETWEEN 2019 AND 2021
    GROUP BY
        EXTRACT(year FROM TO_DATE(SUBSTRING(d."date_joined", 1, 10), 'YYYY-MM-DD'))
)
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG("company_count"), 4) AS "Average_new_unicorn_companies_per_year_in_top_industry"
FROM
    per_year;
```

**Result (1result.csv):**

| Average_new_unicorn_companies_per_year_in_top_industry |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 57.6667                                               |

---

### **Second Query (2result.sql):**

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT cf."company_id") / 3.0, 4) AS "Average_new_unicorn_companies_per_year_in_top_industry"
FROM "MODERN_DATA"."MODERN_DATA"."COMPANIES_FUNDING" cf
JOIN "MODERN_DATA"."MODERN_DATA"."COMPANIES_DATES" cd
  ON cf."company_id" = cd."company_id"
JOIN "MODERN_DATA"."MODERN_DATA"."COMPANIES_INDUSTRIES" ci
  ON cf."company_id" = ci."company_id"
WHERE cf."valuation" >= 1000000000
  AND cd."date_joined" >= '2019-01-01' AND cd."date_joined" <= '2021-12-31'
  AND ci."industry" = (
    SELECT ci2."industry"
    FROM "MODERN_DATA"."MODERN_DATA"."COMPANIES_FUNDING" cf2
    JOIN "MODERN_DATA"."MODERN_DATA"."COMPANIES_DATES" cd2
      ON cf2."company_id" = cd2."company_id"
    JOIN "MODERN_DATA"."MODERN_DATA"."COMPANIES_INDUSTRIES" ci2
      ON cf2."company_id" = ci2."company_id"
    WHERE cf2."valuation" >= 1000000000
      AND cd2."date_joined" >= '2019-01-01' AND cd2."date_joined" <= '2021-12-31'
    GROUP BY ci2."industry"
    ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT cf2."company_id") DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 1
  );
```

**Result (2result.csv):**

| Average_new_unicorn_companies_per_year_in_top_industry |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 57.6667                                               |

**Comparison and Reasoning:**

1. **Identification of the Top Industry:**

   - Both queries correctly identify the top industry with the highest number of new unicorn companies between 2019 and 2021 by counting the distinct companies per industry and selecting the one with the maximum count.

2. **Calculation Method:**

   - **First Query:** Calculates the average by first determining the number of new unicorns in the top industry for each year within the specified range. It then computes the average of these yearly counts, which accounts for fluctuations in the data across different years.
   - **Second Query:** Calculates the total number of new unicorns in the top industry over the three-year period and divides this total by 3.0 to obtain the average per year.

3. **Handling of Yearly Variations:**

   - **First Query:** By computing the average of yearly company counts, it inherently handles any variability in the number of new unicorns each year. This is important if the counts differ significantly from one year to another.
   - **Second Query:** Assumes the data is evenly distributed across the years by dividing the total count by 3. This method may not accurately reflect the average per year if there are disparities in yearly counts.

4. **Flexibility and Adaptability:**

   - **First Query:** Uses dynamic calculations to determine the number of years based on the data, which makes it adaptable to changes in the date range or datasets without modifying the code.
   - **Second Query:** Hardcodes the division by 3.0, which can lead to inaccuracies if the number of years changes or if data for any year is incomplete or missing.

**Conclusion:**

The **first query (1result.sql)** is the correct and more robust solution. It provides an accurate average by considering the actual yearly counts of new unicorn companies in the top industry. This method accounts for any fluctuations in data across the years and avoids potential inaccuracies that may arise from assuming an even distribution.
