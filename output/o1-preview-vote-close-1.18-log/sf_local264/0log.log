- **Table:** `STACKING.STACKING.MODEL`

  - **"name"**: Used to identify the model names; potential usage: differentiate between traditional models and the Stack model.
  - **"version"**: Model version number; potential usage: consider occurrences across different versions.
  - **"step"**: Modeling process step number; potential usage: consider occurrences across different steps.
  - **"L1_model"**: The category of the model; potential usage: count the frequency of each `L1_model`.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **`"name" = 'Stack'`**: To filter records related to the Stack model.
- **`"name" != 'Stack'`**: To filter records related to traditional models.

Task: Which model category (L1_model) appears the most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, and what is the total count of its occurrences?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the `L1_model` that appears most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, the result can be presented in the following format:

```csv
L1_model,Total_count
model_name:str,total_count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKING': {'STACKING': ['EDA', 'FEATURE_IMPORTANCE', 'MODEL', 'MODEL_IMPORTANCE', 'MODEL_SCORE', 'PROBLEM', 'SOLUTION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 18:50:22 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which model category (L1_model) appears the most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, and what is the total count of its occurrences?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To identify the `L1_model` that appears most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, the result can be presented in the following format:

```csv
L1_model,Total_count
model_name:str,total_count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
