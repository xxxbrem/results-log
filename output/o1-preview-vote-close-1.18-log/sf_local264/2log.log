**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `MODEL`
  - `"name"`: Potential usage - Identifies the model's name; can be used to distinguish between traditional models and the Stack model (e.g., models with "Stack" in their name could be Stack models).
  - `"version"`: Potential usage - Indicates different versions of the models; needed to consider occurrences across all versions.
  - `"step"`: Potential usage - Represents different steps in the modeling process; needed to consider occurrences across all steps.
  - `"L1_model"`: Potential usage - Specifies the category of the model; key column to determine which model category appears most frequently.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Comparing traditional models to the Stack model:**
  - Use the `"name"` column to filter models. Models where `"name"` contains "Stack" can be considered Stack models.
  - Use `"name" NOT ILIKE '%Stack%'` to select traditional models.
- **Aggregating counts across steps and versions:**
  - Do not filter by `"version"` or `"step"` to consider all occurrences.
- **Identifying model categories:**
  - Query distinct values of `"L1_model"` and count their occurrences.

**SQL Queries:**

1. ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "L1_model"
   FROM STACKING.STACKING.MODEL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```
   *Retrieve all distinct model categories (`L1_model`).*

Task: Which model category (L1_model) appears the most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, and what is the total count of its occurrences?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine which model category (`L1_model`) appears most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, we aggregate the counts of each `L1_model` from the `MODEL` table and identify the one with the highest occurrence.

```csv
L1_model,count
model_category:str,count:int (Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKING': {'STACKING': ['EDA', 'FEATURE_IMPORTANCE', 'MODEL', 'MODEL_IMPORTANCE', 'MODEL_SCORE', 'PROBLEM', 'SOLUTION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine which model category (`L1_model`) appears most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, we aggregate the counts of each `L1_model` from the `MODEL` table and identify the one with the highest occurrence.

```csv
L1_model,count
model_category:str,count:int (Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
