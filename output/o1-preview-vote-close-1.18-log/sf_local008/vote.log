I have compared the two SQL scripts and their results.

**Analysis:**

Both `1result.sql` and `2result.sql` aim to find the players with the highest values in games played, runs, hits, and home runs, along with their given names and corresponding scores.

- **`1result.sql`**: Uses a straightforward approach with Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for each statistic. It calculates the sum for each player, orders the results in descending order, and limits the output to the top player for each statistic.

- **`2result.sql`**: Takes a more elaborate approach by first calculating the total for each player, then finding the maximum value for each statistic, and finally retrieving all players who have achieved that maximum value.

**Reason for Choosing `1result.sql`:**

- **Simplicity**: `1result.sql` is simpler and more concise. It efficiently achieves the desired outcome without unnecessary complexity.

- **Efficiency**: By directly limiting the results to the top player using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT 1`, it reduces computational overhead.

- **Clarity**: The script is easier to read and understand, which makes maintenance and future modifications more manageable.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
