After comparing both SQL queries, I recommend using `2result.sql` as the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Joins:** The second SQL query (`2result.sql`) joins the county data with the employment data using the `"geo_id"` from the counties table and `"geoid"` from the employment data tables. These fields directly correspond to each other, ensuring a precise match between county records and employment records.

- **Direct Matching:** By using `"geo_id"` and `"geoid"`, the query avoids potential issues that might arise from casting and comparing fields of different data types, as seen in the first SQL query (`1result.sql`) which casts `"county_fips_code"` and `"area_fips"` to numbers. This reduces the risk of mismatches or errors due to data type inconsistencies.

- **Comprehensive Data Retrieval:** The second query does not rely on string patterns (like `'49%'`) to filter the data. Instead, it retrieves all relevant records based on the direct relationship between counties and their corresponding employment data, leading to a more reliable and comprehensive analysis.

- **Consistency with Data Definitions:** The use of `"geo_id"` and `"geoid"` aligns with the data definitions provided. These identifiers are intended to be used together and represent the same geographic entities across different tables.

**Conclusion:** For these reasons, `2result.sql` is the correct and preferred SQL query to determine the county in Utah with the greatest percentage increase in construction jobs from 2000 to 2018.
