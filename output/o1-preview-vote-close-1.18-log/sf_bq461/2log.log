Certainly! To provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, we'll first identify the relevant tables, columns, and potential conditions.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_TEAMS`
   - `"name"`: Potential usage - To find teams named "Wildcats" or "Fighting Irish".
   - `"market"`: Potential usage - To identify the team's market or city.
   - `"id"`: Potential usage - Unique identifier for each team; useful for joining tables.
   - `"alias"`: Potential usage - Alternate names or abbreviations of teams.
   
2. **Table:** `NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_PBP_SR` (Play-by-Play data)
   - `"game_id"`: Potential usage - To identify the specific game between the teams.
   - `"season"`: Potential usage - To filter data for the 2014 season.
   - `"team_name"`: Potential usage - To filter events involving the Wildcats or Fighting Irish.
   - `"team_id"`: Potential usage - To accurately identify teams in events.
   - `"period"`: Potential usage - Indicates the period of the game when the event occurred.
   - `"game_clock"`: Potential usage - Shows the time remaining in the period when the event occurred.
   - `"points_scored"`: Potential usage - To identify scoring plays (events where points were scored).
   - `"event_description"`: Potential usage - Provides details about each event.
   - `"elapsed_time_sec"`: Potential usage - To order events chronologically.
   - `"home_team"`: Potential usage - To determine if the team was playing at home.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter by `"season" = 2014` to focus on the 2014 season.
- Use `"team_name" ILIKE '%Wildcats%'` and `"team_name" ILIKE '%Fighting Irish%'` to find the teams.
- Identify scoring plays with `"points_scored" > 0`.
- Find the specific `"game_id"` where both teams played against each other.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Find the team IDs and details for teams named "Wildcats":**

   ```sql

    ```

13. **Find the periods in which scoring events occurred:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "period"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_PBP_SR
    WHERE "game_id" = 'SPECIFIC_GAME_ID'
      AND "points_scored" > 0;
    ```

14. **Get descriptions of all scoring events with exact timestamps:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "timestamp", "team_name", "points_scored", "event_description"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_PBP_SR
    WHERE "game_id" = 'SPECIFIC_GAME_ID'

Task: Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Here is a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, arranged chronologically:

```csv
Period,Game_Clock,Home_Team_Score,Away_Team_Score,Scoring_Team,Event_Description
period1:int,game_clock1:str,home_score1:int,away_score1:int,scoring_team1:str,event_description1:str
period2:int,game_clock2:str,home_score2:int,away_score2:int,scoring_team2:str,event_description2:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NCAA_BASKETBALL': {'NCAA_BASKETBALL': ['MASCOTS', 'MBB_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_GAMES', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TOURNAMENT_GAMES', 'MBB_PBP_SR', 'MBB_PLAYERS_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_TEAMS', 'MBB_TEAMS_GAMES_SR', 'TEAM_COLORS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 20:13:02 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Here is a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, arranged chronologically:

```csv
Period,Game_Clock,Home_Team_Score,Away_Team_Score,Scoring_Team,Event_Description
period1:int,game_clock1:str,home_score1:int,away_score1:int,scoring_team1:str,event_description1:str
period2:int,game_clock2:str,home_score2:int,away_score2:int,scoring_team2:str,event_description2:str
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
