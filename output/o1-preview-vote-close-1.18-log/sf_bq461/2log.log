Task: Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Unfortunately, I don't have access to the specific scoring plays for the game between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in the 2014 season. However, based on your database schema, you can retrieve this information from the `MBB_PBP_SR` table, which contains play-by-play data.

Here is the format of the data you might obtain:

```csv
Period,Game Clock,Team Scores,Team Scored,Description
period:int,game_clock:str,team_scores:str,team_scored:str,scoring_event_description:str
period:int,game_clock:str,team_scores:str,team_scored:str,scoring_event_description:str
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Period**: The quarter or half in which the scoring event occurred.
- **Game Clock**: The time left on the clock when the event happened.
- **Team Scores**: The cumulative scores of both teams at that point in the game.
- **Team Scored**: The team that scored during the event (e.g., Wildcats or Fighting Irish).
- **Description**: A brief description of the scoring event (e.g., "Three-point shot made by Player X").

This table would list each scoring play chronologically, allowing you to see how the game progressed over time..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NCAA_BASKETBALL': {'NCAA_BASKETBALL': ['MASCOTS', 'MBB_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_GAMES', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TOURNAMENT_GAMES', 'MBB_PBP_SR', 'MBB_PLAYERS_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_TEAMS', 'MBB_TEAMS_GAMES_SR', 'TEAM_COLORS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
