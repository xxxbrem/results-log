Task: Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
period,game_clock,team_score_wildcats,team_score_fighting_irish,scoring_team,description
period:int,game_clock:str,score_wildcats:int,score_fighting_irish:int,scoring_team:str,description:str
period:int,game_clock:str,score_wildcats:int,score_fighting_irish:int,scoring_team:str,description:str
...
```

This table summarizes the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish during their 2014 season game. It includes the period, game clock, current team scores for both teams, the team that scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NCAA_BASKETBALL': {'NCAA_BASKETBALL': ['MASCOTS', 'MBB_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_GAMES', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TOURNAMENT_GAMES', 'MBB_PBP_SR', 'MBB_PLAYERS_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_TEAMS', 'MBB_TEAMS_GAMES_SR', 'TEAM_COLORS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
