    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "event_description"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_PBP_SR
    WHERE "points_scored" > 0
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

19. **Identify the team IDs for "Kentucky Wildcats" and "Notre Dame Fighting Irish" specifically:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "name", "market"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_TEAMS
    WHERE ("name" ILIKE '%Wildcats%' AND "market" = 'Kentucky')
       OR ("name" ILIKE '%Fighting Irish%' AND "market" = 'Notre Dame')
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

20. **Retrieve the play-by-play data for the specific game, including elapsed time for chronological arrangement:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "period", "game_clock", "elapsed_time_sec", "team_name", "points_scored", "event_description"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL.MBB_PBP_SR
    WHERE "game_id" = 'specific_game_id'
      AND "points_scored" > 0
    ORDER BY "elapsed_time_sec" ASC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

    *(Replace 'specific_game_id' with the actual game_id from previous queries.)*

These queries will help in understanding the structure of the data and retrieving the necessary information to summarize the scoring plays between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game.Query:

Task: Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To summarize the scoring plays between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, here are the details of each scoring event arranged chronologically:

```csv
Period,Game_clock,Team_scores,Team_scored,Event_description
period1:int,game_clock1:str,team_scores1:str,team_scored1:str,description1:str
period2:int,game_clock2:str,team_scores2:str,team_scored2:str,description2:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NCAA_BASKETBALL': {'NCAA_BASKETBALL': ['MASCOTS', 'MBB_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_GAMES', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TOURNAMENT_GAMES', 'MBB_PBP_SR', 'MBB_PLAYERS_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_TEAMS', 'MBB_TEAMS_GAMES_SR', 'TEAM_COLORS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 14:59:29 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To summarize the scoring plays between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, here are the details of each scoring event arranged chronologically:

```csv
Period,Game_clock,Team_scores,Team_scored,Event_description
period1:int,game_clock1:str,team_scores1:str,team_scored1:str,description1:str
period2:int,game_clock2:str,team_scores2:str,team_scored2:str,description2:str
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-18 15:00:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To summarize the scoring plays between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, here are the details of each scoring event arranged chronologically:

```csv
Period,Game_clock,Team_scores,Team_scored,Event_description

2025-01-18 15:00:47 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To summarize the scoring plays between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, here are the details of each scoring event arranged chronologically:

```csv
Period,Game_clock,Team_scores,Team_scored,Event_description
period1:int,game_clock1:str,team_scores1:str,team_scored1:str,description1:str
period2:int,game_clock2:str,team_scores2:str,team_scored2:str,description2:str
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-18 15:01:39 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To summarize the scoring plays between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, here are the details of each scoring event arranged chronologically:

```csv
Period,Game_clock,Team_scores,Team_scored,Event_description
period1:int,game_clock1:str,team_scores1:str,team_scored1:str,description1:str
period2:int,game_clock2:str,team_scores2:str,team_scored2:str,description2:str
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
