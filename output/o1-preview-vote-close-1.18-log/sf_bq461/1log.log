   WHERE "season" = 2014
     AND (
       ("h_name" ILIKE '%Wildcats%' AND "a_name" ILIKE '%Fighting Irish%')
       OR ("h_name" ILIKE '%Fighting Irish%' AND "a_name" ILIKE '%Wildcats%')
     );
   ```

6. **List distinct event types in the play-by-play data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "event_type"

   ```

7. **Find all scoring events in the play-by-play data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "event_type", "points_scored"
   FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR"
   WHERE "points_scored" > 0;
   ```

8. **Retrieve scoring plays for the specific game between Wildcats and Fighting Irish:**

   *(Assuming the game ID is known and replaced here as 'specific_game_id')*

   ```sql
   SELECT "period", "game_clock", "team_name", "points_scored", "event_description"
   FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR"
   WHERE "game_id" = 'specific_game_id'
     AND "points_scored" > 0
   ORDER BY "period", "game_clock" DESC;
   ```

9. **List teams involved in a specific game:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "team_name"
   FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR"
   WHERE "game_id" = 'specific_game_id';
   ```

10. **Check available seasons in the play-by-play data:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "season"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR";
    ```

11. **Get the event descriptions for the specific game:**

    SELECT "period", "game_clock", "team_name", "event_type", "event_description"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR"
    WHERE "game_id" = 'specific_game_id'
    ORDER BY "period", "game_clock" DESC;
    ```

13. **Identify how points are recorded in events (e.g., shots, free throws):**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "event_type", "type", "points_scored"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR"
    WHERE "points_scored" > 0;
    ```

14. **Verify if 'event_type' always corresponds to scoring when 'points_scored' > 0:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "event_type", COUNT(*)
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR"
    WHERE "points_scored" > 0
    GROUP BY "event_type";
    ```

15. **Get the number of scoring plays per team in the specific game:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "team_name", COUNT(*) AS "scoring_plays"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR"
    WHERE "game_id" = 'specific_game_id'
      AND "points_scored" > 0
    GROUP BY "team_name";
    ```

16. **Find the total points scored by each team in the specific game:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "team_name", SUM("points_scored") AS "total_points"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR"
    WHERE "game_id" = 'specific_game_id'
    GROUP BY "team_name";
    ```

17. **Retrieve the play-by-play data for the specific game, focusing on scoring events:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "period", "game_clock", "team_name", "points_scored", "event_description"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR"
    WHERE "game_id" = 'specific_game_id'
      AND "points_scored" > 0
    ORDER BY "period", "game_clock" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

18. **Determine the types of shots that result in scoring (e.g., jump shot, layup):**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "type", "shot_type", "points_scored"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR"
    WHERE "points_scored" > 0;
    ```

19. **Identify all plays involving the Wildcats in the 2014 season:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "game_id", "team_name", "event_description"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR"
    WHERE "season" = 2014
      AND "team_name" ILIKE '%Wildcats%';
    ```

20. **Identify all plays involving the Fighting Irish in the 2014 season:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "game_id", "team_name", "event_description"
    FROM NCAA_BASKETBALL.NCAA_BASKETBALL."MBB_PBP_SR"
    WHERE "season" = 2014
      AND "team_name" ILIKE '%Fighting Irish%';
    ```

### **Note:**
- Replace `'specific_game_id'` with the actual game ID once identified from previous queries.
- The `ILIKE` operator is used for case-insensitive pattern matching.
- Ordering by `"game_clock" DESC` assumes the game clock counts down (as is standard in basketball).

By executing these queries, you can gather the necessary information to compile a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game. Each query serves a specific purpose in identifying teams, games, and scoring events relevant to your task.Query:

Task: Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the specific summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game because I don't have access to the actual game data. However, I can guide you on how you might retrieve this information from your database if you have access to it.

You can query the `MBB_PBP_SR` table, which contains play-by-play data for men's college basketball games. Here's how you might structure your query to obtain the desired information:

1. **Filter** the records for the game between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in the 2014 season.
2. **Select** the relevant columns:
   - `period`
   - `game_clock`
   - `team_name` (to identify which team scored)
   - `points_scored` (to update team scores)
   - `event_description` (description of the scoring event)
3. **Sort** the data chronologically based on period and game clock.

Once you have extracted the data, you can arrange it in a CSV format like the following:

```csv
period,game_clock,home_score,away_score,scoring_team,description
1,20:00,0,0,Start of the game,Game start
1,19:45,2,0,Wildcats,Player X made a 2-point jump shot
1,19:30,2,2,Fighting Irish,Player Y made a 2-point layup
...
```

This table includes:
- **Period**: The game period when the event occurred.
- **Game Clock**: The time remaining in the period.
- **Home Score** and **Away Score**: The team scores after the scoring event.
- **Scoring Team**: The team that scored (Wildcats or Fighting Irish).
- **Description**: A brief description of the scoring event.

**Explanation:**
This format provides a chronological summary of all scoring plays, showing how the score changes over time, which team scored, and what happened during each scoring event.

If you have access to the database, running the appropriate SQL query on the `MBB_PBP_SR` table will allow you to extract and compile this information..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NCAA_BASKETBALL': {'NCAA_BASKETBALL': ['MASCOTS', 'MBB_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_GAMES', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TOURNAMENT_GAMES', 'MBB_PBP_SR', 'MBB_PLAYERS_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_TEAMS', 'MBB_TEAMS_GAMES_SR', 'TEAM_COLORS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 20:07:16 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the specific summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game because I don't have access to the actual game data. However, I can guide you on how you might retrieve this information from your database if you have access to it.

You can query the `MBB_PBP_SR` table, which contains play-by-play data for men's college basketball games. Here's how you might structure your query to obtain the desired information:

1. **Filter** the records for the game between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in the 2014 season.
2. **Select** the relevant columns:
   - `period`
   - `game_clock`
   - `team_name` (to identify which team scored)
   - `points_scored` (to update team scores)
   - `event_description` (description of the scoring event)
3. **Sort** the data chronologically based on period and game clock.

Once you have extracted the data, you can arrange it in a CSV format like the following:

```csv
period,game_clock,home_score,away_score,scoring_team,description
1,20:00,0,0,Start of the game,Game start
1,19:45,2,0,Wildcats,Player X made a 2-point jump shot
1,19:30,2,2,Fighting Irish,Player Y made a 2-point layup
...
```

This table includes:
- **Period**: The game period when the event occurred.
- **Game Clock**: The time remaining in the period.
- **Home Score** and **Away Score**: The team scores after the scoring event.
- **Scoring Team**: The team that scored (Wildcats or Fighting Irish).
- **Description**: A brief description of the scoring event.

**Explanation:**
This format provides a chronological summary of all scoring plays, showing how the score changes over time, which team scored, and what happened during each scoring event.

If you have access to the database, running the appropriate SQL query on the `MBB_PBP_SR` table will allow you to extract and compile this information. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

   - `team_name` (to identify which team scored)
   - `points_scored` (to update team scores)
   - `event_description` (description of the scoring event)
3. **Sort** the data chronologically based on period and game clock.

Once you have extracted the data, you can arrange it in a CSV format like the following:

```csv
period,game_clock,home_score,away_score,scoring_team,description
1,20:00,0,0,Start of the game,Game start
1,19:45,2,0,Wildcats,Player X made a 2-point jump shot
1,19:30,2,2,Fighting Irish,Player Y made a 2-point layup
...
```

This table includes:
- **Period**: The game period when the event occurred.
- **Game Clock**: The time remaining in the period.
- **Home Score** and **Away Score**: The team scores after the scoring event.
- **Scoring Team**: The team that scored (Wildcats or Fighting Irish).
- **Description**: A brief description of the scoring event.

**Explanation:**
This format provides a chronological summary of all scoring plays, showing how the score changes over time, which team scored, and what happened during each scoring event.

If you have access to the database, running the appropriate SQL query on the `MBB_PBP_SR` table will allow you to extract and compile this information. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-18 20:08:07 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the specific summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game because I don't have access to the actual game data. However, I can guide you on how you might retrieve this information from your database if you have access to it.

You can query the `MBB_PBP_SR` table, which contains play-by-play data for men's college basketball games. Here's how you might structure your query to obtain the desired information:

1. **Filter** the records for the game between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in the 2014 season.
2. **Select** the relevant columns:
   - `period`
   - `game_clock`
   - `team_name` (to identify which team scored)
   - `points_scored` (to update team scores)
   - `event_description` (description of the scoring event)
3. **Sort** the data chronologically based on period and game clock.

Once you have extracted the data, you can arrange it in a CSV format like the following:

```csv
period,game_clock,home_score,away_score,scoring_team,description
1,20:00,0,0,Start of the game,Game start
1,19:45,2,0,Wildcats,Player X made a 2-point jump shot
1,19:30,2,2,Fighting Irish,Player Y made a 2-point layup
...
```

This table includes:
- **Period**: The game period when the event occurred.
- **Game Clock**: The time remaining in the period.
- **Home Score** and **Away Score**: The team scores after the scoring event.
- **Scoring Team**: The team that scored (Wildcats or Fighting Irish).
- **Description**: A brief description of the scoring event.

**Explanation:**
This format provides a chronological summary of all scoring plays, showing how the score changes over time, which team scored, and what happened during each scoring event.

If you have access to the database, running the appropriate SQL query on the `MBB_PBP_SR` table will allow you to extract and compile this information. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-18 20:08:39 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the specific summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game because I don't have access to the actual game data. However, I can guide you on how you might retrieve this information from your database if you have access to it.

You can query the `MBB_PBP_SR` table, which contains play-by-play data for men's college basketball games. Here's how you might structure your query to obtain the desired information:

1. **Filter** the records for the game between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in the 2014 season.
2. **Select** the relevant columns:
   - `period`
   - `game_clock`
   - `team_name` (to identify which team scored)
   - `points_scored` (to update team scores)
   - `event_description` (description of the scoring event)
3. **Sort** the data chronologically based on period and game clock.

Once you have extracted the data, you can arrange it in a CSV format like the following:

```csv
period,game_clock,home_score,away_score,scoring_team,description
1,20:00,0,0,Start of the game,Game start
1,19:45,2,0,Wildcats,Player X made a 2-point jump shot
1,19:30,2,2,Fighting Irish,Player Y made a 2-point layup
...
```

This table includes:
- **Period**: The game period when the event occurred.
- **Game Clock**: The time remaining in the period.
- **Home Score** and **Away Score**: The team scores after the scoring event.
- **Scoring Team**: The team that scored (Wildcats or Fighting Irish).
- **Description**: A brief description of the scoring event.

**Explanation:**
This format provides a chronological summary of all scoring plays, showing how the score changes over time, which team scored, and what happened during each scoring event.

If you have access to the database, running the appropriate SQL query on the `MBB_PBP_SR` table will allow you to extract and compile this information. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-18 20:09:38 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the specific summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game because I don't have access to the actual game data. However, I can guide you on how you might retrieve this information from your database if you have access to it.

You can query the `MBB_PBP_SR` table, which contains play-by-play data for men's college basketball games. Here's how you might structure your query to obtain the desired information:

1. **Filter** the records for the game between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in the 2014 season.
2. **Select** the relevant columns:
   - `period`
   - `game_clock`
   - `team_name` (to identify which team scored)
   - `points_scored` (to update team scores)
   - `event_description` (description of the scoring event)
3. **Sort** the data chronologically based on period and game clock.

Once you have extracted the data, you can arrange it in a CSV format like the following:

```csv
period,game_clock,home_score,away_score,scoring_team,description
1,20:00,0,0,Start of the game,Game start
1,19:45,2,0,Wildcats,Player X made a 2-point jump shot
1,19:30,2,2,Fighting Irish,Player Y made a 2-point layup
...
```

This table includes:
- **Period**: The game period when the event occurred.
- **Game Clock**: The time remaining in the period.
- **Home Score** and **Away Score**: The team scores after the scoring event.
- **Scoring Team**: The team that scored (Wildcats or Fighting Irish).
- **Description**: A brief description of the scoring event.

**Explanation:**
This format provides a chronological summary of all scoring plays, showing how the score changes over time, which team scored, and what happened during each scoring event.

If you have access to the database, running the appropriate SQL query on the `MBB_PBP_SR` table will allow you to extract and compile this information. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-18 20:10:32 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the specific summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game because I don't have access to the actual game data. However, I can guide you on how you might retrieve this information from your database if you have access to it.

You can query the `MBB_PBP_SR` table, which contains play-by-play data for men's college basketball games. Here's how you might structure your query to obtain the desired information:

1. **Filter** the records for the game between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in the 2014 season.
2. **Select** the relevant columns:
   - `period`
   - `game_clock`
   - `team_name` (to identify which team scored)
   - `points_scored` (to update team scores)
   - `event_description` (description of the scoring event)
3. **Sort** the data chronologically based on period and game clock.

Once you have extracted the data, you can arrange it in a CSV format like the following:

```csv
period,game_clock,home_score,away_score,scoring_team,description
1,20:00,0,0,Start of the game,Game start
1,19:45,2,0,Wildcats,Player X made a 2-point jump shot
1,19:30,2,2,Fighting Irish,Player Y made a 2-point layup
...
```

This table includes:
- **Period**: The game period when the event occurred.
- **Game Clock**: The time remaining in the period.
- **Home Score** and **Away Score**: The team scores after the scoring event.
- **Scoring Team**: The team that scored (Wildcats or Fighting Irish).
- **Description**: A brief description of the scoring event.

**Explanation:**
This format provides a chronological summary of all scoring plays, showing how the score changes over time, which team scored, and what happened during each scoring event.

If you have access to the database, running the appropriate SQL query on the `MBB_PBP_SR` table will allow you to extract and compile this information. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
