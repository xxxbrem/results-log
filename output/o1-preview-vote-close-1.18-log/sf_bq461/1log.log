   - `"id"`: The unique team identifier; useful for linking with other tables.

2. **Table:** `"NCAA_BASKETBALL"."NCAA_BASKETBALL"."MBB_GAMES_SR"`
   - `"game_id"`: To identify specific games.
   - `"season"`: To filter games from the 2014 season.
   - `"h_market"`, `"h_id"`: Home team market and ID.
   - `"a_market"`, `"a_id"`: Away team market and ID.

3. **Table:** `"NCAA_BASKETBALL"."NCAA_BASKETBALL"."MBB_PBP_SR"`
   - `"game_id"`: To link play-by-play events to a specific game.
   - `"season"`: To filter events from the 2014 season.
   - `"team_id"`: The team performing the action; used to identify scoring team.
   - `"team_market"`: Market (nickname) of the team; useful for matching "Wildcats" or "Fighting Irish".
   - `"period"`: The period of the game when the event occurred.

Task: Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Certainly! Here is a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, arranged chronologically:

```csv
Period,GameClock,TeamScore,ScoringTeam,EventDescription
period1:int,game_clock1:str,team_score1:int,scoring_team1:str,event_description1:str
period2:int,game_clock2:str,team_score2:int,scoring_team2:str,event_description2:str
...
```

This table includes the period, game clock time, team scores at each scoring event, which team scored, and a description of the scoring play..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NCAA_BASKETBALL': {'NCAA_BASKETBALL': ['MASCOTS', 'MBB_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_GAMES', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TEAMS_SEASONS', 'MBB_HISTORICAL_TOURNAMENT_GAMES', 'MBB_PBP_SR', 'MBB_PLAYERS_GAMES_SR', 'MBB_TEAMS', 'MBB_TEAMS_GAMES_SR', 'TEAM_COLORS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

This query performs the following steps:

1. **Identify the Game Between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in 2014:**
   - The inner `SELECT` within the `IN` clause finds the `game_id` where both Notre Dame and a Wildcats team (Kentucky) played each other in the 2014 season.

2. **Extract Scoring Events:**
   - The `scoring_events` CTE (Common Table Expression) filters for scoring plays (`points_scored` > 0) involving either Notre Dame or Kentucky.
   - It parses the `"game_clock"` to calculate the `"seconds_remaining_in_period"`.

3. **Compute Elapsed Seconds:**
   - The `ordered_events` CTE calculates the total `"seconds_elapsed"` in the game for each event to properly order the plays chronologically.

4. **Calculate Cumulative Scores:**
   - The `events_with_scores` CTE computes the cumulative scores for both teams up to each event using window functions.

5. **Select and Order the Final Output:**
   - The final `SELECT` statement retrieves the required columns and orders the events chronologically based on `"seconds_elapsed"`.

**Note:** This table includes the period, game clock time, cumulative team scores at each scoring event, which team scored, and a description of the scoring play.

**Example Output:**

```csv
Period,GameClock,Notre Dame Score,Wildcats Score,ScoringTeam,EventDescription
1,"19:45",2,0,"Notre Dame","Pat Connaughton makes two point layup"
1,"19:20",2,3,"Kentucky","Devin Booker makes three point jump shot"
1,"18:55",4,3,"Notre Dame","Jerian Grant makes two point jump shot"
...
```

This output provides a detailed summary of the scoring plays for both teams during their game in the 2014 season, arranged in chronological order.

2025-01-18 15:07:16 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Certainly! Here is a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, arranged chronologically:

```csv
Period,GameClock,TeamScore,ScoringTeam,EventDescription
period1:int,game_clock1:str,team_score1:int,scoring_team1:str,event_description1:str
period2:int,game_clock2:str,team_score2:int,scoring_team2:str,event_description2:str
...
```

This table includes the period, game clock time, team scores at each scoring event, which team scored, and a description of the scoring play. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-18 15:07:41 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Certainly! Here is a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, arranged chronologically:

```csv
Period,GameClock,TeamScore,ScoringTeam,EventDescription
period1:int,game_clock1:str,team_score1:int,scoring_team1:str,event_description1:str
period2:int,game_clock2:str,team_score2:int,scoring_team2:str,event_description2:str
...
```

This table includes the period, game clock time, team scores at each scoring event, which team scored, and a description of the scoring play. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-18 15:09:18 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game? I'd like to see details like the period, game clock, team scores, which team scored, and a description of each scoring event, all arranged chronologically., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Certainly! Here is a summary of the scoring plays for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game, arranged chronologically:

```csv
Period,GameClock,TeamScore,ScoringTeam,EventDescription
period1:int,game_clock1:str,team_score1:int,scoring_team1:str,event_description1:str
period2:int,game_clock2:str,team_score2:int,scoring_team2:str,event_description2:str
...
```

This table includes the period, game clock time, team scores at each scoring event, which team scored, and a description of the scoring play. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
