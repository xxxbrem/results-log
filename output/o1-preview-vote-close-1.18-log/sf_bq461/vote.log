After carefully comparing both SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script to accomplish the task. Here's the reasoning:

### **Reasoning:**

1. **Direct Use of Specific Game ID:**
   - **`0result.sql`** directly references the specific `game_id` (`'95cda731-b593-42cd-8573-621a3d1369dc'`) corresponding to the 2014 season game between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish. This ensures that only the scoring events from the relevant game are included.
   - **`1result.sql`** attempts to infer the `game_id` by intersecting games where both teams played in the season, which could potentially include multiple games or introduce errors if the team names are not unique.

2. **Accurate Calculation of Cumulative Scores:**
   - **`0result.sql`** calculates the cumulative scores for each team accurately by using window functions (`SUM OVER`) partitioned over the elapsed time. It tracks the running total of points for the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish separately, ensuring the `Team_scores` reflect the game progression correctly.
   - **`1result.sql`** calculates the `TeamScore` but does not differentiate between the teams clearly, which might lead to misrepresentation in cumulative scoring if not properly partitioned.

3. **Clear and Descriptive Output:**
   - **`0result.sql`** provides an output that matches the requested format:
     - **Period:** The period of play.
     - **Game_clock:** The remaining time in the period.
     - **Team_scores:** The cumulative scores of both teams at each point in time, formatted as "Wildcats_score - Fighting Irish_score."
     - **Team_scored:** Clearly identifies which team scored during each event.
     - **Event_description:** A detailed description of the scoring event.
   - The output is arranged chronologically, showing the flow of the game as requested.

4. **Use of Team IDs for Accuracy:**
   - **`0result.sql`** uses the specific team IDs for the Wildcats (`'2267a1f4-68f6-418b-aaf6-2aa0c4b291f1'`) and the Fighting Irish (`'80962f09-8821-48b6-8cf0-0cf0eea56aa8'`) to ensure that the scoring events are accurately attributed, avoiding any ambiguity that might arise from team name variations.
   
5. **Comprehensive and Efficient Query:**
   - The query in **`0result.sql`** is more concise and efficient, focusing solely on the necessary data without additional complexities.
   - It retrieves and processes the required information in a straightforward manner, which enhances performance and reduces the likelihood of errors.

### **Conclusion:**

Based on the above reasons, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL script that fulfills the task's requirements effectively, providing an accurate and detailed summary of the scoring plays between the Wildcats and the Fighting Irish in their 2014 season game.
