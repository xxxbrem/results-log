Upon comparing the two SQL queries and their results, the following observations can be made:

1. **Table Name Formatting**:
   - **`1result.sql`**: Uses `FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS`.
   - **`2result.sql`**: Uses `FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDERS"` with double quotes around `"ORDERS"`.

   Using double quotes around table names can be important in SQL when:
   - The table name is a reserved keyword.
   - The table name contains special characters or mixed-case letters and the database is case-sensitive.

2. **Column Aliases**:
   - **`1result.sql`**: Aliases the columns as `"NumberOfLateOrders"` and `"LateOrderPercentage"`.
   - **`2result.sql`**: Aliases the columns as `"LateOrders"` and `"PercentageLate"`.

   Both sets of aliases are acceptable, but `"LateOrders"` and `"PercentageLate"` may be slightly more concise.

3. **Syntax and Consistency**:
   - Both queries use `TRY_TO_DATE` functions to safely parse date strings.
   - Both have the same `WHERE` conditions, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.
   - Both queries produce identical results.

**Conclusion**:

Given that `2result.sql` includes double quotes around the table name `"ORDERS"`, it is more robust against potential SQL syntax issues related to case sensitivity or reserved keywords. Therefore, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL to use.
