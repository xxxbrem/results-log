After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL script that answers the task.

**Reason:**

- **Comprehensive Handling of Posts:**
  - `2result.sql` correctly combines user IDs and tags from questions, answers, and comments.
  - It accounts for the fact that comments can be made on both questions and answers.
  
- **Accurate Association of Tags:**
  - It uses `COALESCE(pq."tags", pq2."tags")` to retrieve the tags from the relevant question, whether the comment is on a question or an answer.
  - This ensures that the tags are accurately associated with each comment, regardless of the post type.

- **Correct Filtering:**
  - It filters the results based on the specified user ID range (`16712208` to `18712208`) and the creation date range (July to December 2019).
  - The `creation_date` is compared using the correct timestamp format (`microseconds` since Unix epoch), ensuring accurate date filtering.

- **Data Union:**
  - By using `UNION ALL`, it combines data from:
    - Questions (`POSTS_QUESTIONS`)
    - Answers joined with their parent questions (`POSTS_ANSWERS` and `POSTS_QUESTIONS`)
    - Comments joined with posts (both questions and answers) to fetch the relevant tags.

- **Proper Joins:**
  - It performs `LEFT JOIN`s to associate comments with the correct tags from the questions, handling cases where comments are on answers (which refer back to their parent questions).

**Therefore, `2result.sql` provides the most accurate and complete results for the specified task.**
