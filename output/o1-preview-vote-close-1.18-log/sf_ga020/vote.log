After carefully comparing the SQL queries and their results:

**0result.sql**:
- Calculates retention rates for quickplay event types based on event names containing 'quickplay'.
- The lowest retention rate is for **'level_reset_quickplay'** at **0.1993**.

**1result.sql**:
- Also calculates retention rates for quickplay event types based on event names containing 'quickplay'.
- The lowest retention rate is for **'level_start_quickplay'** at **0.1748**.

**2result.sql**:
- Uses the 'board' parameter from 'event_params' as the quickplay event type (e.g., 'S' for Small board).
- The retention rate for **'S'** is **20.4276%**.

Given that the question refers to quickplay event types as event names containing 'quickplay', and considering the retention rates calculated, **1result.sql** correctly identifies the event type with the lowest retention rate during the second week after initial engagement.
