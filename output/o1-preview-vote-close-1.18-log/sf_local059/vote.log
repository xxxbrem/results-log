After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL is **1result.sql**.

**Reason:**

- **1result.sql** calculates the total quantity sold for each product in 2021 within each division.
- It then identifies the top three best-selling products in each division based on these total quantities.
- The query computes the average of the **total quantities sold** of these top three products per division.
- This approach aligns with the task requirement: to find the **overall average quantity sold** of the top three best-selling products in each division, considering their **total quantities sold**.

In contrast:

- **0result.sql** and **2result.sql** calculate the average of the **sold quantities per transaction** for the top three products. They consider individual transaction quantities rather than the total quantities sold per product.
- Therefore, their results represent the average transaction size for the top products, not the average of the total quantities sold, which is not what the task requires.

The task specifically asks for the average of the **total quantities sold** of the top three best-selling products in each division, which is correctly implemented in **1result.sql**.
