After analyzing the three SQL queries and their corresponding results, **Option 2** (`2result.sql`) is the correct SQL query. Here's the reasoning:

### **Reasoning:**

1. **Accurate Handling of Exclusions and Extras:**
   - Option 2 correctly parses and applies the exclusions and extras for each order.
   - It ensures that extra toppings are added even if they are duplicates of the default toppings, which aligns with the interpretation that extras are additional quantities.
   - It handles the removal of excluded toppings effectively.

2. **Correct Inclusion of Delivered Orders:**
   - Only orders that were actually delivered (i.e., not canceled) are considered.
   - It accurately joins the `PIZZA_CLEAN_CUSTOMER_ORDERS` and `PIZZA_CLEAN_RUNNER_ORDERS` tables to filter out canceled orders.

3. **Accurate Counting of Ingredients:**
   - The total quantities for each ingredient calculated in Option 2 closely match the expected counts based on the delivered orders and their adjustments.
   - For instance, it correctly computes:
     - **Bacon**: 12 (matching adjustments for extras and duplicates)
     - **BBQ Sauce**: 8
     - **Cheese**: 10
     - **Mushrooms**: 11

4. **Alignment with Data Analysis:**
   - Option 2's results align with a detailed recalculation of the toppings used in each delivered pizza.
   - It considers orders with multiple pizzas and correctly aggregates the toppings.

5. **Comprehensive SQL Query:**
   - The SQL query in Option 2 uses clear and efficient common table expressions (CTEs) to structure the data processing steps.
   - It utilizes functions like `SPLIT`, `REGEXP_REPLACE`, and `ARRAY_CAT` to parse and manipulate the topping lists accurately.

### **Conclusion:**

Option 2 provides the most accurate and reliable summary of the total quantity of each ingredient used in the delivered pizzas, based on the provided data and requirements.
