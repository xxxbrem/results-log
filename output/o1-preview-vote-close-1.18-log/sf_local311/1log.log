**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **RESULTS**
   - **"driver_id"**: To identify drivers and calculate their points per race.
   - **"constructor_id"**: To associate drivers with their constructors.
   - **"race_id"**: To link results to specific races and years.
   - **"points"**: Points earned by drivers in each race.

2. **RACES**
   - **"race_id"**: To link with results and standings.
   - **"year"**: To identify the year of each race.

3. **DRIVERS**
   - **"driver_id"**: To identify drivers.
   - **"forename"**, **"surname"**: For driver names.

4. **CONSTRUCTORS**
   - **"constructor_id"**: To identify constructor teams.
   - **"name"**: Constructor team names.

5. **CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS**
   - **"constructor_id"**: To identify constructors.
   - **"race_id"**: To link to races.
   - **"points"**: Points earned by constructors in each race.

6. **DRIVER_STANDINGS**
   - **"driver_id"**: To track cumulative points of drivers.
   - **"race_id"**: To link standings to specific races and years.
   - **"points"**: Cumulative points up to each race.

7. **CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS**
   - **"constructor_id"**: To track cumulative points of constructors.
   - **"race_id"**: To link standings to specific races and years.
   - **"points"**: Cumulative points up to each race.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Join **RESULTS** with **RACES** on **"race_id"** to obtain the year.
- Aggregate points per driver per year to find the top-performing drivers.
- Aggregate points per constructor per year to find the top-performing teams.
- Identify the best driver for each constructor in each year based on total points.
- Sum the points of the best driver and the constructor to find combined points.
- Order the results to find the top 3 constructors with the highest combined points.

1. **List all distinct years available in the RACES table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year" FROM F1.F1."RACES" ORDER BY "year" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Retrieve all constructors and their IDs from the CONSTRUCTORS table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "constructor_id", "name" FROM F1.F1."CONSTRUCTORS" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Retrieve all drivers and their IDs from the DRIVERS table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "driver_id", "forename", "surname" FROM F1.F1."DRIVERS" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **View points earned by each driver in each race from the RESULTS table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "race_id", "points" FROM F1.F1."RESULTS" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **View points earned by each constructor in each race from the CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", "race_id", "points" FROM F1.F1."CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List all races along with their IDs and years from the RACES table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "year", "name" FROM F1.F1."RACES" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Display cumulative driver standings from the DRIVER_STANDINGS table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "race_id", "points" FROM F1.F1."DRIVER_STANDINGS" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Display cumulative constructor standings from the CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", "race_id", "points" FROM F1.F1."CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Find the total points per driver per year from the RESULTS and RACES tables:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", r."year", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
   FROM F1.F1."RESULTS" res
   JOIN F1.F1."RACES" r ON res."race_id" = r."race_id"
   GROUP BY "driver_id", r."year"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Find the total points per constructor per year from the CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS and RACES tables:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "constructor_id", r."year", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
    FROM F1.F1."CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS" cr
    JOIN F1.F1."RACES" r ON cr."race_id" = r."race_id"
    GROUP BY "constructor_id", r."year"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Identify the best driver for each constructor each year based on total points:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "constructor_id", "driver_id", r."year", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
    FROM F1.F1."RESULTS" res
    JOIN F1.F1."RACES" r ON res."race_id" = r."race_id"
    GROUP BY "constructor_id", "driver_id", r."year"
    ORDER BY "constructor_id", r."year", "total_points" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Check how many drivers raced for each constructor in each year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "constructor_id", r."year", COUNT(DISTINCT "driver_id") AS "driver_count"
    FROM F1.F1."RESULTS" res
    JOIN F1.F1."RACES" r ON res."race_id" = r."race_id"
    GROUP BY "constructor_id", r."year"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **List the maximum points scored by drivers in a single race:**

    ```sql
    SELECT MAX("points") AS "max_driver_points"
    FROM F1.F1."RESULTS";
    ```

14. **List the maximum points scored by constructors in a single race:**

    ```sql
    SELECT MAX("points") AS "max_constructor_points"
    FROM F1.F1."CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS";
    ```

15. **Retrieve constructors with more than one driver per race:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "race_id", "constructor_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "driver_id") AS "driver_count"
    FROM F1.F1."RESULTS"
    GROUP BY "race_id", "constructor_id"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "driver_id") > 1
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

16. **Find distinct points values awarded to drivers:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "points" FROM F1.F1."RESULTS" ORDER BY "points" DESC LIMIT 1000;
    ```

17. **Find distinct points values awarded to constructors:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "points" FROM F1.F1."CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS" ORDER BY "points" DESC LIMIT 1000;
    ```

18. **Get the names of drivers along with their IDs:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "driver_id", "forename", "surname" FROM F1.F1."DRIVERS" LIMIT 1000;
    ```

19. **Get the names of constructors along with their IDs:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "constructor_id", "name" FROM F1.F1."CONSTRUCTORS" LIMIT 1000;
    ```

20. **Check the total number of races per year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "year", COUNT("race_id") AS "race_count"
    FROM F1.F1."RACES"
    GROUP BY "year"
    ORDER BY "year" LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries will help in understanding the structure of the data, the relationships between drivers, constructors, races, and the distribution of points. They provide a foundation for further analysis to address the original task.Query:

Task: Which constructors had the top 3 combined points from their best driver and team, and in which years did they achieve them?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the constructors that had the top 3 combined points from their best driver and team, and the years they achieved them, we would analyze the data to calculate the combined points for each constructor per year. Since we do not have access to the actual data, the expected output format would be:

```csv
Constructor,Year,Combined_Points
constructor_name1:str,year1:int,points1:float
constructor_name2:str,year2:int,points2:float
constructor_name3:str,year3:int,points3:float
```

*(Attention: answer in three rows)*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
