Task: Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Sure! Here's the breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education":

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_with_Education
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:float:xx.xx
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:float:xx.xx
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Category**: The name of each news category (e.g., "Business", "Sport", "Technology").
- **Total_Articles**: The total number of articles in each category.
- **Percentage_with_Education**: The percentage of articles within each category that mention the word "education" (formatted as a float without the '%' symbol, e.g., 23.45).

This format provides a clear overview of the article distribution across categories and highlights the proportion that discusses "education" within each one..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'BBC': {'BBC_NEWS': ['FULLTEXT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Task: Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Sure! Here's the breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education":

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_with_Education
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:float:xx.xx
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:float:xx.xx
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Category**: The name of each news category (e.g., "Business", "Sport", "Technology").
- **Total_Articles**: The total number of articles in each category.
- **Percentage_with_Education**: The percentage of articles within each category that mention the word "education" (formatted as a float without the '%' symbol, e.g., 23.45).

This format provides a clear overview of the article distribution across categories and highlights the proportion that discusses "education" within each one..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'BBC': {'BBC_NEWS': ['FULLTEXT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

- **WHERE "title" ILIKE '%education%'**: To find articles that mention "education" in the title.
- **GROUP BY "category"**: To organize articles by their categories.
- **LIMIT 1000**: To limit the number of rows returned for analysis.

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. **List all unique categories:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "category"
   FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Count total number of articles:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total_Articles"
   FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Count articles per category:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "category", COUNT(*) AS "Article_Count"
   FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
   GROUP BY "category"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Find articles mentioning "education" in the body:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "filename", "category"
   FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
   WHERE "body" ILIKE '%education%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Count how many articles mention "education" per category:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "category", COUNT(*) AS "Education_Articles"
   FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
   WHERE "body" ILIKE '%education%'
   GROUP BY "category"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List article titles that mention "education" in the title:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "title", "category"
   FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
   WHERE "title" ILIKE '%education%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Find articles where "education" appears in both title and body:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "filename", "category"
   FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
   WHERE "title" ILIKE '%education%' AND "body" ILIKE '%education%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Extract article filenames for a specific category (e.g., "Business"):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "filename"
   FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
   WHERE "category" = 'Business'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **List titles of articles per category:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "category", "title"
   FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
   ORDER BY "category"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Find categories of articles that contain the word "university" in the body:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "category"
    FROM BBC.BBC_NEWS.FULLTEXT
    WHERE "body" ILIKE '%university%'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help explore the available data in the `FULLTEXT` table, understand how articles are categorized, and see how the term "education" and related words appear across different articles and categories.Query:

UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'BBC': {'BBC_NEWS': ['FULLTEXT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 10:20:47 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Sure! Here's the breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education":

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_with_Education
category1:str,total_articles1:int,percentage1:float:xx.xx
category2:str,total_articles2:int,percentage2:float:xx.xx
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Category**: The name of each news category (e.g., "Business", "Sport", "Technology").
- **Total_Articles**: The total number of articles in each category.
- **Percentage_with_Education**: The percentage of articles within each category that mention the word "education" (formatted as a float without the '%' symbol, e.g., 23.45).

This format provides a clear overview of the article distribution across categories and highlights the proportion that discusses "education" within each one. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
