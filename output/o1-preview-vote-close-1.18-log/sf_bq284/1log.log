"The global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned Iranian bloggers.

The month-old Committee to Protect Bloggers' is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on 22 February to the ""Free Mojtaba and Arash Day"". Arash Sigarchi and Mojtaba Saminejad are both in prison in Iran. Blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. Iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time. ""I hope this day will focus people,"" Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee, told the BBC News website.

The group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take, including writing to local Iranian embassies. The Committee has deemed Tuesday ""Free Mojtaba and Arash Day"" as part of its first campaign. It is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of Mojtaba and Arash as well as other ""cyber-dissidents"". ""If you have a blog, the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except 'Free Mojtaba and Arash Day',"" said Mr Hopkins. ""That would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. That alone will shine some light on the situation. ""If you don't have one, find one dedicated to that - it takes about 30 seconds."" Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to a US research think-tank.

The Committee to Protect Bloggers was started by US blogger Curt Hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger Ellen Simonetti as a deputy director. She has since started the International Bloggers' Bill of Rights, a global petition to protect bloggers at work. Although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means, it aims to be the hub or organisation, information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech.

The Committee, although only a month old, aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future, and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation. ""Blogging is in this weird no man's land. People think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view,"" said Mr Hopkins. ""Some think of themselves as pundits, kind of like journalists, and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform. ""But they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold.""

It is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. The question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. High profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal, and often anonymous blogs, have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in.

""This is a big messy argument,"" explained Mr Hopkins. He added: ""It is just such a new way of doing business, there will be clamp downs."" But the way these issues get tested is through the courts which, said Mr Hopkins, ""is part of the whole messy conversation."" ""If you haven't already got bloggers in your company, you will have them tomorrow - and if you don't have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. Mr Hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog. ""Everyone does this - mums, radicals, conservatives,"" he said. Many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community. ""That is the essential difference. What I call 'templating software' gives every single person on Earth the chance to have one. ""You don't even have to have your own computer.""

"The ""digital divide"" between rich and poor nations is narrowing fast, according to a World Bank report.

The World Bank questioned a United Nation's campaign to increase usage and access to technology in poorer nations. ""People in the developing world are getting more access at an incredible rate - far faster than... in the past,"" said the report. But a spokesman for the UN's World Summit on the Information Society said the digital divide remained very real. ""The digital divide is rapidly closing,"" the World Bank report said.

Half the world's population now has access to a fixed-line telephone, the report said, and 77% to a mobile network.

The report's figures surpass a WSIS campaign goal that calls for 50% access to telephones by 2015. The UN hopes that widening access to technology such as mobile phones and the net will help eradicate poverty. ""Developing countries are catching up with the rich world in terms of access [to mobi

Begin Exploring Related Columns
Consider the following table and columns relevant to the task:

**Table:**
- `"BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"`

**Columns:**

- `"category"`: Potential usage - To list different categories and count the number of articles in each category.

- `"body"`: Potential usage - To search for articles that mention "education" within the article body.

- `"title"`: Potential usage - To search for articles that mention "education" in the article title.

- `"filename"`: Potential usage - Unique identifier for each article.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filtering articles where `"body"` contains the word "education" using `ILIKE '%education%'`.

- Grouping articles by `"category"` to get counts per category.

---

Here are at least ten simple, short, non-nested SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

1. **List all distinct categories in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "category" FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Count the total number of articles in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Get the total number of articles per category:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "category", COUNT(*) AS "total_articles"
   FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
   GROUP BY "category" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **List articles where the body mentions "education":**

   ```sql
   SELECT "filename", "category"
   FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
   WHERE "body" ILIKE '%education%' LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Count the number of articles mentioning "education" per category:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "category", COUNT(*) AS "articles_mentioning_education"
   FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
   WHERE "body" ILIKE '%education%'
   GROUP BY "category" LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List article titles that mention "education" in the body:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "title", "category"
   FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
   WHERE "body" ILIKE '%education%' LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List articles where the title mentions "education":**

   ```sql
   SELECT "filename", "title", "category"
   FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
   WHERE "title" ILIKE '%education%' LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Get a sample of articles showing the first 100 characters of the body:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "category", "title", LEFT("body", 100) AS "body_snippet"
   FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Count the number of articles where the body is not null:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
   WHERE "body" IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Check if any articles have a null category:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
    WHERE "category" IS NULL LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **List distinct filenames to verify uniqueness:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "filename"
    FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Count the number of articles per filename to check for duplicates:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "filename", COUNT(*) AS "article_count"
    FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
    GROUP BY "filename"
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Find articles where the body is empty:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "filename", "category"
    FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
    WHERE "body" = '' LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Get the number of articles mentioning "education" in the title per category:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "category", COUNT(*) AS "education_in_title"
    FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
    WHERE "title" ILIKE '%education%'
    GROUP BY "category" LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **List articles where both the title and body mention "education":**

    ```sql
    SELECT "filename", "title", "category"
    FROM "BBC"."BBC_NEWS"."FULLTEXT"
    WHERE "title" ILIKE '%education%' AND "body" ILIKE '%education%'

Too long, hard cut:

"The global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned Iranian bloggers.

The month-old Committee to Protect Bloggers' is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on 22 February to the ""Free Mojtaba and Arash Day"". Arash Sigarchi and Mojtaba Saminejad are both in prison in Iran. Blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. Iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time. ""I hope this day will focus people,"" Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee, told the BBC News website.

The group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take, including writing to local Iranian embassies. The Committee has deemed Tuesday ""Free Mojtaba and Arash Day"" as part of its first campaign. It is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of Mojtaba and Arash as well as other ""cyber-dissidents"". ""If you have a blog, the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except 'Free Mojtaba and Arash Day',"" said Mr Hopkins. ""That would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. That alone will shine some light on the situation. ""If you don't have one, find one dedicated to that - it takes about 30 seconds."" Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to a US research think-tank.

The Committee to Protect Bloggers was started by US blogger Curt Hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger Ellen Simonetti as a deputy director. She has since started the International Bloggers' Bill of Rights, a global petition to protect bloggers at work. Although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means, it aims to be the hub or organisation, information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech.

The Committee, although only a month old, aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future, and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation. ""Blogging is in this weird no man's land. People think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view,"" said Mr Hopkins. ""Some think of themselves as pundits, kind of like journalists, and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform. ""But they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold.""

It is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. The question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. High profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal, and often anonymous blogs, have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in.

""This is a big messy argument,"" explained Mr Hopkins. He added: ""It is just such a new way of doing business, there will be clamp downs."" But the way these issues get tested is through the courts which, said Mr Hopkins, ""is part of the whole messy conversation."" ""If you haven't already got bloggers in your company, you will have them tomorrow - and if you don't have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. Mr Hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog. ""Everyone does this - mums, radicals, conservatives,"" he said. Many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community. ""That is the essential difference. What I call 'templating software' gives every single person on Earth the chance to have one. ""You don't even have to have your own computer.""

"The ""digital divide"" between rich and poor nations is narrowing fast, according to a World Bank report.

The World Bank questioned a United Nation's campaign to increase usage and access to technology in poorer nations. ""People in the developing world are getting more access at an incredible rate - far faster than... in the past,"" said the report. But a spokesman for the UN's World Summit on the Information Society said the digital divide remained very real. ""The digital divide is rapidly closing,"" the World Bank report said.

Half the world's population now has access to a fixed-line telephone, the report said, and 77% to a mobile network.

The report's figures surpass a WSIS campaign goal that calls for 50% access to telephones by 2015. The UN hopes that widening access to technology such as mobile phones and the net will help eradicate poverty. ""Developing countries are catching up with the rich world in terms of access [to mobi

Task: Can you provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category from the BBC News, the data can be formatted as follows:

```csv
Category,Total_Articles,Percentage_Mentioning_Education
category1:str,total1:int,percentage1:float
category2:str,total2:int,percentage2:float
...
```

This table lists each category, the total number of articles in that category, and the percentage of those articles that mention "education"..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'BBC': {'BBC_NEWS': ['FULLTEXT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
