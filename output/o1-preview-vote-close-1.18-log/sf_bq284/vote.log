The correct SQL query is:

```plain
1result.sql
```

**Reason:**

The query in `1result.sql` accurately calculates the total number of articles in each category and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category. It correctly uses double quotes around identifiers, which is important for case sensitivity and compatibility with SQL standards when dealing with mixed-case or reserved words in identifiers. This ensures precise referencing of the database objects.
