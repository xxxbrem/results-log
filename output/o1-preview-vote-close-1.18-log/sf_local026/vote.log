After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer. The query accurately calculates the total runs conceded by each bowler in a single over by summing both the runs scored off the bat and the extra runs conceded. It appropriately groups the data by match, bowler, and over to identify the overs where bowlers conceded the maximum runs. The structure of the query is logical and effectively meets the requirements of the task.
