After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer. This is because it conforms to the specified requirements by:

- **Rounding the average inter-movie duration to the nearest integer.**
- **Rounding the average rating to two decimal places.**

The `0result.sql` query explicitly uses `ROUND(AVG("avg_rating"), 2)` to round the average rating to two decimal places, whereas `1result.sql` rounds it to four decimal places with `ROUND(AVG("avg_rating"), 4)`. Additionally, both queries sort the output correctly as per the specified criteria.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
