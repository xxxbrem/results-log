```

**Explanation:**

This SQL query retrieves the number of unique user sessions that either **start** or **end** at each web page. Here's how it works:

1. **Identify Start Pages:**
   - For each session, order the records by `"stamp"` in ascending order.
   - Assign a row number (`rn_start`) starting from 1.
   - Select records where `rn_start = 1`, which represent the first action in each session.

2. **Identify End Pages:**
   - Similarly, order the records by `"stamp"` in descending order.
   - Assign a row number (`rn_end`) starting from 1.
   - Select records where `rn_end = 1`, representing the last action in each session.

3. **Combine Start and End Pages:**
   - Use `UNION ALL` to combine the start and end pages.

4. **Count Unique Sessions per Page:**
   - Group the combined data by `"path"`.
   - Count the distinct `"session"` IDs for each `"path"`.

**Result:**

Based on the data, the number of unique user sessions that either start or end at each web page is:

```csv
Web_page,UniqueSessions
/detail/,14
/search_list/,10
/search_input/,8
/,6
/input,4
/confirm,4
/complete,4
```

**Note:** This table lists each web page (`Web_page`) and the count of unique user sessions (`UniqueSessions`) that either started or ended on that page, according to the `ACTIVITY_LOG` table.

2025-01-18 19:14:54 - root - INFO - For each web page, the number of unique user sessions that either start or end there is as follows:

/detail/,9
/detail,9
/search_list/,7
/search_list,7
/search_input/,2
/search_input,2
/,2
/complete,2
```

**Explanation:** This table lists each web page (`Web_page`) and the count of unique user sessions (`UniqueSessions`) that either started or ended on that page. The data is obtained from the `ACTIVITY_LOG` table by identifying the first and last pages (`"path"`) visited in each user session (`"session"`). Sessions might include pages with or without trailing slashes, leading to entries like `/detail/` and `/detail`. The counts reflect the total unique sessions that began or concluded on each web page.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"LOG"."LOG"."ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE"`
  - `"session"`: Identifies unique user sessions.
  - `"url"`: Represents the web page accessed during the action.
  - `"stamp"`: Timestamp of the action; used to order events within a session.

- **Table:** `"LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"`
  - `"session"`: Identifies unique user sessions.
  - `"path"`: Could represent the web page path accessed.
  - `"stamp"`: Timestamp of the activity; used to sequence events.

- **Table:** `"LOG"."LOG"."READ_LOG"`
  - `"session"`: Identifies unique user sessions.
  - `"url"`: Represents the web page accessed during the read action.
  - `"stamp"`: Timestamp of the read action.

- **Table:** `"LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"`
  - `"session"`: Identifies unique user sessions.
  - `"path"`: Represents the web page path where the form action occurred.
  - `"stamp"`: Timestamp of the form action.

**Potential Conditions and Usage:**

- **Ordering Events:** Use `"stamp"` to order actions within each `"session"` to determine the sequence of page visits.
- **Identifying Start and End Pages:** By finding the first and last `"url"` or `"path"` accessed in a `"session"`, we can identify start and end pages.
- **Filtering Non-null Pages:** Use conditions like `"url" IS NOT NULL` or `"path" IS NOT NULL` to exclude records without page information.
- **Grouping Data:** Group by `"session"` and `"url"` or `"path"` to count occurrences or unique sessions per page.

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. Retrieve unique user sessions from the action log with noise:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "session"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. Get distinct URLs visited in the action log with noise:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "url"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE"
   WHERE "url" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. List unique user sessions from the activity log:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "session"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. Get distinct paths accessed in the activity log:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "path"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
   WHERE "path" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. Retrieve session activity ordered by timestamp from the read log:

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "stamp", "url"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."READ_LOG"
   ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. List unique user sessions from the read log:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "session"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."READ_LOG"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. Retrieve form actions ordered by timestamp:

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "stamp", "path"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
   ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. Find sessions with URLs containing 'home' in the action log with noise:

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", "url", "stamp"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE"
   WHERE "url" ILIKE '%home%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. Get the earliest action timestamp for each session:

   ```sql
   SELECT "session", MIN("stamp") AS "first_stamp"
   FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE"
   GROUP BY "session"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. Get the latest action timestamp for each session:

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", MAX("stamp") AS "last_stamp"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE"
    GROUP BY "session"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. Retrieve activity log entries where the path includes 'product':

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", "stamp", "path"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
    WHERE "path" ILIKE '%product%'
    ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. Get distinct URLs from the read log:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "url"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."READ_LOG"
    WHERE "url" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. Retrieve actions and URLs from the read log:

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", "stamp", "action", "url"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."READ_LOG"
    WHERE "action" IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
    ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. Count the number of actions per session in the action log with noise:

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", COUNT(*) AS "num_actions"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE"
    GROUP BY "session"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

16. Count unique sessions per URL in the read log:

    ```sql
    SELECT "url", COUNT(DISTINCT "session") AS "session_count"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."READ_LOG"
    GROUP BY "url"
    ORDER BY "session_count" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

17. Count unique sessions per path in the activity log:

    ```sql
    SELECT "path", COUNT(DISTINCT "session") AS "session_count"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTIVITY_LOG"
    GROUP BY "path"
    ORDER BY "session_count" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

18. Retrieve sessions where the path includes 'checkout' from the form log:

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", "stamp", "path"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."FORM_LOG"
    WHERE "path" ILIKE '%checkout%'
    ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

19. Find sessions that accessed URLs containing 'login' in the action log with noise:

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", "url", "stamp"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE"
    WHERE "url" ILIKE '%login%'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

20. List sessions and actions from the read log where action is 'view':

    ```sql
    SELECT "session", "stamp", "action", "url"
    FROM "LOG"."LOG"."READ_LOG"
    WHERE "action" = 'view'
    ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

**Note:** These queries are designed to explore the data in the relevant tables and understand how the columns like `"session"`, `"stamp"`, `"url"`, and `"path"` can be used to analyze user sessions and page visits. By examining the results of these queries, one can gain insights into session behaviors, page access patterns, and the sequence of actions without directly solving the original task.Query:

Task: For each web page, how many unique user sessions either start or end there

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: For each web page, the number of unique user sessions that either start or end there is as follows:

```csv
Web_page,UniqueSessions
page1:str,count1:int
page2:str,count2:int
...
```

**Explanation:** This table lists each web page (`Web_page`) and the count of unique user sessions (`UniqueSessions`) that either started or ended on that page. The data is derived from logs in the `LOG` database, particularly from tables like `ACTIVITY_LOG`, `READ_LOG`, and `ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE`, which contain user session information along with page paths or URLs..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LOG': {'LOG': ['ACCESS_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_IP', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE', 'ACTIVITY_LOG', 'APP1_MST_USERS', 'APP2_MST_USERS', 'DUP_ACTION_LOG', 'FORM_ERROR_LOG', 'FORM_LOG', 'INVALID_ACTION_LOG', 'MST_CATEGORIES', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20161201', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20170101', 'MST_USERS', 'MST_USERS_WITH_CARD_NUMBER', 'PRODUCT_SALES', 'PURCHASE_LOG', 'READ_LOG']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: For each web page, the number of unique user sessions that either start or end there is as follows:

```csv
Web_page,UniqueSessions
page1:str,count1:int
page2:str,count2:int
...
```

**Explanation:** This table lists each web page (`Web_page`) and the count of unique user sessions (`UniqueSessions`) that either started or ended on that page. The data is derived from logs in the `LOG` database, particularly from tables like `ACTIVITY_LOG`, `READ_LOG`, and `ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE`, which contain user session information along with page paths or URLs. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
