Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

1. **"session"**: Used to identify unique user sessions.
2. **"stamp"**: Timestamp of the action; used to order actions within a session.
3. **"url"** (from `ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE` and `READ_LOG` tables): Represents the web page accessed.
4. **"path"** (from `ACTIVITY_LOG` and `FORM_LOG` tables): Represents the web page accessed.
5. **"action"**: May provide additional context about the user interaction.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Ordering actions within a session using the "stamp" column.
- Grouping or filtering by "session" to identify the start and end points of sessions.
- Using `DISTINCT` to find unique sessions or web pages.
- Limiting results to manageable numbers using `LIMIT`.

**SQL Queries to Understand Values in Related Columns:**

```sql
-- 1. Get a list of unique sessions from ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE
SELECT DISTINCT "session"
FROM LOG.LOG."ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 2. Get a list of unique URLs accessed from ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE
SELECT DISTINCT "url"
FROM LOG.LOG."ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 3. Retrieve session, timestamp, and URL from ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE
SELECT "session", "stamp", "url"
FROM LOG.LOG."ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE"
ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 4. Get a list of unique paths from ACTIVITY_LOG
SELECT DISTINCT "path"
FROM LOG.LOG."ACTIVITY_LOG"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 5. Retrieve session, timestamp, and path from ACTIVITY_LOG
SELECT "session", "stamp", "path"
FROM LOG.LOG."ACTIVITY_LOG"
ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 6. Get a list of unique paths from FORM_LOG
SELECT DISTINCT "path"
FROM LOG.LOG."FORM_LOG"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 7. Retrieve session, timestamp, and path from FORM_LOG
SELECT "session", "stamp", "path"
FROM LOG.LOG."FORM_LOG"
ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 8. Get a list of unique sessions from READ_LOG
SELECT DISTINCT "session"
FROM LOG.LOG."READ_LOG"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 9. Retrieve session, timestamp, and URL from READ_LOG
SELECT "session", "stamp", "url"
FROM LOG.LOG."READ_LOG"
ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
LIMIT 1000;

-- 10. Get a list of unique actions from READ_LOG
SELECT DISTINCT "action"
FROM LOG.LOG."READ_LOG"
LIMIT 1000;
```

These queries will help in understanding the distribution and content of the relevant columns, providing insight into session behaviors and the web pages accessed. By examining the "stamp" column in conjunction with "session" and "url"/"path", we can identify the starting and ending points of user sessions on specific web pages.Query:
WITH session_stamps AS (
    SELECT
        "session",
        MIN("stamp") AS min_stamp,
        MAX("stamp") AS max_stamp

    INNER JOIN session_stamps s ON a."session" = s."session" AND a."stamp" = s.min_stamp
),
last_pages AS (
    SELECT a."session", a."path" AS web_page
    FROM LOG.LOG."ACTIVITY_LOG" a
    INNER JOIN session_stamps s ON a."session" = s."session" AND a."stamp" = s.max_stamp
),
start_counts AS (
    SELECT web_page, COUNT(DISTINCT "session") AS unique_sessions_start_here
    FROM first_pages
    GROUP BY web_page
),
end_counts AS (
    SELECT web_page, COUNT(DISTINCT "session") AS unique_sessions_end_here
    FROM last_pages
    GROUP BY web_page
)
SELECT
    COALESCE(start_counts.web_page, end_counts.web_page) AS web_page,

Task: For each web page, how many unique user sessions either start or end there

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of unique user sessions that either start or end at each web page, we analyze the session logs by identifying the first and last pages accessed in each session. The following table presents the web pages along with the counts of unique sessions that begin or end there:

```csv
web_page,unique_sessions_start_here,unique_sessions_end_here
page1:str,count_start:int,count_end:int
page2:str,count_start:int,count_end:int
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LOG': {'LOG': ['ACCESS_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_IP', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE', 'ACTIVITY_LOG', 'APP1_MST_USERS', 'APP2_MST_USERS', 'DUP_ACTION_LOG', 'FORM_ERROR_LOG', 'FORM_LOG', 'INVALID_ACTION_LOG', 'MST_CATEGORIES', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20161201', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20170101', 'MST_USERS', 'MST_USERS_WITH_CARD_NUMBER', 'PRODUCT_SALES', 'PURCHASE_LOG', 'READ_LOG']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 19:12:55 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each web page, how many unique user sessions either start or end there, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of unique user sessions that either start or end at each web page, we analyze the session logs by identifying the first and last pages accessed in each session. The following table presents the web pages along with the counts of unique sessions that begin or end there:

```csv
web_page,unique_sessions_start_here,unique_sessions_end_here
page1:str,count_start:int,count_end:int
page2:str,count_start:int,count_end:int
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
