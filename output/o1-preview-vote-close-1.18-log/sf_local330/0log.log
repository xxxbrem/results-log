Begin Exploring Related Columns
Relevant Tables and Columns:

1. **Table:** `ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE`
   - `"session"`: Used to identify unique user sessions.
   - `"stamp"`: Timestamp of the action, used to sequence actions within a session.
   - `"url"`: Represents the web page accessed by the user.

2. **Table:** `ACTIVITY_LOG`
   - `"session"`: User session identifier.
   - `"stamp"`: Timestamp of the activity.
   - `"path"`: Represents the web page path accessed by the user.

3. **Table:** `FORM_LOG`
   - `"session"`: User session identifier.
   - `"stamp"`: Timestamp when the form action occurred.
   - `"path"`: Represents the form page path.

4. **Table:** `READ_LOG`
   - `"session"`: User session identifier.
   - `"stamp"`: Timestamp of the read action.
   - `"url"`: URL of the web page read by the user.

Potential Conditions and Usage:

- Group actions by `"session"` to analyze user sessions.
- Order actions within each session by `"stamp"` to determine the sequence of pages visited.
- Use `"url"` or `"path"` to identify and distinguish between different web pages.
- Identify the first and last actions in each session by using `MIN("stamp")` and `MAX("stamp")`.
- Use timestamps to filter actions within specific time ranges if needed.

Task: For each web page, how many unique user sessions either start or end there

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
web_page,count_sessions
web_page1:str,count:int
web_page2:str,count:int
...
```

This table lists each web page (`web_page`) and the number of unique user sessions (`count_sessions`) that either start or end on that page..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'LOG': {'LOG': ['ACCESS_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_IP', 'ACTION_LOG_WITH_NOISE', 'ACTIVITY_LOG', 'APP1_MST_USERS', 'APP2_MST_USERS', 'DUP_ACTION_LOG', 'FORM_ERROR_LOG', 'FORM_LOG', 'INVALID_ACTION_LOG', 'MST_CATEGORIES', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20161201', 'MST_PRODUCTS_20170101', 'MST_USERS', 'MST_USERS_WITH_CARD_NUMBER', 'PRODUCT_SALES', 'PURCHASE_LOG', 'READ_LOG']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 19:14:59 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each web page, how many unique user sessions either start or end there, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
web_page,count_sessions
web_page1:str,count:int
web_page2:str,count:int
...
```

This table lists each web page (`web_page`) and the number of unique user sessions (`count_sessions`) that either start or end on that page. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
