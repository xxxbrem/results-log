After reviewing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **`1result.sql`** correctly extracts the pages visited by the user `1402138.5184246691` on January 2, 2021, and appropriately classifies them as **PDP** (Product Detail Page), **PLP** (Product Listing Page), or **Other** based on the URL structure and specified criteria.
- In the results of **`1result.sql`**, at least one page is classified as **PLP**, which aligns with the user's request to adjust page names to **PDP** or **PLP** where necessary.
- **`2result.sql`** classifies all pages as **Other**, failing to identify any **PDP** or **PLP**, which does not meet the user's requirements.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plain
1result.sql
```
