To determine the hurricane with the **third longest total travel distance** in the **North Atlantic during 2020**, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by each hurricane in that basin and year, and then rank them accordingly. The two SQL queries provided perform this task with slight differences. Let's compare them:

**First SQL Query (0result.sql):**

- Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank hurricanes based on total travel distance.
- In case of hurricanes with identical total distances, `ROW_NUMBER()` assigns unique sequential ranks arbitrarily, which might not accurately reflect ties.

**Second SQL Query (1result.sql):**

- Utilizes `RANK()` to rank hurricanes.
- `RANK()` assigns the same rank to hurricanes with identical total distances, ensuring ties are handled correctly.
- Includes the `"name"` of the hurricane in intermediate steps, which can be useful for reference.

**Reasoning:**

- **Handling Ties:** Since multiple hurricanes could have traveled the same total distance, using `RANK()` is more appropriate than `ROW_NUMBER()`. `RANK()` ensures that hurricanes with equal distances receive the same rank, which aligns with standard ranking practices.
- **Accuracy in Ranking:** With `RANK()`, if two hurricanes tie for the first place, they both receive rank 1, and the next hurricane receives rank 3. This accurately reflects their standings.
- **Inclusion of Names:** Having the `"name"` in the query can provide additional clarity and is useful for verifying results.

**Conclusion:**

The **second SQL query (1result.sql)** is better suited for identifying the hurricane with the third longest total travel distance because it correctly handles ties using `RANK()` and includes the hurricane names for reference.
