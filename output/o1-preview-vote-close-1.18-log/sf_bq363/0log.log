Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Table:**

- **CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS**

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"trip_seconds"**: Used to calculate trip duration in seconds, which will be rounded to the nearest minute for analysis.
- **"fare"**: The fare amount for each trip; used to calculate the average fare for each quantile.
- **"trip_total"**: The total amount charged for each trip, including fare, tips, tolls, and extras; may be considered for average fare calculations.
- **"unique_key"**: A unique identifier for each trip; can be used to count the total number of trips.
- **"trip_start_timestamp"** and **"trip_end_timestamp"**: Start and end times of trips; could be used to verify or calculate trip durations if needed.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Trips where **"trip_seconds"** is not null and greater than 0.
- Trips where **"fare"** is not null and greater than 0.
- Trips where the rounded trip duration in minutes is between 1 and 50 minutes (i.e., **"trip_seconds"** between 60 and 3000 seconds).

**SQL Queries:**

```sql
-- 1. Retrieve distinct payment types used in taxi trips
SELECT DISTINCT "payment_type"
FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- 2. Identify trips with null trip durations
SELECT "unique_key", "trip_seconds", "fare"
FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
WHERE "trip_seconds" IS NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- 3. Find trips with negative or zero trip durations
SELECT "unique_key", "trip_seconds", "fare"
FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
WHERE "trip_seconds" <= 0
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- 4. Examine trips with durations rounded to between 1 and 50 minutes
SELECT "unique_key", "trip_seconds", "fare"
FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
WHERE "trip_seconds" >= 60 AND "trip_seconds" <= 3000
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- 5. Retrieve fare details for trips within the specified duration range
SELECT "trip_seconds", "fare", "trip_total", "tips", "tolls", "extras"
FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
WHERE "trip_seconds" >= 60 AND "trip_seconds" <= 3000
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- 6. Identify trips with null fare amounts
SELECT "unique_key", "trip_seconds", "fare"
FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
WHERE "fare" IS NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- 7. Find trips with negative or zero fare amounts
SELECT "unique_key", "trip_seconds", "fare"
FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
WHERE "fare" <= 0
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- 8. Explore the relationship between trip duration and trip distance
SELECT "trip_seconds", "trip_miles"
FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
WHERE "trip_seconds" >= 60 AND "trip_seconds" <= 3000
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- 9. Retrieve distinct taxi companies
SELECT DISTINCT "company"
FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
LIMIT 1000;
```

```sql
-- 10. Check the distribution of pickup community areas
SELECT DISTINCT "pickup_community_area"
FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- The queries above are designed to help understand the data in the **TAXI_TRIPS** table, particularly focusing on trip durations and fares.
- They check for null or invalid values in **"trip_seconds"** and **"fare"**, which are crucial for accurate calculations.
- Queries 4 and 5 focus on trips within the specified duration range (1 to 50 minutes) to ensure relevant data is considered.
- Other queries retrieve distinct values from categorical columns like **"payment_type"** and **"company"** to understand possible groupings or filters that may be applied later.
- All column names are enclosed in double quotations as per the SQL standard and the instructions provided.Query:
-- 1. Retrieve distinct payment types used in taxi trips

Task: For taxi trips with a duration rounded to the nearest minute, and between 1 and 50 minutes, if the trip durations are divided into 10 quantiles, what are the total number of trips and the average fare for each quantile?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To analyze the taxi trips with durations between 1 and 50 minutes (rounded to the nearest minute), we divide the trip durations into 10 quantiles. For each quantile, we calculate the total number of trips and the average fare. The expected output is as follows:

```csv
Duration_Quantile,Total_Trips,Average_Fare
Quantile 1,total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float
Quantile 2,total_trips2:int,average_fare2:float
Quantile 3,total_trips3:int,average_fare3:float
Quantile 4,total_trips4:int,average_fare4:float
Quantile 5,total_trips5:int,average_fare5:float
Quantile 6,total_trips6:int,average_fare6:float
Quantile 7,total_trips7:int,average_fare7:float
Quantile 8,total_trips8:int,average_fare8:float
Quantile 9,total_trips9:int,average_fare9:float
Quantile10,total_trips10:int,average_fare10:float
```

In this table:

- **Duration_Quantile**: Represents each of the 10 quantiles of trip durations.
- **Total_Trips**: The number of trips in each quantile (integer).
- **Average_Fare**: The average fare for trips in each quantile (float).

*Note: Actual numerical values are not provided as they require processing the dataset.*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CHICAGO': {'CHICAGO_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS': ['TAXI_TRIPS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
