Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Table:**
- **CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS**

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**
- **"trip_seconds"**: Used to calculate the trip duration in seconds, which will be rounded to the nearest minute. It will also be used to filter trips between 1 and 50 minutes (i.e., between 60 and 3000 seconds).
- **"fare"**: Used to calculate the average fare for each quantile.
  
**Possible Conditions:**
- **"trip_seconds" >= 60**: To include trips that are at least 1 minute long.
- **"trip_seconds" <= 3000**: To include trips that are no longer than 50 minutes.

---

**SQL Queries to Understand Values in Related Columns:**

1. **Retrieve distinct trip durations in seconds:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "trip_seconds"
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
   WHERE "trip_seconds" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Count the total number of trips with durations between 1 and 50 minutes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
   WHERE "trip_seconds" >= 60 AND "trip_seconds" <= 3000
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Retrieve trip durations and fares for trips between 1 and 50 minutes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "trip_seconds", "fare"
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
   WHERE "trip_seconds" >= 60 AND "trip_seconds" <= 3000
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Calculate trip duration rounded to the nearest minute:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "trip_seconds", ROUND("trip_seconds" / 60.0) AS "trip_minutes"
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Retrieve distinct fare amounts:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "fare"
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
   WHERE "fare" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Find the minimum and maximum trip durations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("trip_seconds"), MAX("trip_seconds")
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Check for trips with null trip durations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
   WHERE "trip_seconds" IS NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Retrieve trip durations and fares where fare is not null:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "trip_seconds", "fare"
   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
   WHERE "fare" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Retrieve trip durations, miles, and fares:**
   ```sql

   FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Retrieve payment types used in trips:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "payment_type"
    FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Retrieve trip durations and payment types for trips between 1 and 50 minutes:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "trip_seconds", "payment_type"
    FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
    WHERE "trip_seconds" >= 60 AND "trip_seconds" <= 3000
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Retrieve trip start and end timestamps for trips between 1 and 50 minutes:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "trip_start_timestamp", "trip_end_timestamp", "trip_seconds"
    FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
    WHERE "trip_seconds" >= 60 AND "trip_seconds" <= 3000
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Retrieve trip miles and fares for trips with valid trip miles:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "trip_miles", "fare"
    FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
    WHERE "trip_miles" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Count the number of trips with null fares:**
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
    WHERE "fare" IS NULL
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Retrieve companies and the number of trips they operated:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "company", COUNT(*) AS "trip_count"
    FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS

Task: For taxi trips with a duration rounded to the nearest minute, and between 1 and 50 minutes, if the trip durations are divided into 10 quantiles, what are the total number of trips and the average fare for each quantile?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To address this task, we need to divide taxi trips (with durations rounded to the nearest minute and between 1 and 50 minutes) into 10 quantiles based on their durations. For each quantile, we calculate the total number of trips and the average fare.

Since the exact data is not provided, the output format would be as follows:

```csv
Duration_Range,Total_Trips,Average_Fare
Quantile 1 Duration Range,total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float
Quantile 2 Duration Range,total_trips2:int,average_fare2:float
...
Quantile 10 Duration Range,total_trips10:int,average_fare10:float
```

Each "Quantile * Duration Range" represents the duration range for that quantile, determined from the data distribution..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CHICAGO': {'CHICAGO_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS': ['TAXI_TRIPS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 13:20:41 - root - INFO - To address this task, we need to divide taxi trips (with durations rounded to the nearest minute and between 1 and 50 minutes) into 10 quantiles based on their durations. For each quantile, we calculate the total number of trips and the average fare.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH FilteredTrips AS (
    SELECT
        "trip_seconds",
        ROUND("trip_seconds" / 60.0) AS "trip_minutes",
        "fare"
    FROM CHICAGO.CHICAGO_TAXI_TRIPS.TAXI_TRIPS
    WHERE "trip_seconds" >= 60 AND "trip_seconds" <= 3000
),

TripWithQuantile AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY "trip_minutes") AS "quantile"
    FROM FilteredTrips
)

SELECT
    'Quantile ' || "quantile" || ' (' || MIN("trip_minutes") || '-' || MAX("trip_minutes") || ' minutes)' AS "Duration_Range",
    COUNT(*) AS "Total_Trips",
    ROUND(AVG("fare"), 4) AS "Average_Fare"
FROM TripWithQuantile
GROUP BY "quantile"
ORDER BY "quantile";
```

This query performs the following steps:

1. **FilteredTrips CTE**: Filters the taxi trips to include only those with durations between 1 and 50 minutes (i.e., between 60 and 3000 seconds). It also calculates the trip duration rounded to the nearest minute (`"trip_minutes"`).
2. **TripWithQuantile CTE**: Assigns each trip to one of 10 quantiles based on the rounded trip durations using the `NTILE(10)` window function.
3. **Final SELECT Statement**: For each quantile, it calculates:
   - The duration range by finding the minimum and maximum trip minutes within the quantile.
   - The total number of trips in the quantile.
   - The average fare for the trips in the quantile, rounded to four decimal places.

GROUP BY "quantile"

```

This query performs the following steps:

1. **TripsWithMinutes CTE**: Calculates the trip duration rounded to the nearest minute (`"trip_minutes"`) and filters out records with null or zero trip seconds and null fare values.

2. **FilteredTrips CTE**: Filters trips to include only those with durations between 1 and 50 minutes inclusive.

3. **DurationQuantiles CTE**: Assigns each trip to one of 10 quantiles based on the trip duration in seconds (`"trip_seconds"`), providing finer granularity for the quantile calculation.

4. **Final SELECT Statement**: Groups the data by quantile and calculates:
   - The duration range for each quantile (minimum and maximum `"trip_minutes"` within the quantile).
   - The total number of trips in each quantile.
   - The average fare for each quantile, rounded to four decimal places.

This query ensures that we divide the trips into quantiles based on the precise trip durations in seconds, which results in more evenly distributed quantiles compared to using the rounded minutes. The output will match the specified format:

```csv
Duration_Range,Total_Trips,Average_Fare
Quantile 1 (Duration Range),total_trips1:int,average_fare1:float
Quantile 2 (Duration Range),total_trips2:int,average_fare2:float
...
Quantile 10 (Duration Range),total_trips10:int,average_fare10:float
```

Each "Quantile * (Duration Range)" represents the duration range (in minutes) for that quantile, determined from the data distribution.

**Note:** All decimals in the average fare are rounded to four decimal places as requested.
