After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Accurate Trip Duration Calculation**: `2result.sql` correctly calculates the trip duration in minutes by rounding the `"trip_seconds"` divided by 60. This ensures that each trip's duration is properly categorized based on the nearest minute.

- **Proper Filtering**: The query filters trips where the rounded trip duration is between 1 and 50 minutes, as specified in the task. It also excludes trips with null or missing `"trip_seconds"` and `"fare"` values, ensuring data quality.

- **Quantile Computation**: By using `NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY "trip_minutes")`, the query divides the trips into 10 quantiles based on the rounded trip duration in minutes. This directly addresses the requirement to categorize trips into quantiles based on duration.

- **Clear Duration Ranges**: The output includes the minimum and maximum trip durations for each quantile (e.g., "Quantile 1 (1-4 minutes)"). This provides clarity on the duration range covered by each quantile, making the results more informative.

- **Accurate Aggregations**: It calculates the total number of trips and the average fare for each quantile, providing precise metrics that fulfill the task's objectives.

- **Consistent Results**: The results from `2result.sql` align with the expected outcomes, showing a logical progression of average fares increasing with longer trip durations, which is intuitive and expected.

Therefore, `2result.sql` is the most appropriate and accurate SQL query that satisfies the task requirements.
