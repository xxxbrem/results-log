After reviewing the provided SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer for the given task. Here's the reasoning:

**Reasoning:**

- **Extraction of Session IDs:**
  - `0result.sql` extracts `SESSION_ID` from the `"EVENT_PARAMS"` column where the key is `'ga_session_id'`. This ensures that sessions are accurately identified based on the actual session IDs recorded in the event parameters.
  - This method is reliable because `"ga_session_id"` represents the session identifier assigned by Google Analytics, making it appropriate for session-level analysis.

- **User Identification:**
  - The query uses `COALESCE(t."USER_ID", t."USER_PSEUDO_ID") AS "User_ID"` to include both users with a known `"USER_ID"` and those identified by `"USER_PSEUDO_ID"`. This ensures that all users are considered, even if `"USER_ID"` is null.
  
- **Calculation of Session Purchase Value:**
  - It sums up `"EVENT_VALUE_IN_USD"` per `User_ID` and `SESSION_ID` to get the total purchase value for each session (`"SessionPurchaseValue"`). This is important because a user might make multiple purchases within a single session, and we want to aggregate these to reflect the total session value.
  
- **Average Purchase Value Per Session:**
  - The query then calculates the average purchase value per session per user by averaging `"SessionPurchaseValue"` over all sessions for each user.
  
- **Filtering Users with Multiple Sessions:**
  - By including `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "SESSION_ID") > 1`, the query filters out users who only had a single purchase session in November 2020, ensuring that only users with multiple purchase sessions are included, as per the task requirement.
  
- **Use of Accurate Date Range:**
  - The query considers events from all days in November 2020 by unioning tables from `"EVENTS_20201101"` to `"EVENTS_20201130"`, ensuring comprehensive data coverage for the specified period.

**Comparison with Other Queries:**

- **`1result.sql`:**
  - This query uses `"EVENT_BUNDLE_SEQUENCE_ID"` as the session identifier. However, `"EVENT_BUNDLE_SEQUENCE_ID"` may not reliably represent sessions, as it could indicate the sequence of events within a session rather than the session itself.
  - There's also a risk of misidentifying sessions if `"EVENT_BUNDLE_SEQUENCE_ID"` resets or overlaps between users.

- **`2result.sql`:**
  - While this query also extracts `SESSION_ID` from `"EVENT_PARAMS"`, it calculates the average of `"EVENT_VALUE_IN_USD"` per session using `AVG("EVENT_VALUE_IN_USD")` rather than summing the purchase values. This might not accurately reflect the total purchase value per session if there are multiple purchase events within a session.
  - It then averages these per-session averages per user, which could skew the results compared to summing purchases per session.

**Conclusion:**

`0result.sql` accurately extracts session IDs, correctly aggregates purchase values per session, calculates the average purchase value per session per user, and filters users who engaged in multiple purchase sessions in November 2020.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query is:**

0result.sql
