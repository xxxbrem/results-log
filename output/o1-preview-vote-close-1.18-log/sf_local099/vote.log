After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that `2result.sql` is the correct query.

**Reasoning:**

**First Query (`1result.sql`):**

- **Approach:** For each actor, it calculates:
  - `yash_num_films`: The maximum number of films the actor did with Yash Chopra.
  - `max_films_with_others`: The maximum number of films the actor did with any other director.
- **Condition:** It selects actors where `yash_num_films` is greater than `max_films_with_others`, i.e., actors who have made more films with Yash Chopra than with any other director.

**Second Query (`2result.sql`):**

- **Approach:**
  - Calculates the number of films each actor has done with each director.
  - Identifies the maximum number of films each actor has done with any director (`max_movie_count`).
  - Determines the directors with whom the actor has this maximum count.
  - Filters out actors who have multiple directors tied for the maximum count.
- **Condition:** It counts actors whose **unique top director** (the one with whom they've done the most films) is Yash Chopra.

**Comparison:**

- **Handling Ties:**
  - The **first query** includes actors who have worked with Yash Chopra more times than with any other director. However, if an actor has worked with Yash Chopra and another director the same maximum number of times (i.e., a tie), they are **excluded** because `yash_num_films` would not be greater than `max_films_with_others`.
  - The **second query** explicitly filters out actors who have a tie for the maximum number of films with multiple directors. It only counts actors for whom Yash Chopra is the **sole director** with whom they've worked the most.
- **Accuracy:**
  - Both queries effectively exclude actors with tied maximums involving Yash Chopra and others.
  - The **second query** more precisely adheres to the requirement by ensuring that only actors who have made more films with Yash Chopra than with any other director (and without ties) are counted.

**Conclusion:**

`2result.sql` is more precise as it ensures that only actors whose maximum collaboration is uniquely with Yash Chopra are counted, aligning perfectly with the task's requirement.
