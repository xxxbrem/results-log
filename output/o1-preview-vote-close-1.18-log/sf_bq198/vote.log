After comparing both SQL queries, I conclude that they are functionally equivalent and produce the same results, identifying the top 5 teams based on the number of times they had the maximum wins in a season between 1900 and 2000.

However, **`1result.sql`** is preferable because it uses a **Common Table Expression (CTE)**, which enhances readability and maintainability of the code. The CTE `max_wins_per_season` clearly separates the logic of calculating the maximum wins per season, making the overall query more understandable.

Therefore, the correct SQL to use is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
