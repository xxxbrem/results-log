After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct and most suitable query for addressing the task.

**Reasons:**

1. **Proper Filtering of Active Stations:**
   - **`1result.sql`** accurately filters trips to include only those that start from active stations by using a `WITH` clause named `"active_stations"` and joining it with the trips table.
   - This ensures that only trips from stations with `"status"` = 'active' are considered.

2. **Handling of Null and Invalid Data:**
   - The query explicitly excludes trips where `"start_station_id"` is `NULL` and where `"duration_minutes"` is less than or equal to zero (`"duration_minutes" > 0`). This helps in ensuring data quality by removing invalid or incomplete trip records.
   - This is crucial for accurate calculation of average durations and percentages.

3. **Accurate Calculation of Total Trips from Active Stations:**
   - The CTE `"total_trips_active"` calculates the total number of trips from active stations using the same filters as used in `"station_trip_counts"`.
   - This consistency ensures that the percentage of total trips is correctly computed relative to the appropriate total.

4. **Clear Structure and Readability:**
   - The query is well-structured with appropriate use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs), making it easier to understand and maintain.
   - It uses descriptive aliases and labels, enhancing clarity.

5. **Correct Calculation of Percentages and Averages:**
   - The percentage of total trips is calculated by dividing the station's trip count by the total trips from active stations, then multiplying by 100.
   - The average duration is accurately computed using the `AVG` function, and values are rounded to four decimal places for precision.

6. **Consistent and Accurate Results:**
   - The output matches the expected format and provides the station ID, total trips, percentage of total trips, and average duration, fulfilling the requirements of the task.
   - The results are ordered correctly by the total number of trips in descending order, showing the top 15 stations.

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that precisely addresses the task requirements by correctly filtering, calculating, and presenting the data.
