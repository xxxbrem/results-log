Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table**: `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS`
  - `"start_station_id"`: Used to identify the station where each trip starts; important for counting the number of trips per station.
  - `"duration_minutes"`: Used to calculate the average duration of trips starting from each station.
  - `"start_time"`: May be used to determine active periods or filter trips within certain dates.
  
- **Table**: `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS`
  - `"station_id"`: Unique identifier for each station; used to join with `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` on start station.
  - `"status"`: Indicates whether a station is active; used to filter active stations.
  - `"name"`: Provides the name of the station; useful for reference but not essential to the task.
  
**Potential Conditions:**

- Join `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` and `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` on `"start_station_id"` = `"station_id"` to access the status of each station.
- Filter for active stations using `"status"` = `'active'` (assuming `'active'` denotes active stations).
- Aggregate the number of trips starting from each station.
- Calculate the percentage of total trips each station represents.
- Compute the average duration of trips starting from each station.

Task: Identify the top 15 active stations based on the number of trip starts. For each of these stations, provide the station ID, the total number of trips that start there, the percentage this represents out of all trips from active stations, and the average duration of trips starting from the station.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
station_id,total_trips,percentage_of_total_trips,average_trip_duration
station_id1:int,total_trips1:int,percentage1:float,average_duration1:float
station_id2:int,total_trips2:int,percentage2:float,average_duration2:float

station_id15:int,total_trips15:int,percentage15:float,average_duration15:float
```

This table lists the top 15 active stations based on the number of trip starts. For each station, it provides the station ID, the total number of trips that started there, the percentage this represents out of all trips from active stations, and the average duration of trips starting from the station..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'AUSTIN': {'AUSTIN_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'AUSTIN_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATIONS', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'AUSTIN_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'AUSTIN_INCIDENTS': ['INCIDENTS_2008', 'INCIDENTS_2009', 'INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2011', 'INCIDENTS_2016'], 'AUSTIN_WASTE': ['WASTE_AND_DIVERSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
