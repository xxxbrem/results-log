```plain
0result.sql
```

**Reason:**

Both SQL scripts aim to calculate the wage growth rate and the inflation rate between 1998 and 2017 for Allegheny County, Pittsburgh. They both produce the same results:

- **Wage Growth Rate:** 76.2963%
- **Inflation Rate:** 50.3804%

However, **`0result.sql`** is preferable for the following reasons:

1. **Use of WITH Clauses for Readability and Modularity:**
   - The script uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with `WITH` clauses (`wage_1998`, `wage_2017`, `cpi_1998`, `cpi_2017`), which improve readability and make the query easier to understand and maintain.
   - This structure allows each subquery to be clearly defined and reused if needed.

2. **Robust Handling of CPI Data:**
   - By using `AVG("value")` when selecting CPI values, the script accounts for any potential data anomalies where more than one value might exist for the specified year and period. This ensures that the query won't fail due to multiple rows being returned and will instead compute the average, which should still reflect the intended annual CPI.

3. **Consistency in Aggregation:**
   - Both the wage data and CPI data are aggregated using `AVG`, ensuring consistency in how the data is processed.

4. **Error Prevention:**
   - The explicit use of averaging in `cpi_1998` and `cpi_2017` prevents errors that might occur if, for some reason, multiple records exist for a given year and period in the CPI data. In contrast, the subqueries in `1result.sql` assume that only one record exists and could cause the query to fail if that's not the case.

5. **Clarity in the Final Calculation:**
   - The final `SELECT` statement clearly references the CTEs and calculations, making it easier to verify and understand the computation of the growth rates.

Given these points, **`0result.sql`** is the better choice for accurately and reliably calculating the required growth rates while maintaining good coding practices.
