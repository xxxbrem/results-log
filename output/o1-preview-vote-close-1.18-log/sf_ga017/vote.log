After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct query for the task. Here's the reasoning:

### **Comparison of the SQL Queries**

#### **1. `0result.sql`**

- **Approach**: Counts the number of distinct users who viewed the page titled `'Home'`.
- **Assumption**: Assumes that `'Home'` is the most frequently visited page.
- **Query Structure**:
  - Filters `page_view` events where the `page_title` is `'Home'`.
  - Counts distinct `USER_PSEUDO_ID` from these events.

#### **2. `2result.sql`**

- **Approach**: Dynamically identifies the most frequently visited page and then counts the number of distinct users who viewed it.
- **Query Structure**:
  - Creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) `AllEvents` combining all events from January 2021.
  - Extracts `USER_PSEUDO_ID` and `page_title` from `page_view` events in `PageViews` CTE.
  - Identifies the most frequently visited `page_title`.
  - Counts distinct `USER_PSEUDO_ID` who viewed that page.

### **Reasons for Choosing `2result.sql`**

1. **Dynamic Identification**:
   - `2result.sql` does not make any assumptions about which page is the most visited.
   - It calculates the most frequently visited page based on the data.

2. **Accuracy**:
   - Ensures that the count of distinct users corresponds to the actual most visited page during January 2021.
   - Avoids potential errors if `'Home'` is not the most visited page.

3. **Robustness**:
   - The query remains valid even if the most visited page changes over time or in different datasets.
   - It's adaptable to any data without manual adjustment.

4. **Same Result but Better Methodology**:
   - Although both queries return the same result (`37165` distinct users), `2result.sql` reaches this conclusion through a more reliable method.

### **Conclusion**

- **`2result.sql`** is the correct query as it accurately fulfills the task requirement by dynamically determining the most frequently visited page and then counting the distinct users who viewed it.
- Choosing this query ensures correctness and adaptability in various scenarios.
