After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, **1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Accuracy:** All three queries return the same correct results, listing the top three users with the most upvotes received, along with the number of upvotes they received and the number they gave to others.

  ```
  UserName     UpvotesReceived  UpvotesGivenToOthers
  -----------  ---------------  --------------------
  cdeotte      54855            17256
  cpmpml       40201            13103
  hengck23     34219            396
  ```

- **Clarity and Readability:** The query in **1result.sql** utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with `WITH` clauses, which enhance readability and maintainability. The use of descriptive alias names like `UpvotesReceived` and `UpvotesGivenToOthers` makes the query easier to understand.

- **Comprehensive Joins:** It correctly performs left joins between the `USERS` table and the calculated tables for upvotes received and given, ensuring that all users are included even if they haven't given or received any upvotes.

- **Null Handling:** The use of `COALESCE` functions ensures that users with no upvotes received or given are displayed with a count of zero, preventing null values in the output.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plain
1result.sql
```
