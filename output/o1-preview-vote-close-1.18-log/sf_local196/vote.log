After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, we can determine which query correctly addresses the task.

**Analysis of the SQL Queries:**

1. **`0result.sql`**
   - This query retrieves the first rental date per customer and identifies the corresponding rental ID.
   - It joins multiple tables to get the film rating of the first rented movie.
   - It calculates the total spend per customer and counts the number of subsequent rentals (rentals after the first rental date).
   - **Observation:** While this query is accurate, it involves multiple complex subqueries and joins, which may affect performance.

2. **`1result.sql`**
   - Utilizes the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to identify the first rental per customer efficiently.
   - Joins the necessary tables to obtain the film rating of the first rented movie.
   - Calculates the total spend per customer and the number of subsequent rentals by subtracting one from the total rental count.
   - **Observation:** This query is straightforward, efficient, and directly addresses the task with minimal complexity.

3. **`2result.sql`**
   - Similar to `1result.sql`, it uses the `ROW_NUMBER()` function to find the first rental.
   - Calculates the number of subsequent rentals by counting rentals where the rental date is after the first rental date.
   - **Observation:** This query is correct but involves an extra join to determine subsequent rentals, which could be less efficient than subtracting one from the total rental count.

**Conclusion:**

The query in `1result.sql` is the most efficient and directly addresses the task requirements. It correctly calculates the average total spend and the average number of subsequent rentals for each rating category of the first movie rented by customers.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plain
1result.sql
