After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **2result.sql** is the correct SQL query that satisfies the task requirements. 

**Reasons:**

1. **Excludes Pre-release Versions:**
   - **2result.sql** includes the condition `AND pv."Version" NOT LIKE '%-%'` to exclude pre-release versions (which often contain a hyphen, e.g., `1.0.0-beta`).
   - This ensures only the latest **release** versions are considered, aligning with the task's requirement: *"Considering only the latest release versions of NPM package"*.
   - **0result.sql** and **1result.sql** do not exclude pre-release versions, so their results may include non-stable or pre-release versions.

2. **Correctly Identifies Latest Versions:**
   - By using `ROW_NUMBER()` partitioned by `"Name"` and ordered by `"UpstreamPublishedAt"` descending, **2result.sql** accurately selects the latest release version for each package.

3. **Accurate Ranking Based on GitHub Stars:**
   - **2result.sql** joins the latest package versions with their associated GitHub projects and orders them by `"StarsCount"` descending.
   - This provides the top 8 most popular NPM packages based on GitHub star numbers.

4. **Alignment with Results:**
   - The result of **2result.sql** shows well-known packages like `@dylanvann/svelte` and `@dumc11/tailwindcss`, which correspond to popular projects with high GitHub stars.
   - This indicates that the query is correctly capturing the most popular packages based on the specified criteria.

Therefore, **2result.sql** is the SQL query that correctly addresses the task.
