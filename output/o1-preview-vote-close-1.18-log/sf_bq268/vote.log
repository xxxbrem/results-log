After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Understanding the Task:**
  - We need to calculate the longest number of days between a user's **first visit** and their **last recorded event**.
  - The **last recorded event** is defined as either the user's **last visit** or their **first transaction**, depending on which occurred later.
  - We are only interested in users where this **last recorded event was associated with a mobile device**.

- **Evaluating the SQL Queries:**

  - **`0result.sql`:**
    - Assigns the `last_event_time` as the `first_transaction_time` if it exists, otherwise the `last_visit_time`.
    - Does **not** compare the `first_transaction_time` with the `last_visit_time` to determine which is later.
    - May incorrectly treat the `first_transaction_time` as the last event even if it occurred before the last visit.

  - **`1result.sql`:**
    - Uses `COALESCE(transaction_date, last_visit_date)` to assign the `last_event_date`.
    - Prioritizes the `transaction_date` over the `last_visit_date` without checking which one is later.
    - Similar to `0result.sql`, it may incorrectly select the `transaction_date` as the last event even if it occurred earlier.

  - **`2result.sql`:**
    - **Correctly determines the `last_event_time` by comparing the `first_transaction_time` and the `last_visit_time`**:
      ```sql
      CASE
        WHEN ft."first_transaction_time" IS NULL OR ft."first_transaction_time" <= lv."last_visit_time" THEN lv."last_visit_time"
        ELSE ft."first_transaction_time"
      END AS "last_event_time"
      ```
    - Ensures that the `last_event_time` is the **later** of the two events, accurately reflecting the last recorded event.
    - Also captures the device used during the `last_event_time` for filtering mobile devices.

- **Conclusion:**

  - **`2result.sql`** accurately implements the required logic by correctly identifying the last recorded event for each user.
  - It ensures the calculated durations are based on the appropriate event and accurately filters for mobile devices.
  - The other SQL queries do not perform the necessary comparison between the `first_transaction_time` and the `last_visit_time`, potentially leading to incorrect results.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plain
2result.sql
```
