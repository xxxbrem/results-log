After comparing both SQL queries and their results, we can see that both aim to find the day of the week with the third highest percentage of questions answered within an hour. They both arrive at the same result: **Friday** with approximately **49.78%**.

However, the first SQL query (`1result.sql`) uses the `TIMESTAMPDIFF` function to calculate the time difference between the question creation time and the first answer time in seconds, which provides a clear and accurate computation. It directly handles timestamp calculations and uses an explicit condition (`<= 3600` seconds) to determine if an answer was provided within an hour.

The second SQL query (`2result.sql`) calculates the time difference in microseconds by subtracting the creation dates and compares it to `3600 * 1000000`. While this method works, it relies on manual calculations of microseconds and may be less readable or prone to errors if the units are not consistent.

Therefore, the first SQL query is the correct choice due to its clarity and precise use of timestamp functions.
