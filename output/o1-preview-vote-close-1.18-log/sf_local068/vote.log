After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I find that both `1result.sql` and `2result.sql` effectively calculate the number of new cities added each April, May, and June for the years 2022 and 2023, using 2021 data as a baseline for calculating growth rates. Both queries exclude 2021 data from the final output, as required.

However, `1result.sql` offers a more concise and straightforward implementation. It clearly defines the baseline and data calculations, uses standard SQL functions for rounding and concatenation, and neatly formats the output. This makes `1result.sql` easier to read and maintain.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
