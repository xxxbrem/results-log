- Trips with a calculated trip distance greater than 1000 meters.
- Calculation of average speed using trip duration and distance.
- Filtering station data to find stations in Berkeley.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List all regions to find the region name for Berkeley:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name" 
   FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_REGIONS;
   ```

2. **Retrieve the region ID for Berkeley:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "region_id", "name" 
   FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_REGIONS 
   WHERE "name" ILIKE '%Berkeley%';
   ```

3. **List all station IDs and names in Berkeley:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "name", "region_id" 
   FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO 
   WHERE "name" ILIKE '%Berkeley%';
   ```

4. **Find stations with region ID matching Berkeley's region ID (assuming region ID is known):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "name" 
   FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO 
   WHERE "region_id" = 3;  -- Replace '3' with Berkeley's actual region_id
   ```

5. **List all unique start station names from trips data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "start_station_name" 
   FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS;
   ```

6. **Find trips that start from stations in Berkeley:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "trip_id", "start_station_id", "start_station_name", "duration_sec" 
   FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS 
   WHERE "start_station_name" ILIKE '%Berkeley%';
   ```

7. **Find trips that end at stations in Berkeley:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "trip_id", "end_station_id", "end_station_name", "duration_sec" 
   FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS 
   WHERE "end_station_name" ILIKE '%Berkeley%';
   ```

8. **Retrieve coordinates of stations in Berkeley:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "station_id", "name", "lat", "lon" 
   FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO 
   WHERE "name" ILIKE '%Berkeley%';
   ```

9. **Check the range of trip durations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("duration_sec") AS min_duration, MAX("duration_sec") AS max_duration, AVG("duration_sec") AS avg_duration 
   FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS;
   ```

    FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Find trips with duration greater than a threshold (e.g., 60 seconds):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "trip_id", "duration_sec"

    FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Retrieve trips with sufficient distance information (non-null coordinates):**
    ```sql
    SELECT "trip_id", "duration_sec", 
           "start_station_latitude", "start_station_longitude", 
           "end_station_latitude", "end_station_longitude" 
    FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS 
    WHERE "start_station_latitude" IS NOT NULL 
      AND "start_station_longitude" IS NOT NULL 
      AND "end_station_latitude" IS NOT NULL 
      AND "end_station_longitude" IS NOT NULL 
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Explore the subscriber types in trips data:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "subscriber_type" 
    FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS;
    ```

**Note:** The above queries are designed to explore the relevant data needed to calculate the highest average speed for bike trips in Berkeley with trip distances greater than 1000 meters. By examining station information, trip durations, and trip coordinates, we can prepare to calculate distances and identify trips within Berkeley.Query:

Task: What is the highest average speed (rounded to 1 decimal, in metric m/s) for bike trips in Berkeley with trip distance greater than 1000 meters?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Highest_average_speed_m_per_s
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

Without access to the actual trip data, the highest average speed cannot be determined..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS': {'SAN_FRANCISCO_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_REGIONS', 'BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO', 'BIKESHARE_STATION_STATUS', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_FILM_LOCATIONS': ['FILM_LOCATIONS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS': ['BOUNDARIES'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_SFFD_SERVICE_CALLS': ['SFFD_SERVICE_CALLS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_SFPD_INCIDENTS': ['SFPD_INCIDENTS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_TRANSIT_MUNI': ['CALENDAR', 'FARES', 'ROUTES', 'SHAPES', 'STOPS', 'STOP_MONITORING', 'STOP_TIMES', 'TRIPS', 'VEHICLE_MONITORING'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_TREES': ['STREET_TREES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
