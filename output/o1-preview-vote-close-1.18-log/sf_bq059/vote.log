After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I recommend using `1result.sql` as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Identification of Berkeley Stations:** `1result.sql` retrieves all station IDs associated with Berkeley by joining the `BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO` and `BIKESHARE_REGIONS` tables where the region name is 'Berkeley'. This ensures all trips starting or ending at any Berkeley station are considered.

- **Precise Distance Calculation:** The query uses the built-in spatial functions `ST_DISTANCE` and `TO_GEOGRAPHY` to calculate the distance between the start and end locations. These functions account for the Earth's curvature and provide more accurate results compared to manually computing the Haversine formula.

- **Comprehensive Data Inclusion:** Unlike `2result.sql`, which limits the trips to only three specific station IDs, `1result.sql` includes all relevant trips associated with any station in Berkeley, providing a complete analysis.

- **Efficiency and Readability:** Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and built-in functions makes the query more efficient and easier to understand and maintain.

**Therefore, the recommended SQL is:**

```plain
1result.sql
```
