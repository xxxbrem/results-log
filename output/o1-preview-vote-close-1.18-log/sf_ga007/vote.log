After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer. This is because:

- **`1result.sql`** accurately identifies PDP page views by checking the URL patterns that match Product Detail Pages. It looks for URLs that contain the '+' sign, have at least five segments when split by '/', and where specific segments match the known category names.

- The calculated percentage of **17.491124%** from **`1result.sql`** aligns with the expected proportion of PDP page views based on the dataset and prior exploration.

- On the other hand, **`2result.sql`** yields a percentage of **0.1538%**, which seems unreasonably low given the context and the data. This suggests that **`2result.sql`** may have overly restrictive criteria or a logical error in identifying PDP pages.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
