After carefully comparing the SQL queries and their results, **I choose `plain 2result.sql` as the correct answer**. 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Objective Alignment:**
   - The task is to calculate the percentage of customers who have rented films featuring the top five actors based on the number of films they have acted in.
   - All three SQL queries aim to accomplish this, but `2result.sql` does so in a clear, efficient, and correct manner.

2. **Query Analysis:**

   - **`0result.sql`:**
     - While it correctly identifies the top five actors and calculates the percentage, it uses `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC NULLS LAST`, which is unnecessary since `COUNT(*)` will not be `NULL`.
     - It includes extra CTEs that can be simplified.
   
   - **`1result.sql`:**
     - Introduces an unnecessary subquery in the `top_actors` CTE.
     - Uses joins where `IN` clauses would suffice, potentially impacting performance.
     - Slightly more complex without added benefit.
   
   - **`2result.sql`:**
     - Efficiently identifies the top five actors using `COUNT(*)` and `ORDER BY`.
     - Uses `IN` clauses for simplicity and clarity when filtering films and customers.
     - Consolidates the calculation of the total number of customers within the final query, making it concise.
     - Avoids unnecessary joins and subqueries, enhancing performance and readability.

3. **Result Consistency:**
   - All three queries return the same percentage (`99.1653%`), indicating that they are functionally equivalent in output.
   - However, `2result.sql` achieves this result with a more straightforward approach.

4. **Best Practices:**
   - `2result.sql` follows SQL best practices by:
     - Minimizing unnecessary subqueries and joins.
     - Using clear and concise syntax.
     - Improving maintainability and readability of the code.

**Therefore, the selected SQL file is:**

```plain
2result.sql
```
