After comparing the three SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct script for the following reasons:

1. **Precise Weight Calculations**: `1result.sql` uses the exact weights provided for each employment sector, ensuring a precise calculation of the vulnerable population. The weights are taken to full precision, as shown in the script:

   ```sql
   s."employed_wholesale_trade" * 0.38423645320197042 +
   s."employed_arts_entertainment_recreation_accommodation_food" * 0.89455676291236841 +
   s."employed_information" * 0.31315240083507306 +
   s."employed_retail_trade" * 0.51 +
   s."employed_public_administration" * 0.039299298394228743 +
   s."employed_other_services_not_public_admin" * 0.36555534476489654 +
   s."employed_education_health_social" * 0.20323178400562944 +
   s."employed_transportation_warehousing_utilities" * 0.3680506593618087 +
   s."employed_manufacturing" * 0.40618955512572535 +
   s."occupation_natural_resources_construction_maintenance" * 0.48071410777129553
   ```

2. **Accurate Data Joins**: This script carefully joins the employment data with the state names using the FIPS codes, ensuring that each state's data is accurately matched. It also correctly maps ZIP codes to states using the `state_code` and computes the average median income change per state.

3. **Comprehensive Income Change Calculation**: It computes the average median income change by aggregating ZIP code-level income changes, providing a thorough state-level average.

4. **Consistency with the Task Requirements**: The script aligns closely with the task's requirements by:
   - Calculating the vulnerable population using the specified weights and the 2017 ACS 5-Year data.
   - Determining the average median income change from 2015 to 2018 using the ZIP code data.

5. **Clear Output**: The result from `1result.sql` provides the top 10 states with the highest vulnerable population and their corresponding average median income change, which directly answers the task.

**Therefore, the correct SQL script is:**

```plain
1result.sql
```
