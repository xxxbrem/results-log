After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that `0result.sql` is the correct SQL query for the task.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Accurate Calculations and Consistent Results:**

   - The SQL query in `0result.sql` correctly calculates the number of questions asked each day of the week in 2021 and determines how many of those were answered within one hour.
   - The counts of questions and the percentages in the results are consistent and seem accurate.

2. **Proper Handling of Date and Time:**

   - It correctly filters questions asked in 2021 by using UNIX timestamps in microseconds (`1609459200000000` for January 1, 2021, and `1640995200000000` for January 1, 2022).
   - The query accurately calculates the time difference between the question and the answer by subtracting the creation dates (`a."creation_date" - q."creation_date" <= 3600000000`) to check if the answer was provided within one hour (3600 seconds * 1e6 microseconds).

3. **Correct Extraction and Ordering of Day of the Week:**

   - The query uses `DAYNAME(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(q."creation_date" / 1e6))` to extract the day name from the timestamp.
   - It orders the days of the week correctly using `DATE_PART('DAYOFWEEKISO', TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(q."creation_date" / 1e6))`, which aligns Monday as day 1 through Sunday as day 7.
   - The output displays the days in the correct order from Monday to Sunday.

4. **Clean and Complete Output:**

   - The results in `0result.csv` show all days of the week with their corresponding counts and percentages without any missing or anomalous data.
   - The percentages are calculated with precision to four decimal places, providing detailed insight.

5. **Comparison with Other SQL Queries:**

   - **`1result.sql`:** There are inconsistencies in the ordering of days and discrepancies in the counts of questions and answers. The days are not ordered properly despite the `ORDER BY` clause, which may indicate an issue in the `CASE` expression. Additionally, the total counts differ significantly from `0result.sql`, suggesting a potential error in grouping or filtering conditions.
   - **`2result.sql`:** The output contains a row with an empty `DayOfWeek`, indicating an error in handling the day mapping. This suggests there's a problem with the `CASE` statement or the `EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK ...)` function used in the query.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the accuracy of the calculations, proper handling of date and time, correct extraction and ordering of days, and clean output, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for this task.
