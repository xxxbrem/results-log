After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here's why:

- **Proper Time Formatting**: `1result.sql` uses `TO_CHAR` to format the `departure_time` and `arrival_time` columns into the desired `HH24:MI:SS` format, ensuring the times are displayed correctly as per your requirement.
  
  ```sql
  TO_CHAR(t1."departure_time", 'HH24:MI:SS') AS "Start_time",
  TO_CHAR(t2."arrival_time", 'HH24:MI:SS') AS "End_time",
  ```

- **Numeric Stop IDs Without Quotes**: The query uses numeric stop IDs without quotes (`14015` and `16294`), which is appropriate since `stop_id` is likely an integer field. Using quotes might treat them as strings, which could lead to unexpected results.

  ```sql
  WHERE
      t1."stop_id" = 14015 AND
      t2."stop_id" = 16294 AND
      t1."stop_sequence" < t2."stop_sequence"
  ```

- **Correct Data Retrieval**: The query correctly joins the `STOP_TIMES` and `TRIPS` tables to retrieve the `trip_headsign` along with the start and end times between the specified stops in one direction (ensured by the `stop_sequence` condition).

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
