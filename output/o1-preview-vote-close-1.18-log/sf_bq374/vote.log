After comparing both SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL script.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Robust Data Extraction:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` to extract values from the `"totals"` VARIANT column. This method ensures that all nested fields are correctly accessed, even if some sessions might not have certain keys present.
   - It employs `TRY_TO_NUMBER` when converting values to numbers, which safely handles any non-numeric or null values without causing errors.
   - In contrast, **`0result.sql`** directly accesses nested fields using `"totals":"fieldName"::INT`. This approach may lead to errors if the field doesn't exist or contains non-integer values.

2. **Accurate Counting of New Users:**
   - **`2result.sql`** defines `new_users` by selecting `DISTINCT "fullVisitorId"`, ensuring that each new user is counted only once in the denominator.
   - **`0result.sql`** selects `"fullVisitorId"` without `DISTINCT`, which could lead to duplicates if, hypothetically, a user has multiple sessions with `visitNumber = 1` (e.g., due to data anomalies), resulting in an inflated denominator.

3. **Handling of Missing or Non-Numeric Values:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses `TRY_TO_NUMBER`, which returns `NULL` for non-numeric values, preventing exceptions and allowing for proper filtering.
   - **`0result.sql`** uses a direct cast to `INT`. If a value is non-numeric or `NULL`, this can cause the query to fail or exclude valid entries inadvertently.

4. **Consistent Date Range Inclusion:**
   - Both scripts aim to include sessions between `'20160801'` and `'20170430'`, but **`2result.sql`** ensures that all sessions are included by comprehensively listing tables up to `GA_SESSIONS_20170430`.
   - **`0result.sql`** also attempts this, but given the extensive UNION ALL statements, there's potential for human error in missing a table.

5. **Final Percentage Calculation:**
   - The slight difference in the percentage results (`0.2722%` vs `0.2891%`) suggests that **`2result.sql`** may be handling data edge cases more accurately, leading to a more precise result.
   - **`2result.sql`** calculates the percentage using `COUNT(DISTINCT t."fullVisitorId")` over `COUNT(DISTINCT "fullVisitorId")`, ensuring both the numerator and denominator represent unique users.

**Conclusion:**

Given these reasons, **`2result.sql`** is more robust, accurate, and adheres to best practices for handling VARIANT data and ensuring accurate computations.
