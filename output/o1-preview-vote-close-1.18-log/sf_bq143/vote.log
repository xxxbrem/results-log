After comparing both SQL queries and their results, the **0result.sql** is the correct SQL according to the task requirements. Here's why:

**Reasoning:**

1. **Handling Multiple Sample Submitter IDs:**
   - In the first SQL (`0result.sql`), the `ALIQUOT_TO_CASE_MAPPING_CURRENT` table's `"sample_submitter_id"` field is processed using `SPLIT` and `LATERAL FLATTEN` because some entries contain multiple IDs separated by semicolons (e.g., `"C3N-00244-01;C3N-00244-02;C3N-00244-03"`).
   - This ensures all individual sample submitter IDs are considered when joining with the RNAseq data.
   - In the second SQL (`1result.sql`), there is no handling of multiple sample submitter IDs; it assumes a one-to-one mapping, which could miss matches.

2. **Join Conditions:**
   - `0result.sql` joins the proteomics data to the aliquot mapping table on `"aliquot_id"` and then to the RNAseq data using the correctly split `"sample_submitter_id"`.
   - `1result.sql` joins on `"sample_id"` and `"sample_submitter_id"` without splitting, potentially leading to incomplete or incorrect joins.

3. **Data Accuracy:**
   - By splitting and flattening the `"sample_submitter_id"`, `0result.sql` accurately aligns proteomics samples with their corresponding RNAseq samples.
   - This alignment is crucial for calculating the correct correlations between protein abundance and gene expression levels.

4. **Consistency with Task Requirements:**
   - The task specifies joining datasets on sample submitter IDs and gene symbols.
   - `0result.sql` ensures all possible sample submitter IDs are accounted for, adhering closely to the task.

**Conclusion:**

Given that `0result.sql` correctly handles multiple sample submitter IDs and aligns the datasets appropriately, it is the correct SQL query for the task.
