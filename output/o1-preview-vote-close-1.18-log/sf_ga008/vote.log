After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **both SQL queries correctly calculate the average page views per buyer and the total page views among buyers for each day in November 2020**. 

**Reasons for choosing one over the other:**

- **Query Structure:** Both queries use a similar approach:
  - They combine events from all days in November using `UNION ALL`.
  - They identify buyers by selecting users who performed a 'purchase' event on each day.
  - They calculate page views per buyer by counting 'page_view' events per user per day.
  - They join the page views with the buyers to get page views only for buyers.
  - They aggregate the results to compute the average and total page views among buyers for each day.

- **Result Comparison:** The results (`1result.csv` and `2result.csv`) are identical, indicating that both queries produce the same output.

- **Query Efficiency:** While both queries are correct, **`1result.sql` is slightly more concise and may be more efficient due to fewer subqueries and joins**.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
