Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `ORDERS`
   - **"customerid"**: Used to identify the customer who placed the order.
     - *Potential usage*: Link orders to customers.
   - **"orderid"**: Unique identifier for each order.
     - *Potential usage*: Link orders to order details.
   - **"orderdate"**: Date when the order was placed.
     - *Potential usage*: Filter orders placed in 1998.
   
2. **Table:** `ORDER_DETAILS`
   - **"orderid"**: Links to the corresponding order in the `ORDERS` table.
     - *Potential usage*: Join with `ORDERS` to get order details.
   - **"unitprice"**: Price per unit of the product.
   - **"quantity"**: Number of units ordered.
   - **"discount"**: Discount applied to the order line.
     - *Potential usage*: Calculate total spending per order.

3. **Table:** `CUSTOMERS`
   - **"customerid"**: Unique identifier for each customer.
     - *Potential usage*: Identify customers and link to orders.
   - **"companyname"**: Name of the customer's company.

4. **Table:** `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD`
   - **"groupname"**: Name of the spending group.
     - *Potential usage*: Categorize customers based on spending.
   - **"rangebottom"**: Lower limit of the spending range.
   - **"rangetop"**: Upper limit of the spending range.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filter orders where **"orderdate"** is in the year 1998 (e.g., `"orderdate" LIKE '1998%'`).
- Calculate total spending per customer by summing (`"unitprice"` × `"quantity"`) minus `"discount"`.
- Join `ORDERS`, `ORDER_DETAILS`, and `CUSTOMERS` tables on `"orderid"` and `"customerid"`.
- Use spending ranges from `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` to assign customers to groups.

**Sample SQL Queries:**

1. **List all distinct customers who have placed orders:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "customerid"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDERS"
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

2. **Retrieve all orders placed in 1998:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "orderid", "customerid", "orderdate"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDERS"
   WHERE "orderdate" LIKE '1998%'
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

3. **Get distinct order dates to understand date formats:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "orderdate"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDERS"
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

4. **Fetch order details for a specific order:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "orderid", "productid", "unitprice", "quantity", "discount"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDER_DETAILS"
   WHERE "orderid" = 10248
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

5. **List all customers with their company names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customerid", "companyname"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."CUSTOMERS"
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

6. **Retrieve customer spending group thresholds:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "groupname", "rangebottom", "rangetop"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD"
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

7. **Find orders with a discount applied:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "orderid"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDER_DETAILS"
   WHERE "discount" > 0
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

8. **Get total quantity ordered for each product:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "productid", SUM("quantity") AS "TotalQuantity"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDER_DETAILS"
   GROUP BY "productid"
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

9. **List all products ordered in 1998:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT od."productid"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDER_DETAILS" od
   JOIN NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDERS" o ON od."orderid" = o."orderid"
   WHERE o."orderdate" LIKE '1998%'
   LIMIT 1000
   ```

10. **Retrieve total orders per customer in 1998:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "customerid", COUNT("orderid") AS "OrderCount"
    FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDERS"
    WHERE "orderdate" LIKE '1998%'
    GROUP BY "customerid"
    LIMIT 1000
    ```

11. **Fetch all group names from customer group thresholds:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "groupname"
    FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD"
    LIMIT 1000
    ```

12. **Identify customers without orders in 1998:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "customerid"
    FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."CUSTOMERS"
    WHERE "customerid" NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT "customerid"
        FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDERS"
        WHERE "orderdate" LIKE '1998%'
    )
    LIMIT 1000
    ```

13. **Get average discount applied per order:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "orderid", AVG("discount") AS "AverageDiscount"
    FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDER_DETAILS"
    GROUP BY "orderid"
    LIMIT 1000
    ```

14. **Retrieve the range of order dates:**
    ```sql
    SELECT MIN("orderdate") AS "FirstOrderDate", MAX("orderdate") AS "LastOrderDate"
    FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDERS"
    LIMIT 1000
    ```

15. **List orders along with shipping countries in 1998:**

    SELECT "orderid", "shipcountry"
    FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND."ORDERS"
    WHERE "orderdate" LIKE '1998%'
    LIMIT 1000
    ```

Task: How many customers were in each spending group in 1998, and what percentage of the total customer base does each group represent?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
GroupName,NumberOfCustomers,PercentageOfTotalCustomers
groupname1:str,count1:int,percentage1:xx.xx
groupname2:str,count2:int,percentage2:xx.xx
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NORTHWIND': {'NORTHWIND': ['CATEGORIES', 'CUSTOMERCUSTOMERDEMO', 'CUSTOMERDEMOGRAPHICS', 'CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD', 'CUSTOMERS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMPLOYEETERRITORIES', 'ORDERS', 'ORDER_DETAILS', 'PRODUCTS', 'REGION', 'SHIPPERS', 'SUPPLIERS', 'TERRITORIES', 'USSTATES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 17:22:51 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many customers were in each spending group in 1998, and what percentage of the total customer base does each group represent?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
GroupName,NumberOfCustomers,PercentageOfTotalCustomers
groupname1:str,count1:int,percentage1:xx.xx
groupname2:str,count2:int,percentage2:xx.xx
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
