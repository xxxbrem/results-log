After comparing both SQL queries, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Explanation:**

Both SQL queries aim to calculate the number of customers in each spending group for the year 1998 and determine what percentage they represent of the total customer base. However, **`1result.sql`** is preferable for the following reasons:

1. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - **`1result.sql`** utilizes **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to break down the query into logical steps. This improves readability and makes the query easier to understand and maintain.
   - The CTEs (`all_customers`, `customer_spending`, `customer_totals`, `customer_groups`) clearly outline each stage of data processing.

2. **Comprehensive Customer Inclusion:**
   - By selecting all customers from the `CUSTOMERS` table in the `all_customers` CTE, **`1result.sql`** ensures that customers who did not place any orders in 1998 are included in the analysis.
   - The use of `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` assigns a total spending of zero to these customers, correctly categorizing them into the appropriate spending group.

3. **Accurate Percentage Calculation:**
   - The percentage of total customers is calculated based on the **total number of customers**, not just those who placed orders in 1998.
   - This approach aligns with the task requirement to determine what percentage each spending group represents of the **total customer base**.

4. **Logical Flow and Maintainability:**
   - The step-by-step approach in **`1result.sql`** makes it easier to debug and modify if needed.
   - Each CTE serves a specific purpose, enhancing the modularity of the query.

**Conclusion:**

While both queries produce the same numerical results, **`1result.sql`** offers better clarity, ensures comprehensive customer inclusion, and follows a logical structure that improves maintainability. Therefore, it is the preferred choice for accurately addressing the task.
