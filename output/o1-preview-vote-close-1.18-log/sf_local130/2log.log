2025-01-18 17:46:57 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of `[CompletedStatus]` in your SQL query. In SQL, square brackets are not used for placeholders or variables in this context. Instead, you should directly use the actual value that represents the 'Completed' status.

From the earlier query results you've provided, we have the mapping of `ClassStatus` codes to their descriptions:

```csv
ClassStatus,ClassStatusDescription
1,Enrolled
2,Completed
3,Withdrew
```

Here, the 'Completed' status corresponds to `ClassStatus` value **2**.

### **Corrected SQL Query**

To fix the error, replace `[CompletedStatus]` with **2** in your query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "StudentID", "ClassStatus"
FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."STUDENT_SCHEDULES"
WHERE "ClassStatus" = 2
LIMIT 1000;
```

This query selects all distinct student IDs and their class statuses where the class status is 'Completed'.

---

### **Explanation**

- **Issue**: The placeholder `[CompletedStatus]` is not recognized by SQL and results in an invalid identifier error.
- **Solution**: Replace the placeholder with the actual value. In this case, use `2` which represents the 'Completed' status.
- **SQL Syntax**: Ensure that all identifiers (like table and column names) are enclosed in double quotes if necessary, and that literal values (like numbers or strings) are correctly specified.

---

### **Moving Forward**

Now that we've corrected the query, let's proceed to address the original task using the information we've gathered.

#### **Objective**

Provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile.

#### **Steps to Achieve This**

1. **Identify English Courses**

   - From your earlier results, the `SUBJECTS` table shows:

     ```csv
     SubjectID,SubjectName
     39,Advanced English Grammar
     ```

     So, `SubjectID` **39** corresponds to English courses.

2. **Find Classes of English Courses**

   - From the `CLASSES` table:

     ```csv
     ClassID,SubjectID
     1196,39
     4196,39
     ```

     So, classes with `ClassID` **1196** and **4196** are English classes.

3. **Get Students Who Completed English Courses**

   - Join `STUDENT_SCHEDULES` with `STUDENTS` where:

     - `ClassID` is **1196** or **4196**
     - `ClassStatus` is **2** (Completed)

4. **Calculate Quintile Ranks Based on Grades**

   - Use the grades from `STUDENT_SCHEDULES` to calculate the quintile ranks for these students.

5. **Sort the Results**

   - Sort the students from the highest to the lowest grade quintile.

#### **Final SQL Query**

Here's how you can write the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
WITH EnglishClasses AS (
  SELECT "ClassID"
  FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."CLASSES"
  WHERE "SubjectID" = 39
),
CompletedEnglishGrades AS (
  SELECT ss."StudentID", ss."Grade"
  FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."STUDENT_SCHEDULES" ss
  JOIN EnglishClasses ec ON ss."ClassID" = ec."ClassID"
  WHERE ss."ClassStatus" = 2 AND ss."Grade" IS NOT NULL
),
Quintiles AS (
  SELECT
    "StudentID",
    "Grade",
    NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY "Grade" DESC) AS "QuintileRank"
  FROM CompletedEnglishGrades
),
StudentLastNames AS (
  SELECT "StudentID", "StudLastName"
  FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."STUDENTS"
)
SELECT sl."StudLastName", q."QuintileRank"
FROM Quintiles q
JOIN StudentLastNames sl ON q."StudentID" = sl."StudentID"
ORDER BY q."QuintileRank" DESC;
```

---

### **Result Format**

As per your request, here's the expected output format:

```csv
StudLastName,QuintileRank
name1:str,rank1:int(1-5)
name2:str,rank2:int(1-5)
...
```

- **`StudLastName`**: The last names of students who completed English courses.
- **`QuintileRank`**: Their quintile rank based on grades (1 to 5), with 5 being the highest quintile.

---

### **Brief Explanation**

- **Identify English Classes**: We create a CTE `EnglishClasses` to get the `ClassID`s of classes where the `SubjectID` is **39** (English).
- **Get Completed English Grades**: In the `CompletedEnglishGrades` CTE, we join `STUDENT_SCHEDULES` with `EnglishClasses` and filter for `ClassStatus` = 2 (Completed). We also ensure that `Grade` is not null.
- **Calculate Quintile Ranks**: Using the `NTILE(5)` window function, we assign quintile ranks to the students based on their grades, in the `Quintiles` CTE.
- **Get Last Names**: We select the `StudentID` and `StudLastName` from the `STUDENTS` table in the `StudentLastNames` CTE.
- **Final Selection**: We join `Quintiles` with `StudentLastNames` on `StudentID` and order the results by `QuintileRank` in descending order to list from the highest to lowest quintile.

---

### **Note**

- If there are any students with the same grade resulting in the same quintile, they will share the same `QuintileRank`.
- Ensure that the `Grade` column contains numeric values suitable for ranking.
- Replace any column names or table names if they differ in your actual database schema.

### **Sample SQL Queries**

Below are simple, short, non-nested SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

1. **Retrieve distinct class status descriptions to understand course completion statuses:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "ClassStatusDescription"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Retrieve distinct class statuses from student schedules:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "ClassStatus"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."STUDENT_SCHEDULES"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Get the mapping of class statuses to their descriptions:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "ClassStatus", "ClassStatusDescription"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Retrieve distinct subject names to identify English courses:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "SubjectName"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."SUBJECTS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Retrieve subject IDs for subjects where the name includes 'English':**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "SubjectID"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."SUBJECTS"
   WHERE "SubjectName" ILIKE '%English%'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Retrieve all class IDs and their corresponding subject IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "ClassID", "SubjectID"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."CLASSES"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Retrieve all student IDs and their enrolled class IDs:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "StudentID", "ClassID"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."STUDENT_SCHEDULES"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Retrieve all student IDs and their grades:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "StudentID", "Grade"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."STUDENT_SCHEDULES"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Retrieve all student IDs and their last names:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "StudentID", "StudLastName"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."STUDENTS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Retrieve distinct grades to understand the grade distribution:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "Grade"
    FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."STUDENT_SCHEDULES"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Retrieve class statuses along with their counts to see how many times each status occurs:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "ClassStatus", COUNT(*) AS "StatusCount"
    FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."STUDENT_SCHEDULES"
    GROUP BY "ClassStatus"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Retrieve subject IDs and subject names to map subject IDs to names:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "SubjectID", "SubjectName"
    FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."SUBJECTS"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Retrieve student IDs and class statuses where courses are marked as completed (replace `[CompletedStatus]` with the actual code):**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "StudentID", "ClassStatus"
    FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."STUDENT_SCHEDULES"
    WHERE "ClassStatus" = [CompletedStatus]
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **Retrieve class IDs and subject IDs where the subject name contains 'English' (needs manual matching of subject IDs):**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "ClassID", "SubjectID"
    FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING."CLASSES"
    WHERE "SubjectID" IN ([EnglishSubjectIDs]) -- Replace with actual IDs
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Retrieve student IDs and grades for all students:**

Task: Could you provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To provide the list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile, the result would be formatted as follows:

```csv
StudLastName,QuintileRank
name1:str,rank1:int(1-5)
name2:str,rank2:int(1-5)
...
```

In this table, `StudLastName` represents the last names of students who have completed English courses, and `QuintileRank` is their grade quintile rank ranging from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quintile. The data is sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'SCHOOL_SCHEDULING': {'SCHOOL_SCHEDULING': ['BUILDINGS', 'CATEGORIES', 'CLASSES', 'CLASS_ROOMS', 'DEPARTMENTS', 'FACULTY', 'FACULTY_CATEGORIES', 'FACULTY_CLASSES', 'FACULTY_SUBJECTS', 'MAJORS', 'SQLITE_SEQUENCE', 'STAFF', 'STUDENTS', 'STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS', 'STUDENT_SCHEDULES', 'SUBJECTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 17:49:16 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide the list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile, the result would be formatted as follows:

```csv
StudLastName,QuintileRank
name1:str,rank1:int(1-5)
name2:str,rank2:int(1-5)
...
```

In this table, `StudLastName` represents the last names of students who have completed English courses, and `QuintileRank` is their grade quintile rank ranging from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quintile. The data is sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
