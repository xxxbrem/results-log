Begin Exploring Related Columns
Tables and columns relevant to the task:

1. **STUDENTS**
   - `"StudentID"`: To identify students.
   - `"StudLastName"`: To retrieve last names of students.

2. **STUDENT_SCHEDULES**
   - `"StudentID"`: To link with STUDENTS.
   - `"ClassID"`: To identify classes the student has enrolled in.
   - `"ClassStatus"`: To determine if the class is completed.
   - `"Grade"`: To get the student's grade.

3. **CLASSES**
   - `"ClassID"`: To link with STUDENT_SCHEDULES.
   - `"SubjectID"`: To identify the subject of the class.

4. **SUBJECTS**
   - `"SubjectID"`: To link with CLASSES.
   - `"SubjectName"`: To identify English courses.

5. **STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS**
   - `"ClassStatus"`: To interpret class status codes.
   - `"ClassStatusDescription"`: To determine if the class is completed.

Conditions that may be used:

- Filter for English courses using `"SubjectName"` in the `SUBJECTS` table with a condition like `"SubjectName" ILIKE '%English%'`.
- Filter for completed classes by matching `"ClassStatus"` in `STUDENT_SCHEDULES` with the appropriate status code representing completion in `STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS`.

Here are 10 simple, short, non-nested SQL queries to understand the values in related columns:

1. **Retrieve distinct subject names to identify English courses:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "SubjectName" FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SUBJECTS LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Find subject IDs and names for subjects containing 'English':**
   ```sql
   SELECT "SubjectID", "SubjectName"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SUBJECTS
   WHERE "SubjectName" ILIKE '%English%' LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Get all class status codes and descriptions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ClassStatus", "ClassStatusDescription"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **List distinct class statuses used in student schedules:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "ClassStatus"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.STUDENT_SCHEDULES LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Retrieve student IDs and their grades:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "StudentID", "Grade"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.STUDENT_SCHEDULES LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Get student IDs and last names to relate names with IDs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "StudentID", "StudLastName"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.STUDENTS LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Identify class IDs and their corresponding subject IDs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ClassID", "SubjectID"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.CLASSES LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Find class statuses associated with student schedules:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "StudentID", "ClassID", "ClassStatus"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.STUDENT_SCHEDULES LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Retrieve class IDs for classes related to English courses:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ClassID"
   FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.CLASSES
   WHERE "SubjectID" IN (
       SELECT "SubjectID"
       FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SUBJECTS
       WHERE "SubjectName" ILIKE '%English%'
   ) LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **List student IDs and class IDs for completed classes:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "StudentID", "ClassID"
    FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.STUDENT_SCHEDULES
    WHERE "ClassStatus" = (SELECT "ClassStatus"
                           FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS
                           WHERE "ClassStatusDescription" = 'Completed') LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Get grades of students who completed English courses:**
    ```sql
    SELECT ss."StudentID", ss."Grade"
    FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.STUDENT_SCHEDULES ss
    JOIN SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.CLASSES c ON ss."ClassID" = c."ClassID"
    JOIN SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SUBJECTS s ON c."SubjectID" = s."SubjectID"
    WHERE s."SubjectName" ILIKE '%English%'
      AND ss."ClassStatus" = (SELECT "ClassStatus"
                              FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS
                              WHERE "ClassStatusDescription" = 'Completed') LIMIT 1000;

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "ClassStatusDescription"
    FROM SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Task: Could you provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
StudLastName,QuintileRank
lastname1:str,quintile1:int
lastname2:str,quintile2:int
...
```

**Explanation:**

The table above provides the last names of students who completed English courses, along with their quintile ranks based on their grades. The students are sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'SCHOOL_SCHEDULING': {'SCHOOL_SCHEDULING': ['BUILDINGS', 'CATEGORIES', 'CLASSES', 'CLASS_ROOMS', 'DEPARTMENTS', 'FACULTY', 'FACULTY_CATEGORIES', 'FACULTY_CLASSES', 'FACULTY_SUBJECTS', 'MAJORS', 'SQLITE_SEQUENCE', 'STAFF', 'STUDENTS', 'STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS', 'STUDENT_SCHEDULES', 'SUBJECTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
