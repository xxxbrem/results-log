After analyzing the three SQL queries and their respective results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that fulfills the task requirements. Here's the reasoning:

**1. Candidate 1 (`0result.sql`):**

- **Criteria Used:**
  - Filters courses where the subject name includes 'Composition'.
  - Only considers students who completed these courses.
- **Limitations:**
  - Excludes courses with 'English' in the subject name (e.g., 'Advanced English Grammar').
  - May miss students who took other English courses not labeled as 'Composition'.
  
**2. Candidate 2 (`1result.sql`):**

- **Criteria Used:**
  - Filters courses where the subject name includes 'English'.
  - Considers students regardless of course completion status.
- **Limitations:**
  - Does not check if the students have completed the courses.
  - Excludes 'Composition' courses, which are typically part of English curricula.
  
**3. Candidate 3 (`2result.sql`):**

- **Criteria Used:**
  - Filters courses where the subject name includes 'English' **or** 'Composition'.
  - Considers only students who have **completed** these courses.
  - Ensures grades are not null for accurate quintile calculation.
- **Advantages:**
  - Includes a comprehensive set of English courses.
  - Accurately reflects students who have completed English courses.
  - Calculates quintile ranks based on grades and orders them from highest to lowest.
  
**Conclusion:**

- **`2result.sql`** aligns perfectly with the task requirements:
  - It lists last names of all students who completed English courses (including 'Composition' courses).
  - It calculates and includes their quintile ranks based on grades.
  - It orders the results from the highest to the lowest grade quintile.
