- `STUDENTS`

  - `"StudentID"`: Used to join with `STUDENT_SCHEDULES` to get student information.
  - `"StudLastName"`: Needed to retrieve students' last names.

- `STUDENT_SCHEDULES`

  - `"StudentID"`: Used to join with `STUDENTS` to link student records.
  - `"ClassID"`: Used to join with `CLASSES` to get class details.
  - `"Grade"`: Used to calculate quintile ranks based on grades.
  - `"ClassStatus"`: Indicates the completion status of a class.

- `CLASSES`

  - `"ClassID"`: Used to join with `STUDENT_SCHEDULES`.
  - `"SubjectID"`: Used to join with `SUBJECTS` to get subject information.

- `SUBJECTS`

  - `"SubjectID"`: Used to join with `CLASSES`.
  - `"SubjectName"`: Used to identify English courses.
  - `"SubjectCode"`: May assist in identifying English courses.

- `STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS`

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter where `"SubjectName"` is related to English courses, e.g., `"SubjectName" ILIKE '%English%'`.
- Filter where `"ClassStatusDescription"` is 'Completed' to find classes that have been completed.
- Exclude records where `"Grade"` is `NULL` to focus on graded courses.

Task: Could you provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades, and sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades (sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile), the format would be:

```csv
LastName,GradeQuintileRank
lastname1:str,rank:int (5 highest)
lastname2:str,rank:int
...
```

This table lists the students' last names and their corresponding grade quintile ranks, with quintile 5 representing the highest grades..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'SCHOOL_SCHEDULING': {'SCHOOL_SCHEDULING': ['BUILDINGS', 'CATEGORIES', 'CLASSES', 'CLASS_ROOMS', 'DEPARTMENTS', 'FACULTY', 'FACULTY_CATEGORIES', 'FACULTY_CLASSES', 'FACULTY_SUBJECTS', 'MAJORS', 'SQLITE_SEQUENCE', 'STAFF', 'STUDENTS', 'STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS', 'STUDENT_SCHEDULES', 'SUBJECTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 17:48:53 - root - INFO - Upon reviewing your query and the data provided, it appears that there are no students who have **completed** English courses with a non-null grade in your current dataset. This is why the query returns the message:

```
No data found for the specified query.
```

**Explanation:**

- **English Courses Identification:**
  - From your data, the only subject matching `%English%` is:
    - **SubjectID:** `39`
    - **SubjectName:** `Advanced English Grammar`

- **Classes Associated with English Courses:**
  - The classes for `SubjectID` `39` are:
    - **ClassID:** `1196`
    - **ClassID:** `4196`

- **Student Enrollment and Grades:**
  - Checking the `STUDENT_SCHEDULES` table for these `ClassID`s shows that:
    - Students enrolled in these classes have a `ClassStatus` of `1` (`'Enrolled'`), not `2` (`'Completed'`).
    - The `Grade` for these records is `0.0`, which may represent that the course is in progress or grades have not been assigned yet.

- **Class Status Mapping:**
  - From the `STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS` table:
    - `1` corresponds to `'Enrolled'`
    - `2` corresponds to `'Completed'`

**Therefore**, when you include the condition:

```sql
AND STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS."ClassStatusDescription" = 'Completed'
```

The query filters out all records because there are no students who have completed an English course.

---

**Possible Actions:**

1. **Verify Data Availability:**
   - If possible, check if there are any students who have completed English courses and ensure that their records are correctly entered into the database with `ClassStatus` set to `'Completed'` and valid `Grade`s.

2. **Adjust the Query (If Appropriate):**
   - If you want to include students who are currently enrolled in English courses (since no one has completed them yet), you can modify the condition to:

     ```sql
     AND STUDENT_CLASS_STATUS."ClassStatusDescription" IN ('Completed', 'Enrolled')
     ```

   - **Note:** This adjustment changes the scope of your query and may not align with your original requirement of retrieving only students who have completed English courses.

3. **Test the Query Without the Class Status Filter:**
   - To see the available data, you can temporarily remove the `ClassStatus` condition:

     ```sql
     AND STUDENT_SCHEDULES."Grade" IS NOT NULL
     ```

   - **But keep in mind** that this will include all students in English courses regardless of their completion status.

---

**Revised Query (Including Enrolled Students):**

If you decide to include students who are currently enrolled in English courses, here is the adjusted query:

```sql
SELECT
    STUDENTS."StudLastName" AS "LastName",
    NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY STUDENT_SCHEDULES."Grade" DESC NULLS LAST) AS "GradeQuintileRank"
FROM
    SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.STUDENT_SCHEDULES
JOIN 
    SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.CLASSES ON STUDENT_SCHEDULES."ClassID" = CLASSES."ClassID"
JOIN 
    SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SUBJECTS ON CLASSES."SubjectID" = SUBJECTS."SubjectID"
JOIN 
    SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.SCHOOL_SCHEDULING.STUDENTS ON STUDENT_SCHEDULES."StudentID" = STUDENTS."StudentID"
WHERE
    SUBJECTS."SubjectName" ILIKE '%English%'
    AND STUDENT_SCHEDULES."Grade" IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    "GradeQuintileRank" DESC, STUDENT_SCHEDULES."Grade" DESC NULLS LAST;
```

**Please note** that this query includes all students with grades in English courses, regardless of whether they have completed the course.

---

**Conclusion:**

Given the current dataset, there are no students who have completed English courses with non-null grades. If your data is supposed to have such records, please verify that the data has been correctly entered into the database.

If you need further assistance or have additional information, feel free to provide it, and I'll be happy to help you refine the query.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To provide a list of last names for all students who completed English courses, including their quintile ranks based on their grades (sorted from the highest to the lowest grade quintile), the format would be:

```csv
LastName,GradeQuintileRank
lastname1:str,rank:int (5 highest)
lastname2:str,rank:int

```

This table lists the students' last names and their corresponding grade quintile ranks, with quintile 5 representing the highest grades.
