## Documents about Google Analytics Sample - ga_sessions

This article explains the format and schema of the data that is imported into BigQuery.

## Datasets

For each Analytics view that is enabled for BigQuery integration, a dataset is added using the view ID as the name.

## Tables

Within each dataset, a table is imported for each day of export. Daily tables have the format "ga\_sessions\_YYYYMMDD".

Intraday data is imported at least three times a day. Intraday tables have the format "ga\_sessions\_intraday\_YYYYMMDD". During the same day, each import of intraday data overwrites the previous import in the same table.

When the daily import is complete, the intraday table from the previous day is deleted. For the current day, until the first intraday import, there is no intraday table. If an intraday-table write fails, then the previous day's intraday table is preserved.

Data for the current day is not final until the daily import is complete. You may notice differences between intraday and daily data based on active user sessions that cross the time boundary of last intraday import.

## Rows

Each row within a table corresponds to a session in Analytics 360.

## Columns

The columns within the export are listed below. In BigQuery, some columns may have nested fields and messages within them.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
Sure, let's consider the tables and columns relevant to the task.

### Relevant Tables and Columns:

**Tables:**
- All tables in the `GA360.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SAMPLE` schema named `GA_SESSIONS_YYYYMMDD` for dates from `'20170101'` to `'20170630'` (first half of 2017).

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

1. **"date"**: Used to filter sessions within the first half of 2017.
2. **"trafficSource"**: Contains information about the traffic source.
   - `"trafficSource":VARIANT:"source"::STRING`: The source of the traffic (e.g., 'google', 'bing').
3. **"hits"**: An array containing hit-level data for each session.
4. **"hits".**`transaction`: Contains transaction information.
   - `"hits".transaction:VARIANT:"transactionRevenue"::INTEGER`: Revenue from the transaction.
5. **"hits".**`product`: Contains product-level information within hits.
   - `"hits".product":VARIANT:"productRevenue"::INTEGER`: Revenue associated with individual products.
6. **"trafficSource":VARIANT:"medium"::STRING**: The medium of the traffic source (e.g., 'organic', 'cpc').
7. **"channelGrouping"**: The default channel group associated with the session.
8. **"totals":VARIANT:"transactionRevenue"::INTEGER**: Total transaction revenue for the session.
9. **"fullVisitorId"**: Unique identifier for a user.
10. **"visitId"**: Identifier for the session.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- Date Range: Filter sessions between `'20170101'` and `'20170630'`.
- Traffic Source: Group or filter by `"trafficSource":VARIANT:"source"::STRING` to identify top-performing sources.
- Revenue: Sum `"hits".transaction:VARIANT:"transactionRevenue"` or `"hits".product":VARIANT:"productRevenue"` to calculate revenues.
- Flatten Nested Arrays: Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to access nested fields in `"hits"` and `"hits".product`.

### SQL Queries to Understand Values in Related Columns:

Here are 10 simple, short, non-nested SQL queries to explore the relevant data. Each query is different and helps in understanding the values in related columns.

1. **List Distinct Dates in the First Half of 2017**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT t."date"
   FROM GA360.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SAMPLE.GA_SESSIONS_20170101 t
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Get Distinct Traffic Sources**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT t."trafficSource":VARIANT:"source"::STRING AS "source"
   FROM GA360.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SAMPLE.GA_SESSIONS_20170101 t
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Get Distinct Traffic Mediums**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT t."trafficSource":VARIANT:"medium"::STRING AS "medium"
   FROM GA360.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SAMPLE.GA_SESSIONS_20170101 t
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Extract Hit Numbers from Hits Array**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:VARIANT:"hitNumber"::INTEGER AS "hitNumber"
   FROM GA360.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SAMPLE.GA_SESSIONS_20170101 t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."hits") f
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Retrieve Transaction Revenue from Hits**

   ```sql
   SELECT f.value:VARIANT:"transaction":VARIANT:"transactionRevenue"::INTEGER AS "transactionRevenue"
   FROM GA360.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SAMPLE.GA_SESSIONS_20170101 t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."hits") f
   WHERE f.value:VARIANT:"transaction":VARIANT:"transactionRevenue" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Get Product Names from Hits**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.value:VARIANT:"productName"::STRING AS "productName"
   FROM GA360.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SAMPLE.GA_SESSIONS_20170101 t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."hits") h,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => h.value:VARIANT:"product") p
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Get Product Revenues from Hits**

   ```sql
   SELECT p.value:VARIANT:"productRevenue"::INTEGER AS "productRevenue"
   FROM GA360.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SAMPLE.GA_SESSIONS_20170101 t,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."hits") h,
   LATERAL FLATTEN(input => h.value:VARIANT:"product") p
   WHERE p.value:VARIANT:"productRevenue" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **List Unique Full Visitor IDs**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT t."fullVisitorId"
   FROM GA360.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SAMPLE.GA_SESSIONS_20170101 t
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Retrieve Session-Level Transaction Revenue**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."totals":VARIANT:"transactionRevenue"::INTEGER AS "sessionTransactionRevenue"
   FROM GA360.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SAMPLE.GA_SESSIONS_20170101 t
   WHERE t."totals":VARIANT:"transactionRevenue" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Get Channel Grouping Information**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT t."channelGrouping"
    FROM GA360.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SAMPLE.GA_SESSIONS_20170101 t
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

Each of these queries helps to understand the structure and contents of the relevant columns:

- Queries 1–3 explore the session-level data such as date, traffic source, and medium.
- Queries 4–7 delve into hit-level data, extracting hit numbers, transaction revenue, product names, and product revenues.
- Queries 8–9 examine user identifiers and session-level transaction revenues.
- Query 10 looks at how sessions are categorized into channel groupings.

**Note:** Replace `GA_SESSIONS_20170101` with other table names (e.g., `GA_SESSIONS_20170201`, `GA_SESSIONS_20170301`, etc.) to explore data from other dates within the first half of 2017.

Task: What's the maximum monthly, weekly, and daily product revenues (in millions) generated by the top-performing traffic source in the first half of 2017?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
TimePeriod,MaximumProductRevenue(millions)
Monthly,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
Weekly,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
Daily,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
```

The maximum monthly, weekly, and daily product revenues (in millions) represent the highest revenues generated by the top-performing traffic source in the first half of 2017..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-18 04:36:29 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What's the maximum monthly, weekly, and daily product revenues (in millions) generated by the top-performing traffic source in the first half of 2017?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
TimePeriod,MaximumProductRevenue(millions)
Monthly,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
Weekly,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
Daily,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
```

The maximum monthly, weekly, and daily product revenues (in millions) represent the highest revenues generated by the top-performing traffic source in the first half of 2017. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-18 04:38:38 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What's the maximum monthly, weekly, and daily product revenues (in millions) generated by the top-performing traffic source in the first half of 2017?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
TimePeriod,MaximumProductRevenue(millions)
Monthly,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
Weekly,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
Daily,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
```

The maximum monthly, weekly, and daily product revenues (in millions) represent the highest revenues generated by the top-performing traffic source in the first half of 2017. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table.

2025-01-18 04:45:14 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What's the maximum monthly, weekly, and daily product revenues (in millions) generated by the top-performing traffic source in the first half of 2017?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
TimePeriod,MaximumProductRevenue(millions)
Monthly,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
Weekly,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
Daily,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
```

The maximum monthly, weekly, and daily product revenues (in millions) represent the highest revenues generated by the top-performing traffic source in the first half of 2017. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
Current snswer: 
TimePeriod,MaximumProductRevenue(millions)

When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

2025-01-18 04:49:09 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What's the maximum monthly, weekly, and daily product revenues (in millions) generated by the top-performing traffic source in the first half of 2017?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
TimePeriod,MaximumProductRevenue(millions)
Monthly,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
Weekly,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
Daily,value:float (Attention: answer in one row)
```

The maximum monthly, weekly, and daily product revenues (in millions) represent the highest revenues generated by the top-performing traffic source in the first half of 2017. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
Current snswer:
