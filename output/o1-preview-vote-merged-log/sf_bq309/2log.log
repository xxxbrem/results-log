This SQL query selects the top 10 longest questions from the `POSTS_QUESTIONS` table where each question either has an accepted answer or has at least one answer with a score-to-view ratio greater than 0.01. It joins the `USERS` table to retrieve the user's reputation and net votes (calculated as up_votes minus down_votes), and left joins a subquery counting badges from the `BADGES` table to include the badge count for each user.

The query results will include the following columns:

- **Question_ID**: The unique identifier of the question.
- **Question_Title**: The title of the question.
- **Question_Length**: The length of the question's body in characters.
- **User_Reputation**: The reputation score of the user who asked the question.
- **Net_Votes**: The user's net votes (up_votes - down_votes).
- **Badge_Count**: The total number of badges the user has earned.

Consider the following columns and their potential usage:

- `"id"` from `STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.POSTS_QUESTIONS`: Question identifier
- `"title"` from `STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.POSTS_QUESTIONS`: Question title
- `"body"` from `STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.POSTS_QUESTIONS`: To determine the length of the question
- `"accepted_answer_id"` from `STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.POSTS_QUESTIONS`: Indicates if the question has an accepted answer
- `"owner_user_id"` from `STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.POSTS_QUESTIONS`: To link to the user who asked the question
- `"reputation"` from `STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.USERS`: User's reputation
- `"up_votes"` and `"down_votes"` from `STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.USERS`: To calculate net votes
- `"user_id"` from `STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.BADGES`: To link badges to users
- `"score"` and `"parent_id"` from `STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.POSTS_ANSWERS`: Answer's score and corresponding question ID
- `"view_count"` from `STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW.POSTS_QUESTIONS`: Number of views on the question

Potential conditions:

- Questions with an accepted answer (`"accepted_answer_id"` is not null)
- Answers with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01
- Calculating the length of the question body
- Computing user net votes (`"up_votes"` - `"down_votes"`)
- Counting the number of badges per user

Here are 10 SQL queries:

```sql

```sql
-- 3. Select users and calculate their net votes
SELECT "id", "up_votes", "down_votes", ("up_votes" - "down_votes") AS "net_votes"
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."USERS"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 4. Count badges per user
SELECT "user_id", COUNT(*) AS "badge_count"
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."BADGES"
GROUP BY "user_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 5. Select answers with their scores and parent question IDs
SELECT "id" AS "answer_id", "parent_id", "score"
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_ANSWERS"

FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_ANSWERS" a
JOIN STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS" q
ON a."parent_id" = q."id"
WHERE q."view_count" > 0

SELECT q."id", q."title", u."reputation"
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS" q
JOIN STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."USERS" u
ON q."owner_user_id" = u."id"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 8. Select questions with the length of their bodies, ordered by length descending
SELECT "id", LENGTH("body") AS "body_length"
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"
ORDER BY LENGTH("body") DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 9. Select distinct badge names awarded to users
SELECT DISTINCT "name"
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."BADGES"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
-- 10. Select questions with accepted answers and their body lengths
SELECT "id", LENGTH("body") AS "body_length"
FROM STACKOVERFLOW.STACKOVERFLOW."POSTS_QUESTIONS"

Task: Show the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions where the question has an accepted answer or an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01, including the user's reputation, net votes, and badge count.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To find the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions that either have an accepted answer or have an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01, we consider the length of each question's body. We then retrieve the user's reputation, net votes (calculated as up_votes minus down_votes), and the total badge count for each question's author.

The resulting table includes the following columns:
- **Question_ID**: The unique identifier of the question.
- **Question_Title**: The title of the question.
- **Question_Length**: The length of the question's body in characters.
- **User_Reputation**: The reputation score of the user who asked the question.
- **Net_Votes**: The user's net votes (up_votes - down_votes).
- **Badge_Count**: The total number of badges the user has earned.

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKOVERFLOW': {'STACKOVERFLOW': ['BADGES', 'COMMENTS', 'POSTS_ANSWERS', 'POSTS_MODERATOR_NOMINATION', 'POSTS_ORPHANED_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_PRIVILEGE_WIKI', 'POSTS_QUESTIONS', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI', 'POSTS_TAG_WIKI_EXCERPT', 'POSTS_WIKI_PLACEHOLDER', 'POST_HISTORY', 'POST_LINKS', 'STACKOVERFLOW_POSTS', 'TAGS', 'USERS', 'VOTES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-22 22:43:47 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Show the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions where the question has an accepted answer or an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01, including the user's reputation, net votes, and badge count., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To find the top 10 longest Stack Overflow questions that either have an accepted answer or have an answer with a score-to-view ratio above 0.01, we consider the length of each question's body. We then retrieve the user's reputation, net votes (calculated as up_votes minus down_votes), and the total badge count for each question's author.

The resulting table includes the following columns:
- **Question_ID**: The unique identifier of the question.
- **Question_Title**: The title of the question.
- **Question_Length**: The length of the question's body in characters.
- **User_Reputation**: The reputation score of the user who asked the question.
- **Net_Votes**: The user's net votes (up_votes - down_votes).
- **Badge_Count**: The total number of badges the user has earned.

2025-01-22 22:45:37 - root - INFO - To address the `invalid identifier 'USER_ID'` error, we need to ensure that all column names are correctly referenced with the proper case and quotations. In Snowflake, column names are case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes.
