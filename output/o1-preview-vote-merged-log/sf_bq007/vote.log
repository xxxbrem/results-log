After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **Candidate 2 (`2result.sql`)** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Accurate Use of Employment Columns:**
   - **Candidate 2** correctly uses the `"occupation_natural_resources_construction_maintenance"` column in the calculation of the vulnerable population with its corresponding weight of `0.48071410777129553`.
   - **Candidate 1** incorrectly uses the `"employed_construction"` column instead, which does not align with the specified employment sectors outlined in the task.

2. **Aggregation of Median Income Change:**
   - **Candidate 2** calculates the average median income change by aggregating median incomes from the ZIP code level up to the state level. This method provides a more granular and accurate reflection of income changes across all ZIP codes within each state.
   - **Candidate 0** computes the median income change directly at the state level using state-level data from 2015 and 2018, which may not capture variations within states and does not align with the instruction to use ZIP code data.

3. **Alignment with Task Requirements:**
   - The task specifies using ZIP code data to determine median income changes and aggregating this information to the state level. **Candidate 2** follows this instruction precisely.
   - The vulnerable population is calculated based on the weighted sum of specific employment sectors as per the provided weights, which **Candidate 2** implements correctly.

4. **Consistency in Results:**
   - The results from **Candidate 2** show the vulnerable population and median income change values consistent with expectations based on the data and calculations.

**Conclusion:**

Candidate 2's SQL query aligns accurately with the task requirements, correctly utilizes the specified employment columns and weights, and appropriately calculates the average median income change using ZIP code data aggregated to the state level.
