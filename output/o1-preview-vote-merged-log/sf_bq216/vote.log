After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL file is `2result.sql`.

**Reason:**

- **Completeness:** The query in `2result.sql` correctly retrieves the **top five** patents filed in the same year as `US-9741766-B2`, based on technological similarities. It returns five publication numbers, as required by the task.

- **Accuracy:** It accurately computes the similarity by calculating the dot product between the embedding vectors of `US-9741766-B2` and other patents filed in the same year, excluding `US-9741766-B2` itself.

- **Logic:** The SQL logic properly filters the patents filed in the same year, ensures that embeddings are available, flattens the embeddings for computation, and ranks the patents based on the computed similarity scores.
