After reviewing both SQL scripts and their results, I conclude that **2result.sql** is the correct script.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Realistic Result:**
   - The result from **2result.sql** is **1.7204%**, which is a plausible percentage of new users who met both criteria.
   - In contrast, **1result.sql** yields a result of **100.0%**, which is unrealistic and indicates a flaw in the SQL logic.

2. **Correct Logic Implementation in 2result.sql:**
   - **Total New Users:** It correctly identifies all new users between August 1, 2016, and April 30, 2017.
   - **Initial Long Visits:** It selects new users whose initial visit lasted more than 5 minutes.
   - **Subsequent Purchasers:** It accurately identifies users who made a purchase in any visit after their initial one.
   - **Users Who Met Both Criteria:** It correctly finds the intersection of users who had initial long visits and made subsequent purchases.
   - **Percentage Calculation:** It divides the number of users who met both criteria by the total number of new users, providing an accurate percentage.

3. **Flaw in 1result.sql:**
   - **Incorrect JOIN Logic:** The script joins the total new users, initial long visit users, and purchasers using inner joins, which results in only users who met both criteria being counted in both the numerator and the denominator.
   - **Resulting in 100%:** This flawed logic leads to the numerator and denominator being the same, hence a percentage of 100%, which is incorrect.

Therefore, **2result.sql** correctly calculates the required percentage and should be chosen as the correct answer.
