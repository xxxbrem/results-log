```plain
2result.sql
```

**Reason:**

The SQL query in `2result.sql` is the correct one because it accurately calculates the total points scored by each driver and constructor for each year by considering both regular race results and sprint race results. This query includes points from both the `RESULTS` and `SPRINT_RESULTS` tables, ensuring that all points contributing to the championship standings are accounted for. Sprint races have been a part of Formula 1 since 2021, and their results impact the total points tallied by drivers and constructors. By incorporating sprint race points, `2result.sql` provides a comprehensive and accurate representation of the season standings, making it the correct choice among the provided SQL scripts.
