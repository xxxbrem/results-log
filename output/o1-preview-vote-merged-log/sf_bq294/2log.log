2025-01-21 08:37:03 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates a data type mismatch:

```
100038 (22018): Numeric value '2017-07-01' is not recognized
```

This happens because the `"start_date"` column in the `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` table is stored as a **numeric timestamp** in **microseconds since the Unix epoch** (January 1, 1970), not as a date string. When you compare this numeric value to a string date like `'2017-07-01'`, it results in an error.

**To fix this issue, you need to convert the numeric timestamp to a date format before performing the comparison.**

Here's how you can modify your query:

1. **Convert the numeric `"start_date"` to a timestamp:**

   Use the `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ()` function to convert the microseconds timestamp to a proper date/time format. Since the timestamps are in microseconds, you need to divide by **1,000,000** to convert to seconds.

2. **Compare the converted timestamp with your desired date range:**

   Now you can compare the timestamp with the date strings.

**Revised SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "trip_id",
       "duration_sec",
       TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("start_date" / 1e6) AS "start_date",
       "start_station_name",
       "end_station_name"
FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("start_date" / 1e6) BETWEEN '2017-07-01' AND '2017-12-31'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("start_date" / 1e6)` converts the numeric microsecond timestamp to a timestamp without time zone.
- The `WHERE` clause now correctly compares the timestamps.

**Alternatively**, you can calculate the microsecond equivalents of your date range and compare the numeric values directly:

```sql
-- Calculate microsecond timestamps for the date range
-- '2017-07-01' in microseconds since epoch: 1498867200000000
-- '2017-12-31' in microseconds since epoch: 1514678400000000

SELECT "trip_id",
       "duration_sec",
       "start_date",
       "start_station_name",
       "end_station_name"
FROM SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS
WHERE "start_date" BETWEEN 1498867200000000 AND 1514678400000000
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:**

- Using the numeric comparison might be more efficient since it avoids the function call in the `WHERE` clause.

---

By adjusting your query as shown, you should be able to retrieve the desired records without encountering the data type mismatch error.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS`
   - `"trip_id"`: Used to uniquely identify each bike share trip.
   - `"duration_sec"`: Duration of the trip in seconds; used to find the longest trips.
   - `"start_date"`: Date when the trip started; used to filter trips starting in the second half of 2017.
   - `"start_station_name"`: Name of the start station; needed for the report and to exclude trips without this information.
   - `"end_station_name"`: Name of the end station; used to construct the route (start to end station).
   - `"bike_number"`: Identifier for the bike used; included in the report.
   - `"subscriber_type"`: Type of subscriber (e.g., Customer, Subscriber); included in the report.
   - `"member_birth_year"`: Birth year of the member; used to calculate current age and classify age group.
   - `"member_gender"`: Gender of the member; included in the report.
   - `"start_station_id"`: Identifier for the start station; used to join with station info to get region.
   
2. **Table:** `SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO`
   - `"station_id"`: Unique identifier for the station; used to join with trips.
   - `"name"`: Name of the station; cross-verification with `"start_station_name"`.
   - `"region_id"`: Identifier for the region; used to get the region name.

3. **Table:** `SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS.SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_REGIONS`
   - `"region_id"`: Identifier for the region; used to join with station info.
   - `"name"`: Name of the region; included in the report.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Trips where `"start_date"` is between '2017-07-01' and '2017-12-31' to focus on the second half of 2017.
- Exclude trips where `"start_station_name"`, `"member_birth_year"`, or `"member_gender"` is NULL.
- Use `"duration_sec"` to identify the top 5 longest trips.
- Calculate current age as the difference between the current year and `"member_birth_year"`.
- Classify age groups based on current age:
  - Age < 40: 'Young (<40 Y.O)'
  - 40 ≤ Age ≤ 60: 'Adult (40-60 Y.O)'
  - Age > 60: 'Senior Adult (>60 Y.O)'

These queries:

- Retrieve distinct values to understand the data in columns like `"start_station_name"`, `"subscriber_type"`, and `"member_gender"`.
- Filter trips based on the date range specified.
- Exclude trips with missing essential information.
- Join tables to get additional details like the region name.
- Calculate the current age and classify riders into age groups.
- Identify the top 5 longest trips using the `ORDER BY` clause.

---

By executing these queries, we can gain insights into the data and prepare to provide the detailed report as requested. The final query (number 14) is particularly relevant, as it gathers all necessary information, applies the required conditions, and limits the results to the top 5 longest trips.Query:

Task: Can you provide the details of the top 5 longest bike share trips that started during the second half of 2017, including the trip ID, duration in seconds, start date, start station name, route (start station to end station), bike number, subscriber type, member's birth year, current age, age classification, gender, and the region name of the start station? Please exclude trips where the start station name, member's birth year, or member's gender is not specified.

Here are the details of the top 5 longest bike share trips that started during the second half of 2017, excluding trips where the start station name, member's birth year, or member's gender is not specified. The data includes trip ID, duration in seconds, start date (between July 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017), start station name, route (from start station to end station), bike number, subscriber type, member's birth year, current age, age classification (based on the age criteria provided), gender, and the region name of the start station..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'SAN_FRANCISCO_PLUS': {'SAN_FRANCISCO_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_REGIONS', 'BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO', 'BIKESHARE_STATION_STATUS', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_FILM_LOCATIONS': ['FILM_LOCATIONS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_NEIGHBORHOODS': ['BOUNDARIES'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_SFFD_SERVICE_CALLS': ['SFFD_SERVICE_CALLS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_SFPD_INCIDENTS': ['SFPD_INCIDENTS'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_TRANSIT_MUNI': ['CALENDAR', 'FARES', 'ROUTES', 'SHAPES', 'STOPS', 'STOP_MONITORING', 'STOP_TIMES', 'TRIPS', 'VEHICLE_MONITORING'], 'SAN_FRANCISCO_TREES': ['STREET_TREES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
