After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

1. **Age Calculation:**
   - **`1result.sql`** calculates the current age by subtracting the member's birth year from the year of the trip start date:
     ```sql
     EXTRACT(year FROM DATE_TRUNC('day', TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."start_date" / 1000000))) - t."member_birth_year" AS "Current age"
     ```
     This provides the member's age at the time of the trip, which is appropriate since the trips occurred during the second half of 2017.
   - **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** subtract the birth year from 2023 (the assumed current year), which gives the age as of 2023, not at the time of the trip.

2. **Compliance with Requirements:**
   - **`1result.sql`** correctly filters trips that started between `'2017-07-01'` and `'2017-12-31'` and includes the necessary conditions to exclude trips without specified start station name, member's birth year, or member's gender.
   - It also orders the results by the longest duration and limits the output to the top 5 trips, as required.

3. **Data Accuracy:**
   - The results in **`1result.csv`** show the correct current ages corresponding to the trip dates in 2017, matching the expected ages of the members during that time.

**Therefore,** **`1result.sql`** is the most appropriate query that fulfills all the task requirements.
