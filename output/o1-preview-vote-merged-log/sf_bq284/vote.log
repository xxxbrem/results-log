After comparing both SQL queries, I conclude that `0result.sql` is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Query in `0result.sql`:** This query counts articles that mention "education" in either the **body** or the **title** of the articles. It uses the condition:

  ```sql
  ("body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%')
  ```

  This means it captures all articles where "education" is mentioned anywhere in the article content, providing a more comprehensive analysis.

- **Query in `2result.sql`:** This query counts only those articles that mention "education" in the **body** of the articles. It uses the condition:

  ```sql
  "body" ILIKE '%education%'
  ```

  This excludes articles that mention "education" only in the title but not in the body.

Since the task is to **provide a breakdown of the total number of articles into different categories and the percentage of those articles that mention "education" within each category**, considering mentions in both the **title** and **body** offers a more thorough and accurate representation.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
