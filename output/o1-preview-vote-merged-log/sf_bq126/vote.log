After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL to answer the task. Here's the reasoning:

- **Correctness**: All three SQL queries retrieve the necessary fields (`title`, `artist_display_name`, `medium`, `original_image_url`) from the joined `OBJECTS` and `IMAGES` tables, and apply the specified filters:
  - Objects with 'Photograph' in their names (`o."object_name" ILIKE '%Photograph%'`)
  - From the 'Photographs' department (`o."department" = 'Photographs'`)
  - With known artists (`o."artist_display_name" IS NOT NULL AND o."artist_display_name" != 'Unknown'`)
  - With an end date of 1839 or earlier (`o."object_end_date" <= 1839`)
- **Clarity and Syntax**: The SQL in `2result.sql` is concise and follows standard SQL syntax without unnecessary quotation marks or aliases, making it cleaner and more readable.

Therefore, the **`2result.sql`** is the best choice.
