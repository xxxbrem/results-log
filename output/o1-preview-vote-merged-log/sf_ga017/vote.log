After comparing the three SQL queries, the correct query is:

```plaintext
2result.sql```

**Reasoning:**

- **1result.sql** assumes that the most frequently visited page is `'Home'` without verifying it from the data. While `'Home'` appears to be the most visited page based on earlier queries, directly using it without confirmation may lead to incorrect results if the data changes. Therefore, this query could potentially produce inaccurate results.

- **0result.sql** and **2result.sql** both dynamically identify the most frequently visited page during January 2021 by aggregating page views and then compute the number of distinct users who viewed that page. This ensures accuracy even if the data changes.

- Between **0result.sql** and **2result.sql**, both queries produce the same correct result (`37165` distinct users). However, **2result.sql** is better structured and more readable due to the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs). It separates the logic into clearer sections: first, it combines all events into `all_events`, then it determines the most visited page, and finally, it counts the distinct users who viewed that page. This improves maintainability and understanding of the query.

Therefore, **2result.sql** is the correct and preferred query to accurately determine the number of distinct users who viewed the most frequently visited page during January 2021.
