**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `"MODEL"`
  - **"L1_model"**: Model category.
    - *Potential usage*: Identify and count occurrences of each model category.
  - **"name"**: Name identifier.
    - *Potential usage*: Differentiate models if necessary.
  - **"version"**: Version number.
    - *Potential usage*: Ensure all versions are considered.
  - **"step"**: Modeling step.
    - *Potential usage*: Include all steps in the analysis.

**Conditions:**

- Compare traditional models to the Stack model.
  - *Condition*: Distinguish between traditional models and the Stack model based on the values in the `"L1_model"` column.
  
---

**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **Retrieve a sample of all records from the `MODEL` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **List all distinct model categories (`L1_model`):**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "L1_model" FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Count the total occurrences of each `L1_model`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Total_Count"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   GROUP BY "L1_model"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Display `L1_model` counts in descending order:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Total_Count"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   GROUP BY "L1_model"
   ORDER BY "Total_Count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find all records where `L1_model` is the Stack model:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   WHERE "L1_model" = 'Stack'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find all records of traditional models (excluding the Stack model):**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   WHERE "L1_model" <> 'Stack'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Count the number of times the Stack model appears:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Stack_Model_Count" FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   WHERE "L1_model" = 'Stack';
   ```

8. **Count occurrences of each traditional model category:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Total_Count"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   WHERE "L1_model" <> 'Stack'
   GROUP BY "L1_model"
   ORDER BY "Total_Count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List unique combinations of `name`, `version`, `step`, and `L1_model`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "name", "version", "step", "L1_model"
   FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Count total records for each `L1_model` across all versions and steps:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Total_Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Compare total counts of traditional models versus the Stack model:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      CASE WHEN "L1_model" = 'Stack' THEN 'Stack' ELSE 'Traditional' END AS "Model_Type",
      COUNT(*) AS "Total_Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    GROUP BY "Model_Type"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Get versions and steps where the most frequent `L1_model` appears:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "version", "step", COUNT(*) AS "Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    WHERE "L1_model" = (
      SELECT "L1_model" FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
      GROUP BY "L1_model"
      ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
      LIMIT 1
    )
    GROUP BY "version", "step"
    ORDER BY "Count" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Identify the top three most frequent traditional models:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "L1_model", COUNT(*) AS "Total_Count"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    WHERE "L1_model" <> 'Stack'
    GROUP BY "L1_model"
    ORDER BY "Total_Count" DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

14. **Find all steps and versions where traditional models are used:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "version", "step", "L1_model"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    WHERE "L1_model" <> 'Stack'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Count how many different models are used at each step:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "step", COUNT(DISTINCT "L1_model") AS "Model_Variety"
    FROM "STACKING"."STACKING"."MODEL"
    GROUP BY "step"
    ORDER BY "step"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries will help in understanding the distribution and frequency of different model categories (`L1_model`) across all steps and versions in the `MODEL` table, which is essential for determining which model appears most frequently when comparing traditional models to the Stack model.Query:

Task: Which model category (L1_model) appears the most frequently across all steps and versions when comparing traditional models to the Stack model, and what is the total count of its occurrences?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
L1_model,Total_Count
model_name:str,count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To identify the model category (`L1_model`) that appears most frequently across all steps and versions, we count the number of occurrences of each `L1_model` in the `MODEL` table. The one with the highest total count is the most frequently appearing model category..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'STACKING': {'STACKING': ['EDA', 'FEATURE_IMPORTANCE', 'MODEL', 'MODEL_IMPORTANCE', 'MODEL_SCORE', 'PROBLEM', 'SOLUTION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
L1_model,Total_Count
model_name:str,count:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

To identify the model category (`L1_model`) that appears most frequently across all steps and versions, we count the number of occurrences of each `L1_model` in the `MODEL` table. The one with the highest total count is the most frequently appearing model category. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
