2result.sql
```

I chose **2result.sql** as the correct SQL because it accurately calculates the average **annual wages** by converting the average weekly wages to annual figures (multiplying by 52). This approach ensures we are comparing **annual wage growth** with **annual inflation rates**, which is appropriate for evaluating whether wages kept pace with inflation over the period.

Additionally, **2result.sql** uses the **`item_code` = 'SA0'** in the CPI data, which specifically represents the **'All items'** index. This is more precise than filtering by `"item_name" = 'All items'` because it directly references the standard code used for the overall CPI.

The growth rates calculated are:

- **Wage Growth Rate:** 76.3%
- **Inflation Rate:** 49.57%

These calculations show that the average annual wages in Allegheny County, Pittsburgh, increased by **76.3%** between 1998 and 2017, while the overall inflation rate was **49.57%** during the same period. Therefore, wages grew faster than inflation, indicating that they did indeed keep pace with, and exceeded, inflation over these years.
