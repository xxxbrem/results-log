After comparing the SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Correct Date Field:** `1result.sql` uses the `order_delivered_customer_date` to calculate delivered orders, which aligns with the task's focus on delivered orders volume.
- **Proper Filtering:**
  - Filters orders where `order_status` is `'delivered'`.
  - Ensures `order_delivered_customer_date` is not null or empty.
  - Extracts the year and month from `order_delivered_customer_date` to group orders accurately.
- **Identifying the Year with Lowest Volume:**
  - Calculates annual delivered orders for 2016, 2017, and 2018.
  - Correctly identifies **2016** as the year with the lowest annual delivered orders volume.
- **Calculating Highest Monthly Volume:**
  - Groups orders by month within 2016.
  - Finds that **October 2016** had the highest monthly delivered orders volume, totaling **205 orders**.

**Why the Others Are Incorrect:**

- **`0result.sql`:**
  - While it uses the correct date field, the output shows the month as `'Octth'`, which is not a standard or expected format. This suggests an issue with the date formatting in the query.
- **`2result.sql`:**
  - Uses `order_purchase_timestamp` instead of `order_delivered_customer_date`. The task focuses on delivered orders, so the delivery date is the appropriate field to use.
  - Provides a delivered orders volume of **265** for October 2016, which exceeds the total annual orders for 2016 (267), indicating a possible overcount due to using the purchase date.

Therefore, the correct SQL script is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
