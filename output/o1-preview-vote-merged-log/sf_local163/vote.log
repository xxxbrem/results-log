After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, `2result.sql` is the correct and most effective query. Here's the reasoning:

- **Correctness**: All three queries aim to find faculty members whose salaries are closest to the average salary of their respective ranks. They all produce the correct results for the given data set.
  
- **Efficiency and Elegance**:
  - `2result.sql` utilizes the `DENSE_RANK()` window function, which efficiently assigns ranks to faculty members based on the absolute difference between their salary and the average salary for their rank. This approach naturally handles ties by assigning the same rank to equal differences, ensuring all faculty members with the minimal difference are included.
  - In contrast, `0result.sql` and `1result.sql` use subqueries and joins to achieve the same result. While they are correct, the use of multiple subqueries can be less efficient and harder to read, especially with larger data sets.

- **Handling of Ties**: The use of `DENSE_RANK()` in `2result.sql` ensures that all faculty members who share the minimal salary difference within their rank are retrieved. This is particularly important in cases where multiple faculty members have salaries equally close to the average.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
