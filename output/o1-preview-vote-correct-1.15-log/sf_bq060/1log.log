**Relevant tables and columns:**

- **COUNTRY_NAMES_AREA**
  - `"country_code"`: Used for joining with other tables.
  - `"country_name"`: Used for displaying country names.
  - `"country_area"`: Used to filter countries with an area greater than 500 square kilometers.

- **BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES**
  - `"country_code"`: Used for joining with other tables.
  - `"country_name"`: Can be used for joining if needed.
  - `"year"`: Used to filter data for the year 2017.
  - `"net_migration"`: Used to find the net migration rates for each country.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `"country_area" > 500`
- `"year" = 2017`
- `"net_migration"` (to order and find the highest rates)

Task: Which top 3 countries had the highest net migration in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers? And what are their migration rates?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: The top 3 countries with the highest net migration rates in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers are:

```csv
country_name,net_migration_rate
country_name:str (area > 500 sq km), net_migration_rate: float (>0) (highest)
country_name:str (area > 500 sq km), net_migration_rate: float (>0) (second highest)
country_name:str (area > 500 sq km), net_migration_rate: float (>0) (third highest)
```

**Explanation:**

- **country_name**: The name of the country with an area greater than 500 square kilometers.
- **net_migration_rate**: A positive float representing the net number of migrants per 1,000 population in 2017. The first country has the highest net migration rate, followed by the second and third highest.

These countries are identified by filtering the countries with an area greater than 500 square kilometers from the `COUNTRY_NAMES_AREA` table and then selecting the top three with the highest net migration rates from the `BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES` table for the year 2017..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
Please refrain from adding any conditions that are not explicitly specified in the task.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL': {'CENSUS_BUREAU_INTERNATIONAL': ['AGE_SPECIFIC_FERTILITY_RATES', 'BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES', 'COUNTRY_NAMES_AREA', 'MIDYEAR_POPULATION', 'MIDYEAR_POPULATION_5YR_AGE_SEX', 'MIDYEAR_POPULATION_AGESPECIFIC', 'MIDYEAR_POPULATION_AGE_SEX', 'MORTALITY_LIFE_EXPECTANCY']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
Be careful one country may have different names in different columns in a database.
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
Be careful of information in nested JSON columns. e.g.1. When it comes to active users, it refers to has engagement_time_msec parameter rather than directly counting users. So the right query is: SELECT DISTINCT USER_PSEUDO_ID FROM all_user_activity, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => event_params) AS flattened_params WHERE flattened_params.value:key = 'engagement_time_msec'
e.g. When it comes to top-selling product, you should pay attention to hits2.value:"eCommerceAction":"action_type"::INTEGER = 6 where 6 means sold product.
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When counting for rows of a column, ensure they are distinct: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT col_name) FROM table;
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-16 00:14:43 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which top 3 countries had the highest net migration in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers? And what are their migration rates?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: The top 3 countries with the highest net migration rates in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers are:

```csv
country_name,net_migration_rate
country_name:str (area > 500 sq km), net_migration_rate: float (>0) (highest)
country_name:str (area > 500 sq km), net_migration_rate: float (>0) (second highest)
country_name:str (area > 500 sq km), net_migration_rate: float (>0) (third highest)
```

**Explanation:**

- **country_name**: The name of the country with an area greater than 500 square kilometers.
- **net_migration_rate**: A positive float representing the net number of migrants per 1,000 population in 2017. The first country has the highest net migration rate, followed by the second and third highest.

These countries are identified by filtering the countries with an area greater than 500 square kilometers from the `COUNTRY_NAMES_AREA` table and then selecting the top three with the highest net migration rates from the `BIRTH_DEATH_GROWTH_RATES` table for the year 2017. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
