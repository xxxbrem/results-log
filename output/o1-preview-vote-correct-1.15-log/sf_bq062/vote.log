After comparing both SQL queries, I have determined that **2result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

Both queries aim to find the most frequently used license by packages in each system. However, the second SQL (`2result.sql`) includes an additional condition in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
WHERE
    l.value::STRING IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(l.value::STRING) != ''
```

This ensures that both `NULL` and empty string values are excluded from the results, leading to a more accurate count of valid licenses. The first SQL (`1result.sql`) only checks for `NULL` values and may include empty strings, potentially skewing the results.

The second SQL provides a more precise solution by filtering out invalid license entries, making it the correct choice.

**Chosen SQL:**

```plain
2result.sql
```
