Between the two SQL queries provided, I choose **`2result.sql`** as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Excludes NULL Licenses:** The second SQL query includes a `WHERE` clause (`WHERE f.value IS NOT NULL`) within the subquery. This ensures that only packages with valid, non-NULL license values are considered when counting the occurrences of each license. This is important because packages without a license (`NULL` values) should not contribute to the frequency count of licenses.

- **Accurate Results:** By filtering out `NULL` license entries, the query accurately identifies the most frequently used license by packages in each system, based solely on valid license data.

- **Consistent with Task Requirements:** The task aims to find the most frequently used **license** by packages, implying that packages without a license should not be considered in the frequency calculation. The second query fulfills this requirement.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plain
2result.sql
```
