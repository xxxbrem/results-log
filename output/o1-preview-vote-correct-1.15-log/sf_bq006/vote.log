After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Accurate Filtering of Data:**
   - **`1result.sql`** uses the condition `WHERE "descript" = 'PUBLIC INTOXICATION'`, which precisely filters records where the description exactly matches 'PUBLIC INTOXICATION'.
   - The other queries either use a `LIKE` operator with '%' wildcards or may include unnecessary variations, but since the only relevant description is 'PUBLIC INTOXICATION', an exact match is appropriate.

2. **Proper Calculation of Standard Deviation:**
   - **`1result.sql`** utilizes `STDDEV_SAMP("incident_count")` to calculate the sample standard deviation, which is statistically correct for sample data.
   - **`2result.sql`** uses `STDDEV("incident_count")`, which may calculate the population standard deviation depending on the database system, potentially leading to incorrect Z-scores.

3. **Rounding of Z-Scores:**
   - The query in **`1result.sql`** includes `ROUND(..., 4)` to round the Z-scores to four decimal places, complying with the requirement to ensure float values are rounded accordingly.

4. **Query Structure and Clarity:**
   - **`1result.sql`** employs Common Table Expressions (CTEs) using `WITH` clauses, enhancing readability and maintainability of the SQL code.
   - It logically separates the calculation steps into `daily_counts`, `stats`, and `z_scores`, making the computation process clear.

5. **Consistent Results:**
   - All three queries return the date `2016-03-13` as the date with the second highest Z-score. However, due to the reasons above, **`1result.sql`** provides the most accurate and reliable approach.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plain
1result.sql
```
