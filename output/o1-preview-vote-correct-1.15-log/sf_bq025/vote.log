After reviewing the SQL queries and their outputs, **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Floating-Point Division:** In `1result.sql`, the numerator `total_population_under_20` is explicitly cast to `FLOAT` using `::FLOAT`. This ensures that the division operation performs floating-point division rather than integer division. This is crucial for accurate percentage calculations.

  ```sql
  ROUND((under20."total_population_under_20"::FLOAT / total."midyear_population") * 100, 4) AS "percentage_under_20"
  ```

- **Consistency and Accuracy:** Although all three SQL queries aim to compute the same result and their outputs appear similar, explicitly casting to `FLOAT` prevents potential issues with integer division that could arise depending on the SQL engine's handling of numeric data types.

- **Rounding Precision:** The percentages in `1result.sql` are rounded to 4 decimal places as specified, ensuring consistency with the requirement.

**Conclusion:**
`1result.sql` provides the most accurate and reliable calculation by explicitly handling data types to prevent integer division errors.
