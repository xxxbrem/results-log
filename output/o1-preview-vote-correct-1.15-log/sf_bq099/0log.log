2025-01-16 07:20:38 - root - INFO - Based on the analysis for patent class A01B3, here are the top 3 assignees:

```csv
assignee_name,total_applications,year_with_most_applications,applications_in_that_year,country_code_with_most_applications_during_that_year
"Deere & Company",77,year:int > 0,num:int > 0,country_code:str
"Cnh Industrial America Llc",47,year:int > 0,num:int > 0,country_code:str
"Agsoilworks Tech Company Llc",29,year:int > 0,num:int > 0,country_code:str
```

**Explanation:**

- `assignee_name`: The name of the assignee (string).
- `total_applications`: Total number of applications filed by the assignee in patent class A01B3 (integer greater than 0).
- `year_with_most_applications`: The year in which the assignee filed the most applications (integer representing a year).
- `applications_in_that_year`: Number of applications filed by the assignee in that year (integer greater than 0).
- `country_code_with_most_applications_during_that_year`: The country code where the most applications were filed by the assignee during that year (string).

**Note:** The values for `year_with_most_applications`, `applications_in_that_year`, and `country_code_with_most_applications_during_that_year` cannot be inferred directly from the provided data. Therefore, metanames indicating their data types and conditions have been used.

**Brief Explanation:**

The table lists the top 3 assignees in patent class A01B3 based on the total number of applications. For each assignee, it provides:

- The total number of applications they have filed.
- The year in which they filed the most applications.
- The number of applications filed in that year.
- The country code where they filed the most applications during that peak year.

These insights help in understanding the key players and trends within the specific patent class A01B3.

**Explanation:**

The table provides the requested information for the top 3 assignees in patent class **A01B3** based on the total number of applications. Since specific values cannot be inferred directly from the task description or the data provided, we use metanames indicating potential data types and conditions:

- `assignee_name`: The name of the assignee (string).
- `total_applications`: Total number of applications filed by the assignee (integer greater than 0).
- `year_with_most_applications`: The year in which the assignee filed the most applications (integer representing a year greater than 0).
- `applications_in_that_year`: Number of applications filed by the assignee in that year (integer greater than 0).
- `country_code_with_most_applications_during_that_year`: The country code where the assignee filed the most applications during that year (string).

This format aligns with the task requirements, providing a clear structure for the expected data while adhering to the guidelines for cases where specific values are not available.

{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we need to identify the relevant tables, columns, and conditions that will help us extract the required information.

---

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS`
  - **Columns:**
    - `"cpc"` (VARIANT): Contains the CPC (Cooperative Patent Classification) codes for each patent application. We'll use this to filter applications in patent class **`A01B3`**.
    - `"assignee"` (VARIANT): Contains information about the assignees. We'll extract the assignee names from this column.
    - `"assignee_harmonized"` (VARIANT): Contains harmonized assignee names.
    - `"filing_date"` (NUMBER): The date the patent application was filed. We'll extract the year from this date.
    - `"publication_date"` (NUMBER): The date the patent was published.
    - `"country_code"` (VARCHAR): The country code associated with the application.
    - `"application_number"` (VARCHAR): The application number of the patent.
    - `"publication_number"` (VARCHAR): The publication number of the patent.

---

**Potential Usage and Conditions:**

- **Filtering by CPC Code:**
  - We'll use `LATERAL FLATTEN` on the `"cpc"` column to extract CPC codes and filter records where the CPC code starts with `'A01B3'`.
- **Extracting Assignee Names:**
  - Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` on the `"assignee"` column to extract assignee names.
- **Extracting Years:**
  - Extract the year from `"filing_date"` or `"publication_date"` by converting the date to a string and taking the first four characters.
- **Grouping and Counting:**
  - Group by assignee names and years to count the number of applications.
- **Determining Country Codes:**
  - Use the `"country_code"` column to find the country with the most applications during the year with the most applications for each assignee.

---

    ```

15. **List all application numbers in class 'A01B3':**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT t."application_number"
    FROM PATENTS.PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS t,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."cpc") c
    WHERE c.value::STRING LIKE 'A01B3%'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

**Explanation:**

- In these queries, we're using `LATERAL FLATTEN` to extract data from VARIANT columns like `"cpc"`, `"assignee"`, and `"assignee_harmonized"`.
- The `c.value` and `a.value` refer to the elements within these VARIANT arrays or objects.
- We're filtering CPC codes that start with `'A01B3'` to focus on the specific patent class.
- We extract assignee names, filing dates, publication dates, and country codes to understand the distribution of applications.
- By grouping and counting, we can see the number of applications per assignee, per year, and per country.

These queries help us:

- Understand the data structure and content of the relevant columns.
- Identify the top assignees based on the total number of applications in class `'A01B3'`.
- Determine the year with the most applications for each assignee.
- Find out the country code with the most applications during that peak year.

---

**Note:**

- All column names are enclosed in double quotations as per SQL syntax for case sensitivity.
- We avoided using `WITH` clauses and nested queries to keep each query simple and independent.
- The `LIMIT 1000` clause is used to limit the output for exploration purposes.
- Since we are dealing with date numbers, we convert them to strings using `TO_VARCHAR` to extract the year.
- The queries are designed to explore and understand the data, which can then be used to formulate the final answer to the task.Query:

Task: For patent class A01B3, I want to analyze the information of the top 3 assignees based on the total number of applications. Please provide the following five pieces of information: the name of this assignee,  total number of applications, the year with the most applications, the number of applications in that year, and the country code with the most applications during that year.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the analysis for patent class A01B3, the top 3 assignees are as follows:

```csv
assignee_name,total_applications,year_with_most_applications,applications_in_that_year,country_code_with_most_applications_during_that_year
Assignee_Name1,num:int > 0,year:int,num:int > 0,country_code:str
Assignee_Name2,num:int > 0,year:int,num:int > 0,country_code:str
Assignee_Name3,num:int > 0,year:int,num:int > 0,country_code:str
```

**Explanation:** The table lists the top 3 assignees for patent class A01B3 based on the total number of applications. For each assignee, it provides:
- `assignee_name`: The name of the assignee (string).
- `total_applications`: The total number of applications filed by the assignee (integer greater than 0).
- `year_with_most_applications`: The year in which the assignee filed the most applications (integer representing a year).
- `applications_in_that_year`: The number of applications filed by the assignee in that year (integer greater than 0).
- `country_code_with_most_applications_during_that_year`: The country code where the most applications were filed by the assignee during that year (string).

The values are placeholders indicating the data types and conditions, as specific values cannot be determined from the task description..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
Please refrain from adding any conditions that are not explicitly specified in the task.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['CPC_DEFINITION', 'DISCLOSURES_13', 'PUBLICATIONS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
Be careful one country may have different names in different columns in a database.
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
Be careful of information in nested JSON columns. e.g.1. When it comes to active users, it refers to has engagement_time_msec parameter rather than directly counting users. So the right query is: SELECT DISTINCT USER_PSEUDO_ID FROM all_user_activity, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => event_params) AS flattened_params WHERE flattened_params.value:key = 'engagement_time_msec'
e.g. When it comes to top-selling product, you should pay attention to hits2.value:"eCommerceAction":"action_type"::INTEGER = 6 where 6 means sold product.
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When counting for rows of a column, ensure they are distinct: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT col_name) FROM table;
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive and negative signs.

The error information is:
 No data found for the specified query.
Be careful of using JOIN and LEFT JOIN. JOIN: The length of the result corresponds to the intersection of the two tables based on the ON condition. LEFT JOIN: The result will include all rows from the left table.
e.g. 1 Assess whether different genetic variants affect the log10-transformed TP53 expression levels in TCGA-BRCA samples using sequencing and mutation data: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM expression_data e JOIN mutation_data m ON e."case_barcode" = m."case_barcode"); In this case we just need their intersection to count specific samples, so we shouldn't use LEFT JOIN.e.g. 2 List each musical style with the number of times it appears as a preference. You should write a query like: SELECT * FROM "MUSICAL_STYLES" s JOIN "MUSICAL_PREFERENCES" p ON s."StyleID" = p."StyleID", for the task is to get the intersection of style and preference.
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'

2025-01-16 07:39:20 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For patent class A01B3, I want to analyze the information of the top 3 assignees based on the total number of applications. Please provide the following five pieces of information: the name of this assignee,  total number of applications, the year with the most applications, the number of applications in that year, and the country code with the most applications during that year., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: Based on the analysis for patent class A01B3, the top 3 assignees are as follows:

```csv
assignee_name,total_applications,year_with_most_applications,applications_in_that_year,country_code_with_most_applications_during_that_year
Assignee_Name1,num:int > 0,year:int,num:int > 0,country_code:str
Assignee_Name2,num:int > 0,year:int,num:int > 0,country_code:str
Assignee_Name3,num:int > 0,year:int,num:int > 0,country_code:str
```

**Explanation:** The table lists the top 3 assignees for patent class A01B3 based on the total number of applications. For each assignee, it provides:
- `assignee_name`: The name of the assignee (string).
- `total_applications`: The total number of applications filed by the assignee (integer greater than 0).
- `year_with_most_applications`: The year in which the assignee filed the most applications (integer representing a year).
- `applications_in_that_year`: The number of applications filed by the assignee in that year (integer greater than 0).
- `country_code_with_most_applications_during_that_year`: The country code where the most applications were filed by the assignee during that year (string).

The values are placeholders indicating the data types and conditions, as specific values cannot be determined from the task description. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
