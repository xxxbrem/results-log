After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Precise Filtering of Massachusetts Regions:**
  - The query accurately selects geographic regions in Massachusetts by checking if the `GeoName` ends with `', MA'` using the condition `RIGHT(t2012."GeoName", 4) = ', MA'`. This ensures that only regions in Massachusetts are included and avoids any partial matches that might occur with other methods like `LIKE '%MA'`.
  
- **Correct Join on Unique Region Identifiers:**
  - By joining the tables on `t2012."GeoFIPS" = t2017."GeoFIPS"`, the query ensures that the data for each region from 2012 and 2017 are correctly matched. The `GeoFIPS` code uniquely identifies each region, making this the appropriate field for joining.

- **Accurate Calculation with Required Precision:**
  - The increase in average earnings per job is calculated correctly by subtracting 2012 earnings from 2017 earnings: `t2017."Earnings_per_job_avg" - t2012."Earnings_per_job_avg"`.
  - The use of `ROUND(..., 4)` ensures that the results are rounded to four decimal places, as specified in the instructions.

- **Organized Output:**
  - The results are ordered by `t2012."GeoName"`, which provides a clear and systematic presentation, making it easier to review and verify the data for each region.

**Therefore, `1result.sql` is the correct SQL query that accurately answers the question.**
