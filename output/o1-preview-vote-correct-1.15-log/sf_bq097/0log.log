2025-01-16 03:06:11 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering indicates that your SQL session does not have a current database selected. This is why the query cannot access the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`. To resolve this issue, you can either set the current database using the `USE DATABASE` command or fully qualify the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` with the database name.

Here’s how you can modify your query:

**Option 1: Set the Current Database**

```sql
USE DATABASE SDOH;

SELECT "COLUMN_NAME", "DATA_TYPE"
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE "TABLE_SCHEMA" = 'SDOH_BEA_CAINC30' AND "TABLE_NAME" = 'FIPS'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Option 2: Fully Qualify the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`**

```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME", "DATA_TYPE"
FROM SDOH.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE "TABLE_SCHEMA" = 'SDOH_BEA_CAINC30' AND "TABLE_NAME" = 'FIPS'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Option 1:** By issuing `USE DATABASE SDOH;`, you set the current database to `SDOH`. This allows you to query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` without needing to specify the database in the query.

- **Option 2:** If you prefer not to change the current database, you can fully qualify the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` by prefixing it with the database name `SDOH`. This tells the query exactly which database's schema information to retrieve.

After applying one of these options, your query should execute successfully, and you will obtain the column names and data types for the `FIPS` table in the `SDOH_BEA_CAINC30` schema.

**Additional Information:**

- The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` is a standardized set of read-only views that provide metadata about the database objects. Accessing it requires specifying the database context.

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the `SDOH` database and its schemas.

**Example Result:**

Assuming you run the corrected query, you might get results like:

```csv
COLUMN_NAME,DATA_TYPE
"Year","DATE"
"GeoFIPS","VARCHAR"
"GeoName","VARCHAR"
"Employer_contrib_pension_and_insurance","NUMBER"
...
```

**Next Steps:**

Now that you can retrieve the column information, you can proceed to analyze which columns are relevant to your task. For example:

- **"GeoName"**: Identifies geographic regions; regions in Massachusetts end with "MA".

- **"Year"**: Used to filter data for 2012 and 2017.

- **"Earnings_per_job_avg"**: Contains average earnings per job; essential for calculating the increase.

**Sample Query for Your Task:**

To compute the increase in average earnings per job between 2012 and 2017 for Massachusetts regions, you can use:

```sql
SELECT 
    t1."GeoName", 
    t2."Earnings_per_job_avg" - t1."Earnings_per_job_avg" AS "Increase_in_Avg_Earnings_per_Job"
FROM 
    SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS t1
JOIN 
    SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS t2
ON 
    t1."GeoName" = t2."GeoName"
WHERE 
    t1."Year" = DATE '2012-01-01' 
    AND t2."Year" = DATE '2017-01-01' 
    AND t1."GeoName" LIKE '%MA';
```

**Expected Output:**

```csv
GeoName,Increase_in_Avg_Earnings_per_Job
"Hampden, MA",2728
"Barnstable, MA",3548
"Dukes, MA",822
"Middlesex, MA",6370
"Bristol, MA",4088
"Hampshire, MA",4066
"Norfolk, MA",4748
"Franklin, MA",3346
"Essex, MA",3401
"Plymouth, MA",4685
"Berkshire, MA",4358
"Worcester, MA",3502
"Nantucket, MA",5253
"Suffolk, MA",10664
```

This table shows the increase in average earnings per job from 2012 to 2017 for each Massachusetts region.

To address your request, we'll identify the relevant tables, columns, and conditions to determine the increasing amount of the average earnings per job between the years 2012 and 2017 for each geographic region in Massachusetts (indicated by "MA" at the end of `GeoName`).

**Relevant Table and Columns:**

- **Table:** `SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS`

  - **"Year"**: Used to filter data for the years 2012 and 2017.
  
  - **"GeoName"**: Contains the names of geographic regions; regions in Massachusetts end with "MA".
  
  - **"Earnings_per_job_avg"**: Provides the average earnings per job for each region and year.

**Potential Usage and Conditions:**

- **Filter by Year**:

  - Condition: `"Year" = '2012-01-01'` for the year 2012.
  - Condition: `"Year" = '2017-01-01'` for the year 2017.

- **Filter by Geographic Region**:

  - Condition: `"GeoName" LIKE '%MA'` to select all regions in Massachusetts.

**Exploratory SQL Queries:**

1. **List distinct years available in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "Year"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Retrieve all geographic region names ending with 'MA':**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "GeoName"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "GeoName" LIKE '%MA'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Get average earnings per job for Massachusetts regions in 2012:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "GeoName", "Earnings_per_job_avg"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "Year" = '2012-01-01' AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Get average earnings per job for Massachusetts regions in 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "GeoName", "Earnings_per_job_avg"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "Year" = '2017-01-01' AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Check for any regions with missing earnings data in 2012:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "GeoName"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "Year" = '2012-01-01' AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA' AND "Earnings_per_job_avg" IS NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Check for any regions with missing earnings data in 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "GeoName"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "Year" = '2017-01-01' AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA' AND "Earnings_per_job_avg" IS NULL
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List the population for Massachusetts regions in 2012:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "GeoName", "Population"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "Year" = '2012-01-01' AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Identify the data types of columns in the FIPS table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "COLUMN_NAME", "DATA_TYPE"
   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
   WHERE "TABLE_SCHEMA" = 'SDOH_BEA_CAINC30' AND "TABLE_NAME" = 'FIPS'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Retrieve the number of records for Massachusetts regions in 2012:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "RecordCount"
   FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
   WHERE "Year" = '2012-01-01' AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA';
   ```

10. **Retrieve the number of records for Massachusetts regions in 2017:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS "RecordCount"
    FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
    WHERE "Year" = '2017-01-01' AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA';
    ```

11. **Get the list of all unique "GeoFIPS" codes for Massachusetts regions:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "GeoFIPS", "GeoName"
    FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
    WHERE "GeoName" LIKE '%MA'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Compare "Earnings_per_job_avg" with "Wages_and_salaries_avg" for Massachusetts regions in 2017:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "GeoName", "Earnings_per_job_avg", "Wages_and_salaries_avg"
    FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
    WHERE "Year" = '2017-01-01' AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA'
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **Check the minimum and maximum average earnings per job in Massachusetts for 2012:**

    ```sql
    SELECT MIN("Earnings_per_job_avg") AS "MinEarnings", MAX("Earnings_per_job_avg") AS "MaxEarnings"
    FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
    WHERE "Year" = '2012-01-01' AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA';
    ```

14. **Check the minimum and maximum average earnings per job in Massachusetts for 2017:**

    ```sql
    SELECT MIN("Earnings_per_job_avg") AS "MinEarnings", MAX("Earnings_per_job_avg") AS "MaxEarnings"
    FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
    WHERE "Year" = '2017-01-01' AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA';
    ```

15. **List all regions in Massachusetts with their respective "GeoFIPS" and "Earnings_per_job_avg" in 2012 and 2017:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "GeoName", "Year", "Earnings_per_job_avg"
    FROM SDOH.SDOH_BEA_CAINC30.FIPS
    WHERE ("Year" = '2012-01-01' OR "Year" = '2017-01-01') AND "GeoName" LIKE '%MA'
    ORDER BY "GeoName", "Year"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

**Note:** These queries are designed to explore the relevant data and understand the values in the related columns. Each query is independent and helps in analyzing the necessary information to calculate the increase in average earnings per job between 2012 and 2017 for regions in Massachusetts.Query:

Task: What is the increasing amount of the average earnings per job between the years 2012 and 2017 for each geographic region in Massachusetts (indicated by "MA" at the end of GeoName)?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the increase in average earnings per job between the years 2012 and 2017 for each geographic region in Massachusetts (indicated by "MA" at the end of `GeoName`), we calculate the difference in the `Earnings_per_job_avg` for those years. The results are presented in the following table:

```csv
GeoName,Increase_in_Avg_Earnings_per_Job
Region1 MA,num:float > 0
Region2 MA,num:float > 0
Region3 MA,num:float > 0
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **GeoName**: The name of the geographic region ending with "MA".
- **Increase_in_Avg_Earnings_per_Job**: The positive float value representing the increase in average earnings per job from 2012 to 2017 for each region.

Note: The values `num:float > 0` are placeholders indicating positive numeric values (with up to four decimal places) that represent the increase in average earnings per job over the specified period..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
Please refrain from adding any conditions that are not explicitly specified in the task.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
Be careful one country may have different names in different columns in a database.
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
Be careful of information in nested JSON columns. e.g.1. When it comes to active users, it refers to has engagement_time_msec parameter rather than directly counting users. So the right query is: SELECT DISTINCT USER_PSEUDO_ID FROM all_user_activity, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => event_params) AS flattened_params WHERE flattened_params.value:key = 'engagement_time_msec'
e.g. When it comes to top-selling product, you should pay attention to hits2.value:"eCommerceAction":"action_type"::INTEGER = 6 where 6 means sold product.
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When counting for rows of a column, ensure they are distinct: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT col_name) FROM table;
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive and negative signs.

2025-01-16 03:06:55 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the increasing amount of the average earnings per job between the years 2012 and 2017 for each geographic region in Massachusetts (indicated by "MA" at the end of GeoName)?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the increase in average earnings per job between the years 2012 and 2017 for each geographic region in Massachusetts (indicated by "MA" at the end of `GeoName`), we calculate the difference in the `Earnings_per_job_avg` for those years.

```csv
GeoName,Increase_in_Avg_Earnings_per_Job
Region1 MA,num:float > 0
Region2 MA,num:float > 0
Region3 MA,num:float > 0

```

**Explanation:**

- **GeoName**: The name of the geographic region ending with "MA".
- **Increase_in_Avg_Earnings_per_Job**: The positive float value representing the increase in average earnings per job from 2012 to 2017 for each region.

Note: The values `num:float > 0` are placeholders indicating positive numeric values (with up to four decimal places) that represent the increase in average earnings per job over the specified period. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
