After analyzing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calculation of Daily New Cases:**

   - **1result.sql** uses the `GREATEST(...)` function to ensure that daily new cases are non-negative:
     ```sql
     GREATEST(S."confirmed_cases" - LAG(S."confirmed_cases") OVER (
         PARTITION BY S."state_name" ORDER BY S."date"
     ), 0) AS "new_cases"
     ```
     This handles cases where the cumulative confirmed cases might decrease due to data corrections, setting negative new cases to zero.

   - **0result.sql** and **2result.sql** also calculate daily new cases, but **2result.sql** does not explicitly handle negative values, which might lead to incorrect rankings.

2. **Ranking Method:**

   - **1result.sql** uses the `RANK()` function to determine the daily top five states and counties:
     ```sql
     RANK() OVER (
         PARTITION BY "date"
         ORDER BY "new_cases" DESC NULLS LAST
     ) AS rn
     ```
     The `RANK()` function handles ties appropriately by assigning the same rank to equal values and potentially skipping subsequent ranks. This ensures that the top five rankings do not exceed five entries per day, aligning with the commonly understood definition of a "top five."

   - **0result.sql** uses `DENSE_RANK()`, which does not skip ranks after ties. This can result in more than five entries in the daily top rankings when there are ties, which may not meet the problem's requirement to identify the top five states and counties.

   - **2result.sql** uses `ROW_NUMBER()`, which assigns a unique rank to each row, even if there are ties. This approach does not handle ties correctly and could exclude states or counties that should be ranked equally.

3. **Consistency with Problem Requirements:**

   - The problem specifies identifying the top five states by daily increases and compiling a ranking based on the frequency of their appearances in the daily top fives.

   - **1result.sql** correctly implements this by:
     - Calculating daily new cases accurately.
     - Ranking states and counties per day, considering ties appropriately with `RANK()`, and ensuring the top five do not exceed five entries.
     - Compiling the frequency of each state and county appearing in the daily top fives.

   - Therefore, **1result.sql** aligns best with the problem requirements and provides accurate results.

**Answer:**

```plain
1result.sql
