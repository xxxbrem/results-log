After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query is **`0result.sql`**. Here's the reasoning:

- **Inclusion of `"amount" > 0` Condition**: The `0result.sql` query includes the condition `AND "amount" > 0` in the `WHERE` clause. This ensures that only transactions with a positive amount are considered when calculating the total transaction amount per date. Including transactions with zero amounts could inflate the transaction count without contributing to the total amount, leading to inaccurate results.

- **Function Usage for Date Conversion**: Both queries correctly convert the `block_timestamp` to a date format. While `0result.sql` uses `DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("block_timestamp" / 1000000))`, and `2result.sql` uses `TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("block_timestamp" / 1e6))`, they achieve the same outcome. The difference is due to SQL dialect variations and does not impact the correctness.

- **Consistency in Results**: Both queries return the same date (`2020-11-06`) and total transaction amount (`55548901182319524666.0000`). However, including the `AND "amount" > 0` condition is logically necessary to ensure accuracy.

Therefore, the correct SQL query that answers the question is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
