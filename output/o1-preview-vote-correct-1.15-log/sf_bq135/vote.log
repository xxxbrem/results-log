After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query that answers the question "Which date before 2022 had the highest total transaction amount in the Zilliqa blockchain data?" is **`0result.sql`**.

---

**Explanation:**

- **`0result.sql`:**

  - **Query:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('DAY', TO_TIMESTAMP("block_timestamp" / 1e6)) AS "date",
           ROUND(SUM("amount"), 4) AS "total_transaction_amount"
    FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ZILLIQA.TRANSACTIONS
    WHERE "block_timestamp" < 1640995200000000  -- Before 2022-01-01 in microseconds
    GROUP BY "date"
    ORDER BY "total_transaction_amount" DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

  - **Result:**

    ```
    date,total_transaction_amount
    2021-04-27,502568739536336696622.0000
    ```

  - **Reasoning:**

    - This query considers **all transactions before 2022** without additional filters.
    - It calculates the total transaction amount per date and orders the results to find the date with the highest amount.
    - **April 27, 2021** is determined to have the highest total transaction amount.

- **`1result.sql`:**

  - **Query:**

    ```sql
    SELECT
        DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ("block_timestamp" / 1000000)) AS "date",
        ROUND(SUM("amount"), 4) AS "total_transaction_amount"
    FROM
        CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ZILLIQA.TRANSACTIONS
    WHERE
        "block_timestamp" < 1640995200000000
        AND "accepted" = TRUE
        AND "success" = TRUE
        AND "amount" IS NOT NULL
        AND "amount" > 0
    GROUP BY
        "date"
    ORDER BY
        "total_transaction_amount" DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

  - **Result:**

    ```
    date,total_transaction_amount
    2021-06-21,42824411356450210969.0000
    ```

  - **Reasoning:**

    - This query applies additional filters: `"accepted" = TRUE`, `"success" = TRUE`, and `"amount" > 0`.
    - While including these conditions can be useful, they may exclude transactions that are relevant to calculating the total transaction amount.
    - The total amount for **June 21, 2021** is less than that of April 27, 2021, as shown in `0result.sql`.

- **`2result.sql`:**

  - **Query:**

    ```sql
    SELECT 
        TO_CHAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("block_timestamp" / 1000000), 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS "date", 
        ROUND(SUM("amount"), 4) AS "total_transaction_amount"
    FROM CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ZILLIQA.TRANSACTIONS
    WHERE "block_timestamp" < 1640995200000000  -- UNIX timestamp in microseconds for 2022-01-01
      AND "success" = TRUE
      AND "accepted" = TRUE
    GROUP BY "date"
    ORDER BY "total_transaction_amount" DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

  - **Result:**

    ```
    date,total_transaction_amount
    2020-11-06,55548901182319524666.0000
    ```

  - **Reasoning:**

    - Similar to `1result.sql`, this query filters for `"success" = TRUE` and `"accepted" = TRUE`.
    - It does not filter out transactions with zero or null amounts, which might inflate the total amount inaccurately.
    - The total amount for **November 6, 2020** is less than that of April 27, 2021, as shown in `0result.sql`.

---

**Why `0result.sql` is Correct:**

- **Comprehensive Inclusion:** By not filtering out any transactions (other than ensuring they occurred before 2022), we can capture the complete transaction data for accurate total amounts.
- **Relevance to the Question:** The question seeks the date with the highest total transaction amount without specifying conditions on transaction acceptance or success.
- **Highest Total Amount Identified:** The total amount on April 27, 2021, is the highest among the dates considered, as per the results from `0result.sql`.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

0result.sql
