1result.sql
```

The SQL script `1result.sql` is the correct answer because it accurately calculates the region length and, consequently, the density of mutations. Here are the reasons:

1. **Accurate Region Length Calculation:**
   - **`1result.sql`:** Computes the region length as `(55064852 - 55039447 + 1)`, which equals **25406**. This correctly accounts for both the start and end positions being inclusive.
   - **`2result.sql`:** Uses a hardcoded region length of **25405**, which is one less than the actual length, leading to a slight inaccuracy.

2. **Correct Density of Mutations:**
   - **`1result.sql`:** Calculates the density as `25406 / 5604 ≈ 4.533466`, which rounds to **4.5335** when rounded to four decimal places.
   - **`2result.sql`:** Calculates the density as `25405 / 5604 ≈ 4.533289`, resulting in **4.5333** when rounded correctly, but the provided result shows **4.5334**, indicating a possible rounding inconsistency.

3. **Consistency in Results:**
   - **`1result.sql`** provides results that are consistent with accurate mathematical calculations, ensuring that all float values are rounded to **four decimal places** as per the requirement.

By correctly computing the region length and ensuring precise calculations, `1result.sql` aligns with the task's requirements and delivers accurate summary statistics.
