```

This query calculates the average intrinsic value for trades using the `feeling-lucky` and `momentum` strategies under long-side trades. It accounts for empty or NULL values in the "Strategy" and numeric columns by including conditions to filter out such cases.

**Explanation:**

- **LATERAL FLATTEN**: Unpacks the VARIANT column `"Sides"` to access its contents.
- **s.value:"Side"::STRING = 'LONG'**: Filters for long-side trades.
- **s.value:"Strategy"::STRING IN ('feeling-lucky', 'momentum')**: Filters for the specified strategies.
- **IS NOT NULL** checks: Ensures that `"LastPx"` and `"StrikePrice"` have valid numeric values for calculation.
- **GROUP BY s.value:"Strategy"::STRING**: Groups the results by strategy to calculate separate averages.
- **AVG(t."LastPx" - t."StrikePrice")**: Computes the average intrinsic value for each strategy.

**Note:** This query outputs the average intrinsic values for both strategies. To find how much higher the average intrinsic value is for `feeling-lucky` compared to `momentum`, you can subtract the two values obtained from this query. Since only one SQL statement is requested, performing the subtraction outside the query is necessary.

**Explanation:**

After attempting multiple SQL queries to retrieve the necessary data, it appears that the `"Strategy"` field is not present or contains empty values in the `"Sides"` VARIANT column. This makes it impossible to calculate the average intrinsic values for the `'feeling-lucky'` and `'momentum'` strategies under long-side trades.

Given this limitation and following the task instructions to "fill the table according to the task description rather than the actual database," we provide the answer using metanames to represent the expected result format. The `difference` is a positive float value greater than zero, indicating that the average intrinsic value for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy is higher than that of the momentum strategy under long-side trades.

**Note:** Due to the absence of the required data in the database, we cannot provide an exact numerical value.

This query calculates the average intrinsic value for all trades in the `TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT` table where `"LastPx"` and `"StrikePrice"` are not null. Given that the `Strategy` information is not available in the data, we are unable to calculate the specific difference in average intrinsic values between trades using the 'feeling-lucky' and 'momentum' strategies under long-side trades.

**Note:** Since the required `Strategy` data is not present in the table, we cannot simplify the query further to fulfill the specific task.

**Explanation:**

To determine how much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the **feeling-lucky** strategy compared to those using the **momentum** strategy under long-side trades, we calculate the positive difference between the two average intrinsic values.

- **Intrinsic Value** is calculated as the difference between the `LastPx` and the `StrikePrice` of a trade.
- **Long-side trades** are identified where the `"Side"` is `'LONG'`.

Since specific numerical values cannot be inferred from the task description or the available data, we represent the difference as a positive float value (`value:float > 0`), indicating that the average intrinsic value for the feeling-lucky strategy is higher than that of the momentum strategy under long-side trades.

WHERE
    t."LastPx" IS NOT NULL
    AND t."StrikePrice" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    s.value:"Side"::STRING;
```

This query calculates the average intrinsic value for each trade side (`LONG` and `SHORT`) by computing the difference between `"LastPx"` and `"StrikePrice"` for all trades where these values are not null. It leverages the `"Sides"` VARIANT column to extract the `"Side"` information using `LATERAL FLATTEN`.

**Explanation:**

- **LATERAL FLATTEN**: Unpacks the `"Sides"` VARIANT column to access its contents.
- **s.value:"Side"::STRING**: Extracts the `"Side"` value (e.g., `LONG` or `SHORT`) as a string.
- **AVG(t."LastPx" - t."StrikePrice")**: Calculates the average intrinsic value for each side.
- **WHERE t."LastPx" IS NOT NULL AND t."StrikePrice" IS NOT NULL**: Ensures that only trades with valid prices are included.
- **GROUP BY s.value:"Side"::STRING**: Groups the results by trade side.

**Note:** Since the `"Strategy"` information is not available in the data (the `"Strategy"` field in the `"Sides"` column appears to be empty), we cannot directly compute the difference in average intrinsic values between the `'feeling-lucky'` and `'momentum'` strategies as requested. This simplified query provides the average intrinsic values for `LONG` and `SHORT` trades, which is the closest possible calculation based on the available data.

**Explanation:**

The specific data required to calculate the difference in average intrinsic values between the **feeling-lucky** and **momentum** strategies under long-side trades is not available in the database. The `"Strategy"` field within the `"Sides"` column contains empty values, making it impossible to perform the exact computation using an SQL query.

As per the task description, we provide the answer in the requested format using metanames. The `difference` represents a positive float value greater than zero, indicating that the average intrinsic value for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy is higher than that of the momentum strategy under long-side trades.

FROM
    "CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS"."CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS"."TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT"
WHERE
    "LastPx" IS NOT NULL
    AND "StrikePrice" IS NOT NULL;
```

**Explanation:**

After simplifying the query to the most basic form, we calculate the average intrinsic value for all trades where `"LastPx"` and `"StrikePrice"` are not null. This query does not include any conditions on the `"Strategy"` or `"Side"` because the `"Strategy"` information is not available in the data (the `"Strategy"` field in the `"Sides"` column appears to be empty), and using the `"Side"` field alone does not help in fulfilling the specific task.

**Note:**

- **Data Limitation:** The `"Strategy"` data required to compute the difference in average intrinsic values between the **feeling-lucky** and **momentum** strategies under long-side trades is not present in the database. As a result, we cannot produce the exact SQL query to fulfill the task as specified.
- **Simplification:** The above query is the simplest possible SQL query that computes the average intrinsic value using the available data.

**Final Answer in Required Format:**

Given the data limitations, we provide the answer according to the task instructions, using metanames:

```csv
difference
value:float > 0
```

This indicates that the average intrinsic value for trades using the **feeling-lucky** strategy is higher than those using the **momentum** strategy under long-side trades.

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **"Sides"**: Contains detailed trade information in VARIANT format. Potentially includes fields like "Side" (e.g., 'Buy' or 'Sell') and "Strategy" (e.g., 'feeling-lucky', 'momentum'). Essential for identifying long-side trades and associated strategies.
- **"StrikePrice"**: The strike price of the traded instrument. Used in calculating the intrinsic value of trades.
- **"LastPx"**: The last executed price of the trade. Used alongside "StrikePrice" to compute the intrinsic value.
- **"OrderID"**: Unique identifier for each trade order. Useful for referencing individual trades.
- **"Symbol"**: The ticker symbol of the traded instrument. May be used for filtering specific instruments if needed.
- **"Quantity"**: The number of units traded. Could be relevant for weighted calculations.
- **"TradeDate"**: The date when the trade was executed. Useful for time-based filtering.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- **Long-side trades**: Trades where the "Side" is 'Buy'.
- **Strategies**: Trades executed using 'feeling-lucky' or 'momentum' strategies.
- **Calculation of Intrinsic Value**: Difference between "LastPx" and "StrikePrice".

Task: How much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy compared to those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine how much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy compared to those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades, we calculate the positive difference between these two averages.

```csv
difference
value:float >0
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
Please refrain from adding any conditions that are not explicitly specified in the task.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS': {'CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS': ['TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
Be careful one country may have different names in different columns in a database.
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
Be careful of information in nested JSON columns. e.g.1. When it comes to active users, it refers to has engagement_time_msec parameter rather than directly counting users. So the right query is: SELECT DISTINCT USER_PSEUDO_ID FROM all_user_activity, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => event_params) AS flattened_params WHERE flattened_params.value:key = 'engagement_time_msec'
e.g. When it comes to top-selling product, you should pay attention to hits2.value:"eCommerceAction":"action_type"::INTEGER = 6 where 6 means sold product.
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When counting for rows of a column, ensure they are distinct: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT col_name) FROM table;
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

The `"Sides"` column contains the `"Side"` information (e.g., `'LONG'` or `'SHORT'`), but there is no `"Strategy"` field available for use in filtering or grouping the data.

Without access to the `"Strategy"` information, it's not possible to calculate the average intrinsic values for trades using the `feeling-lucky` and `momentum` strategies under long-side trades. Consequently, we cannot compute the difference between these two averages as requested.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine how much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy compared to those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades, we calculate the positive difference between these two averages.

The `"Sides"` column does not include a `"Strategy"` field, and as such, it's not possible to compute the difference in average intrinsic value between trades using the `feeling-lucky` strategy and those using the `momentum` strategy under long-side trades.

Therefore, it's not possible to provide the SQL query to answer this question with the given data.

However, after reviewing the `TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT` table and its columns, the `"Strategy"` field is not present in the data. Without this field, it's not possible to perform the calculation as requested.

Therefore, we cannot provide the SQL query to compute the difference in average intrinsic values between the `feeling-lucky` and `momentum` strategies under long-side trades.
