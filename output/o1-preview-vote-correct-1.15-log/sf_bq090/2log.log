*Note:* Due to missing or empty values in the "Strategy" and "IntrinsicValue" fields, we cannot compute the specific difference in average intrinsic values between the "feeling-lucky" and "momentum" strategies under long-side trades. The above query calculates the average intrinsic value for long-side trades in general.

**Result Format:**

```csv
difference
value:float > 0
```

*Explanation:* The `difference` represents the positive difference in average intrinsic values between the two strategies under long-side trades. However, since the required data is not available in the table, we represent it as `value:float > 0`.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- **"Sides"**: This VARIANT column likely contains nested JSON data. We can extract the following fields:
  - **"Side"**: Indicates the side of the trade (e.g., '1' for buy/long, '2' for sell/short). This is essential for identifying long-side trades.
  - **"Strategy"**: Specifies the trading strategy used (e.g., 'feeling-lucky', 'momentum'). Needed to filter trades by strategy.
  - **"IntrinsicValue"**: The intrinsic value of the trade. We need this to calculate the average intrinsic value per strategy.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filter trades where **"Side"** equals `'1'` to focus on long-side trades.
- Filter trades where **"Strategy"** is `'feeling-lucky'` or `'momentum'`.
- Extract and compare the average **"IntrinsicValue"** for these strategies.

Task: How much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy compared to those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: SELECT S."Column_Name" FROM {Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Table_name} (ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine how much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy compared to those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades, we calculate the average intrinsic value for each strategy under long-side trades and then find the difference between them.

```csv
difference
value:float > 0
```

*Note:* The `value` represents the positive difference in average intrinsic values between the two strategies under long-side trades..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When calculating distances between two geometries, use `ST_MakePoint(x, y)` to make a point and `ST_Distance(geometry1 GEOMETRY, geometry2 GEOMETRY)` to compute. No need to convert from meters to miles unless requested. Don't use Haversine like 2 * 6371000 * ASIN(...), use ST_DISTANCE for more precise results.
Please refrain from adding any conditions that are not explicitly specified in the task.
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS': {'CYMBAL_INVESTMENTS': ['TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book" SQL: WHERE "title" LIKE '%book%'
However, if the string is not decided, you may use ILIKE and %. e.g. Get articles that mention "education": SQL: "body" ILIKE '%education%' OR "title" ILIKE '%education%'
Be careful one country may have different names in different columns in a database.
When handling TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ conversions, use query like: SELECT CASE WHEN "date" >= 1e15 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000000) WHEN "date" >= 1e12 THEN TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date" / 1000) ELSE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("date") END AS parsed_timestamp FROM my_table;
Be careful of information in nested JSON columns. e.g.1. When it comes to active users, it refers to has engagement_time_msec parameter rather than directly counting users. So the right query is: SELECT DISTINCT USER_PSEUDO_ID FROM all_user_activity, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => event_params) AS flattened_params WHERE flattened_params.value:key = 'engagement_time_msec'
e.g. When it comes to top-selling product, you should pay attention to hits2.value:"eCommerceAction":"action_type"::INTEGER = 6 where 6 means sold product.
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When counting for rows of a column, ensure they are distinct: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT col_name) FROM table;
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
You need to follow the format's positive and negative signs.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine how much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy compared to those using the momentum strategy under long-side trades, we calculate the average intrinsic value for each strategy under long-side trades and then find the difference between them.

```csv
difference
value:float > 0
```

*Note:* The `value` represents the positive difference in average intrinsic values between the two strategies under long-side trades. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
