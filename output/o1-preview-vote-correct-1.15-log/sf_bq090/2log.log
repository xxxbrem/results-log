```

This query calculates the average intrinsic value for trades using the `feeling-lucky` and `momentum` strategies under long-side trades. It accounts for empty or NULL values in the "Strategy" and numeric columns by including conditions to filter out such cases.

**Explanation:**

- **LATERAL FLATTEN**: Unpacks the VARIANT column `"Sides"` to access its contents.
- **s.value:"Side"::STRING = 'LONG'**: Filters for long-side trades.
- **s.value:"Strategy"::STRING IN ('feeling-lucky', 'momentum')**: Filters for the specified strategies.
- **IS NOT NULL** checks: Ensures that `"LastPx"` and `"StrikePrice"` have valid numeric values for calculation.
- **GROUP BY s.value:"Strategy"::STRING**: Groups the results by strategy to calculate separate averages.
- **AVG(t."LastPx" - t."StrikePrice")**: Computes the average intrinsic value for each strategy.

**Note:** This query outputs the average intrinsic values for both strategies. To find how much higher the average intrinsic value is for `feeling-lucky` compared to `momentum`, you can subtract the two values obtained from this query. Since only one SQL statement is requested, performing the subtraction outside the query is necessary.

**Explanation:**

After attempting multiple SQL queries to retrieve the necessary data, it appears that the `"Strategy"` field is not present or contains empty values in the `"Sides"` VARIANT column. This makes it impossible to calculate the average intrinsic values for the `'feeling-lucky'` and `'momentum'` strategies under long-side trades.

Given this limitation and following the task instructions to "fill the table according to the task description rather than the actual database," we provide the answer using metanames to represent the expected result format. The `difference` is a positive float value greater than zero, indicating that the average intrinsic value for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy is higher than that of the momentum strategy under long-side trades.

**Note:** Due to the absence of the required data in the database, we cannot provide an exact numerical value.

This query calculates the average intrinsic value for all trades in the `TRADE_CAPTURE_REPORT` table where `"LastPx"` and `"StrikePrice"` are not null. Given that the `Strategy` information is not available in the data, we are unable to calculate the specific difference in average intrinsic values between trades using the 'feeling-lucky' and 'momentum' strategies under long-side trades.

**Note:** Since the required `Strategy` data is not present in the table, we cannot simplify the query further to fulfill the specific task.

**Explanation:**

To determine how much higher the average intrinsic value is for trades using the **feeling-lucky** strategy compared to those using the **momentum** strategy under long-side trades, we calculate the positive difference between the two average intrinsic values.

- **Intrinsic Value** is calculated as the difference between the `LastPx` and the `StrikePrice` of a trade.
- **Long-side trades** are identified where the `"Side"` is `'LONG'`.

Since specific numerical values cannot be inferred from the task description or the available data, we represent the difference as a positive float value (`value:float > 0`), indicating that the average intrinsic value for the feeling-lucky strategy is higher than that of the momentum strategy under long-side trades.

WHERE
    t."LastPx" IS NOT NULL
    AND t."StrikePrice" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    s.value:"Side"::STRING;
```

This query calculates the average intrinsic value for each trade side (`LONG` and `SHORT`) by computing the difference between `"LastPx"` and `"StrikePrice"` for all trades where these values are not null. It leverages the `"Sides"` VARIANT column to extract the `"Side"` information using `LATERAL FLATTEN`.

**Explanation:**

- **LATERAL FLATTEN**: Unpacks the `"Sides"` VARIANT column to access its contents.
- **s.value:"Side"::STRING**: Extracts the `"Side"` value (e.g., `LONG` or `SHORT`) as a string.
- **AVG(t."LastPx" - t."StrikePrice")**: Calculates the average intrinsic value for each side.
- **WHERE t."LastPx" IS NOT NULL AND t."StrikePrice" IS NOT NULL**: Ensures that only trades with valid prices are included.
- **GROUP BY s.value:"Side"::STRING**: Groups the results by trade side.

**Note:** Since the `"Strategy"` information is not available in the data (the `"Strategy"` field in the `"Sides"` column appears to be empty), we cannot directly compute the difference in average intrinsic values between the `'feeling-lucky'` and `'momentum'` strategies as requested. This simplified query provides the average intrinsic values for `LONG` and `SHORT` trades, which is the closest possible calculation based on the available data.

**Explanation:**

The specific data required to calculate the difference in average intrinsic values between the **feeling-lucky** and **momentum** strategies under long-side trades is not available in the database. The `"Strategy"` field within the `"Sides"` column contains empty values, making it impossible to perform the exact computation using an SQL query.

As per the task description, we provide the answer in the requested format using metanames. The `difference` represents a positive float value greater than zero, indicating that the average intrinsic value for trades using the feeling-lucky strategy is higher than that of the momentum strategy under long-side trades.
