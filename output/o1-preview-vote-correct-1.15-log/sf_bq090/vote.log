After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Intrinsic Value Calculation:**
  - The **first query (`0result.sql`)** calculates the intrinsic value per unit as the difference between the last traded price and the strike price (`LastPx - StrikePrice`). This aligns with the common definition of intrinsic value in trading, especially for options and derivatives.
  - The **second query (`1result.sql`)** calculates the total value of trades (`Quantity * LastPx`), which doesn't represent the intrinsic value. It ignores the strike price, which is essential for calculating intrinsic value.

- **Strategy Identification:**
  - The **first query** filters trades based on `PartyID` values `'LUCKYES'` and `'MOMOES'`, which correspond to the 'feeling-lucky' and 'momentum' strategies for the ES symbol. While it doesn't include all symbols, it directly compares corresponding strategies.
  - The **second query** includes all `PartyID`s starting with `'LUCKY'` and `'MOMO'`, covering more symbols but doesn't adjust the intrinsic value calculation accordingly.

- **Trade Side Filtering:**
  - Both queries filter for long-side trades (`f.value:"Side"::STRING = 'LONG'`), meeting the condition of considering only long trades.

- **Accuracy of Result:**
  - The **first query** computes a precise difference in average intrinsic values per unit, resulting in a small but accurate value:
    ```
    difference
    0.0015150607547939517
    ```
  - The **second query** yields a larger difference in total trade values, which doesn't accurately reflect the intrinsic value difference per unit.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The **first query (`0result.sql`)** correctly calculates the average intrinsic value per unit for the specified strategies under long-side trades, making it the appropriate choice.

**Output:**

```plain
0result.sql
