After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Objective:** Find the **top-selling product** among customers who purchased **'YouTube Men’s Vintage Henley'** in **July 2017**, excluding the product itself.
  
- **Definition of Top-Selling:** In e-commerce, "top-selling" typically refers to products generating the highest **total revenue**, not just the highest quantity sold. Revenue accounts for both the price and quantity of products sold, giving a complete picture of sales performance.

- **Analysis of SQL Queries:**

  - **`0result.sql`:**
    - **Metric Used:** Calculates total sales based on **`SUM(productRevenue)`**.
    - **Approach:**
      - Identifies customers who purchased 'YouTube Men’s Vintage Henley'.
      - Aggregates revenue from other products these customers bought.
    - **Result:** Finds **'YouTube Men's Fleece Hoodie Black'** as the top-selling product with a total revenue of **95.2322** (after dividing by 1,000,000 to adjust for currency units).

  - **`1result.sql` and `2result.sql`:**
    - **Metric Used:** Calculate total sales based on **`SUM(productQuantity)`**.
    - **Issues:**
      - **Inconsistent Results:** `1result.sql` reports 20 units sold, while `2result.sql` reports 24 units sold for 'Google Sunglasses'.
      - **Metric Limitation:** Quantity sold doesn't account for product price differences. A low-priced item sold in high quantities might not generate as much revenue as a high-priced item sold less frequently.

- **Conclusion:**

  - **`0result.sql`** correctly identifies the top-selling product by total revenue, which is the standard metric for sales performance.
  - The calculation considers both the price and quantity, providing a more accurate depiction of the product's sales impact.

**Output:**
