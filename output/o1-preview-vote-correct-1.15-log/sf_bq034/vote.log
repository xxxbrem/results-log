After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query is **2result.sql**.

**Reason:**

- **2result.sql** constructs geography points using the Well-Known Text (WKT) format. The WKT representation `'POINT(longitude latitude)'` is a standard format for specifying geographic coordinates.
  
- The query uses the following syntax to create geography points:
  ```sql
  TO_GEOGRAPHY('POINT(' || "longitude" || ' ' || "latitude" || ')')
  ```
  This ensures that both the station coordinates and Chicago's coordinates are accurately represented as geography types, which is crucial for correct distance calculations on the Earthâ€™s surface.
  
- By using `ST_DISTANCE` on geography types, the distance is calculated using the geodetic calculations appropriate for spherical coordinates, and the distance result is in meters. This allows us to accurately filter stations within a 50 km radius.

- In contrast, **0result.sql** and **1result.sql** may have issues:
  - **0result.sql** uses `ST_MAKEPOINT` without specifying that the points are on a sphere, leading to potential inaccuracies because calculations are done on a planar surface instead of a spherical one.
  - **1result.sql** attempts to convert geometry points to geography types using `TO_GEOGRAPHY(ST_MAKEPOINT(...))`, which may not account for the correct spatial reference system (SRID) or could misinterpret the coordinate order.

Therefore, **2result.sql** is the correct SQL query because it accurately calculates great-circle distances between points on the Earth's surface and correctly identifies stations within a 50 km radius of Chicago.
