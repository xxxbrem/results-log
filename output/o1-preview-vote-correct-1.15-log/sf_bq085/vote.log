After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I conclude that `0result.sql` is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Use of 2020 Population Data:**
   - **`0result.sql`** retrieves population data from the `COVID19_JHU_WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_WDI.INDICATORS_DATA` table for the year **2020**, which aligns with the requirement to use the 2020 population.
   - **`1result.sql`** uses the `COVID19_JHU_WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY` table and selects population data from **2019 or earlier**, which does not meet the requirement.
   - **`2result.sql`** also uses the `INDICATORS_DATA` table for 2020 population data.

2. **Accurate Country Mapping:**
   - **`0result.sql`** explicitly maps country names to ensure consistency between the COVID-19 data and population data. It maps `'US'` to `'United States'` and `'Iran'` to `'Iran, Islamic Rep.'`, which are the correct mappings required for accurate joins.
   - **`1result.sql`** maps `'United States'` to `'US'` and `'Iran, Islamic Rep.'` to `'Iran'`, but since it's using data from different years, the mappings are less relevant.
   - **`2result.sql`** maps `'US'` to `'United States'` and only maps `'Iran, Islamic Rep.'` to `'Iran'` in the population data, which may lead to inconsistent joins.

3. **Consistent Results:**
   - The results from **`0result.csv`** show the total confirmed cases and cases per 100,000 people calculated using 2020 population data, which is what the task requires.
   - The calculations in **`0result.csv`** match those in **`2result.csv`**, but `0result.sql` provides clearer mappings and uses the required dataset.

4. **Float Precision:**
   - **`0result.csv`** ensures that float values are rounded to **4 decimal places**, as specified.

Therefore, **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL query that meets all the requirements.
