After comparing both SQL scripts and their results, I have determined that **`0result.sql`** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

- **Calculation of Poverty Rate:**
  - In `0result.sql`, the poverty rate is correctly calculated as the percentage of individuals living in poverty out of the total population for whom poverty status is determined. This is done using the formula:

    ```sql
    ("poverty" / "pop_determined_poverty_status") * 100 AS poverty_rate
    ```

    This accurately reflects the poverty rate as a percentage.

  - In `1result.sql`, the poverty rate is taken directly from the `"poverty"` column without dividing by the total population. This means it uses the absolute number of individuals in poverty as the poverty rate, which is incorrect for calculating correlation.

- **Accuracy of Correlation Calculation:**
  - `0result.sql` correctly calculates the percentage of births without maternal morbidity for each county and year, and correlates it with the properly calculated poverty rate.
  - Although `0result.sql` computes a single Pearson correlation coefficient across all years, it ensures the accuracy of the data used in the calculation.

- **Per-Year Correlation:**
  - While `1result.sql` attempts to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient per year, the incorrect calculation of poverty rates undermines the validity of its results.
  - Accurate poverty rates are crucial for reliable correlation analysis. Given that `1result.sql` does not calculate the poverty rates correctly, its results are less reliable.

Therefore, due to the correct calculation of the poverty rate and the use of accurate data in computing the correlation, `0result.sql` is the appropriate choice.

**Answer:**

```plain
0result.sql
```
