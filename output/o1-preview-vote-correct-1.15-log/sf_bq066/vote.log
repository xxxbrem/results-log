After reviewing and comparing both SQL scripts and their corresponding results, I have determined that `0result.sql` is the correct and more appropriate SQL script for the following reasons:

### **Reasons for Choosing `0result.sql`:**

1. **Comprehensive Data Inclusion:**
   - **Total Births Source:**
     - In `0result.sql`, the total number of births per county and year is extracted from the `COUNTY_NATALITY` table, which represents all recorded births.
     - This ensures that the total births include all cases, regardless of whether maternal morbidity information is available.
   - **Births Without Maternal Morbidity:**
     - The number of births without maternal morbidity is obtained from the `COUNTY_NATALITY_BY_MATERNAL_MORBIDITY` table by selecting records where `"Maternal_Morbidity_YN" = 0`.
   - **Rationale:**
     - By using the `COUNTY_NATALITY` table for total births, we account for all births, including those where maternal morbidity data might be missing or not recorded.
     - This provides a more accurate denominator when calculating the percentage of births without maternal morbidity.

2. **Accuracy in Percentage Calculation:**
   - **Correct Denominator:**
     - Using the total births from `COUNTY_NATALITY` ensures that the percentage of births without maternal morbidity is calculated against the actual total number of births.
   - **Potential Data Gaps:**
     - The `COUNTY_NATALITY_BY_MATERNAL_MORBIDITY` table might not include all births, especially if maternal morbidity data was not reported or collected for certain cases.
     - Relying solely on this table for both the numerator and denominator (as in `2result.sql`) could lead to inaccuracies due to incomplete data.

3. **Consistency with the Task Requirements:**
   - **Inclusive Data Use:**
     - The task specifies using data for births where no maternal morbidity was reported.
     - By considering all total births and then identifying those without reported maternal morbidity, `0result.sql` aligns with the requirement to assess the relationship comprehensively.
   - **Use of Previous Year's Census Data:**
     - The script correctly joins natality data with the poverty rates from the previous year's census data, as specified.

4. **Correlation Coefficient Results:**
   - **Higher Magnitude Correlation:**
     - The Pearson correlation coefficients obtained from `0result.sql` are slightly higher in magnitude than those from `2result.sql`:
       - 2016: **-0.0957**
       - 2017: **-0.0604**
       - 2018: **-0.0378**
     - This suggests a slightly stronger inverse relationship between poverty rates and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity, which might be more accurate due to the comprehensive data inclusion.

### **Conclusion:**

Given the above reasons, `0result.sql` provides a more accurate and appropriate analysis for assessing the relationship between poverty rates and the percentage of births without maternal morbidity for the years 2016 to 2018.
