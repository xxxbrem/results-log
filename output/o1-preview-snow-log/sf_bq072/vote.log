After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct and preferred query for the task. 

**Reason:**

- **Comprehensive Joins:** `1result.sql` includes a join with the **`RACE`** table (`JOIN DEATH.DEATH.RACE R ON DR."Race" = R."Code"`), which ensures that race codes are accurately mapped using official mappings. This makes the query more robust and adaptable to any changes in race codes or descriptions.

- **Clear and Readable:** By joining the **`RACE`** table and using `R."Code" = 2`, the query clearly indicates that it is filtering based on the race code corresponding to Black individuals. This enhances the readability and maintainability of the query.

- **Accurate Counts Using `COUNT`:** The query uses the `COUNT` function with `CASE WHEN` conditions, which is a standard and efficient method for counting occurrences that meet specific conditions.

- **Consistent Results:** Both queries yield the same results, but `1result.sql` follows better database practices by incorporating necessary joins, making it more reliable.
