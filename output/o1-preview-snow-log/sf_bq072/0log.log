2025-01-25 03:22:35 - root - INFO - Apologies for the oversight. The placeholder `<Black race code>` needs to be replaced with the actual race code for "Black". Based on your earlier query results from the `RACE` table:

```csv
Code,Description
2,Black
```

Therefore, the corrected SQL query is:

```sql
SELECT dr."Age", COUNT(*) AS "BlackDeaths"
FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
WHERE dr."Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
AND dr."Race" = 2
GROUP BY dr."Age"
ORDER BY dr."Age"
LIMIT 100;
```

Similarly, for the other queries involving Black deaths, replace `<Black race code>` with `2`.

**Corrected Queries:**

1. **Count Black vehicle-related deaths by age:**

   ```sql
   SELECT dr."Age", COUNT(*) AS "BlackVehicleDeaths"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
   JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE ic
   ON dr."Icd10Code" = ic."Code"
   WHERE dr."Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
   AND dr."Race" = 2
   AND ic."Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
   GROUP BY dr."Age"
   ORDER BY dr."Age"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Count Black firearm-related deaths by age:**

   ```sql
   SELECT dr."Age", COUNT(*) AS "BlackFirearmDeaths"
   FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
   JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE ic
   ON dr."Icd10Code" = ic."Code"
   WHERE dr."Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
   AND dr."Race" = 2
   AND ic."Description" ILIKE '%firearm%'
   GROUP BY dr."Age"
   ORDER BY dr."Age"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

**Compiling the Results:**

After running the corrected queries, you can compile the results into the requested CSV format.

```csv
Age,Total_Deaths_Vehicle,Black_Deaths_Vehicle,Total_Deaths_Firearms,Black_Deaths_Firearms
12,total_vehicle_deaths,black_vehicle_deaths,total_firearm_deaths,black_firearm_deaths
13,...
14,...
15,...
16,...
17,...
18,...
```

**Example with Sample Data:**

Based on the results from your previous queries, here's how you might fill in the table:

```csv
Age,Total_Deaths_Vehicle,Black_Deaths_Vehicle,Total_Deaths_Firearms,Black_Deaths_Firearms
12,59,number_of_black_vehicle_deaths_at_age_12,39,number_of_black_firearm_deaths_at_age_12
13,71,black_vehicle_deaths,71,black_firearm_deaths
14,93,black_vehicle_deaths,105,black_firearm_deaths
15,133,black_vehicle_deaths,164,black_firearm_deaths
16,263,black_vehicle_deaths,245,black_firearm_deaths
17,341,black_vehicle_deaths,340,black_firearm_deaths
18,494,black_vehicle_deaths,495,black_firearm_deaths
```

Replace `number_of_black_vehicle_deaths_at_age_12`, `black_vehicle_deaths`, and `black_firearm_deaths` with the actual numbers from your query results.

**Brief Explanation:**

- **Total_Deaths_Vehicle**: Total deaths due to vehicle-related incidents at each age.
- **Black_Deaths_Vehicle**: Number of deaths among Black individuals due to vehicle-related incidents at each age.
- **Total_Deaths_Firearms**: Total deaths due to firearms at each age.
- **Black_Deaths_Firearms**: Number of deaths among Black individuals due to firearms at each age.

By correcting the SQL queries and running them, you should be able to gather the necessary data to fill out the table accurately.

**Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **`"Age"`**: Age of the deceased.
  - *Usage*: Filter records for ages between 12 and 18.
  - *Condition*: `WHERE "Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18`

- **`"Race"`**: Race code of the deceased.
  - *Usage*: Identify Black individuals by matching race codes.
  - *Condition*: `WHERE "Race" = <Black race code>`

- **`"Icd10Code"`**: ICD10 code representing the cause of death.
  - *Usage*: Identify deaths due to vehicle-related incidents and firearms.
  - *Condition*: `WHERE "Icd10Code" IN (<list of relevant codes>)`

- **`ICD10CODE`.`"Description"`**: Description of the ICD10 code.
  - *Usage*: Find ICD10 codes related to vehicles and firearms.
  - *Condition*: `WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'` or `WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%firearm%'`

- **`RACE`.`"Code"`** and **`RACE`.`"Description"`**: Mapping of race codes to descriptions.
  - *Usage*: Determine the race code for Black individuals.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filter records where age is between 12 and 18.
- Join `DEATHRECORDS` with `ICD10CODE` to get cause of death descriptions.
- Use `ILIKE '%vehicle%'` or `ILIKE '%firearm%'` to find relevant causes.
- Join `DEATHRECORDS` with `RACE` to get race descriptions.

Task: Please tell me the total and Black deaths due to vehicle-related incidents and firearms separately, for each age from 12 to 18.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Age,Total_Deaths_Vehicle,Black_Deaths_Vehicle,Total_Deaths_Firearms,Black_Deaths_Firearms
12,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
13,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
14,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
15,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
16,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
17,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
18,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int,deaths:int
```

This table displays the total and Black deaths due to vehicle-related incidents and firearms separately for each age from 12 to 18. The `deaths:int` placeholders represent integer values for the number of deaths, which would be retrieved from the database..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'DEATH': {'DEATH': ['ACTIVITYCODE', 'AGERECODE12', 'AGERECODE27', 'AGERECODE52', 'AGETYPE', 'BRIDGEDRACEFLAG', 'DAYOFWEEKOFDEATH', 'DEATHRECORDS', 'EDUCATION1989REVISION', 'EDUCATION2003REVISION', 'EDUCATIONREPORTINGFLAG', 'ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS', 'HISPANICORIGIN', 'HISPANICORIGINRACERECODE', 'ICD10CODE', 'INFANTAGERECODE22', 'MANNEROFDEATH', 'MARITALSTATUS', 'METHODOFDISPOSITION', 'PLACEOFDEATHANDDECEDENTSSTATUS', 'PLACEOFINJURY', 'RACE', 'RACEIMPUTATIONFLAG', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE5', 'RECORDAXISCONDITIONS', 'RESIDENTSTATUS', 'TEMP_DEATHS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv

This table displays the total and Black deaths due to vehicle-related incidents and firearms separately for each age from 12 to 18. The `deaths:int` placeholders represent integer values for the number of deaths, which would be retrieved from the database.
