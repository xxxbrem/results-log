After reviewing and comparing both SQL queries and their results, it is clear that **`0result.sql`** is the correct SQL to use for the following reasons:

### 1. Correct Tag Splitting
- **`0result.sql`** correctly handles the tags by splitting them individually. The tags in the dataset are separated by the pipe character `|`, and this SQL uses `SPLIT(U."tags", '|')` to separate them.
- **`2result.sql`** incorrectly assumes that tags are enclosed within angle brackets `<tag1><tag2>`, and uses `SPLIT(REGEXP_REPLACE(p."tags", '^<|>$', ''), '><')` for splitting. This does not match the actual data format, resulting in incorrect tag parsing.

### 2. Accurate Calculation of Reputation Score
- **`0result.sql`** accurately calculates the reputation score per tag by summing up 10 times the upvotes and 15 times the accepted answers, as per the task requirements.
- **`2result.sql`**, due to incorrect tag splitting, treats the entire tags string as a single tag, leading to incorrect aggregation and reputation score calculation for each tag.

### 3. Correct Identification of Top Tags
- The results from **`0result.sql`** show individual tags like `php`, `html`, `python`, `javascript`, which are expected and make sense in the context of programming-related tags.
- The results from **`2result.sql`** show combined tag strings like `html|http-headers|meta|owasp|penetration-testing`, which indicates that tags were not properly split, and thus the top tags listed are not accurate.

### Conclusion

Based on the above points, **`0result.sql`** provides the correct SQL query that matches the data format and accurately calculates the reputation score per individual tag for user `1908967`.
