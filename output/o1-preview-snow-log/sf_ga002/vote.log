After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **2result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- **Efficiency and Scalability:**  
  The query in **2result.sql** leverages window functions (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "Month" ORDER BY "Quantity" DESC)`) to identify the top product for each month in a single, combined dataset. This approach is more efficient and scalable compared to **1result.sql**, which performs separate queries for each month with `LIMIT 1`. Using window functions reduces redundancy and makes the query easier to maintain and extend to additional months if needed.

- **Ordering and Formatting:**  
  The final result in **2result.sql** uses `DECODE()` to order the months chronologically, ensuring the output is organized properly. Additionally, it formats the quantity using `TO_CHAR("Quantity", 'FM9999999.0000')`, providing a consistent numeric representation with four decimal places, which is helpful for readability and data consistency.

- **Consistency in Approach:**  
  While both queries aim to achieve the same result, **2result.sql** maintains a consistent method for all months by unifying the data before processing, which can prevent potential discrepancies that might arise from handling each month separately, as done in **1result.sql**.

- **Results Verification:**  
  Both queries produce the same results, confirming the correctness of **2result.sql**. However, due to the reasons mentioned above, **2result.sql** is more preferable.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the improved efficiency, better organization, and consistent formatting, **2result.sql** is the better choice.
