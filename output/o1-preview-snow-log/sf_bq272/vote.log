After comparing the SQL queries and their results, **Option 1 (1result.sql)** is the correct SQL for the following reasons:

1. **Excluding Both Cancelled/Returned Orders and Order Items**: Option 1 joins the `ORDER_ITEMS` table with the `ORDERS` table and filters out records where either the order item status or the order status is `'Returned'`, `'Cancelled'`, or `'Canceled'`. This ensures that all cancelled or returned transactions at both the item and order levels are excluded, providing accurate profit calculations.

2. **Correct Date Filtering**: It filters the `"created_at"` timestamp within the specified date range between January 1, 2019, and August 31, 2022, by converting microseconds to timestamps using `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(oi."created_at" / 1e6)`. This accurately selects the relevant data for the given period.

3. **Profit Calculation**: The query calculates profit by subtracting the product `"cost"` from the order item's `"sale_price"`, ensuring a correct computation of profit per item.

4. **Grouping and Ranking**: It groups the data by product name and month, and uses the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function with `PARTITION BY` to rank products based on total profit within each month. The `QUALIFY` clause efficiently filters the top three products per month.

5. **Data Integrity Checks**: By including conditions to check that `"sale_price"` and `"cost"` are not null, the query ensures that the calculations are based on valid data.

6. **Order of Results**: The final `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results first by month and then by total profit in descending order, providing a clear and organized output.

**Therefore, Option 1 provides the most accurate and comprehensive SQL solution for the task.**
