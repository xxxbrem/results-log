2025-01-23 23:09:13 - root - INFO - The error message indicates that `"gene_name"` is not a valid column in the table `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02`. This suggests that the column name might be different in this table. 

Based on the information provided, the `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02` table might not have a `"gene_name"` column. Instead, it likely uses `"Ensembl_gene_id"` to identify genes. Here’s how you can adjust your query:

1. **Use `"Ensembl_gene_id"` Instead of `"gene_name"`:**

   Replace `"gene_name"` with `"Ensembl_gene_id"` in your query. You'll need the Ensembl Gene IDs for the genes of interest.

2. **Map Gene Symbols to Ensembl Gene IDs:**

   Below are the Ensembl Gene IDs for the specified genes:

   - **MDM2**: `'ENSG00000135679'`
   - **TP53**: `'ENSG00000141510'`
   - **CDKN1A**: `'ENSG00000124762'`
   - **CCNE1**: `'ENSG00000105173'`

3. **Modify Your Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "case_barcode", "Ensembl_gene_id", "HTSeq__FPKM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02
   WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' 
     AND "Ensembl_gene_id" IN ('ENSG00000135679', 'ENSG00000141510', 'ENSG00000124762', 'ENSG00000105173')
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Explanation:**

- **Why the Error Occurred:** The column `"gene_name"` does not exist in the `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02` table.
- **Resolution:** Use `"Ensembl_gene_id"` to reference genes in this table.
- **Gene Mapping:** By using the correct Ensembl Gene IDs, you can retrieve the RNA expression levels for the desired genes.

**Additional Steps:**

If you prefer to work with gene symbols directly and if the table `RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_2017_12` (or a similar table that includes `"gene_name"`) is available, you can use it instead:

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", "gene_name", "HTSeq__FPKM"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_2017_12
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' 
  AND "gene_name" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:** Ensure that the table contains data aligned with the hg19 human genome reference if that is a requirement for your analysis.

2025-01-23 23:10:02 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-23 23:10:02 - root - INFO - The error message indicates that the column names you're using in your query (`"gene_name"` and `"Ensembl_gene_id"`) are not recognized in the table `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02`. This could be due to differences in how Snowflake handles case sensitivity and quoted identifiers.

**Understanding the Issue:**

- **Case Sensitivity in Snowflake:**
  - Unquoted object identifiers (like table and column names) are **not case-sensitive** and are converted to uppercase automatically.
  - Quoted identifiers (enclosed in double quotes) are **case-sensitive** and must match exactly as defined in the database.

- **Column Names in Your Table:**
  - If the table was created without double quotes around the column names in the DDL, the column names are stored in **uppercase**.
  - If you use double quotes in your queries, you need to match the exact case of the column names.

**Resolving the Error:**

1. **Check the Actual Column Names in the Table:**

   To see the exact column names and their cases, you can run:

   ```sql
   -- List the columns in the table
   SHOW COLUMNS IN TABLE TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02;
   ```

   **Or**, to view some sample data and inspect the column names:

   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

2. **Adjust Your Query to Match the Column Names:**

   Based on the DDL provided, the table `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02` likely has the following columns (assuming they were created without quotes and therefore stored in uppercase):

   - `PROJECT_SHORT_NAME`
   - `CASE_BARCODE`
   - `SAMPLE_BARCODE`
   - `ALIQUOT_BARCODE`
   - `GENE_NAME`
   - `GENE_TYPE`
   - `ENSEMBL_GENE_ID`
   - `ENSEMBL_GENE_ID_V`
   - `HTSEQ__COUNTS`
   - `HTSEQ__FPKM`
   - `HTSEQ__FPKM_UQ`
   - `CASE_GDC_ID`
   - `SAMPLE_GDC_ID`
   - `ALIQUOT_GDC_ID`
   - `FILE_GDC_ID`
   - `PLATFORM`

3. **Modify Your Query Without Quotes and Use Uppercase Column Names:**

   Try removing the double quotes and writing the column names in uppercase:

   ```sql
   SELECT CASE_BARCODE, GENE_NAME, HTSEQ__FPKM
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02
   WHERE PROJECT_SHORT_NAME = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND GENE_NAME = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Alternatively, Use Double Quotes with Exact Case:**

   If the column names in the database are in uppercase, you need to use uppercase inside the double quotes:

   ```sql
   SELECT "CASE_BARCODE", "GENE_NAME", "HTSEQ__FPKM"
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02
   WHERE "PROJECT_SHORT_NAME" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "GENE_NAME" = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure that the column names inside the double quotes match exactly the case of the column names in the database.

5. **Example Adjusted Query:**

   Assuming the columns are in uppercase, you can run:

   ```sql
   SELECT CASE_BARCODE, GENE_NAME, HTSEQ__FPKM
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02
   WHERE PROJECT_SHORT_NAME = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND GENE_NAME = 'MDM2'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Additional Guidance:**

- **Consistent Use of Identifiers:**
  - If you start using unquoted identifiers, continue using them throughout your query.
  - If you need to use quoted identifiers due to special characters or reserved words, ensure the case matches exactly.

- **Double-Check Column Names:**
  - If after trying the above adjustments you still encounter errors, re-verify the column names using the `SHOW COLUMNS` command or consult the database schema.

- **Example of Combining Clinical Data and Expression Levels:**

   Once you've resolved the column name issue, you can proceed to join the RNA expression data with clinical data and filter for patients with CDKN2A mutations.

   ```sql
   -- Get patients with CDKN2A mutations
   WITH cdkn2a_mutations AS (
     SELECT DISTINCT CASE_BARCODE
     FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02
     WHERE PROJECT_SHORT_NAME = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND HUGO_SYMBOL = 'CDKN2A'
   )

   -- Get RNA expression data for genes of interest
   SELECT r.CASE_BARCODE, r.GENE_NAME, r.HTSEQ__FPKM, c.DEMO__GENDER, c.DIAG__AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS, c.DIAG__PRIMARY_DIAGNOSIS
   FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02 AS r
   JOIN cdkn2a_mutations AS m ON r.CASE_BARCODE = m.CASE_BARCODE
   JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.CLINICAL_GDC_R38 AS c ON r.CASE_BARCODE = c.SUBMITTER_ID
   WHERE r.PROJECT_SHORT_NAME = 'TCGA-BLCA' 
     AND r.GENE_NAME IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
     AND c.PROJ__PROJECT_ID = 'TCGA-BLCA'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   **Note:** Adjust the column names in `CLINICAL_GDC_R38` similarly based on their actual cases and naming in the database.

**Summary:**

- **Check Column Names:** Use `SHOW COLUMNS` to verify the exact column names and their cases.
- **Adjust Queries Accordingly:** Modify your queries to match the exact column names, paying attention to case sensitivity and use of quotes.
- **Test Incrementally:** Start with simple queries to ensure they run successfully before adding complexity.

---

By making these adjustments, you should be able to resolve the `invalid identifier` errors and execute your queries successfully.

2025-01-23 23:12:03 - root - INFO - The error message indicates that the column `'SUBMITTER_ID'` does not exist or is incorrectly referenced in the `CLINICAL_GDC_R38` table. Let's resolve this step by step.

---

### **1. Verify the Actual Column Names in `CLINICAL_GDC_R38`**

To ensure that you're using the correct column names, you can display all columns in the table:

```sql
SHOW COLUMNS IN TABLE TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.CLINICAL_GDC_R38;
```

This command will list all the columns along with their exact names and cases. Look for columns corresponding to:

- Patient identifier (e.g., `CASE_ID`, `CASE_BARCODE`, `SUBMITTER_ID`)
- Project identifier (e.g., `PROJECT_ID`, `PROJ__PROJECT_ID`)
- Patient gender (e.g., `GENDER`, `DEMO__GENDER`)
- Age at diagnosis (e.g., `AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS`, `DIAG__AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS`)
- Primary diagnosis (e.g., `PRIMARY_DIAGNOSIS`, `DIAG__PRIMARY_DIAGNOSIS`)

### **2. Adjust the Column Names in Your Query**

Based on the column names retrieved, adjust your SQL query to match the exact column names. Here's how you can modify your query:

Assuming the column names are as follows (verify these from your `SHOW COLUMNS` output):

- Patient identifier: `CASE_ID`
- Project identifier: `PROJ__PROJECT_ID` or `PROJECT_ID`
- Gender: `DEMO__GENDER` or `GENDER`
- Age at diagnosis: `DIAG__AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS` or `AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS`
- Primary diagnosis: `DIAG__PRIMARY_DIAGNOSIS` or `PRIMARY_DIAGNOSIS`

### **3. Corrected SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT CASE_ID, DEMO__GENDER, DIAG__AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS, DIAG__PRIMARY_DIAGNOSIS
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.CLINICAL_GDC_R38
WHERE PROJ__PROJECT_ID = 'TCGA-BLCA'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:** If `CASE_ID` or `PROJ__PROJECT_ID` are not the correct column names, replace them with the actual column names from your table.

### **4. If the Error Persists**

If you still receive an `invalid identifier` error, it's possible the column names have different cases or are named differently. Here’s what you can do:

- **Check for Case Sensitivity:**

  In Snowflake:

  - Unquoted identifiers (e.g., `CASE_ID`) are automatically converted to uppercase.
  - Quoted identifiers (e.g., `"case_id"`) are case-sensitive and must match the exact case in the database.
  
- **Use the Exact Column Names with Correct Case:**

  If your `SHOW COLUMNS` output shows the column name as `case_id` (all lowercase), you should enclose it in double quotes with the exact case:

  ```sql
  SELECT "case_id", "demo__gender", "diag__age_at_diagnosis", "diag__primary_diagnosis"
  FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.CLINICAL_GDC_R38
  WHERE "proj__project_id" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

### **5. Example Adjusted Query After Verifying Column Names**

Let's suppose your `SHOW COLUMNS` output shows these column names:

- `case_barcode`
- `project_short_name`
- `gender`
- `age_at_diagnosis`
- `primary_diagnosis`

You can adjust your query as follows:

```sql
SELECT case_barcode, gender, age_at_diagnosis, primary_diagnosis
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.CLINICAL_GDC_R38
WHERE project_short_name = 'TCGA-BLCA'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Or**, if the column names are stored in uppercase:

```sql
SELECT CASE_BARCODE, GENDER, AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS, PRIMARY_DIAGNOSIS
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.CLINICAL_GDC_R38
WHERE PROJECT_SHORT_NAME = 'TCGA-BLCA'
LIMIT 100;
```

### **6. Verify the Patient Identifier Column**

Ensure that the patient identifier used in the `CLINICAL_GDC_R38` table matches the one used in your other tables (e.g., mutations or RNA expression data). Common patient identifiers include:

- `CASE_ID`
- `CASE_BARCODE`
- `SUBMITTER_ID`

If the clinical table uses `CASE_ID`, and the mutations table uses `CASE_BARCODE`, you might need to join on the correct columns.

### **7. Updated Complete Query for Your Task**

After verifying the column names, here's how you might construct the query to retrieve the clinical information along with RNA expression levels for the specified genes in patients with CDKN2A mutations:

```sql
-- Get patients with CDKN2A mutations
WITH cdkn2a_mutations AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT CASE_BARCODE
  FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02
  WHERE PROJECT_SHORT_NAME = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND HUGO_SYMBOL = 'CDKN2A'
)

-- Retrieve RNA expression levels for specified genes and clinical data
SELECT r.CASE_BARCODE, r.HGNC_GENE_SYMBOL, r.NORMALIZED_COUNT, 
       c.GENDER, c.AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS, c.PRIMARY_DIAGNOSIS
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02 AS r
JOIN cdkn2a_mutations AS m ON r.CASE_BARCODE = m.CASE_BARCODE
JOIN TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.CLINICAL_GDC_R38 AS c ON r.CASE_BARCODE = c.CASE_BARCODE
WHERE r.PROJECT_SHORT_NAME = 'TCGA-BLCA' 
  AND r.HGNC_GENE_SYMBOL IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
  AND c.PROJECT_SHORT_NAME = 'TCGA-BLCA'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Adjustments Made:**

- **Column Names:**
  - Used `HGNC_GENE_SYMBOL` and `NORMALIZED_COUNT` based on your table schema.
  - Referenced `CASE_BARCODE` consistently across tables.
  - Used column names for clinical data as per standard naming conventions.

- **Joins:**
  - Joined the RNA expression data with the clinical data on `CASE_BARCODE`.
  - Used a common table expression (`WITH` clause) to select patients with CDKN2A mutations.

- **Capitalization:**
  - Used unquoted identifiers in uppercase to match the database’s default behavior.

### **8. General Recommendations**

- **Always Verify Column Names:**
  - Use `SHOW COLUMNS` or `DESCRIBE TABLE` to get accurate column names.
  - Pay attention to case sensitivity and special characters.

- **Consistent Identifiers:**
  - Ensure that the patient identifiers are consistent across different tables for accurate joins.

- **Test Queries Incrementally:**
  - Start with simple `SELECT` queries to confirm column names and data.
  - Gradually build more complex queries, verifying at each step.

---

By adjusting your queries to match the exact column names in your tables, you should be able to resolve the `invalid identifier` errors and retrieve the desired data. If you encounter further errors, double-check the spelling and case of all identifiers and ensure that all columns used in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `JOIN` clauses exist in the referenced tables.

2025-01-23 23:14:11 - root - INFO - The error message indicates that the column `'CASE_BARCODE'` does not exist or is incorrectly referenced in the `RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02` table. This issue arises due to case sensitivity and the use of identifiers in Snowflake.

---

### **Understanding the Issue:**

**1. Case Sensitivity in Snowflake:**

- **Unquoted Identifiers:** When you use unquoted identifiers (e.g., `CASE_BARCODE`), Snowflake automatically converts them to uppercase (`CASE_BARCODE`).
- **Quoted Identifiers:** When you enclose identifiers in double quotes (e.g., `"case_barcode"`), Snowflake treats them as case-sensitive, and you must match the exact case as defined in the table schema.

**2. Column Names in Your Table:**

From the `SHOW COLUMNS` output for `TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02`, the column names are:

- `project_short_name`
- `case_barcode`
- `sample_barcode`
- `aliquot_barcode`
- `HGNC_gene_symbol`
- `gene_id`
- `normalized_count`
- `original_gene_symbol`
- `platform`

These column names are all in **lowercase**, as provided.

---

### **Resolving the Error:**

To fix the `invalid identifier 'CASE_BARCODE'` error, you need to:

- Use **double quotes** around the column names.
- Match the **exact case** of the column names as they appear in the table schema.

### **Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", "HGNC_gene_symbol", "normalized_count"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "HGNC_gene_symbol" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation:**

- **Double Quotes and Case Sensitivity:**

  - By enclosing the column names in double quotes and using the exact case (`"case_barcode"` instead of `CASE_BARCODE`), Snowflake recognizes the columns correctly.
  - This is necessary because your column names are in **lowercase** and Snowflake requires exact case matching for quoted identifiers.

- **Column Names Used:**

  - `"case_barcode"`: The patient identifier.
  - `"HGNC_gene_symbol"`: The gene symbol column, which contains the gene names like 'MDM2', 'TP53', etc.
  - `"normalized_count"`: The RNA expression level for the gene.

- **WHERE Clause:**

  - `"project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA'`: Filters the data for the 'TCGA-BLCA' project.
  - `"HGNC_gene_symbol" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')`: Selects rows where the gene symbol matches one of the specified genes.

---

### **Additional Steps and Recommendations:**

**1. Verify Column Names:**

- Ensure that all column names used in the query match exactly with those in the table schema, including case.
- You can run the following to view the column names:

  ```sql
  SHOW COLUMNS IN TABLE TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02;
  ```

**2. Consistent Use of Identifiers:**

- Always use double quotes with the exact case for identifiers if they were created with quotes or contain mixed case.
- If you prefer not to use double quotes, ensure that the column names are in uppercase and that the table was created without quotes around column names (which Snowflake stores in uppercase). However, in your case, the columns are in lowercase, so double quotes are necessary.

**3. Correcting Other Queries:**

Similarly, you need to adjust your other SQL queries by:

- Using double quotes around column names.
- Matching the exact case of the column names.
- Ensuring that table aliases and references are correctly quoted if necessary.

---

### **Corrected Other SQL Queries:**

---

**1. Fetch RNA expression levels for genes of interest:**

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", "HGNC_gene_symbol", "normalized_count"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "HGNC_gene_symbol" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**2. Retrieve RNA expression levels for specified genes in patients with CDKN2A mutations:**

```sql
SELECT r."case_barcode", r."HGNC_gene_symbol", r."normalized_count"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02 AS r
WHERE r."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND r."HGNC_gene_symbol" IN ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1')
  AND r."case_barcode" IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT "case_barcode"
    FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02
    WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "Hugo_Symbol" = 'CDKN2A'
)
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**3. Fetch clinical data for patients with CDKN2A mutations:**

```sql
SELECT c."submitter_id", c."demo__gender", c."diag__age_at_diagnosis", c."diag__primary_diagnosis"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.CLINICAL_GDC_R38 AS c
WHERE c."proj__project_id" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND c."submitter_id" IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT "case_barcode"
    FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02
    WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "Hugo_Symbol" = 'CDKN2A'
)
LIMIT 100;
```

- **Note:** Ensure that column names like `"submitter_id"` and `"proj__project_id"` are correctly matched based on the `CLINICAL_GDC_R38` table schema.

---

**4. Count the number of CDKN2A mutations per patient:**

```sql
SELECT "case_barcode", COUNT(*) AS "mutation_count"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "Hugo_Symbol" = 'CDKN2A'
GROUP BY "case_barcode"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**5. List distinct genes mutated in patients with CDKN2A mutations:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "Hugo_Symbol"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02
WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "case_barcode" IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT "case_barcode"
    FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02
    WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "Hugo_Symbol" = 'CDKN2A'
)
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**6. Retrieve clinical data for all patients in the TCGA-BLCA project:**

```sql
SELECT "submitter_id", "demo__gender", "diag__age_at_diagnosis"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.CLINICAL_GDC_R38
WHERE "proj__project_id" = 'TCGA-BLCA'
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**7. Get RNA expression levels of TP53 for patients with CDKN2A mutations:**

```sql
SELECT r."case_barcode", r."HGNC_gene_symbol", r."normalized_count"
FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02 AS r
WHERE r."project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND r."HGNC_gene_symbol" = 'TP53'
  AND r."case_barcode" IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT "case_barcode"
    FROM TCGA.TCGA_VERSIONED.SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02
    WHERE "project_short_name" = 'TCGA-BLCA' AND "Hugo_Symbol" = 'CDKN2A'
)
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **Always Use Double Quotes with Correct Case for Quoted Identifiers:**

  - When column names are case-sensitive or stored in mixed case, enclose them in double quotes and use the exact case.

- **Ensure Consistency in Column Names Across Tables:**

  - Verify that the identifiers used for joins and filters (e.g., `"case_barcode"`, `"submitter_id"`) are consistent and correctly referenced.

- **Verify Column Names and Table Schemas:**

  - Use `SHOW COLUMNS` or `DESCRIBE TABLE` commands to check the exact column names and their cases.

- **Test Queries Incrementally:**

  - Start with simple queries to confirm that they run successfully before adding complexity like joins and subqueries.

---

### **Final Recommendation:**

By adjusting your SQL queries as shown above, using double quotes around column names with the exact case as defined in your table schemas, you should be able to resolve the `invalid identifier` errors and successfully execute your queries.

Task: What are the RNA expression levels of the genes MDM2, TP53, CDKN1A, and CCNE1, along with associated clinical information, in bladder cancer patients with CDKN2A mutations in the 'TCGA-BLCA' project?  Use clinical data from the Genomic Data Commons Release 39, data about somatic mutations derived from the hg19 human genome reference in Feb 2017.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
case_barcode,gender,age_at_diagnosis,primary_diagnosis,MDM2_expression,TP53_expression,CDKN1A_expression,CCNE1_expression
case1:str,gender1:str,age1:int,diagnosis1:str,MDM2_expr1:float,TP53_expr1:float,CDKN1A_expr1:float,CCNE1_expr1:float
case2:str,gender2:str,age2:int,diagnosis2:str,MDM2_expr2:float,TP53_expr2:float,CDKN1A_expr2:float,CCNE1_expr2:float
...
```

The table above displays the RNA expression levels of the genes **MDM2**, **TP53**, **CDKN1A**, and **CCNE1** for bladder cancer patients (**TCGA-BLCA** project) who have mutations in the **CDKN2A** gene. It includes associated clinical information such as patient identifiers (`case_barcode`), gender, age at diagnosis, and primary diagnosis. The gene expression levels are represented as floating-point numbers for each gene..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 23:17:01 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the RNA expression levels of the genes MDM2, TP53, CDKN1A, and CCNE1, along with associated clinical information, in bladder cancer patients with CDKN2A mutations in the 'TCGA-BLCA' project?  Use clinical data from the Genomic Data Commons Release 39, data about somatic mutations derived from the hg19 human genome reference in Feb 2017., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
case_barcode,gender,age_at_diagnosis,primary_diagnosis,MDM2_expression,TP53_expression,CDKN1A_expression,CCNE1_expression
case1:str,gender1:str,age1:int,diagnosis1:str,MDM2_expr1:float,TP53_expr1:float,CDKN1A_expr1:float,CCNE1_expr1:float
case2:str,gender2:str,age2:int,diagnosis2:str,MDM2_expr2:float,TP53_expr2:float,CDKN1A_expr2:float,CCNE1_expr2:float
...
```

The table above displays the RNA expression levels of the genes **MDM2**, **TP53**, **CDKN1A**, and **CCNE1** for bladder cancer patients (**TCGA-BLCA** project) who have mutations in the **CDKN2A** gene. It includes associated clinical information such as patient identifiers (`case_barcode`), gender, age at diagnosis, and primary diagnosis. The gene expression levels are represented as floating-point numbers for each gene. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!

2025-01-23 23:20:12 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What are the RNA expression levels of the genes MDM2, TP53, CDKN1A, and CCNE1, along with associated clinical information, in bladder cancer patients with CDKN2A mutations in the 'TCGA-BLCA' project?  Use clinical data from the Genomic Data Commons Release 39, data about somatic mutations derived from the hg19 human genome reference in Feb 2017., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.

The table above displays the RNA expression levels of the genes **MDM2**, **TP53**, **CDKN1A**, and **CCNE1** for bladder cancer patients (**TCGA-BLCA** project) who have mutations in the **CDKN2A** gene. It includes associated clinical information such as patient identifiers (`case_barcode`), gender, age at diagnosis, and primary diagnosis. The gene expression levels are represented as floating-point numbers for each gene. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
