After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL query is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
```

**Reason:**

- **Correct MetricID:** The query in `1result.sql` uses `MetricID = 'B01003_001E'`, which corresponds to the **total population** metric in the ACS data. This ensures that we're calculating the population distribution based on the total population of each block group and tract.
  
- **Accurate Calculation:** The query calculates the total population per census tract using a **window function** `SUM(f."CensusValue") OVER (PARTITION BY g."StateCountyTractID")`, which efficiently computes the sum for each tract without needing a separate subquery or `JOIN`.
  
- **Population Ratio:** It computes the population ratio of each block group within its tract by dividing the block group population by the total tract population. The use of `NULLIF` prevents division by zero, handling any cases where the total tract population might be zero.
  
- **Includes Required Columns:** The query selects all the necessary columns as per the task: `BlockGroupID`, `CensusValue` (block group population), `StateCountyTractID`, `TotalTractPopulation`, and `PopulationRatio`.
  
- **Optimized and Clear:** Compared to the other queries, `1result.sql` is more concise and avoids unnecessary complexity. It leverages window functions for better performance and readability.

**Note:** The query in `0result.sql` uses `MetricID = 'B11012_001E'`, which does **not** correspond to the total population but rather to household compositions. Therefore, it does not accurately fulfill the task requirements.

The query in `2result.sql` is also correct in terms of using the appropriate `MetricID` and calculations. However, it introduces additional complexity by using a `WITH` clause and a subquery to calculate tract totals, which is less efficient compared to the window function approach in `1result.sql`.

**Conclusion:**

- `1result.sql` accurately determines the population distribution within each block group relative to its census tract in New York State using 2021 ACS data.
- It is efficient, accurate, and includes all required data columns, making it the most suitable choice among the provided SQL queries.
