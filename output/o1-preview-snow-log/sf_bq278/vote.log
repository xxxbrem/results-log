After reviewing and comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here's the reasoning:

**Reason for Choosing `1result.sql`:**

1. **Correct Handling of NULL Values:**
   - **`1result.sql`** uses the `COALESCE` function within the subtraction inside the `SUM`, ensuring that any `NULL` values in `"existing_installs_count"` are treated as zero during the calculation. This precise handling prevents any potential errors that could arise from arithmetic operations involving `NULL` values.
   - In contrast, **`2result.sql`** does not handle `NULL` values in `"existing_installs_count"`, which could lead to incorrect calculations of the "Gap in Potential Installations" if `NULL` values are present in the data.

2. **Accurate Calculation of Gap in Potential Installations:**
   - **`1result.sql`** computes the gap by summing up the individual differences between `"count_qualified"` and `"existing_installs_count"` for each row, which provides a more accurate total gap considering potential variations at the row level.
   - **`0result.sql`**, while also handling `NULL` values, subtracts the total existing installations from the total qualified counts. While mathematically similar in many cases, this approach might not capture discrepancies that occur when individual rows have significant differences.

3. **Comprehensive Inclusion of Required Columns:**
   - The query includes all the necessary columns as specified:
     - Number of buildings available for solar installations.
     - Percentage covered by Project Sunroof.
     - Percentage suitable for solar.
     - Total potential panel count.
     - Total kilowatt capacity.
     - Energy generation potential.
     - Carbon dioxide offset.
     - Gap in potential installations.
   - It distinguishes between postal code and census tract levels by assigning the `'Level'` field appropriately and grouping the data accordingly.

4. **Clear and Structured Format:**
   - **`1result.sql`** presents a clear and well-structured query that is easy to read and understand, which aids in maintenance and future modifications if necessary.
   - The use of aliases and organized grouping enhances the readability of the query.

**Conclusion:**

- **`1result.sql`** effectively fulfills the requirement of providing a detailed comparison of the solar potential for each state, distinguishing between postal code and census tract levels, with accurate calculations and proper handling of data nuances.
