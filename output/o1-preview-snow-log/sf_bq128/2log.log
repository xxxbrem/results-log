## Patent Citations

Patent citations are citations to other patent documents. They take the form of backward (cited) and forward (citing) citations. Backward citations, also referred to as back citations or cited patent documents, refer to earlier patent applications or grants that affect the scope of the claims of an application. Forward citations or citing documents refer to later filings of applications that are affected by the scope of the claims of the cited document.

## Our Focus

We only focus on patents which are applied in the USA, and particularly in chemistry, biology, and medical-related fields. Concretely, the subsection id of Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) should be chosen from C5 to C13, or its group id is among the following set:
- A01G
- A01H
- A61K
- A61P
- A61Q
- B01F
- B01J
- B81B
- B82B
- B82Y
- G01N
- G16H

1. **PATENT**
   - `"id"`: Patent identifier. Used to join with other tables.
   - `"title"`: Patent title. Needed to retrieve the title.
   - `"abstract"`: Patent abstract. Needed to retrieve the abstract.
   - `"date"`: Publication date. Used to filter patents published in January 2014.
   - `"country"`: Country of application. We need patents applied in the USA (`"country" = 'US'`).

2. **CPC_CURRENT**
   - `"patent_id"`: Patent identifier. Used to join with the `PATENT` table.
   - `"subsection_id"`: CPC subsection identifier. Used to filter patents in subsections C5 to C13.
   - `"group_id"`: CPC group identifier. Used to filter patents in specified group IDs.

3. **USPATENTCITATION**
   - `"patent_id"`: Citing patent ID (the patent that cites another).
   - `"citation_id"`: Cited patent ID (the patent that is cited).
   - Used to calculate backward and forward citation counts.

4. **Conditions That May Be Used:**
   - Filter patents published in January 2014: `PATENT."date" BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2014-01-31'`.

Apparatus and system for imaging currency bills and financial documents and method for using the same,"A stack of a stack of currency bills is received, transported, and imaged. Image data reproducible as a visually readable image of one or more portions of at least one side of each currency bill in the stack is obtained. A serial number and at least one or more additional characters are extracted from the image data for each currency bill. A processor compares the extracted serial number and corresponding extracted one or more additional characters with stored serial number information and corresponding stored additional character information associated with the serial number information of genuine currency bills. The stored serial number information and corresponding stored additional character information uniquely identify a genuine currency bill. Any currency bill that does not have one or more extracted additional characters matching the stored serial number information and corresponding stored additional character information is flagged.",2014-01-28,622,1
MEMS-based micro and nano grippers with two axis force sensors,"The present invention relates to a design and microfabrication method for microgrippers that are capable of grasping micro and nano objects of a large range of sizes and two-axis force sensing capabilities. Gripping motion is produced by one or more electrothermal actuators. Integrated force sensors along x and y directions enable the measurement of gripping forces as well as the forces applied at the end of microgripper arms along the normal direction, both with a resolution down to nanoNewton. The microfabrication method enables monolithic integration of the actuators and the force sensors.",2014-01-07,1,0

Pneumatic tire,"A pneumatic tire exhibiting high traction performance. A center circumferential groove (14) is provided on the equator (CL) of the tread (12), and between shoulder circumferential grooves (18) on both sides of the center circumferential groove (14) are arranged first lateral grooves (20) formed at a smaller angle relative to the axial direction of the tire than the first lateral groove (20). One end of each first lateral groove (20) and one end of each second lateral groove (22) are made to merge at a shoulder circumferential groove (18), and shoulder lateral grooves (23) are arranged on the outer side of each shoulder circumferential groove (18). Each shoulder lateral groove (23) extends from the merging portion toward a tread end (12E) and is formed at a smaller angle relative to the axial direction of the tire than that of the first lateral groove (20). Because the angle of the shoulder lateral grooves (23) relative to the axial direction of the tire is less, traction performance of the tire increases.",2014-01-28,1,0

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Based on the provided database schema and the task requirements, the following table presents the patent title, abstract, publication date, backward citation count within 5 years, and forward citation count within 5 years for patents published in January 2014. These patents were applied in the USA and are classified in specified chemistry, biology, and medical-related CPC classes.

```csv
Title,Abstract,Publication_Date,Backward_Citation_Count,Forward_Citation_Count

```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTSVIEW': {'PATENTSVIEW': ['APPLICATION', 'ASSIGNEE', 'BOTANIC', 'BRF_SUM_TEXT', 'CLAIM', 'CLAIMS_2021', 'CPC_CURRENT', 'CPC_GROUP', 'CPC_SUBGROUP', 'CPC_SUBSECTION', 'DETAIL_DESC_TEXT_2021', 'DRAW_DESC_TEXT', 'DRAW_DESC_TEXT_2021', 'FIGURES', 'FOREIGNCITATION', 'FOREIGN_PRIORITY', 'GOVERNMENT_INTEREST', 'GOVERNMENT_ORGANIZATION', 'INVENTOR', 'INVENTOR_GENDER', 'IPCR', 'LAWYER', 'LOCATION', 'LOCATION_ASSIGNEE', 'LOCATION_INVENTOR', 'MAINCLASS', 'MAINCLASS_CURRENT', 'MATCH', 'NBER', 'NBER_CATEGORY', 'NBER_SUBCATEGORY', 'NON_INVENTOR_APPLICANT', 'OTHERREFERENCE', 'PATENT', 'PATENT_ASSIGNEE', 'PATENT_CONTRACTAWARDNUMBER', 'PATENT_GOVINTORG', 'PATENT_INVENTOR', 'PATENT_LAWYER', 'PCT_DATA', 'PERSISTENT_ASSIGNEE_DISAMBIG', 'PERSISTENT_INVENTOR_DISAMB', 'PERSISTENT_INVENTOR_DISAMBIG', 'RAWASSIGNEE', 'RAWEXAMINER', 'RAWINVENTOR', 'RAWLAWYER', 'RAWLOCATION', 'REL_APP_TEXT', 'SUBCLASS', 'SUBCLASS_CURRENT', 'USAPPLICATIONCITATION', 'USPATENTCITATION', 'USPC', 'USPC_CURRENT', 'USRELDOC', 'US_TERM_OF_GRANT', 'WIPO', 'WIPO_FIELD']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
