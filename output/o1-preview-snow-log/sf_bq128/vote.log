After comparing both SQL queries and their results, **1result.sql** is the correct query.

**Reason:**

- **Accurate Filtering of CPC Subsections:**
  - In **1result.sql**, the filtering of patents based on `subsection_id` uses the `IN` clause:
    ```sql
    c."subsection_id" IN ('C05', 'C06', 'C07', 'C08', 'C09', 'C10', 'C11', 'C12', 'C13')
    ```
    This explicitly includes only the desired CPC subsections.
  - In **2result.sql**, the filtering uses the `BETWEEN` operator:
    ```sql
    c."subsection_id" BETWEEN 'C05' AND 'C13'
    ```
    Using `BETWEEN` on strings can be error-prone due to lexicographical ordering, potentially including unintended `subsection_id`s that fall within the range but are not explicitly desired. For example, it might include `C05A` or other alphanumeric variations not intended to be part of the selection.

- **Precision and Clarity:**
  - **1result.sql** provides a more precise and explicit selection criteria, reducing the risk of including unwanted data.
  - The use of the `IN` clause ensures only the specified `subsection_id`s are selected.

- **Query Structure:**
  - **1result.sql** uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate backward and forward citations separately, which improves readability and may enhance performance.
  - By aggregating citation counts in the CTEs, the final `SELECT` statement is cleaner and more straightforward.

**Conclusion:**

Due to the explicit and precise filtering of CPC subsections and the clear query structure, **1result.sql** better meets the task requirements.
