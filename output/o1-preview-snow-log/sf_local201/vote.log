After analyzing the three provided SQL queries and their results, the SQL query in `0result.sql` best fulfills the given task. Here's the reasoning:

**Task Summary:**
Identify the first 10 words (of length 4 to 5, starting with 'r') sorted alphabetically that have at least one anagram. Provide the count of anagrams for each word.

**Comparison of SQL Queries:**

1. **`0result.sql`**

   - **Approach:**
     - Filters words starting with 'r' and of length between 4 and 5.
     - Calculates the sorted letters for each word in this filtered list.
     - Finds anagrams by joining this list with all words of length 4 to 5 in the dataset, matching on sorted letters and excluding the word itself.
     - Counts the number of anagrams for each word (excluding itself).
     - Sorts the words alphabetically and limits the result to the first 10 words.
   - **Result:**
     - Provides words like `raad`, `raash`, `rabal`, `rabat`, `rabi`, etc., with varying anagram counts, accurately reflecting the number of other words that are anagrams.
     - The anagram counts are meaningful and correctly exclude the word itself.

2. **`1result.sql`**

   - **Approach:**
     - Identifies all sorted letter combinations that have more than one word (potential anagrams).
     - Filters words starting with 'r' and of length 4 to 5.
     - Joins the filtered list with the anagram groups to get the anagram count.
     - However, it seems to include the word itself in the anagram count, and all counts are `2`, which may not provide accurate anagram counts.
   - **Result:**
     - The anagram counts are uniform (`2`), suggesting that it counts the word itself and one anagram, but does not provide the actual count of anagrams excluding the word itself.
     - Less informative for understanding the number of anagrams each word has.

3. **`2result.sql`**

   - **Approach:**
     - Uses a recursive CTE to split words into letters and sort them.
     - Joins words on their sorted letters to find anagrams, excluding the word itself.
     - Counts the number of anagrams for each word.
     - However, the anagram counts are all `1`, suggesting only one anagram per word.
   - **Result:**
     - The counts are consistently `1`, which may not accurately reflect cases where words have multiple anagrams.
     - May not capture all anagrams due to limitations in the approach.

**Conclusion:**

- **`0result.sql`** provides the most accurate and detailed results aligned with the task requirements.
  - It correctly identifies words starting with 'r' of length 4 to 5 that have at least one anagram.
  - It provides accurate counts of anagrams for each word (excluding the word itself).
  - The words are sorted alphabetically and limited to the first 10, as required.
