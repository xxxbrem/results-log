After carefully reviewing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for the following reasons:

1. **Accurate Joins:**
   - **Zip Code Match:** The query correctly matches the first five digits of the donor's ZIP code (`LEFT(TRIM(f."zip_code"), 5)`) with the ZIP code in the crosswalk table (`z."zip_code"`).
   - **Census Tract Match:** It directly joins the census tract GEOID from the crosswalk table (`z."census_tract_geoid"`) with the GEOID in the ACS data (`c."geo_id"`), ensuring an exact match without unnecessary transformations.

2. **Proper Filtering:**
   - **State and City Filters:** The query filters donations to those made by individuals in New York state (`TRIM(f."state") = 'NY'`) and specifically in Brooklyn (`f."city" ILIKE '%Brooklyn%'`).
   - **Date Range Filter:** It includes donations made between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020 (`f."transaction_dt" BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'`), which is essential for the task.
   - **Kings County Census Tracts:** The query filters census tracts to only those in Kings County by using the FIPS code (`z."census_tract_geoid" LIKE '36047%'`).

3. **Data Validity Checks:**
   - **Non-null Transaction Amounts:** It ensures that only valid donation amounts are considered (`f."transaction_amt" IS NOT NULL`).

4. **Clarity and Simplicity:**
   - The query is straightforward and avoids unnecessary string manipulations that could introduce errors.
   - It uses standard SQL functions and operators, enhancing readability and maintainability.

5. **Comprehensive Aggregation:**
   - **Grouping:** The query correctly groups the data by census tract GEOID and median income (`GROUP BY c."geo_id", c."median_income"`).
   - **Aggregation:** It calculates the average donation amount per census tract accurately (`ROUND(AVG(f."transaction_amt"), 4) AS "avg_donation"`).

In contrast, while `0result.sql` attempts to achieve the same goal, it involves unnecessary string manipulations and transformations that could lead to mismatches or errors in the joins. Specifically:

- It manipulates the census tract GEOID by stripping and padding, which adds complexity.
- It does not explicitly filter donations to those made in the year 2020.
- The matching of GEOID fields may not be precise due to the transformations applied.

Therefore, based on the correctness, clarity, and adherence to the task requirements, the appropriate SQL query is:

1result.sql
