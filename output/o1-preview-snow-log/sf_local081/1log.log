2025-01-21 15:30:57 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to the use of the aggregate function `SUM()` in the `ON` clause of your `JOIN`. In SQL, aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc., cannot be used directly in the `ON` clause because the `ON` clause is evaluated before the aggregation phase of the query execution. 

Here's why the error occurs:

- **Aggregate Functions in `ON` Clause**: The `ON` clause is used to specify the condition for joining tables and is processed before any aggregation (`SUM`, `COUNT`, etc.) happens. Therefore, using an aggregate function like `SUM()` in the `ON` clause is invalid and results in a compilation error.

To achieve your goal of categorizing customers into spending groups based on their total spending in 1998, you need to:

1. **Calculate the total spending per customer for 1998**.
2. **Assign each customer to a spending group based on thresholds in the `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` table**.
3. **Count the number of customers in each group**.
4. **Calculate the percentage that each group represents of the total customer base**.

However, without using subqueries or Common Table Expressions (CTEs), it's not possible to perform these steps because you need to first compute the total spending per customer before you can assign spending groups and perform counts.

**Solution:**

Here's how you can modify your query to achieve the desired result by using a subquery to calculate the total spending per customer and then joining it with the `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` table:

```sql
-- Calculate total spending per customer in 1998 and assign spending groups
SELECT grp."GroupName",
       COUNT(grp."customerid") AS "NumberOfCustomers",
       ROUND(COUNT(grp."customerid") * 100.0 / total_customers.total_count, 2) AS "PercentageOfTotalCustomers"
FROM (
    SELECT t."customerid",
           t."total_spent",
           cgt."groupname" AS "GroupName"
    FROM (
        SELECT o."customerid",
               SUM(od."unitprice" * od."quantity" * (1 - od."discount")) AS "total_spent"
        FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDER_DETAILS" od
        JOIN "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS" o
          ON od."orderid" = o."orderid"
        WHERE o."orderdate" LIKE '1998%'
        GROUP BY o."customerid"
    ) t
    JOIN "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD" cgt
      ON t."total_spent" >= cgt."rangebottom"
     AND t."total_spent" < cgt."rangetop"
) grp
CROSS JOIN (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "customerid") AS total_count
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."CUSTOMERS"
) total_customers
GROUP BY grp."GroupName", total_customers.total_count;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Subquery `t`**: Calculates the total spending per customer for orders placed in 1998.

    ```sql
    SELECT o."customerid",
           SUM(od."unitprice" * od."quantity" * (1 - od."discount")) AS "total_spent"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDER_DETAILS" od
    JOIN "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS" o
      ON od."orderid" = o."orderid"
    WHERE o."orderdate" LIKE '1998%'
    GROUP BY o."customerid"
    ```

2. **Join with `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD`**: Assigns a spending group to each customer based on their total spending.

    ```sql
    JOIN "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD" cgt
      ON t."total_spent" >= cgt."rangebottom"
     AND t."total_spent" < cgt."rangetop"
    ```

3. **Calculate Total Number of Customers**: Retrieves the total number of customers to calculate percentages.

    ```sql
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "customerid") AS total_count
        FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."CUSTOMERS"
    ) total_customers
    ```

4. **Final Grouping and Calculation**: Groups the data by spending group and calculates the count and percentage.

    ```sql
    SELECT grp."GroupName",
           COUNT(grp."customerid") AS "NumberOfCustomers",
           ROUND(COUNT(grp."customerid") * 100.0 / total_customers.total_count, 2) AS "PercentageOfTotalCustomers"
    FROM ...
    GROUP BY grp."GroupName", total_customers.total_count;
    ```

**Sample Output:**

```csv
GroupName,NumberOfCustomers,PercentageOfTotalCustomers
Low,number_of_customers_in_low_group,float_value
Medium,number_of_customers_in_medium_group,float_value
High,number_of_customers_in_high_group,float_value
Very High,number_of_customers_in_very_high_group,float_value
```

**Brief Explanation:**

- **GroupName**: The name of the spending group (Low, Medium, High, Very High).
- **NumberOfCustomers**: The number of customers in each spending group for orders placed in 1998.
- **PercentageOfTotalCustomers**: The percentage that each group represents of the total customer base.

**Note:**

- The `ROUND` function is used to format the percentage to two decimal places.
- The `total_customers` subquery retrieves the total number of customers from the `CUSTOMERS` table to calculate the percentage.

---

This modified query resolves the error by:

- **Using a Subquery**: The total spending per customer is calculated in a subquery, which is then joined with the `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` table.
- **Avoiding Aggregate Functions in the `ON` Clause**: Aggregate functions are used only in the subquery's `SELECT` clause and are not present in the `ON` clause.

**Next Steps:**

- **Run the Modified Query**: Execute the modified query to get the desired results.
- **Verify the Data**: Ensure that the counts and percentages align with your expectations based on the data.

**Additional Information:**

- **Understanding Spending Groups**: The `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` table defines the spending thresholds for each group.
    - **Low**: 0 to 999.9999
    - **Medium**: 1000 to 4999.9999
    - **High**: 5000 to 9999.9999
    - **Very High**: 10000 and above
- **Total Customer Base**: The total number of customers is derived from the `CUSTOMERS` table, ensuring the percentage reflects the entire customer base, not just those who made purchases in 1998.

---

**Final Result Format:**

Present the final results in the following format:

```csv
GroupName,NumberOfCustomers,PercentageOfTotalCustomers
Low,count1:int,percentage1:float
Medium,count2:int,percentage2:float
High,count3:int,percentage3:float
Very High,count4:int,percentage4:float
```

**Example:**

```csv
GroupName,NumberOfCustomers,PercentageOfTotalCustomers
Low,20,25.00
Medium,30,37.50
High,15,18.75
Very High,15,18.75
```

**Conclusion:**

By adjusting your query to calculate the total spending per customer in a subquery and then joining it with the `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` table, you can assign each customer to a spending group and perform the necessary counts and percentage calculations to meet your task requirements.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine how many customers were in each spending group in 1998 and what percentage they represent of the total customer base, we need to explore the relevant tables and columns. Below are the tables and columns that are pertinent to this task, along with their potential usage:

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **`CUSTOMERS`**

   - `"customerid"`: Unique identifier for customers.

2. **`ORDERS`**

   - `"orderid"`: Unique identifier for orders.
   - `"customerid"`: Identifier linking the order to a customer.
   - `"orderdate"`: Date when the order was placed (need to filter for the year 1998).

3. **`ORDER_DETAILS`**

   - `"orderid"`: Identifier linking order details to orders.
   - `"unitprice"`: Price of a single unit of the product at the time of the order.
   - `"quantity"`: Quantity of units ordered.
   - `"discount"`: Discount applied to the order line (expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1).

4. **`CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD`**

   - `"groupname"`: Name of the spending group.
   - `"rangebottom"`: Lower bound of spending for the group.
   - `"rangetop"`: Upper bound of spending for the group.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Filter orders to include only those placed in **1998**.
- Calculate total spending per customer for 1998.
- Categorize customers into spending groups based on their total spending using the thresholds provided in `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD`.

Below are SQL queries ranging from simple to complex to help understand the data in these tables. All queries are limited to 100 rows and ensure that all column names are enclosed in double quotations.

---

1. **Retrieve a list of unique customer IDs from the `CUSTOMERS` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "customerid"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."CUSTOMERS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **View order information including order IDs, customer IDs, and order dates from the `ORDERS` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "orderid", "customerid", "orderdate"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Display order details including order IDs, unit prices, quantities, and discounts from the `ORDER_DETAILS` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "orderid", "unitprice", "quantity", "discount"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDER_DETAILS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve orders placed in the year 1998 from the `ORDERS` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "orderid", "customerid", "orderdate"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
   WHERE "orderdate" LIKE '1998%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate the line total for each order detail (unit price multiplied by quantity minus discount) from the `ORDER_DETAILS` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "orderid",
          "unitprice",
          "quantity",
          "discount",
          "unitprice" * "quantity" * (1 - "discount") AS "line_total"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDER_DETAILS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join `ORDERS` and `ORDER_DETAILS` to view order dates along with line totals:**

   ```sql
   SELECT od."orderid",
          o."orderdate",
          od."unitprice",
          od."quantity",
          od."discount",
          od."unitprice" * od."quantity" * (1 - od."discount") AS "line_total"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDER_DETAILS" od
   JOIN "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS" o
     ON od."orderid" = o."orderid"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Calculate total spending per order in 1998 by summing line totals, grouped by order ID:**

   ```sql
   SELECT od."orderid",
          o."customerid",
          o."orderdate",
          SUM(od."unitprice" * od."quantity" * (1 - od."discount")) AS "order_total"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDER_DETAILS" od
   JOIN "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS" o
     ON od."orderid" = o."orderid"
   WHERE o."orderdate" LIKE '1998%'
   GROUP BY od."orderid", o."customerid", o."orderdate"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate total spending per customer in 1998 by summing order totals, grouped by customer ID:**

   ```sql
   SELECT o."customerid",
          SUM(od."unitprice" * od."quantity" * (1 - od."discount")) AS "total_spent"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDER_DETAILS" od
   JOIN "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS" o
     ON od."orderid" = o."orderid"
   WHERE o."orderdate" LIKE '1998%'
   GROUP BY o."customerid"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Retrieve spending group thresholds from the `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "groupname", "rangebottom", "rangetop"
   FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Attempt to categorize customers into spending groups based on their total spending (Note: Due to SQL limitations without subqueries or CTEs, this query may not execute as intended, but demonstrates the approach):**

    ```sql
    SELECT o."customerid",
           SUM(od."unitprice" * od."quantity" * (1 - od."discount")) AS "total_spent",
           cgt."groupname"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDER_DETAILS" od
    JOIN "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS" o
      ON od."orderid" = o."orderid"
    JOIN "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD" cgt
      ON SUM(od."unitprice" * od."quantity" * (1 - od."discount")) >= cgt."rangebottom"
     AND SUM(od."unitprice" * od."quantity" * (1 - od."discount")) < cgt."rangetop"
    WHERE o."orderdate" LIKE '1998%'
    GROUP BY o."customerid", cgt."groupname", cgt."rangebottom", cgt."rangetop"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

    *Note:* SQL does not allow the use of aggregate functions like `SUM` directly in `JOIN` conditions without subqueries or Common Table Expressions (CTEs). To correctly execute this query, a subquery to calculate `total_spent` per customer would be necessary. However, per the instructions, subqueries and CTEs are to be avoided.

11. **Count the total number of unique customers from the `CUSTOMERS` table:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "customerid") AS "total_customers"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."CUSTOMERS";
    ```

12. **Count the number of customers who placed orders in 1998 from the `ORDERS` table:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "customerid") AS "customers_in_1998"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
    WHERE "orderdate" LIKE '1998%';
    ```

13. **Retrieve distinct order dates to examine the date range of orders from the `ORDERS` table:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "orderdate"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **List all spending group names from the `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` table:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "groupname"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Calculate the maximum order date to find the most recent order in the `ORDERS` table:**

    ```sql
    SELECT MAX("orderdate") AS "latest_order_date"
    FROM "NORTHWIND"."NORTHWIND"."ORDERS";
    ```

Task: How many customers were in each spending group in 1998, and what percentage of the total customer base does each group represent?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of customers in each spending group in 1998 and calculate the percentage of the total customer base that each group represents, we categorize customers based on their total spending during that year using the thresholds defined in the `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` table. The results are presented in the following format:

```csv
GroupName,NumberOfCustomers,PercentageOfTotalCustomers
group1:str,count1:int,percentage1:float
group2:str,count2:int,percentage2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NORTHWIND': {'NORTHWIND': ['CATEGORIES', 'CUSTOMERCUSTOMERDEMO', 'CUSTOMERDEMOGRAPHICS', 'CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD', 'CUSTOMERS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMPLOYEETERRITORIES', 'ORDERS', 'ORDER_DETAILS', 'PRODUCTS', 'REGION', 'SHIPPERS', 'SUPPLIERS', 'TERRITORIES', 'USSTATES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of customers in each spending group in 1998 and calculate the percentage of the total customer base that each group represents, we categorize customers based on their total spending during that year using the thresholds defined in the `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` table. The results are presented in the following format:

```csv
GroupName,NumberOfCustomers,PercentageOfTotalCustomers
group1:str,count1:int,percentage1:float
group2:str,count2:int,percentage2:float
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
