**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.CUSTOMERS`
   - `"customerid"`: To identify unique customers.
   - `"companyname"`: Potentially used for customer names.

2. **Table:** `NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS`
   - `"orderid"`: To join with `ORDER_DETAILS`.
   - `"customerid"`: To associate orders with customers.
   - `"orderdate"`: To filter orders placed in 1998.
     - **Condition:** `"orderdate"` LIKE '%1998%'

3. **Table:** `NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDER_DETAILS`
   - `"orderid"`: To join with `ORDERS`.
   - `"unitprice"`: To calculate spending amount per item.
   - `"quantity"`: To calculate total spending per item.
   - `"discount"`: To adjust the total spending per item.

4. **Table:** `NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD`
   - `"groupname"`: Name of each spending group.
   - `"rangebottom"`: Minimum spending amount for the group.
   - `"rangetop"`: Maximum spending amount for the group.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter orders placed in 1998 using `"orderdate"` LIKE '%1998%'.
- Join `ORDERS` and `ORDER_DETAILS` on `"orderid"`.
- Join `ORDERS` and `CUSTOMERS` on `"customerid"`.
- Calculate total spending per customer by summing (`"unitprice"` * `"quantity"`) adjusted for `"discount"`.
- Compare total spending with thresholds in `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` to determine spending groups.

**SQL Queries to Explore the Data:**

1. **List all customers:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "customerid"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.CUSTOMERS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve orders placed in 1998:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "orderid", "customerid", "orderdate"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS
   WHERE "orderdate" LIKE '%1998%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get order details for orders placed in 1998:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ORDER_DETAILS"."orderid", "ORDER_DETAILS"."productid", "ORDER_DETAILS"."unitprice", "ORDER_DETAILS"."quantity", "ORDER_DETAILS"."discount"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDER_DETAILS AS "ORDER_DETAILS"
   JOIN NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS AS "ORDERS"
     ON "ORDER_DETAILS"."orderid" = "ORDERS"."orderid"
   WHERE "ORDERS"."orderdate" LIKE '%1998%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Count the number of orders per customer in 1998:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "customerid", COUNT(*) AS "order_count"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS
   WHERE "orderdate" LIKE '%1998%'
   GROUP BY "customerid"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Calculate total amount per order in 1998:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ORDER_DETAILS"."orderid", SUM(("unitprice" * "quantity") * (1 - "discount")) AS "order_total"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDER_DETAILS AS "ORDER_DETAILS"
   JOIN NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS AS "ORDERS"
     ON "ORDER_DETAILS"."orderid" = "ORDERS"."orderid"
   WHERE "ORDERS"."orderdate" LIKE '%1998%'
   GROUP BY "ORDER_DETAILS"."orderid"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Find total spending per customer in 1998:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "ORDERS"."customerid", SUM(("unitprice" * "quantity") * (1 - "discount")) AS "total_spending"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDER_DETAILS AS "ORDER_DETAILS"
   JOIN NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS AS "ORDERS"
     ON "ORDER_DETAILS"."orderid" = "ORDERS"."orderid"
   WHERE "ORDERS"."orderdate" LIKE '%1998%'
   GROUP BY "ORDERS"."customerid"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Retrieve spending group thresholds:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "groupname", "rangebottom", "rangetop"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **List unique order dates to examine date formats:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "orderdate"
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Fetch all order details:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDER_DETAILS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Retrieve product information:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "productid", "productname", "unitprice"
    FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.PRODUCTS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Get total number of unique customers who placed orders in 1998:**
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "customerid") AS "unique_customers"
    FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS
    WHERE "orderdate" LIKE '%1998%'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Check the range of spending thresholds:**
    ```sql
    SELECT MIN("rangebottom") AS "min_threshold", MAX("rangetop") AS "max_threshold"
    FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List customers with their total number of orders:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "customerid", COUNT("orderid") AS "total_orders"
    FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS
    GROUP BY "customerid"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Fetch order dates and customer IDs to examine patterns:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "orderdate", "customerid"
    FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **List all customers who have placed orders (regardless of year):**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "customerid"
    FROM NORTHWIND.NORTHWIND.ORDERS
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: How many customers were in each spending group in 1998, and what percentage of the total customer base does each group represent?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the number of customers in each spending group in 1998 and calculate the percentage of the total customer base that each group represents, we categorize customers based on their total spending during that year using the thresholds defined in the `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` table. The results are presented in the following format:

```csv
GroupName,NumberOfCustomers,PercentageOfTotalCustomers
group1:str,count1:int,percentage1:float
group2:str,count2:int,percentage2:float
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NORTHWIND': {'NORTHWIND': ['CATEGORIES', 'CUSTOMERCUSTOMERDEMO', 'CUSTOMERDEMOGRAPHICS', 'CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD', 'CUSTOMERS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMPLOYEETERRITORIES', 'ORDERS', 'ORDER_DETAILS', 'PRODUCTS', 'REGION', 'SHIPPERS', 'SUPPLIERS', 'TERRITORIES', 'USSTATES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-21 15:32:10 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How many customers were in each spending group in 1998, and what percentage of the total customer base does each group represent?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine the number of customers in each spending group in 1998 and calculate the percentage of the total customer base that each group represents, we categorize customers based on their total spending during that year using the thresholds defined in the `CUSTOMERGROUPTHRESHOLD` table. The results are presented in the following format:

```csv
GroupName,NumberOfCustomers,PercentageOfTotalCustomers
group1:str,count1:int,percentage1:float
group2:str,count2:int,percentage2:float
...
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
