# Explanation of Metrics

## 1. Sales-to-CMA Ratio
- **Definition**: This ratio compares actual sales to the centered moving average (CMA) of sales.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Centered Moving Average (CMA)**: The CMA is a smoothed value of sales calculated over a rolling 12-month period. It averages sales from the months before and after a given month, specifically using two overlapping windows (5 months before and 6 months after, and vice versa).
  - **Sales-to-CMA Ratio**: The ratio is computed by dividing the actual sales amount for a month by its corresponding CMA value. A ratio greater than 2 indicates that the actual sales are more than twice the smoothed average for that period, suggesting significantly higher-than-average sales.

## 2. 12-Month Overlapping Windows
- **Definition**: A method to smooth sales data over time by averaging values in a specified window.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Window Size**: The window spans 12 months, with the specific approach involving overlapping periods. 
  - **First Window**: For a given month, this window includes 5 months before and 6 months after.
  - **Second Window**: Another window includes 6 months before and 5 months after the given month.
  - **Averaging**: Sales data is averaged over these two overlapping windows to compute the CMA. This method smooths out fluctuations by considering both the past and future sales in the calculation.

## 3. Restriction to the 7th and 30th Months
- **Definition**: A filter applied to focus calculations within a specific range of months.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Time Range**: Only the months between the 7th and 30th time steps (which correspond to specific periods) are considered for calculating the CMA and ratio.
  - **Purpose**: This restriction is used to avoid edge effects in the data where the moving average might be less reliable (e.g., at the very beginning or end of the available data). By focusing on these months, the calculations are more stable and meaningful.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filtering `"product_id"` for products **4160** and **7790**.
- Filtering `"mth"` for dates from **January 2016** onwards.
- Limiting to the **first 36 months** of data (January 2016 to December 2018).
- Adjusting sales data for seasonality during **time steps 7 to 30** (approximately July 2016 to June 2018).

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Select distinct product IDs from `MONTHLY_SALES`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.MONTHLY_SALES
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve all sales data for products 4160 and 7790:**

   ```sql

   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.MONTHLY_SALES
   WHERE "product_id" IN (4160, 7790)
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get sales data from January 2016 onwards:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", "mth", "qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.MONTHLY_SALES
   WHERE "mth" >= '2016-01'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve sales data for products 4160 and 7790 from January 2016 onwards:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", "mth", "qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.MONTHLY_SALES
   WHERE "product_id" IN (4160, 7790)
     AND "mth" >= '2016-01'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find the total number of months for which we have sales data for each product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", COUNT("mth") AS "months_of_data"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.MONTHLY_SALES
   WHERE "product_id" IN (4160, 7790)
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Check the sales data sequence for products 4160 and 7790:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", "mth", "qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.MONTHLY_SALES
   WHERE "product_id" IN (4160, 7790)
   ORDER BY "product_id", "mth"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get the range of months available for each product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", MIN("mth") AS "first_month", MAX("mth") AS "last_month"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.MONTHLY_SALES

Task: What is the average forecasted annual sales for products 4160 and 7790 for 2018? Use a weighted regression model based on sales data from January 2016, focusing on the first 36 months, with sales adjusted for seasonality during time steps 7 to 30.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To calculate the average forecasted annual sales for products 4160 and 7790 for 2018, we used a weighted regression model based on sales data from January 2016 over the first 36 months. The sales data was adjusted for seasonality during time steps 7 to 30. The results are as follows:

```csv
Product_ID,Average_Forecasted_Annual_Sales_2018
4160,value1:float
7790,value2:float
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-23 05:07:55 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing What is the average forecasted annual sales for products 4160 and 7790 for 2018? Use a weighted regression model based on sales data from January 2016, focusing on the first 36 months, with sales adjusted for seasonality during time steps 7 to 30., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To calculate the average forecasted annual sales for products 4160 and 7790 for 2018, we used a weighted regression model based on sales data from January 2016 over the first 36 months. The sales data was adjusted for seasonality during time steps 7 to 30. The results are as follows:

```csv
Product_ID,Average_Forecasted_Annual_Sales_2018
4160,value1:float
7790,value2:float
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
