2025-01-21 07:56:21 - root - INFO - **Thank you for bringing this to my attention.**

I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. You're encountering the error because the `"pickup_datetime"` column in the `"TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015"` table is stored as a `NUMBER(38,0)` representing Unix timestamps in **microseconds** since the epoch (January 1, 1970). 

To use date and time functions like `DATE()` or `YEAR()`, we need to first convert these numeric timestamps to the `TIMESTAMP` data type. In Snowflake, we can achieve this by dividing the microsecond timestamp by `1e6` (to convert microseconds to seconds) and then using the `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ()` function.

Here are the corrected SQL queries:

---

**Corrected SQL Queries:**

1. **Select sample `pickup_datetime` values converted to timestamps:**

   ```sql
   SELECT TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6) AS "pickup_datetime"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."NEW_YORK"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select sample `pickup_datetime` values on January 1, 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6) AS "pickup_datetime"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."NEW_YORK"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015"
   WHERE DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) = '2015-01-01'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select distinct pickup dates from the year 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) AS "pickup_date"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."NEW_YORK"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015"
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) = 2015
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Select rides on January 1, 2015, with pickup datetime and location:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6) AS "pickup_datetime", 
     "pickup_longitude", 
     "pickup_latitude"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."NEW_YORK"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015"
   WHERE DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) = '2015-01-01'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Select rides with their pickup point and corresponding ZIP code:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."pickup_datetime" / 1e6) AS "pickup_datetime", 
     t."pickup_longitude", 
     t."pickup_latitude", 
     z."zip_code"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."NEW_YORK"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015" t
   JOIN "NEW_YORK_GEO"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."ZIP_CODES" z
     ON ST_CONTAINS(z."zip_code_geom", ST_POINT(t."pickup_longitude", t."pickup_latitude"))
   WHERE DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) = '2015-01-01'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Select count of rides per hour on January 1, 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     DATE_TRUNC('hour', TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) AS "pickup_hour", 
     COUNT(*) AS "ride_count"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."NEW_YORK"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015"
   WHERE DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) = '2015-01-01'
   GROUP BY "pickup_hour"
   ORDER BY "pickup_hour"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Select top 100 busiest pickup ZIP codes on January 1, 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     z."zip_code", 
     COUNT(*) AS "ride_count"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."NEW_YORK"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015" t
   JOIN "NEW_YORK_GEO"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."ZIP_CODES" z
     ON ST_CONTAINS(z."zip_code_geom", ST_POINT(t."pickup_longitude", t."pickup_latitude"))
   WHERE DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) = '2015-01-01'
   GROUP BY z."zip_code"
   ORDER BY "ride_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Select ride counts by pickup hour and ZIP code for January 1, 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     DATE_TRUNC('hour', TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) AS "pickup_hour", 
     z."zip_code", 
     COUNT(*) AS "ride_count"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."NEW_YORK"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015" t
   JOIN "NEW_YORK_GEO"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."ZIP_CODES" z
     ON ST_CONTAINS(z."zip_code_geom", ST_POINT(t."pickup_longitude", t."pickup_latitude"))
   WHERE DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) = '2015-01-01'
   GROUP BY "pickup_hour", z."zip_code"
   ORDER BY "ride_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Select hourly lagged ride counts for January 1, 2015:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     DATE_TRUNC('hour', TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) AS "pickup_hour",
     COUNT(*) AS "current_hour_count",
     LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER(ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('hour', TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6))) AS "previous_hour_count"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."NEW_YORK"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015"
   WHERE DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) = '2015-01-01'
   GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('hour', TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6))
   ORDER BY "pickup_hour"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Select average ride counts over the past 14 days (assuming data availability):**

    ```sql
    SELECT 
      DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) AS "pickup_date", 
      COUNT(*) AS "ride_count",
      AVG(COUNT(*)) OVER(
        ORDER BY DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) 
        ROWS BETWEEN 13 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
      ) AS "14_day_avg"
    FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."NEW_YORK"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015"
    WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6) BETWEEN '2014-12-19' AND '2015-01-01'
    GROUP BY DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ("pickup_datetime" / 1e6))
    ORDER BY "pickup_date"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Converting Microseconds to Timestamps:**

  - The `"pickup_datetime"` column is divided by `1e6` to convert microseconds to seconds.
  - `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ()` is then used to convert the numeric seconds into a `TIMESTAMP` without time zone.

- **Using Date Functions:**

  - Once converted, date functions like `DATE()`, `EXTRACT()`, and `DATE_TRUNC()` can be applied.
  - `DATE()` extracts the date portion, stripping off the time.
  - `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ...)` retrieves the year component.

- **Time-Based Aggregations:**

  - Aggregations are performed over the converted timestamps for accurate results.
  - Window functions like `LAG()` and `AVG()` are used for lagged counts and moving averages.

- **Spatial Joins:**

  - Pickup locations are combined with ZIP codes using `ST_POINT()` to create geometries and `ST_CONTAINS()` for spatial containment checks.

---

**Additional Notes:**

- **Data Availability:**

  - For rolling averages and standard deviations over 14 and 21 days, ensure that data for prior days is available in the dataset.
  - Adjust date ranges in the `WHERE` clause as necessary based on data availability.

- **Alternative Functions:**

  - If the timestamps are stored in milliseconds instead of microseconds, adjust the division accordingly (use `1e3` instead of `1e6`).

---

**Example of Converting Timestamps:**

Suppose `pickup_datetime` has a value of `1420101581000000`.

- Convert microseconds to seconds: `1420101581000000 / 1e6 = 1420101581`
- Convert to timestamp: `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(1420101581)` results in `'2015-01-01 00:46:21'` (UTC)

---

**Apology and Assurance:**

2025-01-21 08:01:04 - root - INFO - **Thank you for bringing this to my attention.**

The error message indicates a data type mismatch in the arguments provided to the `ST_CONTAINS` function:

```
Invalid argument types for function 'ST_CONTAINS': (BINARY(8388608), GEOGRAPHY)
```

**Explanation of the Error:**

- **`z."zip_code_geom"`** is of type **`BINARY(8388608)`**. This column contains the geometry of the ZIP code areas in Well-Known Binary (WKB) format.
- **`ST_POINT(t."pickup_longitude", t."pickup_latitude")`** returns a **`GEOGRAPHY`** object representing a point based on longitude and latitude.

The `ST_CONTAINS` function requires both arguments to be of the **same type**—either both **`GEOGRAPHY`** or both **`GEOMETRY`**. Passing a `BINARY` and a `GEOGRAPHY` object causes the function to fail.

**Solution:**

Convert the `BINARY` geometry of the ZIP codes to a `GEOGRAPHY` object using the `ST_GEOGFROMWKB` function. This will ensure both arguments are of the same type.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT 
  TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."pickup_datetime" / 1e6) AS "pickup_datetime", 
  t."pickup_longitude", 
  t."pickup_latitude", 
  z."zip_code"
FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."NEW_YORK"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015" t
JOIN "NEW_YORK_GEO"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."ZIP_CODES" z
  ON ST_CONTAINS(
       ST_GEOGFROMWKB(z."zip_code_geom"), 
       ST_POINT(t."pickup_longitude", t."pickup_latitude")
     )
WHERE DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) = '2015-01-01'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`ST_GEOGFROMWKB(z."zip_code_geom")`**: Converts the WKB format of the ZIP code geometry into a `GEOGRAPHY` object.
- Both arguments in `ST_CONTAINS` are now `GEOGRAPHY` objects.
- The spatial join will now work correctly, matching taxi pickups to the ZIP codes they occurred in.

**Additional Recommendations:**

To ensure accurate results and avoid potential errors due to invalid coordinates:

1. **Filter Out Invalid Coordinates:**

   Add conditions to exclude records where longitude and latitude are zero or outside valid ranges.

   ```sql
   WHERE 
     DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) = '2015-01-01' AND
     t."pickup_longitude" BETWEEN -180 AND 180 AND
     t."pickup_latitude" BETWEEN -90 AND 90 AND
     t."pickup_longitude" != 0 AND
     t."pickup_latitude" != 0
   ```

2. **Optimize Performance:**

   Consider creating a computed column or view that stores `ST_GEOGFROMWKB(z."zip_code_geom")` to avoid recalculating it for every query.

   ```sql
   -- Example of creating a view
   CREATE VIEW "NEW_YORK_GEO"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."ZIP_CODES_GEOG" AS
   SELECT
     z.*,
     ST_GEOGFROMWKB(z."zip_code_geom") AS "zip_code_geog"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."ZIP_CODES" z;
   ```

   Then modify your query to use the view:

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."pickup_datetime" / 1e6) AS "pickup_datetime", 
     t."pickup_longitude", 
     t."pickup_latitude", 
     z."zip_code"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_GEO"."NEW_YORK"."TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015" t
   JOIN "NEW_YORK_GEO"."GEO_US_BOUNDARIES"."ZIP_CODES_GEOG" z
     ON ST_CONTAINS(
          z."zip_code_geog", 
          ST_POINT(t."pickup_longitude", t."pickup_latitude")
        )
   WHERE 
     DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(t."pickup_datetime" / 1e6)) = '2015-01-01' AND
     t."pickup_longitude" BETWEEN -180 AND 180 AND
     t."pickup_latitude" BETWEEN -90 AND 90 AND
     t."pickup_longitude" != 0 AND
     t."pickup_latitude" != 0
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Summary:**

- **Issue:** Data type mismatch in `ST_CONTAINS` function due to `BINARY` and `GEOGRAPHY` arguments.
- **Solution:** Convert `BINARY` geometry to `GEOGRAPHY` using `ST_GEOGFROMWKB`.
- **Action:** Update the `ON` clause in your `JOIN` to include the conversion.
- **Additional Tips:** Filter out invalid coordinates and consider optimizing your queries for better performance.

## ST_CONTAINS

Returns TRUE if a GEOGRAPHY or GEOMETRY object is completely inside another object of the same type.
More strictly, object g1 contains object g2 if and only if no points of g2 lie in the exterior of g1, and at least one point of the interior of B lies in the interior of A. There are certain subtleties in this definition that are not immediately obvious. For more details on what “contains” means, see the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM).
Although ST_COVERS and ST_CONTAINS might seem similar, the two functions have subtle differences. For details on the differences between “covers” and “contains”, see the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM).

Note This function does not support using a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection as input values.

Tip You can use the search optimization service to improve the performance of queries that call this function.
For details, see Search Optimization Service.

## Syntax

ST_CONTAINS( <geography_expression_1> , <geography_expression_2> )

ST_CONTAINS( <geometry_expression_1> , <geometry_expression_2> )


## Arguments


geography_expression_1A GEOGRAPHY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geography_expression_2A GEOGRAPHY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geometry_expression_1A GEOMETRY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

geometry_expression_2A GEOMETRY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.


## Returns

BOOLEAN.

## Usage notes


For GEOMETRY objects, the function reports an error if the two input GEOMETRY objects have different SRIDs.


## Examples


## GEOGRAPHY examples

This shows a simple use of the ST_CONTAINS function:

create table geospatial_table_01 (g1 GEOGRAPHY, g2 GEOGRAPHY);
insert into geospatial_table_01 (g1, g2) values 
    ('POLYGON((0 0, 3 0, 3 3, 0 3, 0 0))', 'POLYGON((1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2, 1 1))');

Copy SELECT ST_CONTAINS(g1, g2) 
    FROM geospatial_table_01;
+---------------------+
| ST_CONTAINS(G1, G2) |
|---------------------|
| True                |
+---------------------+



## GEOMETRY examples

The query below shows several examples of using ST_CONTAINS. Note how ST_CONTAINS determines that:

The Polygon contains itself.
The Polygon does not contain the LineString that is on its border.
SELECT ST_CONTAINS(poly, poly_inside),
      ST_CONTAINS(poly, poly),
      ST_CONTAINS(poly, line_on_boundary),
      ST_CONTAINS(poly, line_inside)
  FROM (SELECT
    TO_GEOMETRY('POLYGON((-2 0, 0 2, 2 0, -2 0))') AS poly,
    TO_GEOMETRY('POLYGON((-1 0, 0 1, 1 0, -1 0))') AS poly_inside,
    TO_GEOMETRY('LINESTRING(-1 1, 0 2, 1 1)') AS line_on_boundary,
    TO_GEOMETRY('LINESTRING(-2 0, 0 0, 0 1)') AS line_inside);

+--------------------------------+------------------------+------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| ST_CONTAINS(POLY, POLY_INSIDE) | ST_CONTAINS(POLY,POLY) | ST_CONTAINS(POLY,LINE_ON_BOUNDARY) | ST_CONTAINS(POLY,LINE_INSIDE) |
|--------------------------------+------------------------+------------------------------------+-------------------------------|
| True                           | True                   | False                              | True                          |

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `NEW_YORK_GEO`.`NEW_YORK`.`TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015`
   - **"pickup_datetime"**: Used to filter rides on January 1, 2015, extract pickup times, and compute time-based aggregations.
   - **"pickup_longitude"**, **"pickup_latitude"**: Used to identify pickup locations and create point geometries for spatial operations.
   - **"trip_distance"**: May provide additional context for rides (not directly specified in the task).
   - **"passenger_count"**, **"fare_amount"**: Could be used for further analysis (not required for this task).

2. **Table:** `NEW_YORK_GEO`.`GEO_US_BOUNDARIES`.`ZIP_CODES`
   - **"zip_code"**: ZIP code identifier, used to associate rides with pickup locations by ZIP code.
   - **"zip_code_geom"**: Geometry of the ZIP code area, used for spatial joins with pickup points.

**Conditions that May Be Used:**

- **Date Filter**: `"pickup_datetime"` is on January 1, 2015 (`'2015-01-01'`).
- **Spatial Join Condition**: The pickup point (created from `"pickup_longitude"` and `"pickup_latitude"`) falls within the ZIP code geometry using spatial functions like `ST_CONTAINS`.
- **Grouping**: Group data by pickup times (e.g., hourly) and ZIP codes to compute ride counts.
- **Time-Based Calculations**: Compute lagged counts, averages, and standard deviations over specified time intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, 14-day, 21-day).

These queries explore the relevant data and columns needed to understand and solve the task. They cover selecting pickup times, locations, aggregating ride counts, performing spatial joins to determine ZIP codes, and computing time-based metrics such as lagged counts, averages, and standard deviations.

Please note that some queries assume data availability for previous days to compute averages and standard deviations over 14-day and 21-day windows. If the dataset only contains data for January 1, 2015, these computations may not be possible without additional data.Query:

Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NEW_YORK_GEO': {'GEO_US_BOUNDARIES': ['ADJACENT_COUNTIES', 'ADJACENT_STATES', 'CBSA', 'CNECTA', 'COASTLINE', 'CONGRESS_DISTRICT_115', 'CONGRESS_DISTRICT_116', 'COUNTIES', 'CSA', 'METROPOLITAN_DIVISIONS', 'NATIONAL_OUTLINE', 'NWS_FORECAST_REGIONS', 'RAILWAYS', 'STATES', 'URBAN_AREAS', 'ZIP_CODES'], 'NEW_YORK': ['CITIBIKE_STATIONS', 'CITIBIKE_TRIPS', 'NYPD_MV_COLLISIONS', 'TLC_FHV_TRIPS_2015', 'TLC_FHV_TRIPS_2016', 'TLC_GREEN_TRIPS_2013', 'TLC_GREEN_TRIPS_2014', 'TLC_GREEN_TRIPS_2015', 'TLC_GREEN_TRIPS_2016', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2009', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2010', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2011', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2012', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2013', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2014', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2016', 'TREE_CENSUS_1995', 'TREE_CENSUS_2005', 'TREE_CENSUS_2015', 'TREE_SPECIES', '_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
