# Explanation of Metrics

## 1. Sales-to-CMA Ratio
- **Definition**: This ratio compares actual sales to the centered moving average (CMA) of sales.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Centered Moving Average (CMA)**: The CMA is a smoothed value of sales calculated over a rolling 12-month period. It averages sales from the months before and after a given month, specifically using two overlapping windows (5 months before and 6 months after, and vice versa).
  - **Sales-to-CMA Ratio**: The ratio is computed by dividing the actual sales amount for a month by its corresponding CMA value. A ratio greater than 2 indicates that the actual sales are more than twice the smoothed average for that period, suggesting significantly higher-than-average sales.

## 2. 12-Month Overlapping Windows
- **Definition**: A method to smooth sales data over time by averaging values in a specified window.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Window Size**: The window spans 12 months, with the specific approach involving overlapping periods. 
  - **First Window**: For a given month, this window includes 5 months before and 6 months after.
  - **Second Window**: Another window includes 6 months before and 5 months after the given month.
  - **Averaging**: Sales data is averaged over these two overlapping windows to compute the CMA. This method smooths out fluctuations by considering both the past and future sales in the calculation.

## 3. Restriction to the 7th and 30th Months
- **Definition**: A filter applied to focus calculations within a specific range of months.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Time Range**: Only the months between the 7th and 30th time steps (which correspond to specific periods) are considered for calculating the CMA and ratio.
  - **Purpose**: This restriction is used to avoid edge effects in the data where the moving average might be less reliable (e.g., at the very beginning or end of the available data). By focusing on these months, the calculations are more stable and meaningful.

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table:** `PRODUCTS`

   - **Column:** `"id"`: Product identifier
   - **Column:** `"name"`: Product name
     - *Potential usage:* To map `product_id` from the `MONTHLY_SALES` table to product names.

2. **Table:** `MONTHLY_SALES`

   - **Column:** `"product_id"`: References `"id"` in the `PRODUCTS` table.
   - **Column:** `"mth"`: Month of the sales data.
   - **Column:** `"qty"`: Quantity sold in that month.
     - *Potential usage:* Provides monthly sales quantities per product to calculate the seasonality-adjusted sales ratio.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Analyze sales data from January 2016 onwards.
- Focus on the months between the 7th and 30th time steps, corresponding to July 2016 to December 2018, for calculating the centered moving average (CMA).
- Identify products with a sales-to-CMA ratio consistently above 2 for every month in 2017.

---

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve all product IDs and names from the `PRODUCTS` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve all product IDs, months, and quantities from the `MONTHLY_SALES` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", "mth", "qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Find all distinct months in the `MONTHLY_SALES` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "mth"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
   ORDER BY "mth"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Determine the range of sales data dates:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN("mth") AS "Earliest Month", MAX("mth") AS "Latest Month"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES";
   ```

5. **Calculate the total quantity sold per product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
   GROUP BY "product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Join `PRODUCTS` and `MONTHLY_SALES` to get product names with their monthly sales quantities:**

   ```sql
   SELECT p."id" AS "product_id", p."name" AS "product_name", m."mth", m."qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS" p
   JOIN "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES" m ON p."id" = m."product_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Retrieve monthly sales data for a specific product (e.g., `product_id` = 1) ordered by month:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "mth", "qty"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
   WHERE "product_id" = 1
   ORDER BY "mth"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Count the total number of products in the `PRODUCTS` table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total Products"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."PRODUCTS";
   ```

9. **Identify products with sales data in both 2016 and 2017:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
   WHERE "mth" LIKE '2016-%'
   INTERSECT
   SELECT DISTINCT "product_id"
   FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
   WHERE "mth" LIKE '2017-%'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Find the number of months of sales data available per product:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", COUNT(DISTINCT "mth") AS "number_of_months"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
    GROUP BY "product_id"
    ORDER BY "number_of_months" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Calculate the average monthly sales quantity per product:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", AVG("qty") AS "average_monthly_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
    GROUP BY "product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Retrieve total sales quantities for each product in 2017:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty_2017"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
    WHERE "mth" LIKE '2017-%'
    GROUP BY "product_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List total sales quantities per month across all products:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "mth", SUM("qty") AS "total_monthly_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"

    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "mth") = 12
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Select the top 10 products by total sales quantity in 2017:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", SUM("qty") AS "total_qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
    WHERE "mth" LIKE '2017-%'
    GROUP BY "product_id"
    ORDER BY "total_qty" DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

16. **Retrieve the months and quantities for products to analyze sales trends:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", "mth", "qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
    WHERE "mth" >= '2016-01' AND "mth" <= '2017-12'
    ORDER BY "product_id", "mth"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

17. **Check the sales quantities for each product in the months between July 2016 and December 2017:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", "mth", "qty"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
    WHERE "mth" >= '2016-07' AND "mth" <= '2017-12'
    ORDER BY "product_id", "mth"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

18. **Identify products with consistently increasing sales in 2017:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
    WHERE "mth" LIKE '2017-%'
    GROUP BY "product_id"
    HAVING MIN("qty") = MAX("qty")
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

19. **Find the monthly sales ratio to the average sales per product:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id", "mth", "qty", ( "qty" / AVG("qty") OVER (PARTITION BY "product_id") ) AS "sales_ratio"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
    ORDER BY "product_id", "mth"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

20. **Retrieve the products that had sales quantities greater than twice their average in every month of 2017:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "product_id"
    FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES"
    WHERE "mth" LIKE '2017-%' AND "qty" > 2 * (SELECT AVG("qty") FROM "ORACLE_SQL"."ORACLE_SQL"."MONTHLY_SALES" WHERE "product_id" = "MONTHLY_SALES"."product_id")
    GROUP BY "product_id"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "mth") = 12
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

Task: Which products (by name) had a seasonality-adjusted sales ratio consistently above 2 for the entire year of 2017, based on monthly sales data from January 2016?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the products that had a seasonality-adjusted sales ratio consistently above 2 for every month in 2017, we analyzed the monthly sales data from January 2016 through December 2017. The seasonality-adjusted sales ratio was calculated by dividing each month's actual sales by the centered moving average (CMA) of sales, using overlapping 12-month windows as specified.

The products that consistently maintained a sales-to-CMA ratio above 2 throughout 2017 are:

```csv
product_name
Product1:str
Product2:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
