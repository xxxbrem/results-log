After reviewing the SQL queries and their corresponding results, I have compared each to determine which one best satisfies the task requirements.

**Task Requirements:**

- Generate a **daily detailed sales report** for each product under the 'Manufacturing' distributor view.
- Cover the **30 days leading up to February 6, 2022**.
- Include the following metrics:
  - **Total and average values** for:
    - Sales units
    - Revenue
    - Average selling price (ASP)
    - Glance views
    - Conversion rate
    - Shipped units
    - Shipped revenue
    - Net profit margin (PPM)
    - Inventory details

**Comparison of SQL Queries:**

1. **`0result.sql`**

   - **Includes:**
     - Daily data for each product.
     - Average values for ordered units and revenue using window functions (`AVG(...) OVER (PARTITION BY s."ASIN")`).
     - Calculates ASP, conversion rate, and includes inventory details.
   - **Missing:**
     - Totals for sales units, revenue, glance views, etc.
     - Total and average calculations for other metrics like shipped units and shipped revenue.
     - Does not compute total glance views or average conversion rates over the period.
   - **Conclusion:** Partially meets the requirements but lacks several total and average computations.

2. **`1result.sql`**

   - **Includes:**
     - Daily data for each product.
     - Calculates ASP and conversion rate.
     - Includes inventory details.
   - **Missing:**
     - Does not provide any total or average values over the 30-day period.
     - Lacks cumulative totals for sales units, revenue, glance views, etc.
   - **Conclusion:** Does not meet the requirement for total and average metrics over the specified period.

3. **`2result.sql`**

   - **Includes:**
     - **Daily data** for each product.
     - **Total and average values** for:
       - **Ordered units** (`Total_Ordered_Units`, `Average_Ordered_Units`)
       - **Ordered revenue** (`Total_Ordered_Revenue`, `Average_Ordered_Revenue`)
       - **Average Selling Price (ASP)** (`Average_Selling_Price_ASP_Avg`)
       - **Glance views** (`Total_Glance_Views`, `Average_Glance_Views`)
       - **Conversion rate** (`Average_Conversion_Rate`)
       - **Shipped units** (`Total_Shipped_Units`, `Average_Shipped_Units`)
       - **Shipped revenue** (`Total_Shipped_Revenue`, `Average_Shipped_Revenue`)
       - **Net profit margin (PPM)** (`Average_Net_Profit_Margin_PPM`)
     - Includes **inventory details**.
   - **Uses:**
     - A **common table expression (CTE)** with `WITH daily_data AS (...)` to calculate daily metrics.
     - **Window functions** (`SUM(...) OVER (PARTITION BY dd."ASIN")`) to compute total and average values over the 30-day period.
   - **Conclusion:** Fully meets all the task requirements by providing both daily metrics and aggregated total and average values for each product over the specified period.

---

**Reasoning:**

- **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query because it comprehensively satisfies the task requirements by including both daily data and the required total and average metrics computed over the 30-day period for each product.
- It effectively uses window functions to calculate cumulative totals and averages without losing the daily granularity of the data.
- The query joins the necessary tables (`SALES`, `TRAFFIC`, `NET_PPM`, `INVENTORY`) and correctly filters for the 'Manufacturing' distributor view and the specified date range.
- By including all required metrics and computations, `2result.sql` provides a complete and detailed sales report as specified.
