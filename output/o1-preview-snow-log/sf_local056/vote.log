After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here's the reasoning:

- **Accurate Calculation**: `1result.sql` correctly calculates the monthly payment amounts, computes the changes between months for each customer, and then calculates the average of the absolute monthly changes per customer.

- **Appropriate Functions**: It uses the `SUBSTRING` function to extract the year and month from the `"payment_date"`, which is suitable for the date format in the dataset.

- **Correct Window Functions**: The query employs `LAG` window function to compute the monthly changes, which is appropriate for calculating differences between consecutive months.

- **Proper Ordering and Limiting**: It orders the results by the highest average monthly change, ensuring the customer with the highest value is selected.

Therefore, the customer with the highest average monthly change in payment amounts is returned by `1result.sql`.
