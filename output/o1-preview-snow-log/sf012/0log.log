table_name,WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.COMPANY_SECURITY_RELATIONSHIPS
description,"Map between companies and the securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) they issue, including security identifiers from common open sources, including OpenFIGI and PermID. Maps to Cybersyn's company index.

OpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.

Provides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.

The PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.

The PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.

These queries explore various aspects of the data, such as filtering by date, location, and specific events, as well as aggregating damage amounts by year. Adjustments like replacing placeholder GEO IDs or ZIP codes with actual values may be necessary based on the data in the `GEOGRAPHY_INDEX` table. By examining the outputs of these queries, we can gain a better understanding of the dataset and calculate the required total damage amounts for the City of New York from 2010 to 2019.Query:

Task: What were the total amounts of building and contents damage reported under the National Flood Insurance Program in the City of New York for each year from 2010 to 2019?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the total amounts of building and contents damage reported under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in the City of New York for each year from 2010 to 2019, we aggregate the `AMOUNT_PAID_ON_BUILDING_CLAIM` and `AMOUNT_PAID_ON_CONTENTS_CLAIM` fields from the `FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX` table. We focus on claims within the five boroughs of New York City—Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island—using the corresponding `COUNTY_GEO_ID` codes.

Here is the data presented in CSV format:

```csv
Year,Total_Building_Damage_Amount,Total_Contents_Damage_Amount
2010,total_building_damage_2010:float,total_contents_damage_2010:float
2011,total_building_damage_2011:float,total_contents_damage_2011:float
...
2019,total_building_damage_2019:float,total_contents_damage_2019:float
(Attention: answer in ten rows)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT': {'CYBERSYN': ['CLIMATE_WATCH_ATTRIBUTES', 'CLIMATE_WATCH_TIMESERIES', 'CYBERSYN_DATA_CATALOG', 'EIA_ENERGY_ATTRIBUTES', 'EIA_ENERGY_TIMESERIES', 'EUROPEAN_COMMISSION_EDGAR_ATTRIBUTES', 'EUROPEAN_COMMISSION_EDGAR_TIMESERIES', 'FEMA_DISASTER_DECLARATION_AREAS_INDEX', 'FEMA_DISASTER_DECLARATION_INDEX', 'FEMA_MISSION_ASSIGNMENT_INDEX', 'FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX', 'FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_POLICY_INDEX', 'FEMA_REGION_INDEX', 'FOOD_AGRICULTURE_ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTES', 'FOOD_AGRICULTURE_ORGANIZATION_TIMESERIES', 'GEOGRAPHY_INDEX', 'GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'NOAA_WEATHER_METRICS_ATTRIBUTES', 'NOAA_WEATHER_METRICS_TIMESERIES', 'NOAA_WEATHER_STATION_INDEX', 'OUR_WORLD_IN_DATA_ATTRIBUTES', 'OUR_WORLD_IN_DATA_TIMESERIES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-26 07:07:31 - root - INFO - To determine the total amounts of building and contents damage reported under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in the City of New York for each year from 2010 to 2019, we aggregate the `AMOUNT_PAID_ON_BUILDING_CLAIM` and `AMOUNT_PAID_ON_CONTENTS_CLAIM` fields from the `FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX` table. We focus on claims within the five boroughs of New York City—Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island—using their corresponding `COUNTY_GEO_ID` codes.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(year FROM "DATE_OF_LOSS") AS "Year",
    SUM(TRY_TO_DOUBLE("AMOUNT_PAID_ON_BUILDING_CLAIM")) AS "Total_Building_Damage_Amount",
    SUM(TRY_TO_DOUBLE("AMOUNT_PAID_ON_CONTENTS_CLAIM")) AS "Total_Contents_Damage_Amount"
FROM
    "WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT"."CYBERSYN"."FEMA_NATIONAL_FLOOD_INSURANCE_PROGRAM_CLAIM_INDEX"
WHERE
    "DATE_OF_LOSS" BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2019-12-31'
    AND "COUNTY_GEO_ID" IN ('geoId/36005', 'geoId/36047', 'geoId/36061', 'geoId/36081', 'geoId/36085')
GROUP BY
    "Year"
ORDER BY
    "Year";
```

This query:

- Extracts the year from the `"DATE_OF_LOSS"` field.
- Summarizes the total amounts paid on building and contents claims using `SUM(TRY_TO_DOUBLE(...))` to ensure numeric aggregation even if some values are stored as strings.
- Filters records to include only those within the specified date range and the five counties representing New York City.
- Groups the results by year and orders them chronologically.
