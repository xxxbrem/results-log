After reviewing the three SQL queries and their results, **`0result.sql`** is the correct choice for the following reasons:

1. **Accurate Calculation**: The query calculates the sum of absolute differences between the average temperatures correctly. It consistently uses the same methodology for all pairs, taking the absolute difference between the averages of each temperature parameter.

2. **Efficiency**: The inner `SELECT` statements in `0result.sql` specifically select only the necessary columns (`"year"`, `"month"`, `"air_temperature"`, `"wetbulb_temperature"`, `"dewpoint_temperature"`, `"sea_surface_temp"`). This makes the query more efficient by avoiding unnecessary data retrieval.

3. **Consistency**: The calculation methodology in `0result.sql` aligns with the task requirementâ€”computing the sum of absolute differences between the average air temperature, wet bulb temperature, dew point temperature, and sea surface temperature for each month between 2010 and 2014.

Compared to the other queries:

- `1result.sql` is functionally similar but selects all columns using `SELECT *`, which is less efficient.
- `2result.sql` changes the calculation method for the last three terms by taking the average of the temperature differences instead of the difference of the averages, which does not align with the task requirement.

Therefore, the correct SQL query is:

```plain
0result.sql
```
