After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script to answer the question:

*"What's the maximum monthly, weekly, and daily product revenues (in millions) generated by the top-performing traffic source in the first half of 2017?"*

### Reasoning:

- **Dynamic Identification of Top-Performing Traffic Source:**
  - **`1result.sql`** dynamically calculates the top-performing traffic source by aggregating the total product revenue for all traffic sources and selecting the one with the highest revenue.
    ```sql
    -- Identifying the top-performing traffic source
    product_revenue_by_source AS (
      SELECT
        t."trafficSource":"source"::STRING AS traffic_source,
        SUM(p.value:"productRevenue"::FLOAT) / 1000000 AS total_product_revenue_in_millions
      FROM sessions t,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t."hits") h,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(input => h.value:"product") p
      WHERE p.value:"productRevenue" IS NOT NULL
      GROUP BY traffic_source
    ),
    top_source AS (
      SELECT traffic_source
      FROM product_revenue_by_source
      ORDER BY total_product_revenue_in_millions DESC
      LIMIT 1
    ),
    ```
  - In contrast, **`0result.sql`** assumes the top-performing traffic source is `'(direct)'` without verifying if it truly is the top source in the dataset.
    ```sql
    -- Assuming '(direct)' is the top-performing traffic source
    AND t."trafficSource":"source"::STRING = '(direct)'
    ```

- **Accuracy and Generalization:**
  - **`1result.sql`** ensures accuracy by computing revenues based on the actual top-performing traffic source found in the data.
  - This approach makes the query more generalizable and robust, especially if the dataset changes or if applied to different time frames.
  - **`0result.sql`** may yield incorrect results if `'(direct)'` is not the top-performing traffic source, leading to potential inaccuracies.

- **Results Comparison:**
  - Both queries produce the same results because, in this specific dataset, `'(direct)'` happens to be the top-performing traffic source.
  - However, **`1result.sql`** validates this assumption, while **`0result.sql`** does not.

### Conclusion:

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL script as it accurately identifies the top-performing traffic source and computes the maximum product revenues accordingly.
