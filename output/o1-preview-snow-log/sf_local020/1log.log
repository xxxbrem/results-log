Begin Exploring Related Columns
To determine which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken, we need to consider the relevant tables and columns that provide information about bowlers, runs conceded, and wickets taken.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **`"BALL_BY_BALL"`**
  - `"match_id"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"over_id"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"ball_id"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"innings_no"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"bowler"`: Player ID of the bowler for each delivery.

- **`"BATSMAN_SCORED"`**
  - `"match_id"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"over_id"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"ball_id"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"innings_no"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"runs_scored"`: Runs scored off the bat on each delivery.

- **`"EXTRA_RUNS"`**
  - `"match_id"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"over_id"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"ball_id"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"innings_no"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"extra_type"`: Type of extra run (e.g., 'wides', 'noballs', 'byes', 'legbyes').
  - `"extra_runs"`: Number of extra runs conceded on each delivery.

- **`"WICKET_TAKEN"`**
  - `"match_id"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"over_id"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"ball_id"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"innings_no"`: To join with other tables.
  - `"player_out"`: Player ID of the batsman who was dismissed.

- **`"PLAYER"`**
  - `"player_id"`: To join with bowler IDs.
  - `"player_name"`: Name of the player (bowler or batsman).

**Potential Usage and Conditions:**

- Use `"BALL_BY_BALL"` to identify each delivery and the bowler who bowled it.
- Join `"BALL_BY_BALL"` with `"BATSMAN_SCORED"` to get runs scored off the bat.
- Join `"BALL_BY_BALL"` with `"EXTRA_RUNS"` to get extra runs conceded.
  - Include extras of type `'wides'` and `'noballs'` as they are attributed to the bowler.
  - Exclude `'byes'` and `'legbyes'` as they are not attributed to the bowler.
- Use `"WICKET_TAKEN"` to count wickets taken by bowlers.
- Use `"PLAYER"` to get the names of bowlers for readability.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **List of all unique bowlers:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "bowler"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Retrieve bowler IDs and their names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT p."player_id", p."player_name"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."PLAYER" p
   JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL" b ON p."player_id" = b."bowler"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Get all deliveries with runs scored off the bat:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "match_id", "over_id", "ball_id", "innings_no", "runs_scored"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."BATSMAN_SCORED"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Retrieve all extra runs conceded (all types):**
   ```sql
   SELECT "match_id", "over_id", "ball_id", "innings_no", "extra_type", "extra_runs"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."EXTRA_RUNS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get all wickets taken in matches:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "match_id", "over_id", "ball_id", "innings_no", "player_out"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."WICKET_TAKEN"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **List of deliveries bowled by a specific bowler (e.g., bowler with ID 5):**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL"
   WHERE "bowler" = 5
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Total runs conceded off the bat by each bowler:**
   ```sql
   SELECT b."bowler", SUM(bs."runs_scored") AS "total_runs_off_bat"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL" b
   JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."BATSMAN_SCORED" bs
     ON b."match_id" = bs."match_id"
     AND b."over_id" = bs."over_id"
     AND b."ball_id" = bs."ball_id"
     AND b."innings_no" = bs."innings_no"
   GROUP BY b."bowler"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Total extra runs (wides and no-balls) conceded by each bowler:**
   ```sql
   SELECT b."bowler", SUM(er."extra_runs") AS "total_extras"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL" b
   JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."EXTRA_RUNS" er
     ON b."match_id" = er."match_id"
     AND b."over_id" = er."over_id"
     AND b."ball_id" = er."ball_id"
     AND b."innings_no" = er."innings_no"
   WHERE er."extra_type" IN ('wides', 'noballs')
   GROUP BY b."bowler"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Total wickets taken by each bowler:**
   ```sql
   SELECT b."bowler", COUNT(*) AS "wickets_taken"
   FROM "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL" b
   JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."WICKET_TAKEN" w
     ON b."match_id" = w."match_id"
     AND b."over_id" = w."over_id"
     AND b."ball_id" = w."ball_id"
     AND b."innings_no" = w."innings_no"
   GROUP BY b."bowler"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate total runs conceded (runs off the bat + wides + no-balls) by each bowler:**
    ```sql
    SELECT b."bowler", SUM(bs."runs_scored" + COALESCE(er."extra_runs", 0)) AS "total_runs_conceded"
    FROM "IPL"."IPL"."BALL_BY_BALL" b
    LEFT JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."BATSMAN_SCORED" bs
      ON b."match_id" = bs."match_id"
      AND b."over_id" = bs."over_id"
      AND b."ball_id" = bs."ball_id"
      AND b."innings_no" = bs."innings_no"
    LEFT JOIN "IPL"."IPL"."EXTRA_RUNS" er
      ON b."match_id" = er."match_id"
      AND b."over_id" = er."over_id"
      AND b."ball_id" = er."ball_id"
      AND b."innings_no" = er."innings_no"
      AND er."extra_type" IN ('wides', 'noballs')
    GROUP BY b."bowler"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries explore different aspects of the data relevant to calculating the bowling average:

- Identifying bowlers and their details.
- Summing runs conceded both off the bat and through extras.
- Counting wickets taken.
- Joining tables to combine necessary information.

Each query helps in understanding how the data is structured and how it can be used to compute the required statistics without directly providing the final answer to the task.Query:

Task: Which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken, we calculated the total runs conceded by each bowler divided by the number of wickets they have taken. The total runs conceded includes runs scored off the bat (from `BATSMAN_SCORED`) and penalized runs such as wides and no-balls (from `EXTRA_RUNS` with `extra_type` of 'wides' or 'noballs'), and excludes byes and leg-byes. Wickets taken are counted from the `WICKET_TAKEN` table, linked to the bowler via the `BALL_BY_BALL` table on `match_id`, `over_id`, `ball_id`, and `innings_no`. The bowler with the lowest bowling average is thus determined.

```csv
Bowler_Name,Bowling_Average
bowler_name:str,average:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'IPL': {'IPL': ['BALL_BY_BALL', 'BATSMAN_SCORED', 'EXTRA_RUNS', 'MATCH', 'PLAYER', 'PLAYER_MATCH', 'TEAM', 'WICKET_TAKEN']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

ORDER BY ba."bowling_average" ASC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 1;
```

The query calculates the total runs conceded (runs off the bat and penalized runs for wides and no-balls) and the total number of wickets taken by each bowler. It then computes the bowling average by dividing total runs conceded by wickets taken. The bowler with the lowest bowling average is selected and their name and bowling average are displayed.

2025-01-24 21:15:15 - root - INFO - To determine which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken, we calculated the total runs conceded by each bowler divided by the number of wickets they have taken. The total runs conceded includes runs scored off the bat (from `BATSMAN_SCORED`) and penalized runs such as wides and no-balls (from `EXTRA_RUNS` with `extra_type` of 'wides' or 'noballs'), and excludes byes and leg-byes. Wickets taken are counted from the `WICKET_TAKEN` table, linked to the bowler via the `BALL_BY_BALL` table on `match_id`, `over_id`, `ball_id`, and `innings_no`. To ensure meaningful results and avoid anomalies from bowlers who have bowled very few deliveries, we included only bowlers who have bowled at least 6 deliveries. The bowler with the lowest bowling average is thus determined.

This query calculates the total runs conceded by each bowler and the number of wickets credited to them, ensuring that only wicket types credited to the bowler are included. By dividing the total runs conceded by the number of wickets, we obtain the bowling average. The query selects the bowler with the lowest bowling average.

2025-01-24 21:17:02 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken, we calculated the total runs conceded by each bowler divided by the number of wickets they have taken. The total runs conceded includes runs scored off the bat (from `BATSMAN_SCORED`) and penalized runs such as wides and no-balls (from `EXTRA_RUNS` with `extra_type` of 'wides' or 'noballs'), and excludes byes and leg-byes. Wickets taken are counted from the `WICKET_TAKEN` table, linked to the bowler via the `BALL_BY_BALL` table on `match_id`, `over_id`, `ball_id`, and `innings_no`. The bowler with the lowest bowling average is thus determined.

2025-01-24 21:20:11 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: To determine which bowler has the lowest bowling average per wicket taken, we calculated the total runs conceded by each bowler divided by the number of wickets they have taken. The total runs conceded includes runs scored off the bat (from `BATSMAN_SCORED`) and penalized runs such as wides and no-balls (from `EXTRA_RUNS` with `extra_type` of 'wides' or 'noballs'), and excludes byes and leg-byes. Wickets taken are counted from the `WICKET_TAKEN` table, linked to the bowler via the `BALL_BY_BALL` table on `match_id`, `over_id`, `ball_id`, and `innings_no`. The bowler with the lowest bowling average is thus determined.

```csv
Bowler_Name,Bowling_Average
bowler_name:str,average:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
``` The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
