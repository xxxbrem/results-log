After reviewing both SQL scripts and their results, I have chosen **`0result.sql`** as the correct answer.

**Reason:**

The script `0result.sql` accurately calculates the longest streak of consecutive inserted city dates for each country in June 2022 by effectively handling cases where multiple cities are inserted on the same date for a country. It uses the `DENSE_RANK()` function, which properly accounts for duplicate dates by assigning the same rank to identical dates within each country. This ensures that consecutive dates are correctly grouped when calculating streaks.

By computing the difference between the `DENSE_RANK()` and the day number since June 1st (`DATEDIFF('day', '2022-06-01', CAST("insert_date" AS DATE))`), the script identifies sequences of consecutive dates (streaks). It then finds the maximum streak per country and selects the countries with the overall longest streaks.

This approach is more precise in handling potential duplicates in the data compared to using `ROW_NUMBER()`, as seen in the second script `2result.sql`. Therefore, `0result.sql` provides a more accurate and reliable result for identifying the countries with the longest streaks of consecutive inserted city dates.
