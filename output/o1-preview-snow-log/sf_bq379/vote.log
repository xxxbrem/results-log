The correct SQL query is `1result.sql`.

**Reasoning:**

All three SQL queries aim to find the target approved symbol whose overall association score is closest to the mean score for psoriasis. Here's an analysis of each:

1. **`0result.sql`**:
   - Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate the mean score and the absolute difference between each target's score and the mean.
   - Finds the minimum difference and selects the target with that difference.
   - While correct, it includes additional CTEs that make the query slightly more complex than necessary.

2. **`1result.sql`**:
   - Also uses CTEs to calculate the mean score and the absolute differences.
   - Orders the targets by the smallest difference and limits the result to one target.
   - The query is concise, efficient, and directly addresses the problem without unnecessary complexity.
   - It ensures that only the target with the closest score to the mean is selected.

3. **`2result.sql`**:
   - Calculates the mean score and orders the targets by the absolute difference.
   - However, it uses `CROSS JOIN` with `MeanScore`, which can be less efficient for large datasets.
   - The `LIMIT 12` suggests it would return 12 targets rather than the single target closest to the mean, which doesn't precisely meet the requirement.
   - There's potential for ambiguity if multiple targets have the same minimum difference.

**Conclusion:**

Given its clarity and direct approach, `1result.sql` is the most appropriate and correct query to solve the problem.
