Upon comparing the three SQL queries, here's the analysis:

**0result.sql and 1result.sql:**
- Both queries calculate the number of actors who have collaborated with Yash Chopra more times than with any other director.
- These queries consider all actors who have worked with Yash Chopra and compare their collaboration counts with other directors.
- However, they might not handle cases where an actor has collaborated with Yash Chopra and another director the same maximum number of times. In such cases, the actor should not be counted, as the condition specifies "more films with Yash Chopra than with any other director."

**2result.sql:**
- This query accurately identifies actors who have made more films with Yash Chopra than with any other director.
- It handles the scenario where an actor's maximum collaboration count is tied between Yash Chopra and another director by excluding such actors.
- By ensuring that only actors whose highest number of collaborations is uniquely with Yash Chopra are counted, this query aligns perfectly with the task's requirements.

**Conclusion:**
- **2result.sql** is the correct SQL query because it precisely fulfills the condition by counting actors who have made more films with Yash Chopra than with any other director, excluding those with equal maximum collaborations.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
