The correct SQL query is:

```plain
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

In the task, we're asked to find:

- The **numeric value of the active council district** in Austin
- Which has the **highest number of bike trips**
- That **start and end within the same district**
- **But not at the same station**

Additionally, we need to consider only **active stations**, as indicated by `"status" = 'active'`.

**Comparison of the SQL Queries:**

**0result.sql**

- **Joins Trips with Start and End Stations:**
  - Joins `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` with `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` twice to get start and end station details.
- **Matches Start and End Stations by Station ID:**
  - Uses `TRY_TO_NUMBER(t."end_station_id")` to handle cases where `end_station_id` might not be numeric.
- **Conditions Applied:**
  - Ensures that both start and end stations are **active** (`"status" = 'active'`).
  - Both start and end stations have a **non-null council district**.
  - The **council districts of start and end stations are the same**.
  - **Start and end stations are different** (`"start_station_id" <> TRY_TO_NUMBER(t."end_station_id")`).
- **Grouping and Ordering:**
  - Groups by `s1."council_district"`.
  - Orders by the **count of trips** in descending order.
  - Limits the result to **one council district** with the highest trip count.

**1result.sql**

- **Defines a CTE `filtered_trips`:**
  - Converts `start_station_id` and `end_station_id` to numeric values.
  - Filters trips where both station IDs are not null and not equal.
- **Joins with Start and End Stations:**
  - Joins `filtered_trips` with `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` for start and end stations.
- **Conditions Applied:**
  - Checks that the **council districts of start and end stations are the same**.
  - Only ensures that the **start station's council district is not null**.
  - **Does not filter for active stations**.
- **Grouping and Ordering:**
  - Groups by `start_stations."council_district"`.
  - Orders by the **count of trips** in descending order.
  - Limits the result to **one council district** with the highest trip count.

**Why 0result.sql is Correct:**

- **Inclusion of Active Stations:**
  - **0result.sql** correctly filters for trips between stations that are **currently active** (`"status" = 'active'`), as required by the task.
  - **1result.sql** does **not** include this condition, potentially counting trips involving inactive stations.
  
- **Ensures Non-null Council Districts for Both Stations:**
  - **0result.sql** checks that **both** start and end stations have non-null council districts.
  - **1result.sql** only checks for the start station's council district being not null.
  
- **Alignment with Task Requirements:**
  - **0result.sql** fully aligns with all specified conditions, ensuring accurate results.
  
Therefore, **0result.sql** is the correct SQL query that satisfies all the conditions of the task.
