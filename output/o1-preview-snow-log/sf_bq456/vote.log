After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct query for the following reasons:

1. **Correct JSON Field Access:**
   - In `1result.sql`, the JSON fields are accessed using the correct syntax for Snowflake:
     ```sql
     qm."Quantity":"CodeMeaning"::STRING
     ```
     This syntax extracts the `CodeMeaning` from the `Quantity` JSON object directly.
   - In contrast, `0result.sql` uses the `GET` function:
     ```sql
     GET(q."Quantity", 'CodeMeaning')::STRING
     ```
     While `GET` can retrieve values from a VARIANT type, the direct field access used in `1result.sql` is more appropriate and reliable for this JSON structure.

2. **Case-Insensitive Comparison:**
   - `1result.sql` incorporates `LOWER()` function to handle case differences in `CodeMeaning` values:
     ```sql
     LOWER(qm."Quantity":"CodeMeaning"::STRING) = 'elongation'
     ```
     This ensures that any variations in case (e.g., 'Elongation', 'elongation', 'ELONGATION') are accounted for, preventing potential mismatches.
   - `0result.sql` performs case-sensitive comparisons:
     ```sql
     GET(q."Quantity", 'CodeMeaning')::STRING = 'Elongation'
     ```
     This approach may miss records where the case does not exactly match, leading to incomplete results.

3. **Consistent and Accurate Results:**
   - The output from `1result.sql` is more likely to include all relevant records due to the reasons above, providing a comprehensive dataset as required by the task.
   - Ordering the results by `PatientID` and `StudyInstanceUID` in `1result.sql` also enhances the readability and organization of the output.

**Conclusion:**
