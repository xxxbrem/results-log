```plaintext
2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

After careful comparison of the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`2result.sql`** is the correct answer. Here's why:

### **1. Handling of Ties with RANK() vs. ROW_NUMBER():**

- **`1result.sql`** uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank drivers:

  ```sql
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dt."constructor_id", dt."year" ORDER BY dt."driver_points" DESC) AS rn
  ```

  - **Issue:** `ROW_NUMBER()` assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within a partition, regardless of ties. This means that if two drivers have the same total points for a constructor in a year, one will arbitrarily be assigned `rn = 1`, and the other `rn = 2`, potentially excluding a driver who is equally deserving of being considered the best.

- **`2result.sql`** uses `RANK()` to rank drivers:

  ```sql
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY res."constructor_id", ra."year" ORDER BY SUM(res."points") DESC) AS "driver_rank"
  ```

  - **Advantage:** `RANK()` assigns the same rank to all rows with the same value in the ordering criteria. If two drivers have the same total points, they will both receive the same rank. This ensures that all drivers tied for the highest points are considered equally.

### **2. Accurate Identification of Best Drivers:**

- By using `RANK()`, **`2result.sql`** accurately identifies all best drivers per constructor per year, even in cases of ties, ensuring fairness and correctness in the calculation.

### **3. Calculation of Combined Points:**

- Both queries calculate the combined points as the sum of the team's total points and the best driver's total points:

  ```sql
  (sub."total_driver_points" + sub2."total_constructor_points") AS "Combined_Points"
  ```

  - **Note:** While this approach may double-count the best driver's points (since the team's points include all drivers' points), the task explicitly asks for the combined points from the team and their best driver. Therefore, both queries follow the same methodology.

### **4. Consistency in Results:**

- Both queries produce the same top 3 results:

  ```
  Constructor | Year | Combined_Points
  -------------------------------------
  Red Bull    | 2023 | 1320.0
  Red Bull    | 2022 | 1157.0
  Mercedes    | 2019 | 1152.0
  ```

- However, **`2result.sql`** ensures that the selection of best drivers is accurate and fair.

### **Conclusion:**

Given the above points, **`2result.sql`** is the preferred and correct SQL query. It provides a more accurate and fair ranking of drivers by properly handling ties with `RANK()`, leading to a correct determination of the top constructors based on the combined points of their best drivers and teams.
