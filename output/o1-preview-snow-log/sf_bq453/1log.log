This SQL query selects the required data for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41,196,311 and 41,277,499 from the `_1000_GENOMES`.`_1000_GENOMES`.`VARIANTS` table. It computes the observed counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes by flattening the `call` and `genotype` fields. It calculates the allele frequency and uses it to determine the expected genotype counts under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Finally, it computes the chi-squared score for each variant.

**Notes:**

- The `alternate_bases` and `call` columns are of VARIANT type and need to be flattened to extract individual values.
- The `genotype` field within each call contains the alleles for that sample; these are used to compute genotype counts.
- The allele frequency is calculated as the total number of alternate alleles divided by twice the number of samples (since each individual has two alleles).
- Expected genotype counts are computed based on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium formulas.
- The chi-squared score is calculated using the observed and expected counts, with checks to avoid division by zero.

**Assumptions:**

- The alleles are coded as `0` for the reference allele and `1` for the alternate allele.
- Missing or undefined genotypes are not included in the calculations.
- Since the `HWE` column appears to have empty values, the chi-squared score is computed manually.

2025-01-25 08:05:01 - root - INFO - I apologize for the confusion and the errors in the previous SQL queries. Let's address the issues step by step.

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Unmatched Quote in WHERE Clause:**
   In the previous SQL query, there was an unmatched single quote in the WHERE clause:

   ```sql
   v."reference_name" = '17"
   ```

   It should be:

   ```sql
   v."reference_name" = '17'
   ```

2. **Incorrect Syntax in LATERAL FLATTEN and JOINs:**
   The use of `LATERAL FLATTEN` and aliases needs to be correctly structured.

3. **Complex Calculations May Introduce Errors:**
   The calculations for the chi-squared score and genotype counts could be simplified for clarity and correctness.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here is the corrected SQL query that should run without syntax errors:

```sql
SELECT
  v."reference_name",
  v."start",
  v."end",
  v."reference_bases",
  ab.value::STRING AS "alternate_bases",
  v."VT" AS "variant_type",
  
  -- Compute observed counts of genotypes
  SUM(IFF(gt."allele0" = 0 AND gt."allele1" = 0, 1, 0)) AS "observed_homo_ref",
  SUM(IFF(gt."allele0" != gt."allele1", 1, 0)) AS "observed_heterozygous",
  SUM(IFF(gt."allele0" = 1 AND gt."allele1" = 1, 1, 0)) AS "observed_homo_alt",
  
  -- Compute allele frequency
  SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*)) AS "allele_frequency",
  
  -- Compute expected counts under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
  (POWER(1 - (SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*))), 2)) * COUNT(*) AS "expected_homo_ref",
  (2 * (SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*))) * (1 - (SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*))))) * COUNT(*) AS "expected_heterozygous",
  (POWER(SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*)), 2)) * COUNT(*) AS "expected_homo_alt",
  
  -- Compute chi-squared score
  (
    POWER(
      SUM(IFF(gt."allele0" = 0 AND gt."allele1" = 0, 1, 0)) -
      (POWER(1 - (SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*))), 2) * COUNT(*)),
      2
    ) /
    NULLIF((POWER(1 - (SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*))), 2) * COUNT(*)), 0)
  ) +
  (
    POWER(
      SUM(IFF(gt."allele0" != gt."allele1", 1, 0)) -
      (2 * (SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*))) * (1 - (SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*)))) * COUNT(*)),
      2
    ) /
    NULLIF((2 * (SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*))) * (1 - (SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*)))) * COUNT(*)), 0)
  ) +
  (
    POWER(
      SUM(IFF(gt."allele0" = 1 AND gt."allele1" = 1, 1, 0)) -
      (POWER(SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*)), 2) * COUNT(*)),
      2
    ) /
    NULLIF((POWER(SUM(gt."allele0" + gt."allele1") / (2.0 * COUNT(*)), 2) * COUNT(*)), 0)
  ) AS "chi_squared_score"

FROM
  "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" v,
  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."alternate_bases") ab,
  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."call") c,
  LATERAL (SELECT
             TRY_TO_NUMBER(c.value:"genotype"[0]) AS "allele0",
             TRY_TO_NUMBER(c.value:"genotype"[1]) AS "allele1"
           ) AS gt

WHERE
  v."reference_name" = '17'
  AND v."start" >= 41196311
  AND v."end" <= 41277499

GROUP BY
  v."reference_name",
  v."start",
  v."end",
  v."reference_bases",
  ab.value,
  v."VT";
```

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Fixed Unmatched Quote in WHERE Clause:**

   Corrected:

   ```sql
   v."reference_name" = '17'
   ```

2. **Proper Use of Aliases and LATERAL FLATTEN:**

   - The `LATERAL FLATTEN` functions are correctly aliased as `ab` and `c`.
   - To extract the `genotype` information, we use a LATERAL subquery to select `allele0` and `allele1` from the flattened `call` data.

3. **Simplified Calculations:**

   - Computations for observed genotype counts and allele frequencies are simplified with proper syntax.
   - Used `IFF` function to conditionally sum genotype counts.
   - Ensured mathematical operations are correctly structured.

4. **Avoided Syntax Errors:**

   - Placed aliases and function calls correctly.
   - Ensured all parentheses are properly matched.

5. **Using `NULLIF` to Avoid Division by Zero:**

   - In the chi-squared score calculation, used `NULLIF` to prevent division by zero errors.

**Notes:**

- **Data Types:**

  - The `genotype` field may contain null or missing values. `TRY_TO_NUMBER` is used to safely convert allele strings to numbers, resulting in `NULL` if the conversion fails.
  - Ensure that missing data is accounted for in calculations.

- **Chi-Squared Score Calculation:**

  - The chi-squared score is calculated by summing the squared differences between observed and expected counts, divided by the expected counts.
  - The formula is applied for each genotype class (hom_ref, het, hom_alt).

- **Expected Genotype Counts Under HWE:**

  - Expected counts are calculated using allele frequencies under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

**Additional SQL Query to Retrieve `HWE` Column Values:**

If you prefer to retrieve the `HWE` column directly (even though it may be empty or null), you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT
  "HWE"
FROM
  "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS"
WHERE
  "reference_name" = '17'
  AND "start" >= 41196311
  AND "end" <= 41277499
LIMIT 100;
```

If you're still encountering errors, it's possible that the `HWE` column does not exist or is not properly formatted in the table. You can confirm the list of columns in the `VARIANTS` table using:

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS";
```

**Validation:**

- I recommend running the corrected SQL query to ensure it executes successfully.
- If there are any further errors, please share the exact error message so I can provide more precise assistance.

**Summary:**

- The corrected SQL query should now execute without syntax errors.
- The query calculates the required fields as per your task, including the chi-squared scores calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
- Let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications to the query.

2025-01-25 08:07:48 - root - INFO - It seems you're encountering an error when trying to select the `"MQ"` and `"DP"` columns from the `VARIANTS` table. The error message:

```
Function TRY_CAST cannot be used with arguments of types VARIANT and NUMBER(38,0)
```

indicates that there's a data type mismatch when attempting to retrieve these columns. Let's address this issue and provide a corrected SQL query to meet your task requirements.

---

**Issue Explanation:**

- **Data Type Mismatch:** The columns `"MQ"` (Mapping Quality) and `"DP"` (Read Depth) in the `VARIANTS` table may be stored as `VARIANT` data types instead of `NUMBER` or `FLOAT`. Attempting to select them directly or casting them without proper handling can lead to the error you're seeing.
  
- **Empty or Null Values:** Additionally, these columns might contain `NULL` or empty values for the specified variants, which can cause issues when performing type conversions or calculations.

---

**Solution:**

We need to:

1. **Confirm the Data Types:** Check the actual data types of the `"MQ"` and `"DP"` columns in the table.

2. **Handle VARIANT Data Types:** If these columns are of type `VARIANT`, we must extract the numeric values correctly.

3. **Ensure Non-null Values:** Handle possible `NULL` or missing values to prevent errors during computations.

4. **Simplify the Query:** Focus on retrieving the required data without causing data type errors.

---

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's a revised SQL query that retrieves the required information and handles potential data type issues:

```sql
SELECT
  v."reference_name",
  v."start",
  v."end",
  v."reference_bases",
  ab.value::STRING AS "alternate_bases",
  v."VT" AS "variant_type",

  -- Attempt to retrieve the HWE column, if available
  TRY_TO_NUMERIC(v."HWE") AS "chi_squared_score",

  -- Flatten the AC (allele count) array and get the first element
  ac.value::NUMBER AS "allele_count",
  TRY_TO_NUMBER(v."AN") AS "allele_number",
  TRY_TO_NUMBER(v."AF") AS "allele_frequency"

FROM
  "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" v
  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."alternate_bases") ab
  LEFT JOIN LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."AC") ac ON TRUE

WHERE
  v."reference_name" = '17'
  AND v."start" >= 41196311
  AND v."end" <= 41277499

LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Retrieving Alternate Bases:** We use `LATERAL FLATTEN` on `"alternate_bases"` since it's a `VARIANT` (array) to extract individual alternate alleles.

- **Handling Allele Count ("AC"):** We flatten the `"AC"` array to extract allele counts. The allele counts correspond to the alternate alleles.

- **Converting Data Types:** We use `TRY_TO_NUMERIC` and `TRY_TO_NUMBER` to safely convert data from `VARIANT` or `STRING` to numeric types, preventing errors if the values are `NULL` or not numeric.

- **Attempting to Retrieve "HWE":** Since the `"HWE"` column may be empty or `NULL`, `TRY_TO_NUMERIC` prevents errors by returning `NULL` if the conversion fails.

---

**Next Steps for Observed and Expected Genotype Counts:**

Calculating observed and expected genotype counts and the chi-squared scores using SQL can be complex, especially with nested `VARIANT` data types. Given the limitations and potential data type issues, it might be more practical to export the relevant data and perform these calculations using a programming language like Python or R.

However, if you still want to proceed with SQL, here's how you can extract genotype information:

```sql
SELECT
  v."reference_name",
  v."start",
  v."end",
  v."reference_bases",
  ab.value::STRING AS "alternate_bases",
  v."VT" AS "variant_type",
  
  -- Extract genotypes
  TRY_TO_NUMBER(gt.value[0]) AS "allele0",
  TRY_TO_NUMBER(gt.value[1]) AS "allele1"

FROM
  "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" v
  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."alternate_bases") ab
  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."call") c
  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => c.value:"genotype") gt

WHERE
  v."reference_name" = '17'
  AND v."start" >= 41196311
  AND v."end" <= 41277499
  AND gt.value IS NOT NULL

LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Flattening the "call" Field:** We flatten the `"call"` array to access individual sample calls.

- **Extracting Genotype Information:** Within each `"call"`, we flatten the `"genotype"` array to get the alleles.

- **Converting Alleles to Numbers:** We use `TRY_TO_NUMBER` to convert allele values to numeric types.

**Note:** This query will produce multiple rows per variant, one for each allele in the genotype data. Calculating observed counts and expected frequencies directly in SQL would involve aggregating this data, which can be resource-intensive and may still run into data type issues.

---

**Alternatives:**

- **Export Data for External Analysis:** Consider exporting the necessary data (e.g., genotype information, allele counts) and performing the calculations in an environment better suited for statistical analysis.

- **Check Column Data Types:** Verify the actual data types of the columns using:

  ```sql
  DESCRIBE TABLE "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS";
  ```

- **Handle Missing or Null Values:** Ensure that your queries account for `NULL` or missing values to prevent errors during data type conversions.

---

**Summary:**

- The error you're encountering suggests a data type mismatch when handling `VARIANT` data.

- By using `TRY_TO_NUMBER` and `TRY_TO_NUMERIC`, we can safely attempt to convert `VARIANT` values to numeric types, avoiding errors from invalid conversions.

- Extracting and computing genotype-related statistics directly in SQL is complex due to the nested data structures and data type issues. It may be more efficient to perform these calculations in a programming environment designed for statistical analysis.

- The provided SQL queries should help you retrieve the necessary data without encountering the previous errors.

This SQL query retrieves the required information for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41,196,311 and 41,277,499 from the `_1000_GENOMES`.`_1000_GENOMES`.`VARIANTS` table. It performs the following steps:

1. **Extract Genotype Information:**
   - Uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` to expand the `alternate_bases` and `call` arrays.
   - Extracts alleles (`allele0` and `allele1`) from each `genotype` array within the `call` field.
   - Filters out records where genotype information is missing.

2. **Calculates Observed Genotype Counts:**
   - Counts the number of samples with homozygous reference (`allele0 = 0` and `allele1 = 0`).
   - Counts the number of heterozygous samples (`allele0 != allele1`).
   - Counts the number of homozygous alternate samples (`allele0 = 1` and `allele1 = 1`).

3. **Calculates Allele Frequency:**
   - Computes the allele frequency as the total number of alternate alleles divided by twice the number of genotypes.

4. **Calculates Expected Genotype Counts Under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium:**
   - Uses allele frequency to compute expected counts for each genotype class:
     - Expected homozygous reference count: \((1 - p)^2 \times N\)
     - Expected heterozygous count: \(2p(1 - p) \times N\)
     - Expected homozygous alternate count: \(p^2 \times N\)
     - Where \(p\) is the allele frequency and \(N\) is the total number of genotypes.

5. **Computes Chi-Squared Score:**
   - Calculates the chi-squared statistic to assess the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
   - The chi-squared score is the sum of squared differences between observed and expected counts, divided by the expected counts.
   - Uses `NULLIF` to avoid division by zero in cases where the expected count is zero.

**Notes:**

- **Data Type Conversions:**
  - `TRY_TO_NUMBER` is used to safely convert allele values to numbers. If conversion fails (e.g., due to missing data), it returns `NULL`.
  - Records with `NULL` allele values are filtered out to ensure accurate calculations.

- **Handling Nested Structures:**
  - The query carefully handles the `VARIANT` data types and nested JSON structures within the `call` and `genotype` fields.
  - Uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` to unpack arrays and access nested data.

- **Syntax Corrections:**
  - The previous errors were due to incorrect placement of `LATERAL` and syntax issues.
  - In this corrected query, `LATERAL FLATTEN` is properly used with commas separating each table function in the `FROM` clause.
  - The use of a Common Table Expression (CTE) with `WITH genotypes AS (...)` improves readability and organization.

- **Final Output:**
  - The query outputs one row per variant, providing all the required information specified in the task.

**Important:**

- This query assumes that the alleles are coded as `0` for the reference allele and `1` for the alternate allele.
- Ensure that the `VARIANTS` table and the columns used in the query exist and have the correct data types.
- Depending on the size of the dataset, this query may be resource-intensive. Consider adding `LIMIT` if you want to retrieve a subset of the data.

**Usage:**

- Run this query in your Snowflake environment to retrieve the desired information.
- Replace any placeholders or adjust the query if needed based on your actual database schema.

**Explanation:**

This SQL query retrieves the required information for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41,196,311 and 41,277,499 from the `_1000_GENOMES`.`_1000_GENOMES`.`VARIANTS` table.

**Key Corrections and Updates:**

- **Data Type Conversion:**
  - Replaced `TRY_TO_NUMBER` with `TO_NUMBER` and explicitly cast the genotype elements to `TEXT` (string) before converting to a number:
    ```sql
    TO_NUMBER(c.value:"genotype"[0]::TEXT) AS "allele0",
    TO_NUMBER(c.value:"genotype"[1]::TEXT) AS "allele1"
    ```
    This avoids the error related to `TRY_CAST` on `VARIANT` types.
  
- **Flattening the Nested Structures:**
  - Used `LATERAL FLATTEN` correctly with commas (`,`) to separate each table function in the `FROM` clause.
  - Avoided unsupported `JOIN` syntax with `LATERAL FLATTEN` by using commas.

- **Conditional Aggregations:**
  - Used `IFF` for conditionals within `SUM` to count genotypes appropriately.

- **Chi-Squared Calculation:**
  - Calculated the chi-squared score using observed and expected genotype counts.
  - Used `NULLIF` to prevent division by zero.

**Notes:**

- **Data Access:**
  - Accessed the alleles directly from the `genotype` array in the `call` field.
  - Cast the `allele` values to `TEXT` before converting to `NUMBER` to handle the `VARIANT` type properly.

- **Query Structure:**
  - The query first extracts the necessary data in the `genotypes` CTE (Common Table Expression).
  - It then performs aggregations and calculations in the main `SELECT` statement.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Alleles are coded as `0` for the reference allele and `1` for the alternate allele.
  - Only diploid genotypes (two alleles per genotype) are considered.
  - Missing or invalid genotype data is excluded from the calculations.

**Usage:**

- Run this query in your Snowflake environment to obtain the desired results.
- Ensure that the `_1000_GENOMES`.`_1000_GENOMES`.`VARIANTS` table contains the expected data and structure.
- Adjust any table or column names if they differ in your database schema.

**Summary:**

This query should execute without errors and provide:

- Reference names, start and end positions.
- Reference and alternate bases.
- Variant types.
- Observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes.
- Allele frequencies.
- Chi-squared scores calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

```

This simplified SQL query removes the previous conditions that were filtering out all data. By eliminating the `WHERE` clause and any restrictions on the `reference_name` or `start` positions, we aim to retrieve any available `PV4` values from the `VARIANTS` table. This increases the likelihood of obtaining data, even if the `PV4` field is sparsely populated.

**Explanation:**

- **Removed Conditions:**
  - **No `WHERE` Clause:** By omitting the `WHERE` clause, we're not limiting the results to a specific chromosome or position range. This allows us to capture any records that contain `PV4` values.
  
- **LATERAL FLATTEN:**
  - We use `LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."PV4")` to unpack the `PV4` array for each variant.
  - This handles cases where `PV4` is an array of values, and we want to retrieve each individual value.

- **Selecting `pv4_value`:**
  - We select `f.value::FLOAT AS "pv4_value"` to cast each flattened `PV4` value to a floating-point number.

- **Limiting Results:**
  - The `LIMIT 100` clause ensures that we retrieve a manageable number of records for review.

**Notes:**

- If this query still returns no data, it may indicate that the `PV4` column is empty or contains only `NULL` values across the entire dataset.
- In that case, consider selecting a different column that may contain relevant data.
  
  For example, to retrieve values from the `PV4` column only where data exists, you could add a condition to check for non-null `PV4` values:

  ```sql
  SELECT
    v."reference_name",
    v."start",
    v."end",
    f.value::FLOAT AS "pv4_value"
  FROM
    "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" v,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(input => v."PV4") f
  WHERE
    f.value IS NOT NULL
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Alternative Approach:**
  - If the `PV4` field lacks data, you might want to explore other fields that contain meaningful information.
  - For instance, you could retrieve allele frequencies or quality scores:

    ```sql
    SELECT
      v."reference_name",
      v."start",
      v."end",
      v."AF" AS "allele_frequency",
      v."quality" AS "quality_score"
    FROM
      "_1000_GENOMES"."_1000_GENOMES"."VARIANTS" v
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

**Conclusion:**

By simplifying the query and removing conditions that were filtering out all data, we increase the chances of retrieving actual records from the database. This approach helps identify whether the lack of results was due to overly restrictive conditions or genuinely absent data in the specified fields.

Relevant tables and columns:

- **Table**: `_1000_GENOMES`.`_1000_GENOMES`.`VARIANTS`

  - **"reference_name"**: Chromosome name; used to filter for chromosome 17.
  - **"start"**: Start position of the variant; used to filter variants within the specified range.
  - **"end"**: End position of the variant; used to filter variants within the specified range.
  - **"reference_bases"**: Reference bases at the variant position.
  - **"alternate_bases"**: Alternate bases observed at the variant position; stored as a VARIANT, may need to be flattened.
  - **"VT"**: Variant type (e.g., SNP, INDEL).
  - **"HWE"**: Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium value; represents chi-squared scores for the variant.
  - **"AC"**: Allele count; may help calculate observed counts of genotypes.
  - **"AN"**: Allele number; total number of alleles considered.
  - **"AF"**: Allele frequency of the alternate allele.
  - **"call"**: Genotype calls for samples; stored as a VARIANT, may need to be flattened to get genotype counts.

Conditions that may be used:

- **Chromosome filter**: `"reference_name" = '17'`
- **Position range**: `"start" >= 41196311 AND "end" <= 41277499`

Task: What are the reference names, start positions, end positions, reference bases, alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores (calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), and the observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, including their allele frequencies and allele frequencies, for variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41196311 and 41277499?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
reference_name,start,end,reference_bases,alternate_bases,variant_type,chi_squared_score,observed_homo_ref,observed_heterozygous,observed_homo_alt,expected_homo_ref,expected_heterozygous,expected_homo_alt,allele_frequency
reference_name:str,start:int,end:int,reference_bases:str,alternate_bases:str,variant_type:str,chi_squared_score:float,observed_homo_ref:int,observed_heterozygous:int,observed_homo_alt:int,expected_homo_ref:float,expected_heterozygous:float,expected_homo_alt:float,allele_frequency:float
reference_name:str,start:int,end:int,reference_bases:str,alternate_bases:str,variant_type:str,chi_squared_score:float,observed_homo_ref:int,observed_heterozygous:int,observed_homo_alt:int,expected_homo_ref:float,expected_heterozygous:float,expected_homo_alt:float,allele_frequency:float

```

This table provides information about variants on chromosome 17 between positions 41,196,311 and 41,277,499. It includes the reference names, start and end positions, reference and alternate bases, variant types, chi-squared scores calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, observed and expected counts of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes, as well as their allele frequencies..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'_1000_GENOMES': {'_1000_GENOMES': ['PEDIGREE', 'SAMPLE_INFO', 'VARIANTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
