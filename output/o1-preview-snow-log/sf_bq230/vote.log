Among the three SQL queries provided, **`1result.sql`** is the correct one for the given task.

**Reason:**

- **Year and Statistic Category Filtering:**
  - The query filters records for the year **2022** and where **`statisticcat_desc`** is **'PRODUCTION'**, satisfying the requirement to include only production figures from 2022.

- **Aggregation Level:**
  - It ensures data is measured at the **state level** by filtering **`agg_level_desc`** to **'STATE'**.

- **Commodity and Group Filtering:**
  - For **corn**, the query selects records where:
    - **`commodity_desc`** is **'CORN'**,
    - **`group_desc`** is **'FIELD CROPS'**,
    - **`unit_desc`** is **'BU'** (bushels), ensuring that only corn production in bushels is included.
  - For **mushrooms**, it selects records where:
    - **`commodity_desc`** is **'MUSHROOMS'**,
    - **`group_desc`** is **'HORTICULTURE'**,
    - **`unit_desc`** is **'LB'** (pounds), which is appropriate since mushrooms are typically measured in pounds, not bushels.

- **Handling Missing Values:**
  - The query excludes records with missing or suppressed values by checking **`value_suppression_code`** is **NULL** and **`value`** is **NOT NULL**.

- **Data Aggregation:**
  - It uses **`GROUP BY`** to aggregate the production figures by **state**, **commodity**, and **unit**, summing up the production values. This ensures that if there are multiple records for the same state and commodity, their production figures are totaled.

- **Correct Units for Each Commodity:**
  - By specifying **'BU'** for corn and **'LB'** for mushrooms, the query retrieves production figures in the correct units as per the task requirement.

**Comparison with Other Queries:**

- **`0result.sql`:**
  - Does not aggregate the production figures, potentially leading to multiple rows per state and commodity.
  - Does not specify **`unit_desc`** for mushrooms, which might result in inconsistent units.
  - Might include duplicate or partial data.

- **`2result.sql`:**
  - Filters **`unit_desc`** to **'BU'** universally, which excludes mushrooms since they are measured in pounds, not bushels.
  - As a result, mushrooms are not included in the output, failing to meet the task requirement.

Therefore, **`1result.sql`** accurately fulfills all the task criteria by correctly filtering, aggregating, and presenting the production figures for corn and mushrooms in their appropriate units.
