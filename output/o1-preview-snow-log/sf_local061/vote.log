After comparing both SQL scripts and their results, I recommend using `0result.sql` as the correct answer for the following reasons:

1. **Comprehensive Month Mapping**: `0result.sql` includes a `months` CTE that maps all calendar months from 1 to 12, ensuring that the final output includes all months, even if there is no projected sales data for a particular month. This provides a complete view of all months in 2021.

2. **Handling of Missing Data**: By performing a `LEFT JOIN` between the `months` table and the `projected_sales`, `0result.sql` ensures that months with no data are still represented in the output with `Projected_Sales_USD` as 0. This is crucial for accurately calculating the average monthly sales over all 12 months.

3. **Explicit Month Names**: The use of the `months` CTE allows for a cleaner and more scalable association between month numbers and their names, making the final output more readable and maintainable.

4. **Consistency in Exchange Rates**: Both scripts correctly apply the exchange rates from the `CURRENCY` table. However, `0result.sql` ensures that if an exchange rate is missing (which shouldn't happen as all exchange rates are 1.0 for France in 2021), it defaults to 1 using `COALESCE`, providing an extra layer of robustness.

Given these reasons, `0result.sql` is the preferred solution as it provides a comprehensive and accurate projection of the average monthly sales in USD for France in 2021.

Per your instruction, the chosen SQL is:
