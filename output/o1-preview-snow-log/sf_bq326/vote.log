After comparing the SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL script is:

```plaintext
2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Precision in Indicator Selection:** The `2result.sql` script uses the exact `indicator_code` `'SH.XPD.CHEX.PP.CD'` to identify the per capita current health expenditures adjusted for purchasing power parity. Using the `indicator_code` is more precise and less error-prone than relying on `indicator_name`, as it eliminates potential issues due to variations or typos in the indicator names.

- **Comprehensive Null and Zero Checks:** The script includes checks to ensure that the values for both population and health expenditures are not null and not zero, which prevents division by zero errors and ensures accurate calculations.

  ```sql
  WHERE "year_2017" IS NOT NULL
    AND "year_2018" IS NOT NULL
    AND "year_2017" != 0
  ...
  AND hn2017."value" IS NOT NULL
    AND hn2018."value" IS NOT NULL
    AND hn2017."value" != 0
  ```

- **Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** The script effectively uses CTEs (`population_growth` and `expenditure_growth`) for clarity and modularity. This makes the query more readable and easier to maintain or modify.

- **Consistent Percentage Calculation:** The growth percentages are calculated accurately for both population and health expenditures, and the script uses `ROUND` for cleaner output, although rounding is optional when counting countries.

  ```sql
  ROUND((("year_2018" - "year_2017") / "year_2017") * 100, 4) AS "pop_growth_percent"
  ```

- **Final Count Matches Other Scripts:** The result of `76` countries aligns with the other scripts, confirming the correctness of the query logic.

By using precise indicator codes and thorough data validation, `2result.sql` provides the most accurate and reliable answer to the question.
