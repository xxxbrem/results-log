**SQL Queries to Understand the Data:**

1. **Query 1:** Retrieve a list of all countries from the population table.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "country"
   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Query 2:** Retrieve population data for countries in 2017 and 2018.

   ```sql
   SELECT "country", "year_2017", "year_2018"
   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Query 3:** Calculate the population change from 2017 to 2018 for each country.

   ```sql
   SELECT "country", "year_2017", "year_2018", ("year_2018" - "year_2017") AS "population_change"
   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Query 4:** Retrieve distinct indicator names related to health from the health population table.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "indicator_name"

   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION.HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION
   WHERE "indicator_name" ILIKE '%per capita current health expenditure%purchasing power parity%'
     AND "year" IN (2017, 2018)
   ORDER BY "country_name", "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Query 9:** Find countries with population growth data available for 2017 and 2018.

   ```sql
   SELECT "country", "year_2017", "year_2018"
   FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY
   WHERE "year_2017" IS NOT NULL AND "year_2018" IS NOT NULL
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Query 10:** List countries along with their health expenditure and population data for 2018.

    ```sql
    SELECT pop."country", pop."year_2018" AS "population_2018", health."value" AS "health_expenditure_2018"
    FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY pop
    JOIN WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION.HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION health
      ON pop."country_code" = health."country_code"
    WHERE health."indicator_name" ILIKE '%per capita current health expenditure%purchasing power parity%'
      AND health."year" = 2018
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Query 11:** Retrieve the percentage population growth for each country between 2017 and 2018.

    ```sql
    SELECT "country", ("year_2018" - "year_2017") / "year_2017" * 100 AS "population_growth_percentage"
    FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Query 12:** Retrieve the health expenditure data along with the percentage change from 2017 to 2018.

    ```sql
    SELECT h1."country_name",
           h1."value" AS "health_expenditure_2017",
           h2."value" AS "health_expenditure_2018",
           ((h2."value" - h1."value") / h1."value") * 100 AS "health_expenditure_growth_percentage"
    FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION.HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION h1
    JOIN WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION.HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION h2
      ON h1."country_code" = h2."country_code"
     AND h1."indicator_code" = h2."indicator_code"
    WHERE h1."indicator_name" ILIKE '%per capita current health expenditure%purchasing power parity%'
      AND h1."year" = 2017
      AND h2."year" = 2018
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **Query 13:** List countries where both population and health expenditure data are available for 2017 and 2018.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT pop."country", pop."country_code"
    FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY pop
    JOIN WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION.HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION health
      ON pop."country_code" = health."country_code"
    WHERE health."indicator_name" ILIKE '%per capita current health expenditure%purchasing power parity%'
      AND health."year" IN (2017, 2018)
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Query 14:** Retrieve the list of country codes to check for consistency between the two tables.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT pop."country_code"
    FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY pop
    WHERE pop."country_code" IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Query 15:** Find any discrepancies in country names between the two datasets.

    ```sql
    SELECT pop."country" AS "population_country", health."country_name" AS "health_country"
    FROM WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION.POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY pop
    FULL OUTER JOIN WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION.HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION health
      ON pop."country_code" = health."country_code"
    WHERE pop."country" <> health."country_name"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the data structure, available indicators, and the necessary information to compute the percentage increases for population and health expenditures. They also assist in preparing for data joining and calculations required to answer the original task.Query:

Task: How many countries saw increases of more than 1% in both their population and per capita current health expenditures (adjusted for purchasing power parity) in 2018 based on the world bank health and global population data

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Number_of_countries
value:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

This value represents the number of countries that experienced increases of more than 1% in both their population and per capita current health expenditures (adjusted for purchasing power parity) in 2018, based on the World Bank health and global population data..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'WORLD_BANK': {'WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION': ['POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY'], 'WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_DEBT', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_EDUCATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_EDUCATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY'], 'WORLD_BANK_WDI': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'FOOTNOTES', 'INDICATORS_DATA', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIME']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
