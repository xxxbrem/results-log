) sub;
```

This query calculates the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations by:

- **Identifying Final Packaging Combinations**: Selecting packaging IDs that are not contained within any other packaging (i.e., their `"id"` is not present in `"contains_id"` in `PACKAGING_RELATIONS`).
  
- **Calculating Total Quantities**: Joining the `PACKAGING_RELATIONS` table multiple times to account for nested items up to four levels deep. The quantities at each level are multiplied to get the total quantity of individual items contained within each final packaging combination.

- **Computing the Average**: Averaging the total quantities across all final packaging combinations to get the desired result.

**Note**: The `COALESCE` function is used to handle cases where there is no further nesting, treating the quantity as `1` when `NULL`.

**Output Format**:

```csv
average_total_quantity
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)

Begin Exploring Related Columns
To solve the task, we need to consider the following tables and columns:

**Relevant Tables and Columns**:

1. **PACKAGING**
   - `"id"`: Unique identifier for each packaging item. Potential usage: Identify each packaging item.
   - `"name"`: Name of the packaging item. Potential usage: Provides the name of the packaging item.

2. **PACKAGING_RELATIONS**
   - `"packaging_id"`: ID of the packaging that contains other items. Potential usage: Indicates which packaging contains other items.
   - `"contains_id"`: ID of the item contained within a packaging. Potential usage: Identifies items contained within a packaging.
   - `"qty"`: Quantity of the contained item within the packaging. Potential usage: Used to calculate total quantities within packaging combinations.

**Conditions that may be used**:

- Identify final packaging combinations by selecting packaging items that are not contained within any other packaging (i.e., their `"id"` is not present in `"contains_id"` in `PACKAGING_RELATIONS`).
- Explore the nested relationships between packaging items.
- Calculate total quantities by summing up `"qty"` values, considering nested items.

**SQL Queries**:

1. **Select all packaging items and their names**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Select distinct packaging IDs from PACKAGING_RELATIONS**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "packaging_id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Select distinct contains IDs from PACKAGING_RELATIONS**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find top-level packaging combinations (not contained in any other packaging)**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING
   WHERE "id" NOT IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
   ) LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Get immediate contents of top-level packaging combinations**:

   ```sql
   SELECT pr."packaging_id", p1."name" AS "Packaging Name", pr."contains_id", p2."name" AS "Contains Name", pr."qty"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS pr
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING p1 ON pr."packaging_id" = p1."id"
   JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING p2 ON pr."contains_id" = p2."id"
   WHERE pr."packaging_id" IN (
       SELECT "id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING
       WHERE "id" NOT IN (
           SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
       )
   ) LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Select all packaging relations to understand nesting**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "packaging_id", "contains_id", "qty" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Find packaging items that are not containers (do not contain other items)**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "id", "name" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING
   WHERE "id" NOT IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT "packaging_id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
   ) LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Find packaging items that are both containers and contained within other packaging**:

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT pr1."packaging_id" AS "Packaging ID"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS pr1
   WHERE pr1."packaging_id" IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT pr2."contains_id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS pr2
   ) LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Count how many times each item is contained in other packaging**:

   ```sql
   SELECT "contains_id", COUNT(*) AS "Contained Count"
   FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
   GROUP BY "contains_id"
   ORDER BY "Contained Count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **Calculate total immediate quantities within each top-level packaging**:

    ```sql
    SELECT pr."packaging_id", SUM(pr."qty") AS "Total Quantity"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS pr
    WHERE pr."packaging_id" IN (
        SELECT "id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING
        WHERE "id" NOT IN (
            SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
        )
    )
    GROUP BY pr."packaging_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Explore names and quantities of items contained within a specific packaging (e.g., packaging_id = 1)**:

    ```sql
    SELECT p1."name" AS "Packaging Name", p2."name" AS "Contains Name", pr."qty"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS pr
    JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING p1 ON pr."packaging_id" = p1."id"
    JOIN ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING p2 ON pr."contains_id" = p2."id"
    WHERE pr."packaging_id" = 1
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Identify packaging items that are never contained within other packaging (could be top-level packaging)**:

    ```sql
    SELECT "id", "name" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING
    WHERE "id" NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT "contains_id" FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS
    ) LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List all packaging items along with how many items they contain directly**:

    ```sql
    SELECT pr."packaging_id", COUNT(pr."contains_id") AS "Number of Contained Items"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS pr
    GROUP BY pr."packaging_id"
    ORDER BY "Number of Contained Items" DESC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

14. **Get total quantities considering items that are not nested (i.e., only direct contents)**:

    ```sql
    SELECT pr."packaging_id", SUM(pr."qty") AS "Total Direct Quantity"
    FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS pr
    GROUP BY pr."packaging_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

15. **Find the average total direct quantity across all packaging combinations**:

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG("Total Quantity") AS "Average Total Direct Quantity" FROM (
        SELECT pr."packaging_id", SUM(pr."qty") AS "Total Quantity"
        FROM ORACLE_SQL.ORACLE_SQL.PACKAGING_RELATIONS pr
        GROUP BY pr."packaging_id"
    ) sub;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the relationships between packaging items and the quantities of items contained within each packaging combination. They explore the structure of the packaging hierarchy, identify top-level packaging combinations, and calculate quantities.Query:

Task: What is the average total quantity across all final packaging combinations, considering all items contained within each combination?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
average_total_quantity
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The average total quantity across all final packaging combinations is calculated by summing the quantities of all items contained within each final packaging combination, including all nested items and their quantities, and then computing the average of these totals across all final packaging combinations..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'ORACLE_SQL': {'ORACLE_SQL': ['BREWERIES', 'CHANNELS_DIM', 'CONWAY_GEN_ZERO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CUSTOMER_FAVORITES', 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'EMP_HIRE_PERIODS', 'FAVORITE_COLL_TYPE', 'GENDER_DIM', 'ID_NAME_COLL_ENTRIES', 'ID_NAME_COLL_TYPE', 'ID_NAME_TYPE', 'INVENTORY', 'LOCATIONS', 'MONTHLY_BUDGET', 'MONTHLY_SALES', 'ORDERLINES', 'ORDERS', 'PACKAGING', 'PACKAGING_RELATIONS', 'PICKING_LINE', 'PICKING_LIST', 'PICKING_LOG', 'PRODUCTS', 'PRODUCT_ALCOHOL', 'PRODUCT_GROUPS', 'PRODUCT_MINIMUMS', 'PURCHASES', 'SERVER_HEARTBEAT', 'STOCK', 'TICKER', 'WEB_APPS', 'WEB_COUNTER_HIST', 'WEB_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'WEB_DEVICES', 'WEB_PAGES', 'WEB_PAGE_VISITS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
average_total_quantity
value:float
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

The average total quantity across all final packaging combinations is calculated by summing the quantities of all items contained within each final packaging combination, including all nested items and their quantities, and then computing the average of these totals across all final packaging combinations. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
