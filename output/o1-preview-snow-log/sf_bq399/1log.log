**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **Table**: `WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_WDI.COUNTRY_SUMMARY`
   - `"country_code"`: Used to identify countries and join with other tables.
   - `"short_name"`: The country's name.
   - `"region"`: Identifies the region of each country.
   - `"income_group"`: Determines income classification, used to filter high-income countries.

2. **Table**: `WORLD_BANK.WORLD_BANK_WDI.INDICATORS_DATA`
   - `"country_code"`: Used to identify countries and join with other tables.
   - `"indicator_name"`: To select records related to the crude birth rate.
   - `"indicator_code"`: May be used to precisely identify the crude birth rate indicator.
   - `"year"`: To filter data from the 1980s (1980-1989).
   - `"value"`: Contains the crude birth rate values.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `"income_group"` = 'High income' (to select high-income countries).
- `"indicator_name"` ILIKE '%crude birth rate%' (to find the crude birth rate indicator).
- `"year"` BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989 (to focus on the 1980s).

Task: Which high-income country had the highest average crude birth rate respectively in each region, and what are their corresponding average birth rate, during the 1980s?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Country,Region,Average Crude Birth Rate
country1:str,region1:str,rate1:float
country2:str,region2:str,rate2:float
...
```

To determine the high-income country with the highest average crude birth rate in each region during the 1980s, we:

1. **Identified High-Income Countries**: Selected countries from the `COUNTRY_SUMMARY` table where the `income_group` is `'High income'`, along with their corresponding `region`.

2. **Extracted Crude Birth Rate Data**: Retrieved crude birth rate data from the `INDICATORS_DATA` table where `indicator_name` corresponds to the crude birth rate indicator, focusing on the years from 1980 to 1989.

3. **Calculated Averages**: Calculated the average crude birth rate for each high-income country over the specified period.

4. **Selected Highest per Region**: For each region, identified the high-income country with the highest average crude birth rate during the 1980s..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'WORLD_BANK': {'WORLD_BANK_GLOBAL_POPULATION': ['POPULATION_BY_COUNTRY'], 'WORLD_BANK_HEALTH_POPULATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'HEALTH_NUTRITION_POPULATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_DEBT': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_DEBT', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIMES'], 'WORLD_BANK_INTL_EDUCATION': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'INTERNATIONAL_EDUCATION', 'SERIES_SUMMARY'], 'WORLD_BANK_WDI': ['COUNTRY_SERIES_DEFINITIONS', 'COUNTRY_SUMMARY', 'FOOTNOTES', 'INDICATORS_DATA', 'SERIES_SUMMARY', 'SERIES_TIME']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
