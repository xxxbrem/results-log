After reviewing and comparing the three SQL queries provided (`0result.sql`, `1result.sql`, and `2result.sql`), I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the most accurate and appropriate query for answering the question:

*Which high-income country had the highest average crude birth rate respectively in each region, and what are their corresponding average birth rate, during the 1980s?*

**Reasons for selecting `1result.sql`:**

1. **Use of Indicator Code for Precision:**
   - **`1result.sql`** uses the `indicator_code` `'SP.DYN.CBRT.IN'` to filter for the *Crude birth rate (per 1,000 people)* indicator. Using the `indicator_code` ensures precise matching, as indicator names might have slight variations or localization differences.
   - In contrast, **`0result.sql`** relies on the `indicator_name` `'Birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people)'`, which could be prone to errors if the indicator name changes or has discrepancies in the dataset.

2. **Exclusion of Null or Empty Regions:**
   - **`1result.sql`** explicitly excludes records where the region is `NULL` or empty (`''`) by including the conditions `cs."region" IS NOT NULL` and `cs."region" <> ''`. This ensures that only valid regions are considered in the results.
   - This is important because including countries without a specified region could lead to incorrect or misleading results.
   - **`0result.sql`** does not include these conditions, potentially including countries without valid region information.

3. **Logical Structure and Clarity:**
   - **`1result.sql`** uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to clearly separate the steps:
     - `avg_birth_rates`: Calculates the average crude birth rate for each high-income country in the 1980s.
     - `max_birth_rates`: Determines the maximum average crude birth rate for each region.
     - The final `SELECT` joins these two CTEs to retrieve the countries with the highest average crude birth rate in each region.
   - This structure makes the query easier to read, understand, and maintain.

4. **Consistent Ordering of Results:**
   - **`1result.sql`** orders the final results by `abr."Region"`, providing a clear and organized output.

5. **Identical and Correct Results Across Queries:**
   - While all three queries produce the same results, the method and precision of **`1result.sql`** make it the most reliable choice.

**Conclusion:**

Given the above reasons, **`1result.sql`** is the best query to accurately answer the question. It ensures precise filtering using the indicator code, properly handles regions, and has a clear and logical structure.
