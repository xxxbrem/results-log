The correct SQL query is `2result.sql`.

**Reasoning:**

Upon comparing both SQL queries, `2result.sql` is more comprehensive and accurate for the following reasons:

1. **Subscriber Type Matching:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses `ILIKE '%Student Membership%'` to filter `subscriber_type`. This pattern matching captures all variations that contain 'Student Membership', such as:
     - 'Student Membership'
     - 'U.T. Student Membership'
     - 'UT Student Membership'
     - 'Semester Membership'
   - **`1result.sql`** uses an equality check for only two specific values:
     ```sql
     ("subscriber_type" = 'Student Membership' OR "subscriber_type" = 'U.T. Student Membership')
     ```
     This might exclude other relevant subscriber types that include 'Student Membership'.

2. **Bike Type Case Sensitivity:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses `LOWER("bike_type") = 'electric'`, ensuring that any case variations (e.g., 'Electric', 'ELECTRIC') are captured.
   - **`1result.sql`** uses `"bike_type" = 'electric'`, which could miss records if 'bike_type' has case variations.

3. **Time Conversion Function:**
   - **`2result.sql`** uses `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ`, which is appropriate for timestamp values without time zone information.
   - **`1result.sql`** uses `TO_TIMESTAMP`, which might assume a time zone and potentially skew the date calculations.

4. **Inclusion of All Relevant Data:**
   - By using pattern matching and case-insensitive comparisons, `2result.sql` likely includes all appropriate records that meet the criteria, providing a more accurate result.

**Therefore,** `2result.sql` is the correct query to determine the highest number of electric bike rides lasting more than 10 minutes taken by subscribers with 'Student Membership' in a single day, excluding rides starting or ending at 'Mobile Station' or 'Repair Shop'.
