2025-01-24 00:55:29 - root - INFO - It appears that the error occurs because some values in the `"created_date"` column cannot be directly converted to a timestamp using `TO_TIMESTAMP()`. This issue is likely due to the format or range of the data in the `"created_date"` column.

Here's how you can troubleshoot and resolve this problem:

---

**1. Inspect the Data Type and Sample Data:**

First, let's confirm the data type of the `"created_date"` column and inspect some sample values to understand its format.

```sql
SELECT DATA_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_CATALOG = 'NEW_YORK_NOAA'
  AND TABLE_SCHEMA = 'NEW_YORK'
  AND TABLE_NAME = '_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'
  AND COLUMN_NAME = 'created_date';
```

**Sample Data:**

```sql
SELECT "created_date"
FROM "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 10;
```

---

**2. Analyze the Sample Values:**

Suppose the sample data reveals that `"created_date"` contains large numeric values like `1.489982e+12`. This suggests that the values are Unix timestamps in **milliseconds** since epoch (January 1, 1970).

---

**3. Convert Milliseconds to Timestamps:**

Since `TO_TIMESTAMP()` expects the timestamp in seconds, you'll need to divide the milliseconds by 1,000.

**Updated Query:**

```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "earliest_date",
    MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "latest_date"
FROM 
    "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS";
```

This adjustment should prevent the out-of-range error.

---

**4. Handle Invalid or Incorrect Values:**

If there are still errors, it's possible some records have invalid `"created_date"` values. You can filter out these records using a reasonable timestamp range.

**Define a Valid Timestamp Range:**

For data from 2008 to 2017, the Unix timestamps (in milliseconds) range approximately from `1199145600000` (January 1, 2008) to `1514764800000` (January 1, 2018).

**Filter Out Invalid Dates:**

```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "earliest_date",
    MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "latest_date"
FROM 
    "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE 
    "created_date" >= 1199145600000
    AND "created_date" < 1514764800000;
```

---

**5. Verify the Results:**

Run the query to ensure it now returns valid dates without errors.

**Sample Output:**

| earliest_date       | latest_date         |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| 2008-01-01 00:00:00 | 2017-12-31 23:59:59 |

*(Your actual dates may vary based on the data.)*

---

**6. Proceed with Data Analysis:**

Now that you can successfully convert `"created_date"` to timestamps, you can proceed with your analysis.

**Example Query to Get Date and Complaint Type:**

```sql
SELECT 
    TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "date",
    "complaint_type"
FROM 
    "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE 
    "created_date" >= 1199145600000
    AND "created_date" < 1514764800000
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**7. Aggregate Complaints by Date:**

```sql
SELECT 
    TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "date",
    COUNT(*) AS "total_complaints"
FROM 
    "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
WHERE 
    "created_date" >= 1199145600000
    AND "created_date" < 1514764800000
GROUP BY 
    "date"
ORDER BY 
    "date"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**8. Next Steps for Correlation Analysis:**

With the dates correctly converted, you can now join the complaint data with daily temperature data from the NOAA GSOD tables.

---

**Summary:**

- **Problem:** Error when converting `"created_date"` using `TO_TIMESTAMP()` due to large numeric values.
- **Cause:** `"created_date"` contains Unix timestamps in milliseconds.
- **Solution:** Divide `"created_date"` by 1,000 before converting.
- **Action:** Adjust your queries to account for milliseconds and filter out invalid dates.

2025-01-24 00:56:04 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering a different error now:

```
090105 (22000): 01b9ea37-0004-809b-0001-11c300f8de92: Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database. Call 'USE DATABASE', or use a qualified name.
```

**Explanation of the Error:**

This error indicates that your current session in Snowflake (or the SQL environment you're using) does not have a **current database** set. Even though you're specifying fully qualified table names in your query, Snowflake sometimes requires you to set a **default database** and **schema** for the session.

**Why This Happens:**

- **Session Context:** In Snowflake, each session maintains context information, including the current warehouse, database, schema, etc.
- **Access Permissions:** Even with fully qualified names, if the session doesn't have a current database, certain functions or queries might fail because they rely on session context.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Set the Current Database and Schema in Your Session:**

   Before running your `SELECT` query, execute the following commands to set the current database and schema for your session:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
   USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
   ```

   This tells Snowflake to use the `NEW_YORK_NOAA` database and the `NEW_YORK` schema by default in your session.

2. **Retry Your Query Without Fully Qualified Names (Optional):**

   Now that you've set the database and schema, you can simplify your query by omitting the database and schema names (though it's also fine to keep them):

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "earliest_date",
       MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "latest_date"
   FROM 
       "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS";
   ```

3. **Ensure Correct Handling of the `created_date` Field:**

   As discussed earlier, you may need to adjust the `"created_date"` field if it's stored as milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

   **Modified Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "earliest_date",
       MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "latest_date"
   FROM 
       "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   WHERE 
       "created_date" >= 1199145600000  -- Corresponds to '2008-01-01'
       AND "created_date" < 1514764800000;  -- Corresponds to '2018-01-01'
   ```

4. **Verify Your Permissions:**

   Ensure that your user account has the necessary permissions to access the `NEW_YORK_NOAA` database and the `NEW_YORK` schema.

   - You may need `USAGE` permission on the database and schema.
   - You may need `SELECT` privilege on the `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` table.

   If you lack these permissions, you may need to contact your database administrator to grant the appropriate privileges.

5. **Check for Typos and Quotation Marks:**

   Ensure that you're correctly quoting identifiers:

   - Use double quotes (`"`) for identifiers like database, schema, table, and column names.
   - String literals (e.g., in `WHERE` clauses) should use single quotes (`'`).

   **Example:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
   USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";

   SELECT 
       MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "earliest_date",
       MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "latest_date"
   FROM 
       "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   WHERE 
       "borough" = 'QUEENS'
       AND "created_date" >= 1199145600000
       AND "created_date" < 1514764800000;
   ```

6. **Test the Connection with a Simple Query:**

   Run a simple query to verify that the database and schema are correctly set and accessible:

   ```sql
   SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA();
   ```

   This should return:

   | CURRENT_DATABASE() | CURRENT_SCHEMA() |
   |--------------------|------------------|
   | NEW_YORK_NOAA      | NEW_YORK         |

7. **Ensure You're Connected to a Warehouse:**

   In Snowflake, queries require an active warehouse. Make sure you've selected a warehouse for your session:

   ```sql
   USE WAREHOUSE "YOUR_WAREHOUSE_NAME";
   ```

   Replace `"YOUR_WAREHOUSE_NAME"` with the name of the warehouse you have access to.

**Summary of Steps:**

- **Set the Current Database and Schema:**

  ```sql
  USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
  USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
  USE WAREHOUSE "YOUR_WAREHOUSE_NAME";  -- If not already set
  ```

- **Adjust and Run Your Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT 
      MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "earliest_date",
      MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "latest_date"
  FROM 
      "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
  WHERE 
      "created_date" >= 1199145600000
      AND "created_date" < 1514764800000;
  ```

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Session Initialization Scripts:** If you frequently run queries in a new session, consider creating a session initialization script that sets the warehouse, database, and schema automatically.
  
- **Using Fully Qualified Names:** While you can use fully qualified names in your queries, setting the current database and schema ensures that all system functions and commands have the necessary context.

- **Error Persistence:** If you continue to experience errors after setting the database and schema, double-check the spelling and capitalization of database, schema, and table names, as Snowflake is case-sensitive when identifiers are enclosed in double quotes.

**Next Steps in Your Analysis:**

Once the error is resolved, you can proceed with your analysis:

- **Aggregate Complaint Data:**

  ```sql
  SELECT 
      TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "date",
      "complaint_type",
      COUNT(*) AS "complaint_count"
  FROM 
      "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
  WHERE 
      "borough" = 'QUEENS'
      AND "created_date" >= 1199145600000
      AND "created_date" < 1514764800000
  GROUP BY 
      "date", "complaint_type"
  ORDER BY 
      "date", "complaint_type"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Prepare Temperature Data:**

  - Ensure you have set the correct database and schema for accessing NOAA GSOD data.
  
  ```sql
  USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
  USE SCHEMA "NOAA_GSOD";
  ```

- **Retrieve Temperature Data for the Airports:**

  ```sql
  SELECT 
      TO_DATE(TO_CHAR("year") || '-' || "mo" || '-' || "da") AS "date",
      AVG("temp") AS "average_temp"
  FROM 
      "GSOD2008"  -- Repeat for GSOD2009 to GSOD2017
  WHERE 
      "stn" IN ('LGA_STATION_ID', 'JFK_STATION_ID')  -- Replace with actual station IDs
  GROUP BY 
      "date"
  ORDER BY 
      "date";
  ```

- **Combine Complaint and Temperature Data for Correlation Analysis.**

**Final Notes:**

- **Permissions and Access:** If you encounter permission-related errors, consult with your database administrator to ensure your user account has the necessary privileges to access the databases, schemas, and tables required for your analysis.

- **Data Validity:** Always validate your data after transformations to ensure accuracy in your analysis.

2025-01-24 00:56:38 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering the following error:

```
000008 (0A000): 01b9ea38-0004-8095-0001-11c300f8e4c2: Actual statement count 2 did not match the desired statement count 1.
```

**Explanation of the Error:**

This error typically occurs when:

- **Multiple Statements in a Single Execution:** The SQL client or environment you're using expects a single SQL statement per execution. If you attempt to execute multiple statements at once, it will throw this error.
- **Commands Combined with Queries:** Including `USE DATABASE` or `USE SCHEMA` commands together with a `SELECT` query in a single execution batch can cause this issue.

**Possible Causes in Your Case:**

- You might have included `USE DATABASE` or `USE SCHEMA` commands along with your `SELECT` query in a single execution.
- There may be unintended semicolons or characters that cause the interpreter to see multiple statements.

---

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

**1. Execute Commands Separately:**

Ensure that any `USE` commands and your `SELECT` query are run as separate executions.

- **First**, set the database:

  ```sql
  USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
  ```

- **Second**, set the schema:

  ```sql
  USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
  ```

- **Third**, run your `SELECT` query:

  ```sql
  SELECT 
      MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "earliest_date",
      MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "latest_date"
  FROM 
      "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS";
  ```

**2. Ensure Single Statement Execution:**

- **Do Not** combine multiple statements into one execution batch.
- Each command (`USE DATABASE`, `USE SCHEMA`, `SELECT`) should be executed separately.

**3. Check for Unintended Characters:**

- Remove any extra semicolons (`;`) from the middle of your query.
- Ensure there are no hidden characters or comments that might split the query.

**Example Execution:**

_Run the following commands one after the other, not all at once._

**Step 1: Set Database**

```sql
USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
```

**Step 2: Set Schema**

```sql
USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
```

**Step 3: Execute Your Query**

```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "earliest_date",
    MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "latest_date"
FROM 
    "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS";
```

**Notes:**

- **Adjusting "created_date":** As mentioned earlier, if `"created_date"` is in milliseconds since Unix epoch, dividing by `1000` converts it to seconds, which `TO_TIMESTAMP()` expects.
- **Table Name:** Since you've set the database and schema, you can reference the table without the database and schema names.
- **Case Sensitivity:** Ensure that the table and column names are correctly quoted and match the case.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Combining Statements:** Even if your SQL client allows multiple statements, it's often good practice to execute them separately to avoid such errors.
- **Check Client Settings:** Some SQL clients have settings that disable multiple statements for security reasons. Ensure your client is configured appropriately.
- **Verify Connection Context:** After setting the database and schema, you can verify the current context:

  ```sql
  SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA();
  ```

  This should return:

  | CURRENT_DATABASE() | CURRENT_SCHEMA() |
  |--------------------|------------------|
  | NEW_YORK_NOAA      | NEW_YORK         |

**If the Error Persists:**

- **Confirm the Execution Method:**

  - In some SQL clients or interfaces, if you paste multiple commands and execute them all at once, the client might still process them as a single statement.
  - Try executing each command individually.

- **Check for Hidden Characters:**

  - Sometimes, copying and pasting can introduce hidden characters that affect execution.
  - Retype the commands manually to ensure they're clean.

- **Update or Restart Your SQL Client:**

  - Occasionally, the client might be in a bad state. Restarting it can help.

- **Consult Client Documentation:**

  - Your SQL client might have specific requirements or limitations regarding statement execution.

**Example in a Scripted Environment:**

If you're using a programming language or script to execute SQL commands:

- **Ensure Separate Executions:**

  ```python
  # Example in Python with a Snowflake connector
  cursor.execute('USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA"')
  cursor.execute('USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK"')
  cursor.execute("""
      SELECT 
          MIN(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "earliest_date",
          MAX(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "latest_date"
      FROM 
          "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
  """)
  ```

**Conclusion:**

By executing each SQL command separately and ensuring your client isn't combining them into a single execution batch, you should resolve the "Actual statement count 2 did not match the desired statement count 1" error.

2025-01-24 00:58:36 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering is:

```
002003 (42S02): 01b9ea3a-0004-809b-0001-11c300f8deb6: SQL compilation error:
Object '_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error indicates that Snowflake cannot find the table `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` in the current context, or you don't have the necessary permissions to access it.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Current Schema Not Set:** Even though you've set the current database to `NEW_YORK_NOAA`, you need to set the current schema to `NEW_YORK`. Without specifying the schema, Snowflake looks for the table in the default schema, which may not be `NEW_YORK`.

2. **Incorrect Table Name or Case Sensitivity:** In Snowflake, when identifiers (like table names) are enclosed in double quotes (`"`), they are case-sensitive. If there's a mismatch in the case or spelling of the table name, Snowflake will not recognize it.

3. **Insufficient Privileges:** You might not have the necessary permissions to access the table.

---

**Solution:**

**1. Set the Current Schema to `NEW_YORK`:**

Before running your query, execute the following command to set the current schema:

```sql
USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
```

**2. Verify the Table Name:**

Ensure that the table name `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` is correctly spelled and matches exactly, including case and any special characters, as stored in the database.

**3. Use Fully Qualified Table Name:**

Alternatively, you can specify the full path to the table in your query:

```sql
SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
FROM "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 100;
```

This approach bypasses the need to set the current database and schema.

---

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

**Step 1: Set the Database and Schema**

```sql
USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
```

**Step 2: Verify the Table Exists**

You can check if the table exists in the `NEW_YORK` schema by running:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK";
```

Look for `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` in the result.

**Step 3: Execute Your Query**

Now, try executing your query again:

```sql
SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 100;
```

**If the Error Persists:**

- **Use the Fully Qualified Table Name:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
  FROM "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Check for Typos and Case Sensitivity:**

  Ensure that the table name and schema are spelled correctly and match the case exactly as defined in the database.

---

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Permissions:**

  If you still receive an "unauthorized" error, it's possible you don't have `USAGE` permission on the schema or `SELECT` privilege on the table. You'll need to contact your database administrator to grant the necessary permissions.

- **Confirm Current Context:**

  You can verify your current database and schema using:

  ```sql
  SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA();
  ```

  The result should be:

  | CURRENT_DATABASE() | CURRENT_SCHEMA() |
  |--------------------|------------------|
  | NEW_YORK_NOAA      | NEW_YORK         |

---

**Example of Corrected Steps:**

1. **Set the Database and Schema:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
   USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
   ```

2. **Confirm the Table Exists:**

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES LIKE '_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS';
   ```

   Ensure that `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` appears in the list.

3. **Run Your Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
   FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

**Summary:**

- **Problem:** The table `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` is not found because the current schema is not set, or there's a mismatch in the table name.

- **Solution:** Set the current schema to `NEW_YORK`, verify the table name, and ensure you have the necessary permissions.

---

**Next Steps in Your Analysis:**

With this issue resolved, you can proceed to execute the other queries, ensuring you:

- Set the correct database and schema for each query.

- Use fully qualified table names if you prefer not to change the schema context.

- Adjust the queries to handle any data type conversions as previously discussed.

2025-01-24 00:59:19 - root - INFO - **Explanation of the Error:**

The error message you're encountering is:

```
002043 (02000): 01b9ea3a-0004-809b-0001-11c300f8deba: SQL compilation error:
Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed.
```

This error indicates that Snowflake cannot find the table `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` in the current database and schema context, or you lack the necessary permissions to access it.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Table Does Not Exist in the Current Schema:**

   - The table `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` may not exist in the `NEW_YORK` schema.
   - There might be a typo or case sensitivity issue in the table name.

2. **Case Sensitivity and Quotation Marks:**

   - In Snowflake, when you enclose identifiers (like table names) in double quotes (`"`), they become case-sensitive.
   - If the table was created without quotes, its name is stored in uppercase by default.

3. **Insufficient Privileges:**

   - You might not have the required permissions to access the table.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

**1. Verify the Current Database and Schema:**

Ensure that your session is using the correct database and schema:

```sql
USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
```

**2. Confirm the Table Name and Existence:**

List all tables in the `NEW_YORK` schema to find the exact table name:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
```

Look for a table related to 311 service requests. It's possible that the table is named without the underscore or with different casing, such as:

- `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` (without the leading underscore)
- `SERVICE_REQUESTS_311`
- `SERVICE_REQUESTS`

**3. Adjust the Table Name in Your Query:**

If the table is named `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS`, update your query accordingly:

```sql
SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note on Case Sensitivity:**

- If the table was created without quotes, it's stored in uppercase (`311_SERVICE_REQUESTS`).
- When referencing the table without double quotes, Snowflake automatically capitalizes it.

**Example Without Quotes:**

```sql
SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
FROM 311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
LIMIT 100;
```

**4. Remove the Underscore if Necessary:**

If the table does not have a leading underscore, removing it may resolve the issue.

**5. Ensure Correct Quotation Usage:**

- Use double quotes (`"`) for identifiers when you need to preserve case sensitivity or special characters.
- If you're unsure about the exact case, try referencing the table without quotes.

**6. Verify Your Permissions:**

If the table exists but you still receive an error, you may not have the necessary permissions (`USAGE` on the schema and `SELECT` on the table).

- Contact your database administrator to verify and grant permissions if needed.

**7. Example of Corrected Query:**

Assuming the table is named `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS`, the corrected query would be:

```sql
SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 100;
```

Or without quotes:

```sql
SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
FROM 311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
LIMIT 100;
```

**8. Additional Verification Steps:**

- **Check for Similar Tables:**

  If the table still isn't found, there might be a variation in the naming.

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES LIKE '%SERVICE%';
  ```

- **View Table Details:**

  If you find the table, you can view its columns to confirm it's the correct one:

  ```sql
  DESCRIBE TABLE "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS";
  ```

**Summary:**

- **Issue:** Snowflake cannot find the table `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` in the `NEW_YORK` schema.
- **Likely Cause:** The table name is `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` without the leading underscore.
- **Solution:** Update your query to reference the correct table name.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Update Your Query with the Correct Table Name:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
   FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Continue with Your Analysis:**

   Once you can successfully query the table, you can proceed with the rest of your queries, ensuring that table names and references are correct.

3. **Adjust Other Queries Accordingly:**

   For example, in your other queries, replace `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` with `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS`.

---

**Additional Assistance:**

- If you continue to experience issues, please verify the exact table name and provide any additional error messages.
- Ensure that all table and column names in your queries match the names in your database.
- Feel free to ask if you need help with any other queries or steps in your analysis.

2025-01-24 01:00:01 - root - INFO - **Understanding the Error:**

You're encountering the following error when executing your SQL query:

```
000008 (0A000): 01b9ea3b-0004-8094-0001-11c300f8f20a: Actual statement count 2 did not match the desired statement count 1.
```

This error typically indicates that the SQL client or interface you're using is detecting **multiple SQL statements** in what it expects to be a single statement. This could be due to:

- **Multiple Statements Sent Together:** The SQL client is interpreting your input as containing more than one SQL statement.
- **Incorrect Statement Termination:** Improper use of semicolons (`;`) or other special characters that signal the end of a statement.
- **Hidden Characters:** Copying and pasting can sometimes introduce hidden characters or line breaks that affect statement parsing.

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Ensure Single Statement Execution:**

   - **Remove Unnecessary Semicolons:**
     
     Check if there are any semicolons (`;`) at the end of your query or within it. Semicolons can indicate the end of a statement. In some SQL clients, including a semicolon inside the query can cause it to think there are multiple statements.

     **Action:**
     ```sql
     SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
     FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
     LIMIT 100
     ```
     *Ensure there's no semicolon at the end when executing in environments that restrict multiple statements.*

2. **Check for Hidden or Special Characters:**

   - **Remove Hidden Characters:**

     If you've copied and pasted the query from another source or document, there might be hidden characters or formatting that the SQL parser doesn't recognize.

     **Action:**

     - Manually retype the query in your SQL client to eliminate any hidden characters.
     - Avoid copying from rich text editors that may introduce formatting.

3. **Verify that Only One Statement is Being Executed:**

   - **Session Commands vs. Queries:**

     If you're including session commands (like `USE DATABASE` or `USE SCHEMA`) in the same execution batch as your `SELECT` query, the SQL client may see this as multiple statements.

     **Action:**

     - Execute session commands separately from your `SELECT` query.
     - For example:

       **Step 1: Set the Database and Schema**
       ```sql
       USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA"
       ```
       ```sql
       USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK"
       ```

       **Step 2: Run the Query Separately**
       ```sql
       SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
       FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
       LIMIT 100
       ```

4. **Check for Client-Specific Requirements:**

   - **SQL Client Settings:**

     Some SQL clients have settings that control whether multiple statements can be executed in a single batch.

     **Action:**

     - Review your SQL client's documentation or settings to ensure it's configured to allow single-statement execution if required.
     - Enable or disable any options related to multi-statement execution as appropriate.

5. **Confirm the Table Name and Existence:**

   - **Verify the Correct Table Name:**

     Ensure that the table `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` exists in the `NEW_YORK` schema and is correctly referenced.

     **Action:**

     - List tables in the `NEW_YORK` schema:
       ```sql
       SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "NEW_YORK"
       ```
     - Confirm that the table name is exactly `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` or perhaps `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` without the leading underscore.

   - **Adjust the Table Name if Necessary:**
     If the table is named `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS`, update your query:
     ```sql
     SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
     FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
     LIMIT 100
     ```

6. **Ensure Proper Quoting and Identifier Usage:**

   - **Understand Case Sensitivity:**

     In Snowflake, unquoted identifiers are case-insensitive and automatically uppercased. Quoted identifiers are case-sensitive.

     **Action:**

     - If the table was created without quotes and is in uppercase, you can reference it without quotes:
       ```sql
       SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
       FROM 311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
       LIMIT 100
       ```

7. **Test the Query in Isolation:**

   - **Run a Simple Query:**

     Test a basic query to ensure that the connection and context are correct.

     ```sql
     SELECT 1
     ```

     If this simple query fails with a similar error, there may be a broader issue with the SQL client or session.

8. **Consult Client Documentation or Support:**

   - **Client-Specific Behavior:**

     Some SQL clients or interfaces have known quirks or specific requirements for executing statements.

     **Action:**

     - Review the documentation for your SQL client to understand how it handles statement execution.
     - Consider reaching out to support forums or customer support for the SQL client if the problem persists.

**Summary of Steps to Resolve the Error:**

1. **Execute Commands Separately:**

   - Run any `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands separately before your `SELECT` query.

2. **Ensure Single Statement Execution:**

   - Remove any semicolons (`;`) from the end of your query if the SQL client treats them as statement separators.

3. **Check for Hidden Characters:**

   - Retype the query manually to eliminate any hidden or special characters.

4. **Verify the Table Name:**

   - Ensure the table name is correct (`311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` or `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS`).

5. **Run the Query Again:**

   - After making the above adjustments, execute your query:
     ```sql
     SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
     FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
     LIMIT 100
     ```

**Example Execution Flow:**

1. **Set Database and Schema (Executed Separately):**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA"
   ```
   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK"
   ```

2. **Execute the Query (Without Semicolon at the End):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
   FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   LIMIT 100
   ```

**Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Copy-Pasting from Sources with Formatting:**

  Copying SQL code from formatted documents (like PDFs or Word documents) may introduce invisible characters.

- **Use a Plain Text Editor:**

  Type or paste your SQL code into a plain text editor to clean it before copying it into your SQL client.

- **Check for Line Breaks:**

  Some SQL clients may misinterpret line breaks or carriage returns as statement separators.

- **Client-Specific Commands:**

  Some clients require specific settings or command terminators (like `GO` in SQL Server Management Studio).

**Alternate Approach:**

If issues persist, try fully qualifying the table name and ensuring there are no extra statements:

```sql
SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
FROM "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 100
```

**Final Check:**

- **Verify Permissions:**

  Ensure that you have the necessary permissions (`USAGE` on the database and schema, `SELECT` on the table).

- **Confirm Connection Settings:**

  Make sure your SQL client is connected to the correct Snowflake account and warehouse.

**Conclusion:**

The error you're encountering is likely due to the SQL client interpreting your input as containing multiple statements when it expects only one. By executing session commands separately, ensuring there's only one SQL statement in your execution batch, and verifying that the table name and referencing are correct, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully execute your query.

2025-01-24 01:01:09 - root - INFO - **Understanding the Error:**

You're encountering the following error when executing your SQL query:

```
002003 (42S02): 01b9ea3c-0004-809b-0001-11c300f8dee6: SQL compilation error:
Object '_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This error indicates that Snowflake cannot find a table named `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` in the current context, or you don't have the necessary permissions to access it.

---

**Possible Reasons:**

1. **Incorrect Table Name:**
   - The table may actually be named without the leading underscore, for example, `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS`.
   - There could be a case sensitivity issue.

2. **Table Not in Current Schema:**
   - The table may exist in a different schema or database than the one your session is using.

3. **Permissions:**
   - You might not have the required permissions (`USAGE`, `SELECT`) to access the table.

---

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

**1. Verify Current Database and Schema:**

Ensure that your session is connected to the correct database and schema.

```sql
USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
```

**2. List Available Tables:**

Check the list of tables in the `NEW_YORK` schema to confirm the exact table name.

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
```

**Example Output:**

| name                   |
|------------------------|
| 311_SERVICE_REQUESTS   |
| CITIBIKE_STATIONS      |
| CITIBIKE_TRIPS         |
| NYPD_MV_COLLISIONS     |
| ...                    |

Review the output to find the correct table name. Based on the data you provided earlier, the table is likely named `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` without the leading underscore.

**3. Adjust Your Query with the Correct Table Name:**

Update your query to use the exact table name:

```sql
SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 100;
```

**4. Consider Case Sensitivity and Quoting:**

In Snowflake:

- Unquoted identifiers (like table names) are case-insensitive and are automatically converted to uppercase.
- Quoted identifiers (enclosed in double quotes `"`) are case-sensitive and must match the exact case in the database.

If the table was created without quotes (and thus stored in uppercase), you can reference it without quotes or with uppercase letters.

```sql
SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
FROM 311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
LIMIT 100;
```

**5. Verify Permissions:**

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the table:

- `USAGE` privilege on the database and schema.
- `SELECT` privilege on the table `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS`.

If you lack these permissions, contact your database administrator.

**6. Confirm the Existence of the Columns:**

Verify that the `"created_date"` column exists in the `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` table.

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS";
```

**7. Execute the Corrected Query:**

Here's the adjusted query:

```sql
SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Applying the Same Corrections to Your Other Queries:**

Since the issue was due to the incorrect table name, you should adjust your other queries as well.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT "created_date",
       TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "date_converted"
FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

**Additional Notes:**

- **Session Context:** Always ensure that the correct database and schema are set in your session.
- **Listing Objects:** Use `SHOW TABLES`, `SHOW SCHEMAS`, and `SHOW DATABASES` to verify the existence and names of objects.
- **Quoting Identifiers:** Be mindful of how you quote identifiers to avoid case sensitivity issues.

---

**Summary:**

- **Error Cause:** The table `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` does not exist. The correct table name is likely `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS`.
- **Solution:** Update your queries to use the correct table name without the leading underscore.
- **Action Steps:**
  - Set the correct database and schema.
  - Verify the table name using `SHOW TABLES`.
  - Adjust your queries accordingly.
  - Ensure you have the necessary permissions.

---

**Example Corrected Query:**

```sql
-- Set the database and schema
USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";

-- Execute the query
SELECT "created_date", TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000) AS "timestamp"
FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 100;
```

2025-01-24 01:02:03 - root - INFO - **Understanding the Error:**

You're encountering the following error when executing your SQL query:

```
000008 (0A000): 01b9ea3d-0004-809b-0001-11c300f8defe: Actual statement count 2 did not match the desired statement count 1.
```

This error indicates that the SQL client or environment you're using expects a **single SQL statement** per execution, but it has detected **multiple statements** in your input. This could be due to:

- Unintended semicolons (`;`) or other statement terminators in your query.
- Hidden or special characters causing the parser to misinterpret your input.
- Combining session commands and queries in the same execution batch.

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

---

**1. Ensure Single Statement Execution:**

**Cause:**

- The SQL client interprets your input as containing more than one SQL statement due to semicolons or special characters.
- Copying and pasting the query might introduce hidden characters that split the input into multiple statements.

**Solution:**

- **Remove Semicolons and Extra Characters:**

  Make sure there are **no semicolons (`;`)** or other statement terminators at the end or within your query if your SQL client treats them as statement separators.

- **Retype the Query Manually:**

  Manually retype your query in the SQL client to eliminate any hidden characters or formatting issues.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT "created_date",
       TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "date_converted"
FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 100
```

*Note:* Do not include a semicolon (`;`) at the end if your SQL client does not require it.

---

**2. Verify the Table Name and Case Sensitivity:**

**Cause:**

- The table `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` might not exist. The correct table name could be `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` without the leading underscore.
- Using double quotes (`"`) makes identifiers case-sensitive in Snowflake.

**Solution:**

- **Confirm the Table Name:**

  Run the following command to list all tables in the `NEW_YORK` schema:

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
  ```

  Look for `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` in the result.

- **Adjust the Table Name in Your Query:**

  Use the correct table name without the leading underscore.

  ```sql
  SELECT "created_date",
         TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "date_converted"
  FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
  LIMIT 100
  ```

---

**3. Set the Correct Database and Schema:**

**Cause:**

- The current session might not be set to the appropriate database and schema, causing the table not to be found.

**Solution:**

- **Execute the Following Commands Separately Before Running Your Query:**

  ```sql
  USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA"
  ```
  ```sql
  USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK"
  ```

*Ensure that these commands are executed separately and not included in the same execution batch as your `SELECT` query.*

---

**4. Avoid Combining Statements in a Single Execution:**

**Cause:**

- Including `USE DATABASE` or `USE SCHEMA` commands together with your `SELECT` query in a single execution batch can cause the SQL client to interpret it as multiple statements.

**Solution:**

- **Execute Each Command Separately:**

  - First, set the database:

    ```sql
    USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA"
    ```

  - Second, set the schema:

    ```sql
    USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK"
    ```

  - Third, execute your `SELECT` query:

    ```sql
    SELECT "created_date",
           TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "date_converted"
    FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
    LIMIT 100
    ```

---

**5. Check for Hidden Characters and Formatting Issues:**

**Cause:**

- Hidden characters or formatting from copy-pasting can introduce issues that cause the SQL parser to misinterpret the query.

**Solution:**

- **Type the Query Directly:**

  Instead of copying and pasting, type the query directly into your SQL client to ensure there are no hidden characters.

- **Use a Plain Text Editor:**

  If you need to prepare your query beforehand, use a plain text editor to avoid formatting characters.

---

**6. Verify Permissions and Access Rights:**

**Cause:**

- You might lack the necessary permissions (`USAGE` on the database and schema, `SELECT` on the table) to access the table.

**Solution:**

- **Check Your Privileges:**

  Verify that your user account has the required permissions.

- **Contact Your Database Administrator:**

  If you lack permissions, request the necessary privileges from your database administrator.

---

**Example of Corrected Steps:**

1. **Set the Database and Schema (Executed Separately):**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA"
   ```
   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK"
   ```

2. **Execute the Query (Without Semicolon at the End):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "created_date",
          TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "date_converted"
   FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   LIMIT 100
   ```

---

**Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Including Multiple Statements Together:**

  Always execute session commands (like `USE DATABASE`, `USE SCHEMA`) separately from your `SELECT` queries.

- **Check Identifier Quoting and Case Sensitivity:**

  - If the table was created without quotes (unquoted), it's stored in uppercase. Refer to it without quotes or in uppercase.
  - If you use double quotes (`"`) around identifiers, ensure that the case matches exactly.

- **Test with a Simple Query:**

  Try running a simple query to ensure that the database and schema settings are correct:

  ```sql
  SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA();
  ```

  This should return:

  | CURRENT_DATABASE() | CURRENT_SCHEMA() |
  |--------------------|------------------|
  | NEW_YORK_NOAA      | NEW_YORK         |

---

**Conclusion:**

The error you're experiencing is likely due to your SQL client interpreting your input as containing multiple statements when it expects only one. By ensuring that you're executing a single statement at a time, removing any unintended semicolons or hidden characters, and verifying the correct table name and permissions, you should be able to resolve the error.

---

**Next Steps in Your Analysis:**

- **Proceed with Data Exploration:**

  Once you're able to execute your queries successfully, you can continue exploring the data and performing your analysis.

- **Adjust Other Queries Accordingly:**

  Apply the same principles to any other queries that are producing similar errors.

2025-01-24 01:02:47 - root - INFO - **Understanding the Error:**

You're encountering the following error:

```
002003 (42S02): 01b9ea3e-0004-809b-0001-11c300f8df0a: SQL compilation error:
Object '"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"' does not exist or not authorized.
```

**Explanation:**

Even though your query references the table `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"`, the error message indicates that the object `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` does not exist or you lack authorization to access it. This suggests that:

- The table might actually be named `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` **without the leading underscore**.
- Snowflake cannot find the table `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` because it doesn't exist in the current schema.
- The error message references `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` because Snowflake may be interpreting the underscore differently, or it's suggesting the closest existing table.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Set the Correct Database and Schema:**

   Ensure that your session is using the correct database and schema.

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
   USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
   ```

2. **Verify the Table Name:**

   List all tables in the `NEW_YORK` schema to confirm the exact table name.

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
   ```

   Look for the table related to 311 service requests. It's likely named `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` **without the leading underscore**.

3. **Adjust Your Query with the Correct Table Name:**

   Update your query to use the correct table name.

   ```sql
   SELECT "created_date",
          TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "date_converted"
   FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Consider Case Sensitivity and Quoting:**

   - In Snowflake, when you **enclose identifiers in double quotes**, they are **case-sensitive**.
   - If the table was created without quotes (unquoted identifiers), its name is stored in **uppercase** by default.

   **Try referencing the table without quotes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "created_date",
          TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "date_converted"
   FROM 311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   Or, if you prefer to use quotes, ensure the case matches exactly as stored in the database. If the table is stored in uppercase, use:

   ```sql
   SELECT "CREATED_DATE",
          TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("CREATED_DATE" / 1000)) AS "DATE_CONVERTED"
   FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Confirm the Column Names:**

   Verify that the `"created_date"` column exists in the `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` table and check its exact casing.

   ```sql
   DESCRIBE TABLE "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS";
   ```

6. **Check Your Permissions:**

   Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the table:

   - **USAGE** privilege on the `NEW_YORK` schema.
   - **SELECT** privilege on the `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` table.

   If you lack these permissions, contact your database administrator to obtain the necessary access.

7. **Test the Corrected Query:**

   After confirming the table name and column names, execute the corrected query.

   **Example:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "created_date",
          TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "date_converted"
   FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   Or without quotes (if your table and column names are in uppercase):

   ```sql
   SELECT CREATED_DATE,
          TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP(CREATED_DATE / 1000)) AS DATE_CONVERTED
   FROM 311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Summary:**

- The error occurs because the table `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` does not exist in the `NEW_YORK` schema.
- The correct table name is likely `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` without the leading underscore.
- Snowflake is case-sensitive when using quoted identifiers. Ensure that table and column names are correctly cased.

**Next Steps:**

- Update your query to use the correct table name and verify the case of your identifiers.
- Ensure that you're connected to the correct database and schema.
- Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the table and its columns.

**Example of Corrected Query Flow:**

1. **Set the Database and Schema:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
   USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
   ```

2. **Verify the Table Exists:**

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES LIKE '%SERVICE%';
   ```

   Look for `311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` in the result.

3. **Describe the Table to Confirm Column Names:**

   ```sql
   DESCRIBE TABLE "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS";
   ```

   Confirm that the `created_date` column exists and note its exact casing.

4. **Execute the Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "created_date",
          TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP("created_date" / 1000)) AS "date_converted"
   FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   Or, adjusting for case sensitivity:

   ```sql
   SELECT CREATED_DATE,
          TO_DATE(TO_TIMESTAMP(CREATED_DATE / 1000)) AS DATE_CONVERTED
   FROM 311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Using Incorrect Table Names:**

  Ensure that you're referencing the correct table name as it exists in the database.

- **Be Mindful of Identifier Quoting and Case Sensitivity:**

  - Unquoted identifiers are automatically uppercased and are case-insensitive.
  - Quoted identifiers preserve case and are case-sensitive.

- **Permissions:**

  If you continue to receive "not authorized" errors after correcting the table name, check with your database administrator to confirm your access rights.

**Final Note:**

By adjusting the table name in your query to `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` and ensuring that you're using the correct case for identifiers, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully execute your query.

2025-01-24 01:03:33 - root - INFO - **Understanding the Error:**

You're encountering the following error when trying to execute your query:

```
002003 (42S02): SQL compilation error:
Object 'STATIONS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

**Explanation:**

This error indicates that Snowflake cannot find the table named `"STATIONS"` in your current database and schema context, or you don't have the necessary permissions to access it.

**Reason for the Error:**

- The **`"STATIONS"` table is located in the `"NOAA_GSOD"` schema**, not in the `"NEW_YORK"` schema.
- Your session is currently set to use the `"NEW_YORK_NOAA"` database and the `"NEW_YORK"` schema.
- The table is not found because it's in a different schema.

---

**Solution: Set the Correct Schema or Use Fully Qualified Table Names**

Since your SQL client is not allowing multiple statements in one execution (as indicated by the error when running `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands together), you have two options:

1. **Execute `USE` Commands Separately**
2. **Use Fully Qualified Table Names in Your Query**

---

### **Option 1: Execute `USE` Commands Separately**

**Step 1: Set the Database (Execute Separately)**

Run the following command by itself:

```sql
USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA"
```

**Step 2: Set the Schema to `"NOAA_GSOD"` (Execute Separately)**

Run the following command by itself:

```sql
USE SCHEMA "NOAA_GSOD"
```

**Note:** Since your SQL client doesn't allow multiple statements in one execution, make sure to run these `USE` commands one at a time before running your `SELECT` query.

**Step 3: Verify the Current Database and Schema (Optional)**

You can confirm that you've switched to the correct database and schema:

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA();
```

**Expected Output:**

| CURRENT_DATABASE() | CURRENT_SCHEMA() |
|--------------------|------------------|
| NEW_YORK_NOAA      | NOAA_GSOD        |

**Step 4: Execute Your Query**

Now, run your `SELECT` query:

```sql
SELECT "usaf", "name", "lat", "lon"
FROM "STATIONS"
WHERE "name" ILIKE '%LA GUARDIA%' OR "name" ILIKE '%JOHN F KENNEDY%'
LIMIT 100
```

---

### **Option 2: Use Fully Qualified Table Names**

If you cannot change the schema due to client restrictions, you can reference the table using its fully qualified name, including the database and schema.

**Execute the Query Using the Fully Qualified Table Name:**

```sql
SELECT "usaf", "name", "lat", "lon"
FROM "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS"
WHERE "name" ILIKE '%LA GUARDIA%' OR "name" ILIKE '%JOHN F KENNEDY%'
LIMIT 100
```

**Advantages:**

- No need to change the current database or schema.
- Ensures that you're accessing the correct table regardless of session context.

---

**Additional Tips:**

- **Ensure Correct Quotation and Case Sensitivity:**

  - In Snowflake, identifiers enclosed in double quotes (`"`) are case-sensitive.
  - Verify that the database, schema, and table names are correctly cased.
  - If the table name is in uppercase in the database, make sure to use uppercase letters or remove the double quotes.

- **Check Your Permissions:**

  - Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the `"STATIONS"` table.
  - Required privileges include `USAGE` on the database and schema and `SELECT` on the table.
  - If you lack the necessary permissions, contact your database administrator.

---

**Example Execution Flow:**

1. **Option 1: Using `USE` Commands Separately**

   **Step 1:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA"
   ```

   **Step 2:**

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "NOAA_GSOD"
   ```

   **Step 3:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "usaf", "name", "lat", "lon"
   FROM "STATIONS"
   WHERE "name" ILIKE '%LA GUARDIA%' OR "name" ILIKE '%JOHN F KENNEDY%'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

2. **Option 2: Using Fully Qualified Table Name**

   ```sql
   SELECT "usaf", "name", "lat", "lon"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NOAA_GSOD"."STATIONS"
   WHERE "name" ILIKE '%LA GUARDIA%' OR "name" ILIKE '%JOHN F KENNEDY%'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

**Applying This Knowledge to Previous Queries:**

- **For Queries Involving the `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` Table:**

  - This table is in the `"NEW_YORK"` schema.
  - Ensure your session uses the `"NEW_YORK"` schema or use the fully qualified table name.

- **For Queries Involving the NOAA GSOD Tables:**

  - These tables are in the `"NOAA_GSOD"` schema.
  - Switch to this schema or use the fully qualified table names.

---

**Understanding Session Context Errors:**

The error you received earlier:

```
000008 (0A000): Actual statement count 2 did not match the desired statement count 1.
```

**Explanation:**

- This error occurs because your SQL client doesn't allow multiple statements (like `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA`) in a single execution.
- To resolve this, execute each command **separately**, one at a time.

**Recommendations:**

- **Always Set the Database and Schema at the Start of Your Session:**

  - **Set Database:**

    ```sql
    USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA"
    ```

  - **Set Schema:**

    ```sql
    USE SCHEMA "NOAA_GSOD"
    ```

- **Alternatively, Use Fully Qualified Table Names in Your Queries.**

---

**Summary:**

- **Error Cause:** Attempting to access a table in the wrong schema.
- **Solution:** Set the correct schema or use the fully qualified table name.
- **Action Items:**

  - Execute `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands separately before your queries.
  - Ensure that your queries reference the correct database and schema.
  - Use fully qualified table names if you cannot change the session context.
  - Verify your permissions on the relevant database, schema, and tables.

2025-01-24 01:08:00 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering an error due to the incorrect table name in your query. Let's address this issue.

**Understanding the Error:**

Your query:

```sql
SELECT "created_date",
       COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
GROUP BY "created_date"
ORDER BY "created_date"
LIMIT 100
```

**Error Message:**

```
002003 (42S02): SQL compilation error:
Object '_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

**Explanation:**

- The error message refers to `'_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'`, indicating that the table could be named with a leading underscore.
- However, your query references `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` **without** the leading underscore.
- This mismatch suggests that the actual table name in your database is `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"`.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Verify the Correct Table Name:**

   Based on the initial information you provided, the table is named with a leading underscore:

   ```plaintext
   table_name,_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
   DDL,"create or replace TABLE _311_SERVICE_REQUESTS (
       ...
   );"
   ```

2. **Adjust Your Query to Use the Correct Table Name:**

   Replace `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` with `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` in your query.

   ```sql
   SELECT "created_date",
          COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
   FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   GROUP BY "created_date"
   ORDER BY "created_date"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Ensure Correct Database and Schema Context:**

   - Set the current database and schema to ensure Snowflake looks for the table in the right place.
   - **Note:** Execute these commands **separately** in your SQL client, as some clients do not allow multiple statements in one execution.

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
   ```

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
   ```

4. **Use Fully Qualified Table Name (if necessary):**

   If you cannot change the session's database and schema settings, use the fully qualified table name in your query.

   ```sql
   SELECT "created_date",
          COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
   FROM "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   GROUP BY "created_date"
   ORDER BY "created_date"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Check Your Permissions:**

   Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the table:

   - **USAGE** privilege on the `NEW_YORK_NOAA` database and `NEW_YORK` schema.
   - **SELECT** privilege on the `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` table.

   If you lack these permissions, contact your database administrator.

6. **Verify the Table's Existence:**

   To confirm the exact table name and its presence in the schema, list all tables:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK";
   ```

   Look for the table with a name similar to `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS`.

7. **Check for Case Sensitivity and Quotation:**

   - In Snowflake, identifiers enclosed in double quotes (`"`) are **case-sensitive**.
   - Ensure that the table and column names in your query match exactly as they are defined in the database.
   - If the table name is in lowercase or uppercase, adjust your query accordingly.

**Final Corrected Query:**

Assuming the table is named `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` and you've set the correct database and schema, your query should be:

```sql
SELECT "created_date",
       COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
GROUP BY "created_date"
ORDER BY "created_date"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Alternative with Fully Qualified Table Name:**

```sql
SELECT "created_date",
       COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
FROM "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
GROUP BY "created_date"
ORDER BY "created_date"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Typos:** Ensure there are no typos in the table name.
- **Case Matching:** If the table name is stored in uppercase, and you are not using double quotes, you can write:

  ```sql
  SELECT "CREATED_DATE",
         COUNT(*) AS "DAILY_COMPLAINT_COUNT"
  FROM _311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
  GROUP BY "CREATED_DATE"
  ORDER BY "CREATED_DATE"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Session Context Verification:** Confirm your current database and schema:

  ```sql
  SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA();
  ```

  Expected result:

  | CURRENT_DATABASE() | CURRENT_SCHEMA() |
  |--------------------|------------------|
  | NEW_YORK_NOAA      | NEW_YORK         |

**Summary:**

- The error occurs because Snowflake cannot find the table `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"`; the actual table name is likely `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"`.
- Adjust your query to use the correct table name with the leading underscore.
- Ensure you have set the correct database and schema or use the fully qualified table name.
- Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the table.

**Next Steps:**

- Run the corrected query.
- If you encounter further errors, share the exact error message so we can assist you further.

2025-01-24 01:08:41 - root - INFO - It seems that you're still encountering an error when trying to access the `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` table. Let's carefully analyze the problem and resolve the issue.

---

**Understanding the Error:**

- **Your Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "created_date",
         COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
  FROM "311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
  GROUP BY "created_date"
  ORDER BY "created_date"
  LIMIT 100
  ```

- **Error Message:**

  ```
  002003 (42S02): SQL compilation error:
  Object '"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"' does not exist or not authorized.
  ```

**Explanation:**

- The error indicates that the table `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` does **not exist** or you **do not have authorization** to access it.
- Based on the DDL you provided earlier, the actual table name is likely `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` **with a leading underscore**.

---

**Action Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

**1. Verify the Exact Table Name:**

- **Query to List Tables in the Schema:**

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK";
  ```

- **Expected Output (Sample):**

  | created_on               | name                   | database_name  | schema_name | kind  | ... |
  |--------------------------|------------------------|----------------|-------------|-------|-----|
  | 2023-10-01 12:34:56.789  | _311_SERVICE_REQUESTS  | NEW_YORK_NOAA  | NEW_YORK    | TABLE |     |
  | ...                      | ...                    | ...            | ...         | ...   |     |

- **Observation:**

  - If the table appears as `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"`, it confirms that the table name includes a **leading underscore**.
  - Ensure that the **case** matches exactly. Since you're using double quotes, Snowflake treats identifiers as **case-sensitive**.

**2. Adjust the Query with the Correct Table Name:**

- **Updated Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "created_date",
         COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
  FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
  GROUP BY "created_date"
  ORDER BY "created_date"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

**3. Ensure Correct Database and Schema Context:**

- **Set the Database and Schema (Execute Separately):**

  ```sql
  USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
  USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
  ```

- **Note:**

  - Since your SQL client may not allow multiple statements in a single execution, run each `USE` command separately.
  - You can verify the current database and schema:

    ```sql
    SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA();
    ```

    **Expected Result:**

    | CURRENT_DATABASE() | CURRENT_SCHEMA() |
    |--------------------|------------------|
    | NEW_YORK_NOAA      | NEW_YORK         |

**4. Check Permissions:**

- **Confirm that You Have the Necessary Privileges:**

  - **USAGE** privilege on the `"NEW_YORK_NOAA"` database.
  - **USAGE** privilege on the `"NEW_YORK"` schema.
  - **SELECT** privilege on the `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` table.

- **If You Lack Permissions:**

  - Contact your database administrator to obtain the necessary privileges.

**5. Verify Column Names and Case Sensitivity:**

- **Check the Columns in the Table:**

  ```sql
  DESCRIBE TABLE "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS";
  ```

  - Ensure that the `"created_date"` column exists and note its exact casing.

- **Adjust Column Names if Necessary:**

  - If the column is named `"CREATED_DATE"`, you need to use the exact case when using double quotes.

**6. Retry the Query with Adjustments:**

- **Final Adjusted Query:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "created_date",
         COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
  FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
  GROUP BY "created_date"
  ORDER BY "created_date"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

---

**Possible Reasons for the Error Persisting:**

- **Incorrect Table Name:** If the table does not exist with either name (`"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` or `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"`), then the table might not be present in the schema.

- **Case Sensitivity Issues:** Since you're using double quotes, ensure that the table name matches exactly, including case and any special characters.

- **Schema Misalignment:** The table might be in a different schema. For example, if it's in a schema named `"PUBLIC"` instead of `"NEW_YORK"`.

---

**Alternative Approach:**

**1. Use Fully Qualified Table Name:**

- **Syntax:**

  ```sql
  SELECT "created_date",
         COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
  FROM "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
  GROUP BY "created_date"
  ORDER BY "created_date"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- **Advantages:**

  - Bypasses any issues with the current database or schema settings.
  - Explicitly specifies the database, schema, and table, reducing ambiguity.

**2. Check for Table in Other Schemas:**

- **List All Schemas in the Database:**

  ```sql
  SHOW SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
  ```

- **Check Tables in Other Schemas:**

  - For each schema, list the tables:

    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."SCHEMA_NAME";
    ```

  - Replace `"SCHEMA_NAME"` with the names from the previous step.

**3. If the Table is Found in Another Schema:**

- Adjust your query to reference the correct schema.

  ```sql
  SELECT "created_date",
         COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
  FROM "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."CORRECT_SCHEMA_NAME"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
  GROUP BY "created_date"
  ORDER BY "created_date"
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

---

**Example of Full Execution Flow:**

1. **Set the Database and Schema:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
   USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
   ```

2. **Verify Current Context:**

   ```sql
   SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA();
   ```

3. **List Tables in Current Schema:**

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
   ```

   - Confirm that `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` exists in the list.

4. **Describe the Table to Confirm Columns:**

   ```sql
   DESCRIBE TABLE "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS";
   ```

   - Ensure that `"created_date"` is a column in the table.

5. **Execute the Adjusted Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "created_date",
          COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
   FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   GROUP BY "created_date"
   ORDER BY "created_date"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

---

**Final Notes:**

- **Double-Check Identifier Quoting:**

  - If the table name is stored in lowercase or mixed case, and you use double quotes, you must match the case exactly.

  - **Example:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "created_date",
           COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
    FROM "_311_service_requests"
    GROUP BY "created_date"
    ORDER BY "created_date"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

- **Try Without Quotes (if Appropriate):**

  - If the table and column names are all uppercase and you don't need to preserve case sensitivity, you can remove the double quotes.

  - **Example:**

    ```sql
    SELECT CREATED_DATE,
           COUNT(*) AS DAILY_COMPLAINT_COUNT
    FROM _311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
    GROUP BY CREATED_DATE
    ORDER BY CREATED_DATE
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

- **Consult the Database Administrator:**

  - If after all adjustments the error persists, there may be an issue with permissions or the table may not exist.

  - Your database administrator can provide insights into:

    - Whether the table exists and its exact name.
    - Whether you have the necessary permissions.
    - Any other issues that may be preventing access.

---

**Adjusted Query (Based on the Likely Correct Table Name):**

```sql
SELECT "created_date",
       COUNT(*) AS "daily_complaint_count"
FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
GROUP BY "created_date"
ORDER BY "created_date"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

2025-01-24 01:09:09 - root - INFO - It appears that the error you're encountering is due to using an incorrect table name in your query. Based on the information provided earlier, the correct table name is `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"`—with a leading underscore.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "complaint_type", COUNT(*) AS "total_count"
FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
GROUP BY "complaint_type"
ORDER BY "total_count" DESC
LIMIT 100
```

**Explanation:**

- **Table Name Correction:**
  - The table is named `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` with a leading underscore. Using `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` without the underscore results in the error because that table does not exist in the database.
  
- **Database and Schema Context:**
  - Ensure that your session is using the correct database and schema. Execute the following commands separately before running your query:
    ```sql
    USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA"
    ```
    ```sql
    USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK"
    ```
    *Note: If your SQL client does not allow multiple statements in one execution, run each `USE` command separately.*

- **Verify Table Existence:**
  - You can confirm that the table exists by listing all tables in the `"NEW_YORK"` schema:
    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK";
    ```
    Look for `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` in the list of tables.

- **Permissions:**
  - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the table:
    - `USAGE` privilege on the `"NEW_YORK_NOAA"` database.
    - `USAGE` privilege on the `"NEW_YORK"` schema.
    - `SELECT` privilege on the `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` table.
  - If you lack these permissions, contact your database administrator.

- **Using Fully Qualified Table Name (Optional):**
  - If setting the database and schema doesn't resolve the issue, or if you prefer not to change the session context, you can use the fully qualified table name:
    ```sql
    SELECT "complaint_type", COUNT(*) AS "total_count"
    FROM "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
    GROUP BY "complaint_type"
    ORDER BY "total_count" DESC
    LIMIT 100
    ```

**Next Steps:**

1. **Set the Database and Schema:**
   - Run the `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` commands separately to ensure your session is pointed to the correct database and schema.

2. **Run the Corrected Query:**
   - Execute the corrected SQL query provided above.

3. **Verify Results:**
   - The query should now execute successfully and return the total count of complaints for each `"complaint_type"`.

**Additional Tip:**

- **Consistency in Identifier Quoting:**
  - Since you're using double quotes around your identifiers, Snowflake treats them as case-sensitive. Ensure that the table and column names in your query exactly match those in the database, including case and any special characters.

**Example Execution Flow:**

1. **Set Database and Schema:**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA"
   ```
   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK"
   ```

2. **Execute Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "complaint_type", COUNT(*) AS "total_count"
   FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   GROUP BY "complaint_type"
   ORDER BY "total_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100
   ```

**Conclusion:**

By correcting the table name to include the leading underscore and ensuring you're in the correct database and schema, you should be able to execute your query without errors. If you continue to experience issues, please verify your permissions or consult with your database administrator.

2025-01-24 01:09:58 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering the following error when executing your SQL query:

```
002003 (42S02): 01b9ea45-0004-809b-0001-11c300f8df92: SQL compilation error:
Object '_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS' does not exist or not authorized.
```

Even though your query references `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"`, the error mentions `'_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'`. This suggests there might be an issue with the table name, case sensitivity, or permissions.

---

### **Possible Reasons and Solutions:**

#### **1. Incorrect Table Name:**

- **Table Name with Leading Underscore:**
  - The correct table name is likely `**_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS**`, with a leading underscore, as per the DDL you provided earlier.

#### **2. Case Sensitivity in Snowflake:**

- **Unquoted Identifiers:**
  - In Snowflake, unquoted identifiers (like table and column names) are automatically converted to uppercase.
  - Therefore, if the table was created without quotes, it's stored as `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` in uppercase.

- **Quoted Identifiers:**
  - When you enclose identifiers in double quotes (`"`), Snowflake treats them as case-sensitive.
  - If you use `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"`, Snowflake looks for a table with that exact name and case, which may not exist.

**Action:** Remove the double quotes from the table name to allow Snowflake to interpret it correctly.

#### **3. Setting the Correct Database and Schema:**

- **Ensure the Current Database and Schema are Set:**
  - Before running your query, set the database and schema. Execute these commands separately:

    ```sql
    USE DATABASE NEW_YORK_NOAA;
    ```

    ```sql
    USE SCHEMA NEW_YORK;
    ```

#### **4. Verify Table Existence and Permissions:**

- **Check if the Table Exists:**
  - List all tables in the `NEW_YORK` schema to confirm the exact table name:

    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA NEW_YORK;
    ```

  - Look for `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` in the list.

- **Permissions:**
  - Ensure you have the necessary privileges:
    - `USAGE` privilege on the `NEW_YORK_NOAA` database.
    - `USAGE` privilege on the `NEW_YORK` schema.
    - `SELECT` privilege on the `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` table.
  - If not, contact your database administrator to grant the required permissions.

#### **5. Corrected SQL Query:**

Given the above, here's the corrected query without double quotes around the table name:

```sql
SELECT "complaint_type", COUNT(*) AS "total_count"
FROM _311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
GROUP BY "complaint_type"
ORDER BY "total_count" DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation:**

- **Removed Double Quotes from Table Name:**
  - By removing the double quotes, Snowflake treats `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS` as an unquoted identifier, converts it to uppercase, and matches it with the table stored in uppercase.

- **Retained Double Quotes for Column Names:**
  - Column names are kept in double quotes if they were created with specific cases or contain special characters.

---

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Execute the Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "complaint_type", COUNT(*) AS "total_count"
   FROM _311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
   GROUP BY "complaint_type"
   ORDER BY "total_count" DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **If Error Persists:**

   - **Verify Table Name and Case:**
     - Ensure the table name is exactly `_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS`.
     - If it was created with quotes and has a different case or special characters, you need to match that exact name.

   - **Use Fully Qualified Table Name:**

     ```sql
     SELECT "complaint_type", COUNT(*) AS "total_count"
     FROM NEW_YORK_NOAA.NEW_YORK._311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
     GROUP BY "complaint_type"
     ORDER BY "total_count" DESC
     LIMIT 100;
     ```

     - This specifies the database and schema explicitly.

   - **Check with Database Administrator:**
     - Confirm that the table exists and you have access to it.

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Hidden Characters:**
  - Ensure there are no typos or hidden characters in your query.

- **Consistent Identifier Usage:**
  - Be consistent with using double quotes. If you start using them for identifiers, remember that they enforce case sensitivity.

- **Testing with Simpler Queries:**
  - Try running a simple `SELECT` query to confirm access:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM _311_SERVICE_REQUESTS
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

2025-01-24 01:12:44 - root - INFO - It appears that you're encountering an error because the table `"311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` does not exist or you don't have the necessary permissions to access it. Based on previous context, the correct table name is likely `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` with a leading underscore.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT "complaint_type", "latitude", "longitude"
FROM "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK"."_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Table Name Correction:** The table is named `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` with a leading underscore. Changing the table name in your query should resolve the "object does not exist or not authorized" error.
- **Consistent Quoting:** By enclosing the table and column names in double quotes (`"`), you ensure that the case sensitivity and any special characters are preserved.

**Additional Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Verify the Table Exists:**

   To confirm the exact table name and its existence, you can list all tables in the `"NEW_YORK"` schema:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA "NEW_YORK_NOAA"."NEW_YORK";
   ```

   Look for `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` in the list of tables.

2. **Check Your Permissions:**

   Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the table:

   - **USAGE** privilege on the `"NEW_YORK_NOAA"` database.
   - **USAGE** privilege on the `"NEW_YORK"` schema.
   - **SELECT** privilege on the `"_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"` table.

   If you lack these permissions, contact your database administrator to grant you the appropriate privileges.

3. **Set the Correct Database and Schema Context:**

   Before running your query, set the current database and schema to ensure you're in the correct context. Execute these commands separately:

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
   ```

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
   ```

**Try the Query Without Fully Qualified Table Name:**

If you've set the current database and schema, you can run the query without the fully qualified table name:

```sql
SELECT "complaint_type", "latitude", "longitude"
FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
LIMIT 100;
```

**Notes:**

- **Session Context:** Setting the database and schema simplifies your queries and reduces the chance of referencing the wrong object.
- **Case Sensitivity:** Ensure that the table name and column names match exactly, including case and any special characters, since identifiers in double quotes are case-sensitive in Snowflake.

**Example Execution Flow:**

1. **Set Database and Schema (Execute Separately):**

   ```sql
   USE DATABASE "NEW_YORK_NOAA";
   ```

   ```sql
   USE SCHEMA "NEW_YORK";
   ```

2. **Execute the Corrected Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "complaint_type", "latitude", "longitude"
   FROM "_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

**Conclusion:**

By correcting the table name to include the leading underscore and ensuring you're referencing the correct object, you should be able to execute your query successfully. If you continue to encounter errors, double-check your permissions and consult with your database administrator if necessary.

**Feel free to let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!**

Task: Could you help me analyze the relationship between each complaint type and daily temperature in New York city, focusing on data in airports LaGuardia and JFK over the 10 years starting from 2008? Calculate the total complaint count, the total day count, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (rounded to 4 decimals) between temperature and both the count and percentage of each common (>5000 occurrences) and strongly correlated (absolute value > 0.5) complaint type.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Complaint_Type,Total_Complaint_Count,Total_Day_Count,Pearson_Correlation_Count,Pearson_Correlation_Percentage
complaint_type1:str,total_count1:int,total_days1:int,correlation1:float,correlation_percent1:float
complaint_type2:str,total_count2:int,total_days2:int,correlation2:float,correlation_percent2:float
...
```

This table summarizes the analysis of the relationship between each common complaint type (with over 5000 occurrences) and daily temperature at LaGuardia and JFK airports in New York City from 2008 to 2017. For each complaint type that shows a strong correlation (absolute Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.5) with temperature, it provides:

- **Complaint_Type**: The type of 311 complaint.
- **Total_Complaint_Count**: The total number of complaints recorded over the 10-year period.
- **Total_Day_Count**: The total number of days with recorded complaints.
- **Pearson_Correlation_Count**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between daily temperature and the daily count of complaints of this type, rounded to 4 decimals.
- **Pearson_Correlation_Percentage**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between daily temperature and the percentage of this complaint type among all complaints on that day, rounded to 4 decimals.

This analysis helps identify which complaint types are most affected by temperature changes, providing insights for city services to allocate resources more effectively based on weather patterns..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-24 01:16:37 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you help me analyze the relationship between each complaint type and daily temperature in New York city, focusing on data in airports LaGuardia and JFK over the 10 years starting from 2008? Calculate the total complaint count, the total day count, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (rounded to 4 decimals) between temperature and both the count and percentage of each common (>5000 occurrences) and strongly correlated (absolute value > 0.5) complaint type., reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Complaint_Type,Total_Complaint_Count,Total_Day_Count,Pearson_Correlation_Count,Pearson_Correlation_Percentage
complaint_type1:str,total_count1:int,total_days1:int,correlation1:float,correlation_percent1:float
complaint_type2:str,total_count2:int,total_days2:int,correlation2:float,correlation_percent2:float
...
```

This table summarizes the analysis of the relationship between each common complaint type (with over 5000 occurrences) and daily temperature at LaGuardia and JFK airports in New York City from 2008 to 2017. For each complaint type that shows a strong correlation (absolute Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.5) with temperature, it provides:

- **Complaint_Type**: The type of 311 complaint.
- **Total_Complaint_Count**: The total number of complaints recorded over the 10-year period.
- **Total_Day_Count**: The total number of days with recorded complaints.
- **Pearson_Correlation_Count**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between daily temperature and the daily count of complaints of this type, rounded to 4 decimals.
- **Pearson_Correlation_Percentage**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between daily temperature and the percentage of this complaint type among all complaints on that day, rounded to 4 decimals.

This analysis helps identify which complaint types are most affected by temperature changes, providing insights for city services to allocate resources more effectively based on weather patterns. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
