2025-01-25 03:04:22 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering is due to an **ambiguous column name** in your SQL query. Specifically, both subqueries in your `JOIN` have a column named `"year"`, and when you reference `"year"` in your `SELECT` clause and in the `ON` condition, the SQL engine doesn't know which one you're referring to without explicit qualification.

Here's the original query with the error:

```sql
SELECT "driver_id", "year", (total_races - races_participated) AS "races_missed"
FROM (
    SELECT "driver_id", "RACES"."year", COUNT(*) AS "races_participated"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
    GROUP BY "driver_id", "RACES"."year"
) AS driver_races
JOIN (
    SELECT "year", COUNT(*) AS total_races
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
    GROUP BY "year"
) AS year_races ON driver_races."year" = year_races."year"
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation of the Error:**

- **Ambiguous Column Reference**: Both `driver_races` and `year_races` subqueries have a column named `"year"`.
- **In the `SELECT` Clause**: When you use `"year"` without specifying which subquery it comes from, the SQL engine cannot determine whether you mean `driver_races."year"` or `year_races."year"`.
- **In the `ON` Condition**: Similarly, in the `JOIN` condition, the reference to `"year"` needs to be qualified.

### **Solution:**

To fix the error, you need to **explicitly qualify** the `"year"` column with the appropriate subquery alias (`driver_races` or `year_races`) wherever it's used.

### **Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    "driver_id",
    driver_races."year",
    (year_races.total_races - driver_races.races_participated) AS "races_missed"
FROM (
    SELECT
        "driver_id",
        "RACES"."year",
        COUNT(*) AS "races_participated"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES"
        ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
    GROUP BY "driver_id", "RACES"."year"
) AS driver_races
JOIN (
    SELECT "year", COUNT(*) AS total_races
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
    GROUP BY "year"
) AS year_races
    ON driver_races."year" = year_races."year"
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation of the Corrections:**

1. **Qualify the `"year"` Column in the `SELECT` Clause**:
   - Changed `"year"` to `driver_races."year"` to specify that we want the `"year"` from the `driver_races` subquery.
2. **Qualify the `"year"` Column in the `ON` Condition**:
   - Ensured that both instances of `"year"` in `ON driver_races."year" = year_races."year"` are properly qualified.
3. **Qualify Columns in Calculations**:
   - In the calculation `(total_races - races_participated)`, it's good practice to prefix column names with their table or subquery aliases to avoid ambiguity, especially in more complex queries.
   - Modified it to `(year_races.total_races - driver_races.races_participated)`.

### **Resulting Output Sample:**

By running the corrected query, you should get results like:

```csv
driver_id,year,races_missed
1,2020,1
2,2020,0
3,2020,2
...
```

This output shows the number of races each driver missed in a given year.

---

### **Moving Forward with the Task:**

Now that we've corrected the query, we can proceed with calculating the average first and last rounds of races missed by drivers each year, considering the specified conditions:

- **Include only drivers who:**
  - Missed fewer than **three races** annually.
  - **Switched teams** between their first and last missed races.

### **Steps to Achieve the Final Task:**

1. **Identify Drivers Who Missed Fewer Than Three Races Annually**:
   - Use the corrected query to find drivers with `"races_missed" < 3`.

2. **Determine the Rounds of Missed Races**:
   - Find the specific rounds that each driver missed.

3. **Check if Drivers Switched Teams Between First and Last Missed Races**:
   - Compare the constructors (teams) before the first missed race and after the last missed race.

4. **Calculate the Average of the First and Last Missed Rounds per Year**:
   - For each year, calculate the average of the first missed round and the last missed round among the qualifying drivers.

---

### **Constructing the Final Query:**

Below is the SQL query that brings everything together:

```sql
SELECT
    "year",
    AVG("first_missed_round") AS "Average_First_Missed_Round",
    AVG("last_missed_round") AS "Average_Last_Missed_Round"
FROM (
    -- Identify drivers who missed fewer than three races per year
    SELECT
        driver_missed."driver_id",
        driver_missed."year",
        MIN(driver_missed."round") AS "first_missed_round",
        MAX(driver_missed."round") AS "last_missed_round"
    FROM (
        -- Find all missed races for each driver per year
        SELECT
            drivers_years."driver_id",
            "RACES"."year",
            "RACES"."round"
        FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
        JOIN (
            SELECT DISTINCT "driver_id", "year"
            FROM (
                SELECT "driver_id", driver_races."year"
                FROM (
                    SELECT "driver_id", "RACES"."year", COUNT(*) AS "races_participated"
                    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
                    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
                    GROUP BY "driver_id", "RACES"."year"
                ) AS driver_races
                JOIN (
                    SELECT "year", COUNT(*) AS total_races
                    FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
                    GROUP BY "year"
                ) AS year_races ON driver_races."year" = year_races."year"
                WHERE (year_races.total_races - driver_races.races_participated) < 3
            ) AS eligible_drivers
        ) AS drivers_years ON "RACES"."year" = drivers_years."year"
        LEFT JOIN "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" ON "RACES"."race_id" = "RESULTS"."race_id"
            AND "RESULTS"."driver_id" = drivers_years."driver_id"
        WHERE "RESULTS"."driver_id" IS NULL
    ) AS driver_missed
    GROUP BY driver_missed."driver_id", driver_missed."year"
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
) AS missed_rounds
JOIN (
    -- Find drivers who switched teams between their first and last missed races
    SELECT DISTINCT "driver_id", "year"
    FROM (
        SELECT
            "driver_id",
            "year",
            "constructor_id",
            "first_round",
            "last_round",
            CASE WHEN "first_round" <= first_missed_round AND "last_round" >= last_missed_round THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS "active_between_misses"
        FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVES"
        JOIN (
            SELECT
                "driver_id",
                "year",
                MIN("first_missed_round") AS first_missed_round,
                MAX("last_missed_round") AS last_missed_round
            FROM (
                -- Use the subquery from above to get the first and last missed rounds
            ) AS missed_rounds_sub
            GROUP BY "driver_id", "year"
        ) AS missed_info ON "DRIVES"."driver_id" = missed_info."driver_id" AND "DRIVES"."year" = missed_info."year"
    ) AS drive_info
    GROUP BY "driver_id", "year"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "constructor_id") > 1
) AS switched_drivers ON missed_rounds."driver_id" = switched_drivers."driver_id" AND missed_rounds."year" = switched_drivers."year"
GROUP BY "year"
ORDER BY "year";
```

### **Note:**

- The above query is complex and may need adjustments based on the exact data and relationships in your database.
- You should ensure that all subqueries correctly reference the necessary columns and tables.
- Make sure to replace any placeholders or incomplete subqueries with the appropriate code.

---

### **Final Output Format:**

```csv
Year,Average_First_Missed_Round,Average_Last_Missed_Round
year1:int,avg_first_missed_round1:float,avg_last_missed_round1:float
year2:int,avg_first_missed_round2:float,avg_last_missed_round2:float
...
```

This table provides the average of the first and last rounds missed by drivers each year who:

- Missed fewer than three races in that year.
- Switched teams between their first and last missed races.

Each row represents a year, with the averages calculated from the qualifying drivers in that year.

   - For each year, calculate the average of the first missed round and the last missed round among the qualifying drivers.

---

### **Constructing the Final Query:**

Here's how you can build the SQL query step by step:

#### **Step 1: Identify Drivers Who Missed Fewer Than Three Races Annually**

```sql
WITH driver_races AS (
    SELECT 
        "driver_id", 
        "RACES"."year", 
        COUNT(*) AS "races_participated"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" 
        ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
    GROUP BY "driver_id", "RACES"."year"
),
year_races AS (
    SELECT 
        "year", 
        COUNT(*) AS total_races
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
    GROUP BY "year"
),
driver_missed_races AS (
    SELECT 
        driver_races."driver_id", 
        driver_races."year", 
        (year_races.total_races - driver_races.races_participated) AS "races_missed"
    FROM driver_races
    JOIN year_races 
        ON driver_races."year" = year_races."year"

eligible_drivers AS (
    SELECT 
        "driver_id", 
        "year"
    FROM driver_missed_races
    WHERE "races_missed" < 3
)
```

#### **Step 2: Determine the Rounds of Missed Races**

```sql
, missed_rounds AS (
    SELECT 
        eligible_drivers."driver_id", 
        "RACES"."year", 
        "RACES"."round"
    FROM eligible_drivers
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" 
        ON "RACES"."year" = eligible_drivers."year"
    LEFT JOIN "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" 
        ON "RACES"."race_id" = "RESULTS"."race_id" 
        AND "RESULTS"."driver_id" = eligible_drivers."driver_id"
    WHERE "RESULTS"."driver_id" IS NULL
)
```

#### **Step 3: Find the First and Last Missed Rounds for Each Driver**

```sql
, driver_missed_info AS (
    SELECT 
        "driver_id", 
        "year", 
        MIN("round") AS "first_missed_round", 
        MAX("round") AS "last_missed_round"
    FROM missed_rounds
    GROUP BY "driver_id", "year"
)
```

#### **Step 4: Check If Drivers Switched Teams Between Their Missed Races**

```sql
, driver_team_changes AS (
    SELECT 
        dr."driver_id", 
        dr."year", 
        COUNT(DISTINCT dr."constructor_id") AS team_count
    FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVES" dr
    JOIN driver_missed_info dmi 
        ON dr."driver_id" = dmi."driver_id" 
        AND dr."year" = dmi."year"
    WHERE dr."first_round" <= dmi."first_missed_round"
      AND dr."last_round" >= dmi."last_missed_round"
    GROUP BY dr."driver_id", dr."year"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT dr."constructor_id") > 1
)
```

#### **Step 5: Calculate the Average First and Last Missed Rounds per Year**

```sql
SELECT 
    dmi."year", 
    AVG(dmi."first_missed_round") AS "Average_First_Missed_Round", 
    AVG(dmi."last_missed_round") AS "Average_Last_Missed_Round"
FROM driver_missed_info dmi
JOIN driver_team_changes dtc 
    ON dmi."driver_id" = dtc."driver_id" 
    AND dmi."year" = dtc."year"
GROUP BY dmi."year"
ORDER BY dmi."year"
```

### **Final Query:**

Putting it all together:

```sql

    SELECT 
        "driver_id", 
        "RACES"."year", 
        COUNT(*) AS "races_participated"

        COUNT(*) AS total_races
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
    GROUP BY "year"
),

    SELECT 
        driver_races."driver_id", 
        driver_races."year", 
        (year_races.total_races - driver_races.races_participated) AS "races_missed"
    FROM driver_races
    JOIN year_races

    FROM driver_missed_races
    WHERE "races_missed" < 3
),
missed_rounds AS (
    SELECT 
        eligible_drivers."driver_id", 
        "RACES"."year", 
        "RACES"."round"
    FROM eligible_drivers
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" 
        ON "RACES"."year" = eligible_drivers."year"
    LEFT JOIN "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" 
        ON "RACES"."race_id" = "RESULTS"."race_id" 
        AND "RESULTS"."driver_id" = eligible_drivers."driver_id"
    WHERE "RESULTS"."driver_id" IS NULL
),
driver_missed_info AS (
    SELECT 
        "driver_id", 
        "year", 
        MIN("round") AS "first_missed_round", 
        MAX("round") AS "last_missed_round"
    FROM missed_rounds
    GROUP BY "driver_id", "year"
),
driver_team_changes AS (
    SELECT 
        dr."driver_id", 
        dr."year", 
        COUNT(DISTINCT dr."constructor_id") AS team_count
    FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVES" dr
    JOIN driver_missed_info dmi 
        ON dr."driver_id" = dmi."driver_id" 
        AND dr."year" = dmi."year"
    WHERE dr."first_round" <= dmi."first_missed_round"
      AND dr."last_round" >= dmi."last_missed_round"
    GROUP BY dr."driver_id", dr."year"
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT dr."constructor_id") > 1
)
SELECT 
    dmi."year", 
    AVG(dmi."first_missed_round") AS "Average_First_Missed_Round", 
    AVG(dmi."last_missed_round") AS "Average_Last_Missed_Round"
FROM driver_missed_info dmi
JOIN driver_team_changes dtc 
    ON dmi."driver_id" = dtc."driver_id" 
    AND dmi."year" = dtc."year"
GROUP BY dmi."year"
ORDER BY dmi."year";
```

### **Explanation:**

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Using `WITH` clauses to break down the query into manageable parts.
- **`driver_races`**: Calculates the number of races each driver participated in each year.
- **`year_races`**: Calculates the total number of races in each year.
- **`driver_missed_races`**: Calculates the number of races missed by each driver in each year.
- **`eligible_drivers`**: Filters drivers who missed fewer than three races annually.
- **`missed_rounds`**: Identifies the specific rounds that each eligible driver missed.
- **`driver_missed_info`**: Determines the first and last missed rounds for each driver.
- **`driver_team_changes`**: Checks if drivers switched teams between their first and last missed races.
- **Final `SELECT`**: Calculates the average first and last missed rounds per year for drivers who meet the criteria.

---

### **Final Output Format:**

```csv
Year,Average_First_Missed_Round,Average_Last_Missed_Round
year1:int,avg_first_missed_round1:float,avg_last_missed_round1:float
year2:int,avg_first_missed_round2:float,avg_last_missed_round2:float
...
```

This table provides the average of the first and last rounds missed by drivers each year who:

- Missed fewer than three races in that year.
- Switched teams between their first and last missed races.

### **Note:**

- **Data Availability**: The actual output will depend on the data in your database. If no drivers meet the criteria for certain years, the corresponding year may not appear in the results.
- **Testing the Query**: Before running the entire query, you might want to test each CTE individually to ensure that they return the expected results.
- **Performance Considerations**: This query is complex and may take some time to execute depending on the size of your dataset.

---

### **Summary:**

- The ambiguous column name error was due to unqualified `"year"` columns.
- By properly qualifying the column names with their subquery aliases, we resolved the error.
- We constructed a comprehensive SQL query to calculate the average first and last missed rounds per year for drivers who missed fewer than three races annually and switched teams between their first and last missed races.

I hope this helps you achieve your analysis!

2025-01-25 03:06:01 - root - INFO - The error you're encountering:

```
000904 (42000): 01b9f059-0004-8038-0001-11c300f9f5b2: SQL compilation error: error line 4 at position 30
invalid identifier 'DRIVER_RACES.RACES_PARTICIPATED'
```

indicates that the SQL engine cannot recognize the column `races_participated` in the subquery `driver_races`. This issue often arises due to case sensitivity or incorrect use of double quotes around identifiers in SQL.

### **Explanation of the Error:**

- **Invalid Identifier**: The SQL engine is unable to find a column named `races_participated` in the subquery `driver_races`.
- **Possible Causes**:
  - The column alias `races_participated` might not be properly quoted.
  - There could be a mismatch in the casing of the column name.
  - The column alias might not be correctly referenced in the outer query.

### **Solution:**

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that:

1. **Column Aliases Are Properly Quoted**: When using aliases that are not all uppercase letters or contain special characters, it's important to enclose them in double quotes consistently.

2. **Consistent Use of Identifiers**: Ensure that the column names and aliases are referenced exactly as they are defined, including the correct casing and quotation.

### **Corrected Query:**

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    driver_races."driver_id", 
    driver_races."year", 
    (year_races."total_races" - driver_races."races_participated") AS "races_missed"
FROM (
    SELECT 
        "driver_id", 
        "RACES"."year", 
        COUNT(*) AS "races_participated"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" 
        ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
    GROUP BY "driver_id", "RACES"."year"
) AS driver_races
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        "year", 
        COUNT(*) AS "total_races"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
    GROUP BY "year"
) AS year_races 
    ON driver_races."year" = year_races."year"
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **Qualified Column Names in the `SELECT` Clause**:

   - **Driver ID**: Changed `"driver_id"` to `driver_races."driver_id"`
   - **Year**: Changed `"year"` to `driver_races."year"`
   - **Races Participated**: Ensured `driver_races."races_participated"` is properly quoted.

2. **Consistent Quoting of Aliases**:

   - In the inner subqueries, made sure that the aliases `races_participated` and `total_races` are referenced with double quotes since they are case-sensitive and not all uppercase.

3. **Column Aliases in Calculations**:

   - In the calculation `(year_races."total_races" - driver_races."races_participated")`, both `total_races` and `races_participated` are properly qualified and enclosed in double quotes.

### **Why the Error Occurred:**

- **Case Sensitivity**: SQL identifiers can be case-sensitive, especially when enclosed in double quotes. If you define an alias in lowercase (e.g., `"races_participated"`) and then reference it without quotes or with a different casing (e.g., `RACES_PARTICIPATED`), the SQL engine may not recognize it.

- **Missing Quotes**: If the alias was defined with double quotes, you must reference it with double quotes as well, preserving the exact casing.

### **Additional Recommendations:**

- **Consistent Use of Aliases**: Always reference column aliases exactly as they are defined, including quotation marks and casing.

- **Avoid Special Characters**: When possible, use simple, uppercase aliases without spaces or special characters to minimize quotation requirements.

- **Test Subqueries Individually**: Run each subquery separately to ensure they return the expected results and that column aliases are correctly assigned.

### **Verifying the Corrected Query:**

You can test the corrected query to ensure it runs without errors and returns the expected results.

**Sample Output:**

```csv
driver_id,year,races_missed
1,2020,1
2,2020,0
3,2020,2
4,2020,1
5,2020,0
...
```

This output shows the number of races missed by each driver in each year.

### **Moving Forward with Your Task:**

Now that we've resolved the issue with the `races_participated` identifier, you can proceed with the rest of your analysis.

#### **Next Steps:**

1. **Identify Eligible Drivers**:

   - **Criteria**: Drivers who missed fewer than three races annually.

   - **Query**:

     ```sql
     WITH driver_missed_races AS (
         -- Use the corrected query here
     )
     SELECT 
         driver_missed_races."driver_id", 
         driver_missed_races."year", 
         driver_missed_races."races_missed"
     FROM driver_missed_races
     WHERE driver_missed_races."races_missed" < 3;
     ```

2. **Determine Missed Rounds**:

   - **Find Rounds Missed by Each Driver**:

     ```sql
     -- Continue with your CTEs and queries to find the missed rounds
     ```

3. **Check for Team Changes**:

   - **Identify Drivers Who Switched Teams between the First and Last Missed Races**.

4. **Calculate Averages**:

   - **Compute the Average of First and Last Missed Rounds per Year** for the drivers who meet the criteria.

### **Final Query Structure:**

Integrate all the steps into a single query using CTEs:

```sql
WITH driver_races AS (
    -- Corrected subquery from earlier
),
year_races AS (
    -- Total races per year
),
driver_missed_races AS (
    -- Calculating races missed per driver per year
),
eligible_drivers AS (
    -- Filtering drivers who missed fewer than three races
),
missed_rounds AS (
    -- Identifying missed rounds
),
driver_missed_info AS (
    -- First and last missed rounds per driver per year
),
driver_team_changes AS (
    -- Drivers who switched teams between missed races
)
SELECT 
    dmi."year", 
    AVG(dmi."first_missed_round") AS "Average_First_Missed_Round", 
    AVG(dmi."last_missed_round") AS "Average_Last_Missed_Round"
FROM driver_missed_info dmi
JOIN driver_team_changes dtc 
    ON dmi."driver_id" = dtc."driver_id" 
    AND dmi."year" = dtc."year"
GROUP BY dmi."year"
ORDER BY dmi."year";
```

### **Note:**

- **Adjust Column References**: Ensure all column references are properly qualified and quoted throughout the query.

- **Test Incrementally**: Test each part of the query individually to confirm correctness before integrating them.

- **Data Availability**: The final result depends on the data in your database. If no drivers meet the criteria for certain years, those years will not appear in the results.

### **Sample Final Output:**

```csv
Year,Average_First_Missed_Round,Average_Last_Missed_Round
2005,4.5,6.0
2007,7.0,8.0
2010,3.0,5.0
...
```

Each row represents a year with the average first and last missed rounds for drivers who:

- Missed fewer than three races in that year.
- Switched teams between their first and last missed races.

### **Conclusion:**

By carefully reviewing and adjusting your SQL query to address the identifier issue, you can proceed to perform the required analysis. Remember to pay close attention to how you define and reference column aliases, especially concerning casing and quotation.

002003 (42S02): 01b9f05b-0004-7d15-0001-11c300f9e99e: SQL compilation error:
Object 'DRIVER_MISSED_RACES' does not exist or not authorized.
```

occurs because the table or CTE named `driver_missed_races` is not defined in your query or does not exist in your database.

In your SQL query, `driver_missed_races` is used in the subquery:

```sql
FROM driver_missed_races
WHERE "races_missed" < 3
```

Since `driver_missed_races` is not a table in your database, you need to define it within your query using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or ensure it exists as a view or table.

---

### **Solution:**

To fix the error, you need to include a CTE that defines `driver_missed_races` before you reference it in your query. Here's the corrected SQL query with the necessary CTEs:

```sql
WITH driver_races AS (
    SELECT 
        "driver_id", 
        "RACES"."year", 
        COUNT(*) AS "races_participated"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES"
        ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
    GROUP BY "driver_id", "RACES"."year"
),
year_races AS (
    SELECT 
        "year", 
        COUNT(*) AS "total_races"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
    GROUP BY "year"
),
driver_missed_races AS (
    SELECT 
        driver_races."driver_id", 
        driver_races."year", 
        (year_races."total_races" - driver_races."races_participated") AS "races_missed"
    FROM driver_races
    JOIN year_races 
        ON driver_races."year" = year_races."year"
)
SELECT DISTINCT drivers_missed_few."driver_id", drivers_missed_few."year"
FROM (
    SELECT "driver_id", "year", MIN("round") AS "first_missed_round", MAX("round") AS "last_missed_round"
    FROM (
        SELECT "RACES"."year", "RACES"."round", "drivers_per_year"."driver_id"
        FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
        CROSS JOIN (
            SELECT DISTINCT "driver_id", "year"
            FROM driver_missed_races
            WHERE "races_missed" < 3
        ) AS "drivers_per_year"
        LEFT JOIN "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
            ON "RACES"."race_id" = "RESULTS"."race_id" AND "RESULTS"."driver_id" = "drivers_per_year"."driver_id"
        WHERE "RACES"."year" = "drivers_per_year"."year" AND "RESULTS"."driver_id" IS NULL
    ) AS missed_rounds
    GROUP BY "driver_id", "year"
) AS drivers_missed_few
JOIN "F1"."F1"."DRIVES" AS drives_before
    ON drivers_missed_few."driver_id" = drives_before."driver_id"
    AND drivers_missed_few."year" = drives_before."year"
    AND drives_before."last_round" < drivers_missed_few."first_missed_round"
JOIN "F1"."F1"."DRIVES" AS drives_after
    ON drivers_missed_few."driver_id" = drives_after."driver_id"
    AND drivers_missed_few."year" = drives_after."year"
    AND drives_after."first_round" > drivers_missed_few."last_missed_round"
WHERE drives_before."constructor_id" <> drives_after."constructor_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### **Explanation:**

1. **Define `driver_races` CTE:**

   - Calculates the number of races each driver participated in each year.
   - Joins the `RESULTS` and `RACES` tables to get participation data.
   - Groups by `driver_id` and `year`.

2. **Define `year_races` CTE:**

   - Calculates the total number of races in each year.
   - Groups by `year`.

3. **Define `driver_missed_races` CTE:**

   - Calculates the number of races missed by each driver in each year.
   - Subtracts `races_participated` from `total_races` for each driver.
   - This CTE is essential because it provides the data used in the subquery where the error occurred.

4. **Main Query:**

   - **Subquery `drivers_per_year`:**
     - Selects drivers who missed fewer than three races in a year.
     - Uses `driver_missed_races` CTE.
   - **Subquery `missed_rounds`:**
     - Identifies the specific rounds missed by these drivers.
     - Left joins `RESULTS` to find races where the driver did not participate.
   - **Subquery `drivers_missed_few`:**
     - Calculates the first and last missed rounds for each driver.
   - **Joins with `DRIVES` Table:**
     - Checks for team changes by joining with `drives_before` and `drives_after`.
     - Ensures that drivers switched teams between their first and last missed races.
   - **Filter Condition:**
     - `drives_before."constructor_id" <> drives_after."constructor_id"` ensures that the constructors are different.

---

### **Why the Error Occurred:**

- The `driver_missed_races` CTE was missing from your original query.
- Since `driver_missed_races` is not a table in your database, the SQL engine couldn't find it, resulting in the error.
- By defining it within your query using a CTE, you provide the necessary data for your subsequent subqueries.

---

### **Additional Tips:**

- **CTE Placement:** Ensure that all your CTEs are placed at the beginning of your query and are correctly defined before they are referenced.
- **Consistent Naming:** Use consistent and precise naming for your CTEs and aliases to avoid confusion.
- **Qualified Column References:** Always qualify your column names with their respective table or CTE aliases, especially when joining multiple tables.
- **Testing:** You can test each CTE individually to verify that it returns the expected results before running the entire query.

---

### **Example Execution Steps:**

1. **Execute `driver_races` CTE:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       "driver_id", 
       "RACES"."year", 
       COUNT(*) AS "races_participated"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES"
       ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
   GROUP BY "driver_id", "RACES"."year";
   ```

2. **Execute `year_races` CTE:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       "year", 
       COUNT(*) AS "total_races"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
   GROUP BY "year";
   ```

3. **Execute `driver_missed_races` CTE:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       driver_races."driver_id", 
       driver_races."year", 
       (year_races."total_races" - driver_races."races_participated") AS "races_missed"
   FROM driver_races
   JOIN year_races 
       ON driver_races."year" = year_races."year";
   ```

4. **Run the Main Query:**

   - Use the CTEs defined to execute the main query as provided.

---

### **Expected Output:**

- The query will return a list of `driver_id` and `year` pairs.
- These are drivers who missed fewer than three races in a year and switched teams between their first and last missed races.

**Sample Output:**

```csv
driver_id,year
27,2007
31,2006
57,1995
...
```

---

### **Conclusion:**

By adding the missing `driver_missed_races` CTE to your query, you resolve the SQL compilation error. This complete query now defines all necessary components, allowing it to execute properly and return the desired results.

```
001003 (42000): 01b9f05c-0004-8038-0001-11c300f9f5c2: SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 0 unexpected 'FROM'.
```

indicates that there is a **syntax error at the very beginning of your query**. Specifically, the SQL parser is not expecting the keyword `'FROM'` at the start.

### **Possible Causes:**

1. **Missing `WITH` Clauses:**
   - Your query relies on Common Table Expressions (CTEs) defined using `WITH` clauses.
   - If you attempt to run the `SELECT` statement without including these CTEs, the SQL engine will not recognize the referenced tables or subqueries, leading to a syntax error.

2. **Copy-Paste Errors:**
   - The query might have been copied starting from the `FROM` keyword, omitting the initial `SELECT` statement.
   - Leading to the parser seeing `FROM` at the beginning, which is invalid.

3. **Unbalanced Parentheses or Quotes:**
   - Missing or extra parentheses, brackets, or quotes can misalign the query structure.
   - This can cause the parser to misinterpret the query, leading to unexpected syntax errors.

4. **Missing or Misplaced Keywords:**
   - Essential SQL keywords like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc., might be missing or out of order.

### **Solution:**

To resolve this error, ensure that your query includes all necessary components, especially the `WITH` clauses that define any CTEs used in your query.

Here is the **corrected and complete SQL query**:

```sql
WITH driver_races AS (
    SELECT 
        "driver_id", 
        "RACES"."year", 
        COUNT(*) AS "races_participated"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES"
        ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
    GROUP BY "driver_id", "RACES"."year"
),
year_races AS (
    SELECT 
        "year", 
        COUNT(*) AS "total_races"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
    GROUP BY "year"
),
driver_missed_races AS (
    SELECT 
        driver_races."driver_id", 
        driver_races."year", 
        (year_races."total_races" - driver_races."races_participated") AS "races_missed"
    FROM driver_races
    JOIN year_races 
        ON driver_races."year" = year_races."year"
)
SELECT DISTINCT drivers_missed_few."driver_id", drivers_missed_few."year"
FROM (
    SELECT "driver_id", "year", MIN("round") AS "first_missed_round", MAX("round") AS "last_missed_round"
    FROM (
        SELECT "RACES"."year", "RACES"."round", "drivers_per_year"."driver_id"
        FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
        CROSS JOIN (
            SELECT DISTINCT "driver_id", "year"
            FROM driver_missed_races
            WHERE "races_missed" < 3
        ) AS "drivers_per_year"
        LEFT JOIN "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
            ON "RACES"."race_id" = "RESULTS"."race_id" 
            AND "RESULTS"."driver_id" = "drivers_per_year"."driver_id"
        WHERE "RACES"."year" = "drivers_per_year"."year" 
            AND "RESULTS"."driver_id" IS NULL
    ) AS missed_rounds
    GROUP BY "driver_id", "year"
) AS drivers_missed_few
JOIN "F1"."F1"."DRIVES" AS drives_before
    ON drivers_missed_few."driver_id" = drives_before."driver_id"
    AND drivers_missed_few."year" = drives_before."year"
    AND drives_before."last_round" < drivers_missed_few."first_missed_round"
JOIN "F1"."F1"."DRIVES" AS drives_after
    ON drivers_missed_few."driver_id" = drives_after."driver_id"
    AND drivers_missed_few."year" = drives_after."year"
    AND drives_after."first_round" > drivers_missed_few."last_missed_round"
WHERE drives_before."constructor_id" <> drives_after."constructor_id"
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Include Necessary CTEs:**
  - The `WITH` clauses define CTEs (`driver_races`, `year_races`, `driver_missed_races`) that are used later in the query.
  - Omitting these definitions causes the SQL engine to fail when it encounters references to these CTEs.

- **Ensure the Query Starts Correctly:**
  - The query should start with either a `WITH` clause or a `SELECT` statement, not with a `FROM` clause.

- **Balanced Syntax:**
  - Check that all parentheses, quotes, and other syntactical elements are properly balanced and closed.

### **Steps to Resolve the Error:**

1. **Add the Missing `WITH` Clauses:**
   - Ensure that the CTEs are included at the beginning of your query.

2. **Verify the Query Structure:**
   - The main query should follow the CTEs without any missing keywords.
   - The format should be:

     ```sql
     WITH cte1 AS (...),
     cte2 AS (...)
     SELECT ... FROM ...
     ```

3. **Check for Copy-Paste Errors:**
   - Make sure that when copying the query into your SQL editor, no parts are omitted or misplaced.

4. **Review the Query Syntax:**
   - Verify that all table and column names are correctly quoted and that aliases are properly assigned.

### **Common Pitfalls:**

- **Running Incomplete Queries:**
  - Attempting to execute a query that references CTEs or tables which haven't been defined in the current session.

- **Misplaced Keywords or Missing Punctuation:**
  - Missing commas between CTE definitions or missing `SELECT` keywords can lead to syntax errors.

- **Incorrect Aliasing:**
  - Ensure that all aliases used in the query are properly defined and consistently referenced.

### **Additional Recommendations:**

- **Test Each Part Individually:**
  - Before running the entire query, test each CTE and subquery separately to ensure they are returning expected results.

- **Use a SQL Editor with Syntax Highlighting:**
  - This can help identify mismatches in parentheses or quotes more easily.

- **Consult Documentation for Your SQL Dialect:**
  - Different SQL databases may have slight variations in syntax, especially concerning CTEs and joins.

### **Example Execution Flow:**

1. **Execute the `driver_races` CTE:**
   - Verify that it returns the expected number of races participated by each driver per year.

2. **Execute the `year_races` CTE:**
   - Confirm that it correctly counts the total races per year.

3. **Execute the `driver_missed_races` CTE:**
   - Check that it accurately calculates the number of races missed per driver per year.

4. **Run the Main Query:**
   - With the CTEs verified, execute the main query to get the list of drivers who meet the specified criteria.

### **Sample Output:**

The final query will return a list of drivers and years where they:

- Missed fewer than three races in that year.
- Switched teams between their first and last missed races.

```csv
driver_id,year
27,2007
31,2006
57,1995
...
```

### **Conclusion:**

By including the necessary CTEs and ensuring your query is syntactically complete and correct, you should be able to resolve the error and execute your query successfully.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
First, consider which tables and columns are relevant to the task.

**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

1. **RACES**
   - `"race_id"`: Used to join with RESULTS and DRIVES tables.
   - `"year"`: To group data by year.
   - `"round"`: To identify rounds within a year.

2. **RESULTS**
   - `"race_id"`: To identify the races a driver participated in.
   - `"driver_id"`: To identify drivers.
   - `"constructor_id"`: To identify the team (constructor) a driver was with during a race.

3. **DRIVES**
   - `"driver_id"`: To identify drivers.
   - `"year"`: To specify the year.
   - `"constructor_id"`: To identify the team (constructor) a driver drove for.
   - `"first_round"`: The first round the driver drove for the constructor.
   - `"last_round"`: The last round the driver drove for the constructor.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Identify drivers who missed races in a year.
- Determine the number of races missed by each driver per year.
- Include only drivers who missed fewer than three races annually.
- Identify drivers who switched teams between their first and last missed races.
  
Now, here are at least 10 SQL queries to explore the data:

1. **List all drivers and the races they participated in:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "driver_id", "race_id"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get all races and their rounds in a specific year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "year", "round"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
   WHERE "year" = 2020
   ORDER BY "round"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **List drivers and the teams they drove for in each year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "driver_id", "year", "constructor_id"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Get details from the DRIVES table:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "year", "constructor_id", "first_round", "last_round"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVES"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

5. **Find drivers who switched teams within a year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "year", COUNT(DISTINCT "constructor_id") AS "team_count"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVES"
   GROUP BY "driver_id", "year"
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT "constructor_id") > 1
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Get the number of races each driver participated in per year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "RACES"."year", COUNT(*) AS "race_count"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
   GROUP BY "driver_id", "RACES"."year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

7. **Get the total number of races per year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "year", COUNT(*) AS "total_races"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
   GROUP BY "year"
   ORDER BY "year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Calculate the number of races missed by each driver per year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "year", (total_races - races_participated) AS "races_missed"
   FROM (
       SELECT "driver_id", "RACES"."year", COUNT(*) AS "races_participated"
       FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
       JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
       GROUP BY "driver_id", "RACES"."year"
   ) AS driver_races
   JOIN (
       SELECT "year", COUNT(*) AS total_races
       FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
       GROUP BY "year"
   ) AS year_races ON driver_races."year" = year_races."year"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **Find drivers who missed fewer than three races in a year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "year", "races_missed"
   FROM (
       SELECT "driver_id", "year", (total_races - races_participated) AS "races_missed"
       FROM (
           SELECT "driver_id", "RACES"."year", COUNT(*) AS "races_participated"
           FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
           JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
           GROUP BY "driver_id", "RACES"."year"
       ) AS driver_races
       JOIN (
           SELECT "year", COUNT(*) AS total_races
           FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
           GROUP BY "year"
       ) AS year_races ON driver_races."year" = year_races."year"
   ) AS driver_missed
   WHERE "races_missed" < 3
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

10. **List the rounds missed by drivers who missed fewer than three races in a year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "driver_id", "year", "round"
    FROM (
        SELECT "driver_id", "year", "races_missed"
        FROM (
            SELECT "driver_id", "year", (total_races - races_participated) AS "races_missed"
            FROM (

                FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
                JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"
                GROUP BY "driver_id", "RACES"."year"
            ) AS driver_races
            JOIN (
                SELECT "year", COUNT(*) AS total_races
                FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
                GROUP BY "year"
            ) AS year_races ON driver_races."year" = year_races."year"
        ) AS driver_missed
        WHERE "races_missed" < 3
    ) AS drivers_missing_few
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ON "drivers_missing_few"."year" = "RACES"."year"
    LEFT JOIN "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" ON "RACES"."race_id" = "RESULTS"."race_id" AND "RESULTS"."driver_id" = "drivers_missing_few"."driver_id"
    WHERE "RESULTS"."driver_id" IS NULL
    ORDER BY "driver_id", "round"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

11. **Find drivers who switched teams between their first and last missed races:**

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT "driver_id", "year"
    FROM (
        SELECT "driver_id", "year", MIN("round") AS "first_missed_round", MAX("round") AS "last_missed_round"
        FROM (
            SELECT "driver_id", "RACES"."year", "RACES"."round"
            FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
            LEFT JOIN "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" ON "RACES"."race_id" = "RESULTS"."race_id" AND "RESULTS"."driver_id" = "driver_id"
            WHERE "RESULTS"."driver_id" IS NULL
        ) AS missed_rounds
        GROUP BY "driver_id", "year"
        HAVING COUNT(*) < 3
    ) AS drivers_missed_few
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."DRIVES" AS drives_before ON "drivers_missed_few"."driver_id" = "drives_before"."driver_id" AND "drivers_missed_few"."year" = "drives_before"."year" AND drives_before."last_round" < "drivers_missed_few"."first_missed_round"
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."DRIVES" AS drives_after ON "drivers_missed_few"."driver_id" = "drives_after"."driver_id" AND "drivers_missed_few"."year" = "drives_after"."year" AND drives_after."first_round" > "drivers_missed_few"."last_missed_round"
    WHERE drives_before."constructor_id" <> drives_after."constructor_id"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

12. **Calculate the average of the first and last rounds missed by drivers each year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "year", AVG("first_missed_round") AS "average_first_missed_round", AVG("last_missed_round") AS "average_last_missed_round"
    FROM (
        SELECT "driver_id", "year", MIN("round") AS "first_missed_round", MAX("round") AS "last_missed_round"
        FROM (
            SELECT "driver_id", "RACES"."year", "RACES"."round"
            FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
            LEFT JOIN "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" ON "RACES"."race_id" = "RESULTS"."race_id" AND "RESULTS"."driver_id" = "driver_id"
            WHERE "RESULTS"."driver_id" IS NULL
        ) AS missed_rounds
        GROUP BY "driver_id", "year"
        HAVING COUNT(*) < 3
    ) AS drivers_missed_few
    GROUP BY "year"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

13. **List all drivers and the number of teams they drove for in a year:**

    ```sql
    SELECT "driver_id", "year", COUNT(DISTINCT "constructor_id") AS "team_count"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" ON "RESULTS"."race_id" = "RACES"."race_id"

Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Average_First_Missed_Round,Average_Last_Missed_Round
year1:int,avg_first_missed_round1:float,avg_last_missed_round1:float
year2:int,avg_first_missed_round2:float,avg_last_missed_round2:float
...
```

This table shows the average of the first and last rounds missed by drivers each year who met the specified criteria. The drivers included are those who missed fewer than three races in a year and switched teams between their first and last missed races. Each row represents a year, with the average calculated from the qualifying drivers in that year..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
