# Special Words Definition

## Batting Average
- Batting average is a measure of a batsman's performance, calculated by dividing the total number of runs scored by the number of times they have been dismissed. A higher batting average indicates a more consistent and successful batsman.
- Batting Average = Total Runs ÷ Total Dismissals

## Strike Rate
- In batting, strike rate indicates the scoring rate of a batsman, showing the average number of runs scored per 100 balls faced. A higher strike rate reflects an aggressive and fast-scoring batsman.
- Strike Rate = (Total Runs ÷ Balls Faced) × 100

## Wickets Taken
- Wickets taken refers to the total number of times a bowler has successfully dismissed an opposing batsman. This statistic is a core measure of a bowler's effectiveness and impact on the game.

## Economy Rate
- Economy rate measures a bowler's efficiency by indicating the average number of runs conceded per over (6 balls) bowled. A lower economy rate shows greater control and efficiency in restricting the opposition's scoring.
- Economy Rate = (Total Runs Conceded ÷ Balls Bowled) × 6

## Wickets Taken
- The number of times a bowler successfully dismisses a batsman in a single match.  This metric is a direct indicator of the bowler's effectiveness, showing how many players they were able to remove from play.

## Runs Given
- The total number of runs scored by the batting side off a particular bowler’s deliveries in a single match.  This value reflects the runs the bowler has conceded to the batting team, and a lower runs-given value is typically favorable for the bowler's performance.
The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'IPL': {'IPL': ['BALL_BY_BALL', 'BATSMAN_SCORED', 'EXTRA_RUNS', 'MATCH', 'PLAYER', 'PLAYER_MATCH', 'TEAM', 'WICKET_TAKEN']}}
Begin Exploring Related Columns
To accomplish the task, we'll need to identify the relevant tables and columns from the provided database schema, and understand how they relate to each other. Below is the mapping of columns to their potential usage:

### Relevant Tables and Columns

1. **PLAYER**

   - `"player_id"`: Unique identifier for each player.
   - `"player_name"`: Name of the player.

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: For each player, list their ID, name, most frequent role across all matches, batting hand, bowling skill, total runs scored, total matches played, total dismissals, batting average, highest score in a single match, number of matches where their score exceeded 30, 50, and 100, total balls faced in their career, strike rate, total wickets taken, economy rate, and their best performance in a single match (most wickets taken, in the format "wickets taken-runs given"). Ignore the extra runs data.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To provide the requested player statistics, we will list each player with their respective data fields as specified. Here's the structured data in CSV format:

```csv
Player_ID,Name,Most_Frequent_Role,Batting_Hand,Bowling_Skill,Total_Runs_Scored,Total_Matches_Played,Total_Dismissals,Batting_Average,Highest_Score_In_Single_Match,Matches_Scored_Over_30,Matches_Scored_Over_50,Matches_Scored_Over_100,Total_Balls_Faced,Strike_Rate,Total_Wickets_Taken,Economy_Rate,Best_Bowling_Performance
v1:int,v2:str,v3:str,v4:str,v5:str,v6:int,v7:int,v8:int,v9:float,v10:int,v11:int,v12:int,v13:int,v14:int,v15:float,v16:int,v17:float,v18:str
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Player_ID (int):** Unique identifier for each player.
- **Name (str):** Full name of the player.
- **Most_Frequent_Role (str):** The role (e.g., batsman, bowler, all-rounder) the player has played most often across all matches.
- **Batting_Hand (str):** The batting style (e.g., Right-hand bat, Left-hand bat) of the player.
- **Bowling_Skill (str):** The bowling style (e.g., Right-arm fast, Left-arm spin) of the player.
- **Total_Runs_Scored (int):** Total number of runs scored by the player in their career.
- **Total_Matches_Played (int):** Total number of matches the player has participated in.
- **Total_Dismissals (int):** Total number of times the player has been dismissed.
- **Batting_Average (float):** Calculated as Total Runs Scored divided by Total Dismissals.
- **Highest_Score_In_Single_Match (int):** The highest number of runs scored by the player in a single match.
- **Matches_Scored_Over_30 (int):** Number of matches where the player scored more than 30 runs.
- **Matches_Scored_Over_50 (int):** Number of matches where the player scored more than 50 runs.
- **Matches_Scored_Over_100 (int):** Number of matches where the player scored more than 100 runs.
- **Total_Balls_Faced (int):** Total number of balls the player has faced in their career.
- **Strike_Rate (float):** Calculated as (Total Runs Scored divided by Total Balls Faced) multiplied by 100.
- **Total_Wickets_Taken (int):** Total number of wickets the player has taken.
- **Economy_Rate (float):** Calculated as (Total Runs Given divided by Total Balls Bowled) multiplied by 6.
- **Best_Bowling_Performance (str):** The best bowling figures in a single match, formatted as "wickets taken-runs given" (e.g., "5-27").

Please note that the data fields are placeholders indicating the type of data (e.g., `int`, `str`, `float`) expected in each column. The actual data would be populated based on the calculations performed on the database records..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'IPL': {'IPL': ['BALL_BY_BALL', 'BATSMAN_SCORED', 'EXTRA_RUNS', 'MATCH', 'PLAYER', 'PLAYER_MATCH', 'TEAM', 'WICKET_TAKEN']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
