The correct SQL is **2result.sql**.

**Reason:**

- **2result.sql** accurately models the picking process by ordering the inventory based on the earliest purchase date and smallest quantity.
- It uses window functions to calculate the cumulative inventory and determines the picked quantity for each inventory batch, ensuring that the picked quantities match the overlapping range between the total ordered quantity and the available inventory.
- This approach aligns with the requirement to consider the order in which inventory is consumed and to not exceed the available inventory or the total ordered quantity.
- In contrast, **0result.sql** simply calculates the pick percentage by taking the lesser of the total ordered quantity and total inventory, without considering the order of inventory consumption or the specifics of the picking process described.

**Therefore, the correct SQL query that fulfills the requirements is:**

```plaintext
2result.sql
