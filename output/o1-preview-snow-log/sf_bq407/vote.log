2result.sql

I have chosen `2result.sql` as the correct SQL query because it properly joins the census data and the COVID-19 data on the county FIPS codes by accounting for differences in formatting between the two datasets.

In the census data (`COUNTY_2020_5YR` table), the `geo_id` field may contain additional prefixes or characters beyond the standard 5-digit county FIPS code. To accurately match the counties, `2result.sql` uses the `RIGHT` function to extract the last five characters of the `geo_id`, which correspond to the county FIPS code. It also ensures that the `county_fips_code` from the COVID-19 data (`SUMMARY` table) is left-padded with zeros to five digits using the `LPAD` function. This approach aligns the formatting of both fields, allowing for a correct and reliable join between the two tables.

The other SQL queries (`0result.sql` and `1result.sql`) attempt to join the tables directly using `s."county_fips_code" = c."geo_id"`. However, if there's a mismatch in the formatting of the `geo_id` and `county_fips_code` fields (such as prefixes or differing lengths), this direct join may not correctly align the data, leading to inaccurate results.

By handling the formatting differences and ensuring the county FIPS codes are properly matched, `2result.sql` accurately identifies the top three counties with populations over 50,000 that had the highest COVID-19 case fatality rates on August 27, 2020. It provides the required details, including the county name, state, median age, total population, confirmed cases per 100,000 people, deaths per 100,000 people, and the case fatality rate percentage.
