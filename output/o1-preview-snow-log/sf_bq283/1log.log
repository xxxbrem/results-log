**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS`
  - `"trip_id"`: Identifier for each trip; potential usage in counting trips.
  - `"start_station_id"`: ID of the station where each trip starts; potential usage in grouping trips by starting station.
  - `"duration_minutes"`: Duration of each trip in minutes; potential usage in calculating average trip duration per station.
- **Table:** `AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS`
  - `"station_id"`: Identifier for each station; potential usage in joining with trips to get station information.
  - `"status"`: Status of the station (e.g., 'active'); potential usage in filtering for active stations.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Filter stations where `"status"` is 'active'.
- Join `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` with `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` on matching station IDs.
- Group trips by `"start_station_id"` to aggregate data per station.
- Order results by the total number of trips in descending order.
- Limit results to the top 15 stations based on trip count.

   GROUP BY "start_station_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

8. **Get the average duration of trips starting from active stations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."start_station_id", AVG(t."duration_minutes") AS "average_duration"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS AS t
   JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS AS s
     ON t."start_station_id" = s."station_id"
   WHERE s."status" = 'active'
   GROUP BY t."start_station_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

9. **List trips with start station names by joining trips and stations:**

   ```sql
   SELECT t."trip_id", t."start_station_id", s."name" AS "start_station_name"
   FROM AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_TRIPS AS t
   LEFT JOIN AUSTIN.AUSTIN_BIKESHARE.BIKESHARE_STATIONS AS s
     ON t."start_station_id" = s."station_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

These queries progressively explore the data relevant to the task, from simple retrievals to more complex aggregations and joins. By examining the results of these queries, one can gain an understanding of how the trips and stations data relate to each other and how to approach identifying the top 15 active stations based on trip starts.Query:

Task: Identify the top 15 active stations based on the number of trip starts. For each of these stations, provide the station ID, the total number of trips that start there, the percentage this represents out of all trips from active stations, and the average duration of trips starting from the station.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To identify the top 15 active stations based on the number of trip starts, we consider only stations with an "active" status from the `BIKESHARE_STATIONS` table. We join this with the `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` table on the station IDs, count the number of trips starting at each station, calculate the percentage of these trips out of all trips from active stations, and compute the average duration of trips starting from each station.

The resulting data is presented below:

```csv
station_id,total_number_of_trips,percentage_of_total_trips,average_duration_minutes
id1:int,num_trips1:int,percentage1:float[0,100],avg_duration1:float

*(Attention: answer in 15 rows)*.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'AUSTIN': {'AUSTIN_311': ['_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS'], 'AUSTIN_BIKESHARE': ['BIKESHARE_STATIONS', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS'], 'AUSTIN_CRIME': ['CRIME'], 'AUSTIN_INCIDENTS': ['INCIDENTS_2008', 'INCIDENTS_2009', 'INCIDENTS_2010', 'INCIDENTS_2011', 'INCIDENTS_2016'], 'AUSTIN_WASTE': ['WASTE_AND_DIVERSION']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
