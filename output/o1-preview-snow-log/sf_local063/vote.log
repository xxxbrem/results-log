After comparing both SQL scripts and their results, the correct SQL script that accurately addresses the task is:

```plaintext
0result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Methodology Alignment:** The `0result.sql` script correctly identifies the top 20% of products based on total sales by using the `NTILE(5)` function, which divides the products into five equal groups and selects those in the top 20% (those where `"sales_ntile" = 1`).

- **Sales Share Calculation:** It accurately computes the sales share for each product in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 in the US without promotions by filtering on `s."promo_id" = 999` and joining the necessary tables for the time and customer dimensions.

- **Correct Identification of the Product:** The script identifies **"Team shirt"** as the product with the smallest change in sales share between the two periods, with a change of `0.0005`, which is smaller than the change identified in `2result.sql`.

- **Consistency with Data:** The approach in `0result.sql` is consistent with the data provided, where the "Team shirt" product appears multiple times (due to different product IDs) but is collectively one of the top-selling products. The script effectively captures this by grouping sales per product ID.

- **Appropriate Use of Functions:** The use of window functions like `NTILE` and the handling of `NULL` values ensures accurate ranking and calculation, making the results reliable.

Hence, the `0result.sql` script is the correct choice as it effectively computes the required metrics and accurately identifies the product with the smallest change in sales share among the top 20% of products.
