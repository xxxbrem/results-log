After comparing both SQL queries and their results, the correct SQL that addresses the task is **1result.sql**.

**Reasoning:**

- **Task Requirements:**
  - **Examine records for Chinese cities in July 2021.**
  - **Identify both the shortest and longest streaks of consecutive date entries.**
  - **List the dates along with their corresponding city names, capitalizing the first letter of each city name, for these streaks.**
  
- **Analysis of 1result.sql:**
  - **Filters records for Chinese cities (`"country_code_2" = 'cn'`) within July 2021 (`"insert_date" BETWEEN '2021-07-01' AND '2021-07-31'`).**
  - **Calculates streaks of consecutive dates for each city.**
  - **Identifies both the shortest and longest streaks among all Chinese cities in July 2021.**
  - **Outputs the dates and city names (with the first letter capitalized) for the cities with these streaks.**
  
- **Analysis of 2result.sql:**
  - **Focuses only on a specific list of cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Chongqing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Xi'an, Nanjing, and Hangzhou.**
  - **Does not limit the data to July 2021; it considers all available dates.**
  - **Calculates streaks based on the entire dataset for these cities, not specifically within July 2021.**
  - **Therefore, it does not fully address the task requirements.**

**Conclusion:**

- **1result.sql** accurately fulfills the task by correctly filtering the data, calculating the streaks within the specified timeframe, and outputting the required information.
