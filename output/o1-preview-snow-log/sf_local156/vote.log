The correct SQL query is **`2result.sql`**.

```plaintext
2result.sql
```

**Reasoning:**

Upon comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **`2result.sql`** stands out as the correct choice for the following reasons:

1. **Filtering by Bitcoin Transactions:**
   - The task specifically requires analyzing the yearly average cost of **Bitcoin** purchases. The data includes transactions for both Bitcoin (`'BTC'`) and Ethereum (`'ETH'`).
   - **`2result.sql`** correctly includes the condition `AND t."ticker" = 'BTC'` in the `WHERE` clause to filter only Bitcoin transactions.
   - The other SQL queries, **`0result.sql`** and **`1result.sql`**, omit this filter and therefore include both Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions in their calculations. This inclusion skews the average costs and does not accurately reflect the cost of Bitcoin purchases alone.

2. **Accurate Calculation of Average Purchase Cost:**
   - By filtering exclusively for Bitcoin transactions, **`2result.sql`** ensures that the computed average purchase costs are accurate and relevant to the task.
   - The higher average purchase costs in **`2result.csv`** compared to those in **`0result.csv`** and **`1result.csv`** support this accuracy, as Ethereum prices are generally lower than Bitcoin prices. Including Ethereum transactions would artificially lower the average costs, which is not desired.

3. **Correct Use of Window Functions and Ranking:**
   - **`2result.sql`** appropriately uses window functions like `LAG()` to calculate the annual percentage change in average cost per region.
   - It also employs the `RANK()` function to rank the regions based on their average purchase costs each year, fulfilling the task's requirement to rank the regions.

4. **Results Match the Expected Outcomes:**
   - The results in **`2result.csv`** show logical and consistent trends in average purchase costs and annual percentage changes.
   - The annual percentage changes are calculated correctly, reflecting the year-over-year differences in average purchase costs for each region.

In conclusion, **`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query because it accurately filters for Bitcoin purchases, calculates the yearly average costs by region, ranks the regions each year based on these averages, and computes the annual percentage change in cost, all in alignment with the task requirements.
