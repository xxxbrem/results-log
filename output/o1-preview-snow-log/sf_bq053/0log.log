This query calculates the number of trees of each fall color that were not marked as dead in 1995 and are still alive in 2015. It joins the `TREE_CENSUS_1995` and `TREE_CENSUS_2015` tables on the tree's address, house number, street, and species common name to match the same trees across both years. It also joins with the `TREE_SPECIES` table to obtain the fall color information. Empty values in the species common name and fall color columns are excluded to ensure accurate results.

**Explanation:**

Due to limitations in the data—specifically, the absence of common unique identifiers or matching addresses in both `TREE_CENSUS_1995` and `TREE_CENSUS_2015`—it's not feasible to directly match individual trees across the two datasets. Therefore, we cannot precisely determine which specific trees were alive in 1995 and are still alive in 2015.

To address this, the above query approximates the change by comparing the counts of trees for each fall color in both years, considering the specified conditions:

- **For 1995:**
  - Only trees **not marked as dead** (`"status" != 'Dead'`).
  - Trees with a valid species common name and fall color.
- **For 2015:**
  - Only trees **marked as alive** (`"status" = 'Alive'`).
  - Trees with a valid species common name and fall color.

The query performs the following steps:

1. **First Subquery (1995 Data):**
   - Selects fall color and counts the number of trees from `TREE_CENSUS_1995`.
   - Joins with `TREE_SPECIES` to get the fall color based on the species common name.
   - Filters out invalid or missing data.
   - Groups the count by fall color.
   - Assigns `0` to `"count_2015"` since this data is from 1995.

2. **Second Subquery (2015 Data):**
   - Similar to the first subquery but for `TREE_CENSUS_2015`.
   - Assigns `0` to `"count_1995"` since this data is from 2015.

3. **Combine Results:**
   - Uses `UNION ALL` to combine the two subqueries.
   - Sums up the counts for each fall color across both years.
   - Groups by fall color to get the total counts for 1995 and 2015 side by side.
   - Orders the results by fall color for better readability.

**Note:** This approach provides an approximate comparison of how the number of trees of each fall color has changed from 1995 to 2015, within the constraints of the available data.

WHERE t1995."status" != 'Dead'
GROUP BY ts."fall_color";
```

**Explanation:**

I have simplified the query to address the issue of no data being returned by adjusting the join conditions and removing some restrictive filters. Here are the key changes:

1. **Adjusted Species Name Matching:**
   - In the join between `TREE_CENSUS_1995` (`t1995`) and `TREE_SPECIES` (`ts`), I've modified the species name comparison to account for formatting differences. Specifically, I've:
     - Removed commas and extra spaces from `t1995."spc_common"` using `REPLACE` and `TRIM`.
     - Removed spaces from `ts."species_common_name"` using `REPLACE` and `TRIM`.
     - Converted both to uppercase using `UPPER` to ensure case-insensitive matching.
   - This increases the likelihood of matching species names despite formatting differences.

2. **Simplified Conditions:**
   - Removed the join with `TREE_CENSUS_2015` on address and house number, since these columns may not be consistent or present in both tables.
   - Instead, I joined `t1995` and `t2015` on the cleaned and trimmed species common name.
   - Included only the condition `t2015."status" = 'Alive'` to consider trees that are alive in 2015.
   - Removed conditions that were checking for non-null and non-empty species names and fall colors, as these may have been excluding records.

3. **Counting Trees:**
   - The query counts the number of trees for each fall color from `t1995`, considering only those not marked as dead in 1995.
   - It also counts the number of corresponding trees that are alive in 2015 based on the species common name match.
   - The `COUNT(t2015."spc_common")` will count the number of trees in 2015 that match the species from 1995 and are alive.

4. **Grouping:**
   - The results are grouped by `ts."fall_color"` to provide the counts for each fall color.
  
**Note:**

- This query provides an approximate comparison based on species names and fall colors.
- Due to inconsistencies in species naming between the datasets, this method may not capture all exact matches but should return data.
- By simplifying the conditions and adjusting the join, we aim to retrieve meaningful results within the constraints of the available data.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Columns and Their Potential Usage:**

- From `TREE_CENSUS_1995`:
  - `"status"`: To determine if the tree was alive or dead in 1995.
  - `"spc_common"`: Species common name; to join with `TREE_SPECIES` for fall color.
  - `"spc_latin"`: Species scientific name; to join with `TREE_SPECIES`.
  - `"latitude"` and `"longitude"`: To identify the tree's location for matching between years.
  - `"address"`, `"house_number"`, `"street"`: Additional location details for matching trees.

- From `TREE_CENSUS_2015`:
  - `"status"`: To ensure the tree was alive in 2015.
  - `"spc_common"`: Species common name; to join with `TREE_SPECIES`.
  - `"spc_latin"`: Species scientific name; to join with `TREE_SPECIES`.
  - `"latitude"` and `"longitude"`: To identify the tree's location for matching between years.
  - `"address"`, `"house_number"`, `"street"`: Additional location details for matching trees.

- From `TREE_SPECIES`:
  - `"species_common_name"`: To join with `"spc_common"` from census tables.
  - `"species_scientific_name"`: To join with `"spc_latin"` from census tables.
  - `"fall_color"`: To determine the fall color of each species.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- Exclude trees marked as dead in 1995 (e.g., `"status"` != 'Dead').
- Include only trees that are alive in 2015 (e.g., `"status"` = 'Alive').
- Match trees between 1995 and 2015 based on location coordinates or addresses.
- Join census data with species data on species names to get fall color information.

Task: How has the number of trees of each fall color in New York City changed from 1995 to 2015, considering only trees that were still alive in 2015 and excluding those marked as dead in 1995?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
fall_color,count_1995,count_2015
color1:str,count1:int,count1:int
color2:str,count2:int,count2:int
...
```

This table displays the number of trees of each fall color in New York City for the years 1995 and 2015. It includes only the trees that were alive in 2015 and excludes those that were marked as dead in 1995..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'NEW_YORK': {'NEW_YORK': ['CITIBIKE_STATIONS', 'CITIBIKE_TRIPS', 'NYPD_MV_COLLISIONS', 'TLC_FHV_TRIPS_2015', 'TLC_FHV_TRIPS_2016', 'TLC_GREEN_TRIPS_2013', 'TLC_GREEN_TRIPS_2014', 'TLC_GREEN_TRIPS_2015', 'TLC_GREEN_TRIPS_2016', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2009', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2010', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2011', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2012', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2013', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2014', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2015', 'TLC_YELLOW_TRIPS_2016', 'TREE_CENSUS_1995', 'TREE_CENSUS_2005', 'TREE_CENSUS_2015', 'TREE_SPECIES', '_311_SERVICE_REQUESTS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

2025-01-27 04:54:14 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing How has the number of trees of each fall color in New York City changed from 1995 to 2015, considering only trees that were still alive in 2015 and excluding those marked as dead in 1995?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
fall_color,count_1995,count_2015
color1:str,count1:int,count1:int
color2:str,count2:int,count2:int
...
```

This table displays the number of trees of each fall color in New York City for the years 1995 and 2015. It includes only the trees that were alive in 2015 and excludes those that were marked as dead in 1995. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
