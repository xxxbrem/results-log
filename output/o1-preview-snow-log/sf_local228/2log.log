Begin Exploring Related Columns
To address the task, we'll consider the following tables and columns:

1. **MATCH**
   - `"match_id"`: Used to link with other tables.
   - `"season_id"`: To group data by season.

2. **BATSMAN_SCORED**
   - `"match_id"`: To link with matches.
   - `"over_id"`, `"ball_id"`, `"innings_no"`: To uniquely identify each delivery.
   - `"runs_scored"`: The number of runs scored on each ball.

3. **BALL_BY_BALL**
   - `"match_id"`: To link with matches.
   - `"over_id"`, `"ball_id"`, `"innings_no"`: To link with BATSMAN_SCORED and WICKET_TAKEN.
   - `"striker"`: `player_id` of the batsman facing the ball.
   - `"bowler"`: `player_id` of the bowler delivering the ball.

4. **WICKET_TAKEN**
   - `"match_id"`: To link with matches.
   - `"over_id"`, `"ball_id"`, `"innings_no"`: To link with BALL_BY_BALL.
   - `"player_out"`: `player_id` of the batsman who got out.
   - `"kind_out"`: The dismissal type (e.g., 'caught', 'bowled', etc.).

5. **PLAYER**
   - `"player_id"`: To get player names.
   - `"player_name"`: The name of the player.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Exclude dismissal types `'run out'`, `'hit wicket'`, and `'retired hurt'` when counting wickets.
- Prioritize players with lower `"player_id"` in case of ties.
- Group data by `"season_id"` to get season-wise statistics.

---

Here are 10 SQL queries to explore and understand the data:

1. **List all seasons available:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "season_id"
   FROM IPL.IPL.MATCH
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get all matches with their dates and seasons:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "match_id", "season_id", "match_date"
   FROM IPL.IPL.MATCH
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Retrieve all players with their names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "player_id", "player_name"
   FROM IPL.IPL.PLAYER
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4. **Find all dismissal types:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "kind_out"

Task: Identify the top three batsmen with the most runs and the top three bowlers with the most wickets in each season, displaying them in the same row for each season. In case of ties, prioritize players with lower player_ids. Exclude 'run out', 'hit wicket', and 'retired hurt' as out_types for bowlers.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: Here's the result in CSV format:

```csv
Season,Batsman1_Name,Batsman1_Runs,Batsman2_Name,Batsman2_Runs,Batsman3_Name,Batsman3_Runs,Bowler1_Name,Bowler1_Wickets,Bowler2_Name,Bowler2_Wickets,Bowler3_Name,Bowler3_Wickets
season1:str,batsman1:str,runs1:int,batsman2:str,runs2:int,batsman3:str,runs3:int,bowler1:str,wickets1:int,bowler2:str,wickets2:int,bowler3:str,wickets3:int

...
```

**Explanation:**

For each season, the table displays the top three batsmen with the most runs and the top three bowlers with the most wickets, all in the same row. The players are ranked based on their total runs or wickets in that season. In case of ties, players with lower `player_id` values are given priority. The out_types 'run out', 'hit wicket', and 'retired hurt' are excluded when counting wickets for bowlers..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'IPL': {'IPL': ['BALL_BY_BALL', 'BATSMAN_SCORED', 'EXTRA_RUNS', 'MATCH', 'PLAYER', 'PLAYER_MATCH', 'TEAM', 'WICKET_TAKEN']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.
