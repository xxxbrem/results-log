After comparing the two SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **`1result.sql`** is the correct choice. This query includes the `TRIM` function applied to the `"reactions"` and `"outcomes"` fields, which further cleanses the data by removing any leading or trailing whitespace. This ensures that the data is as clean and accurate as possible, aligning with the cleansing documentation requirements.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

1result.sql
