After comparing the two SQL queries, **`1result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`**, the correct SQL query is **`2result.sql`**. Here's why:

### Reasons:

1. **Calculation of Poverty Rate**:

   - **`1result.sql`**: 
     - It directly uses the `"poverty"` column from the census data as the poverty rate. This is incorrect because the `"poverty"` column represents the number of individuals in poverty, not the poverty rate percentage.
     - It does **not** divide the number of people in poverty by the total population to get the poverty rate.

   - **`2result.sql`**: 
     - It correctly calculates the poverty rate by dividing the number of individuals in poverty by the total population for whom poverty status is determined, then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage:
       ```sql
       ("poverty" / NULLIF("pop_determined_poverty_status", 0)) * 100 AS poverty_rate
       ```
     - This aligns with the standard method for calculating poverty rates.

2. **Matching County FIPS Codes**:

   - Both queries attempt to match county FIPS codes between natality and census data.
   - **`2result.sql`** ensures proper matching by using `RIGHT("geo_id", 5)` to extract the county FIPS code from the census data's `"geo_id"`, and it pads the FIPS codes in natality data to match:
     ```sql
     LPAD(CAST("County_of_Residence_FIPS" AS VARCHAR), 5, '0') AS county_fips
     ```

3. **Calculation of Percentage of Births Without Maternal Morbidity**:

   - Both queries calculate the percentage of births without maternal morbidity.
   - **`2result.sql`** explicitly calculates this percentage in the `combined` CTE:
     ```sql
     (n.births_no_morbidity / NULLIF(n.total_births, 0)) * 100 AS percent_no_morbidity
     ```
   - It ensures that there's no division by zero by using `NULLIF`.

4. **Results Consistency**:

   - The Pearson correlation coefficients from **`2result.sql`** are around **-0.1**, which is a reasonable value indicating a slight negative correlation.
   - The coefficients from **`1result.sql`** are around **-0.03**, which might be due to the incorrect poverty rate calculation.

5. **Adherence to Data Analysis Requirements**:

   - The task specifies using the poverty rates from the previous year's census data and accurately calculating the percentages and correlation.
   - **`2result.sql`** follows these instructions correctly.

### Conclusion:

**`2result.sql`** is the correct SQL query as it accurately calculates the poverty rates, correctly matches the FIPS codes between datasets, and properly computes the percentage of births without maternal morbidity. It follows the data analysis requirements specified in the task.
