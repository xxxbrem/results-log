These queries progressively build an understanding of the data by:

- Identifying customers from Italy.
- Filtering sales data for December 2021.
- Joining relevant tables to associate sales with customers and products.
- Calculating profit at the transaction level.
- Aggregating profit at the customer level.

This approach lays the groundwork for segmenting Italian customers into profitability buckets and performing the required calculations for each bucket.Query:

Task: Can you segment Italian customers into ten profitability buckets for December 2021, using equal profit intervals, and calculate the following for each bucket in December 2021: the number of customers, maximum profit, and minimum profit?

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To segment Italian customers into ten profitability buckets for December 2021 using equal profit intervals, and calculate the number of customers, maximum profit, and minimum profit for each bucket, the results are as follows:

```csv
Profit_bucket,Number_of_customers,Max_profit,Min_profit
1,num_customers1:int,max_profit1:float,min_profit1:float
2,num_customers2:int,max_profit2:float,min_profit2:float

```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'COMPLEX_ORACLE': {'COMPLEX_ORACLE': ['CHANNELS', 'COSTS', 'COUNTRIES', 'CURRENCY', 'CUSTOMERS', 'PRODUCTS', 'PROMOTIONS', 'SALES', 'SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS', 'TIMES']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

       MIN("total_profit") AS "Min_profit"
FROM customer_buckets
GROUP BY "profit_bucket"
ORDER BY "profit_bucket";
```

This query performs the following steps:

1. **Calculate Total Profit per Customer**:
   - The `total_profit_per_customer` CTE computes the total profit for each Italian customer in December 2021 by subtracting the total cost from the total amount sold.
   - Profit calculation: `s."amount_sold" - (s."quantity_sold" * cst."unit_cost")`

2. **Determine Minimum and Maximum Profit**:
   - The `min_max_profit` CTE retrieves the minimum and maximum total profit among all Italian customers.

3. **Calculate Profit Intervals**:
   - The `profit_intervals` CTE calculates the profit interval size by dividing the profit range by 10.
   - Profit interval size: `("max_profit" - "min_profit") / 10.0`

4. **Assign Customers to Profit Buckets**:
   - The `customer_buckets` CTE assigns each customer to a profit bucket based on their total profit.
   - Bucket assignment logic:
     - If the profit interval is zero (all profits are equal), assign to bucket 1.
     - If the customer's profit equals the maximum profit, assign to bucket 10.
     - Otherwise, calculate the bucket using the formula: `FLOOR((total_profit - min_profit) / profit_interval) + 1`

5. **Aggregate Results by Profit Bucket**:
   - The final `SELECT` statement groups the customers by their profit bucket and calculates the number of customers, maximum profit, and minimum profit in each bucket.

Replace `"COMPLEX_ORACLE"` with your actual database and schema names if they differ.

**Note**: Ensure that all column and table names are enclosed in double quotes as required, and adjust the database and schema names to match your actual names. This query follows the Snowflake SQL dialect and should meet your requirements for segmenting the customers and calculating the desired metrics.

2025-01-26 22:07:52 - root - INFO - To segment Italian customers into ten profitability buckets for December 2021 using equal profit intervals, and calculate the number of customers, maximum profit, and minimum profit for each bucket, you can use the following SQL query.

**Explanation**:

- **Calculate Total Profit per Customer**:
  - The `total_profit_per_customer` CTE calculates the total profit for each Italian customer in December 2021.
  - Profit is calculated as the difference between the amount sold and the total cost: `s."amount_sold" - (s."quantity_sold" * cst."unit_cost")`.
  - The `ROUND` function ensures that the `total_profit` is rounded to four decimal places.

- **Determine Minimum and Maximum Profit**:
  - The `min_max_profit` CTE retrieves the minimum and maximum total profit among all Italian customers.

- **Calculate Profit Intervals**:
  - The `profit_intervals` CTE calculates the profit interval by dividing the profit range by 10.
  - This divides the total profit range into ten equal buckets.

- **Assign Customers to Profit Buckets**:
  - The `customer_buckets` CTE assigns each customer to a profit bucket from 1 to 10.
  - The `CASE` statement handles edge cases:
    - If the profit interval is zero (all profits are equal), all customers are assigned to bucket 1.
    - If a customer's profit equals the maximum profit, they are assigned to bucket 10.
    - Otherwise, the bucket is calculated based on the profit interval.
  - The `FLOOR` function ensures that customers are evenly distributed into buckets based on their profit.

- **Aggregate Results**:
  - The final `SELECT` statement groups customers by `profit_bucket`.
  - It calculates the number of customers, maximum profit, and minimum profit for each bucket.
  - The `CAST` function converts `profit_bucket` to an integer for proper formatting.

**Note**:

- Replace `"COMPLEX_ORACLE"` with your actual database and schema names if they differ.
- Ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations as required.
- This query follows the Snowflake SQL dialect and adheres to your formatting requirements.

**Sample Result Format**:

After running the query, the results will be formatted as follows (values are illustrative):

```csv
Profit_bucket,Number_of_customers,Max_profit,Min_profit
1,10,100.0000,10.0000
2,15,200.0000,100.0001
3,12,300.0000,200.0001
4,8,400.0000,300.0001
5,7,500.0000,400.0001
6,6,600.0000,500.0001
7,5,700.0000,600.0001
8,4,800.0000,700.0001
9,3,900.0000,800.0001
10,2,1000.0000,900.0001
```

This matches your requested format with ten buckets, the number of customers, and profits rounded to four decimal places.
