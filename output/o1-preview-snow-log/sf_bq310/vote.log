After comparing the SQL queries and their results, I conclude that **`1result.sql`** is the correct SQL query for the task.

**Reasoning:**

- **Task**: Find the title of the most viewed "how" question related to Android development on StackOverflow, specifically across tags like `'android-layout'`, `'android-activity'`, `'android-intent'`, and others.

- **`1result.sql`** specifically filters the questions based on the exact tags provided:
  - It uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` and `SPLIT` to break the `"tags"` column (which contains tags separated by `|`) into individual tags.
  - It then checks if any of these tags match the specified tags (`'android'`, `'android-layout'`, `'android-activity'`, `'android-intent'`).

- **Comparing with the other queries**:
  - **`0result.sql`** and **`2result.sql`** use `"tags" ILIKE '%android%'` or `"tags" LIKE '%android%'`, which will match any tag that contains the substring `'android'`.
    - This might include unintended tags and does not strictly filter for the specified tags.
    - It may also miss questions that have the specified tags but don't include `'android'` as a substring in other tags.

- **Result Consistency**: All queries return the same question title, but **`1result.sql`** ensures that only questions with the exact specified tags are considered, making it the most accurate according to the task requirements.

**Output:**

```plain
1result.sql
```
