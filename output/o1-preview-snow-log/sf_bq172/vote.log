After comparing both SQL queries and their results, I have determined that `1result.sql` is the correct answer.

**Reason:**

- Both queries aim to identify the drug with the highest total number of prescriptions in New York State during 2014 and then list the top five states with the highest total claim counts for this drug, including their total claim counts and total drug costs.
- Both queries correctly:
  - Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) `top_drug` to find the top drug in New York State by summing the total claim counts and ordering in descending order.
  - Join the main table with the `top_drug` CTE on the `drug_name` to gather data for that specific drug across all states.
  - Group the results by state and calculate the total claim counts and total drug costs.
  - Order the results to list the top five states with the highest total claim counts.

- However, `1result.sql`:
  - Uses clearer and more consistent aliasing. For example, it names the subquery in the CTE as `temp_drug`, which may make it clearer in contexts with multiple subqueries.
  - Orders the final results by `"Total Claim Count" DESC NULLS LAST, "State" ASC`, which ensures that if two states have the same total claim counts, they will be ordered alphabetically by state name. This adds an extra layer of clarity and consistency to the output.

**Therefore, the correct SQL is:**

```plain
1result.sql
