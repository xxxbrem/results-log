After comparing both SQL queries, **Candidate 1** (`1result.sql`) provides a more accurate calculation.

**Reasoning:**

- **Candidate 1 (`1result.sql`):**
  - **Approach:** Calculates the percentage of questions answered within an hour by considering only the **earliest answer** for each question.
  - **Method:**
    - Uses a subquery to find the **minimum (`MIN`) creation date** of answers (`"min_creation_date"`) for each question.
    - Checks if the earliest answer was provided within an hour of the question's creation.
    - This method ensures that each question is counted only once, regardless of how many answers it received within an hour.
- **Candidate 0 (`0result.sql`):**
  - **Approach:** Counts all answers provided within an hour for each question, which may count the same question multiple times if it received multiple answers within an hour.
  - **Potential Issue:** This can inflate the numerator since questions with multiple quick answers are overrepresented.
  - **Impact:** The percentage calculated may be slightly higher due to counting duplicates.

By focusing on whether each question received **at least one answer within an hour**, Candidate 1's query aligns precisely with the task's requirement and provides an accurate percentage.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

```plaintext
1result.sql
