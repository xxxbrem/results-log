After comparing the three SQL queries and their results, **Option 2 (2result.sql)** is the correct choice. Here's the reasoning:

**Option 0 (0result.sql):**

- **Approach:** Extracts product IDs from URIs like `/product/ID`, joins with `PRODUCTS` to get categories, filters to the top category (`Intimates`), computes session durations.
- **Result:** Average time is **0.0011 minutes** (~0.066 seconds).
- **Issue:** The average session duration is implausibly low, indicating that the method might not be capturing all relevant sessions or events accurately.

**Option 1 (1result.sql):**

- **Approach:** Attempts to find sessions where users visited the category page for the top category (`Intimates`) by manipulating URIs.
- **Result:** Average time is **645.5144 minutes** (~10.75 hours).
- **Issue:** The average session duration is unrealistically high, suggesting that sessions may include long periods of inactivity or that the calculation is skewed by outliers.

**Option 2 (2result.sql):**

- **Approach:** Selects events where the URI contains `'Intimates'`, calculates session durations per session, computes the average.
- **Result:** Average time is **1.6737 minutes** (~1 minute and 40 seconds).
- **Validity:**
  - This method accurately identifies sessions where users interacted with the top category by checking if `'Intimates'` is present in the URI.
  - It calculates session durations correctly by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum `created_at` timestamps per session.
  - The average session duration is plausible and aligns with typical user behavior on e-commerce sites.

**Conclusion:**

- **Option 2** provides a reasonable and accurate calculation of the average time users spend per visit on the product category with the highest total quantity purchased.
- It effectively filters relevant sessions and performs the necessary computations without overcomplicating the process or introducing significant errors.

Therefore, the correct SQL is:

2result.sql
