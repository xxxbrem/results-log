Relevant tables and columns:

- **RACES**
  - `"race_id"`: Link to the RESULTS table.
  - `"year"`: Needed to group results by year.
- **RESULTS**
  - `"race_id"`: Link to the RACES table.
  - `"driver_id"`: Link to the DRIVERS table.
  - `"constructor_id"`: Link to the CONSTRUCTORS table.
  - `"points"`: Points scored by the driver in a race.
- **DRIVERS**
  - `"driver_id"`: Link to the RESULTS table.
  - `"full_name"`: Full name of the driver.
- **CONSTRUCTORS**
  - `"constructor_id"`: Link to the RESULTS table.
  - `"name"`: Name of the constructor.

Conditions that may be used:

- Joining tables on matching IDs to combine relevant information.
- Grouping results by year to aggregate points per year.
- Using `SUM` to calculate total points for drivers and constructors.
- Sorting to identify the driver and constructor with the most points each year.

Here are some SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

1. **List distinct years from the RACES table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "year"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
   ORDER BY "year" ASC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **View sample data from the RESULTS table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Retrieve driver IDs and their points from the RESULTS table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Get full names of drivers from the DRIVERS table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "driver_id", "full_name"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVERS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Fetch constructor IDs and names from the CONSTRUCTORS table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "constructor_id", "name"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTORS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **List race IDs and corresponding years from the RACES table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "year"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RACES"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **Find points scored by each driver in each race:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "race_id", "driver_id", "points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Join RESULTS and RACES to see driver points along with the year:**
   ```sql
   SELECT R."year", RE."driver_id", RE."points"
   FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" RE
   JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" R ON RE."race_id" = R."race_id"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Inspect data from the DRIVER_STANDINGS table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "F1"."F1"."DRIVER_STANDINGS"
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **View data from the CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS table:**
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM "F1"."F1"."CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS"
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

11. **Check the total points per driver across all races:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "driver_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
    GROUP BY "driver_id"
    ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

12. **Get the total points per constructor across all races:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "constructor_id", SUM("points") AS "total_points"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
    GROUP BY "constructor_id"
    ORDER BY "total_points" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

13. **List drivers and their cumulative points per year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT R."year", RE."driver_id", SUM(RE."points") AS "yearly_points"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" RE
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" R ON RE."race_id" = R."race_id"
    GROUP BY R."year", RE."driver_id"
    ORDER BY R."year", "yearly_points" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

14. **List constructors and their cumulative points per year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT R."year", RE."constructor_id", SUM(RE."points") AS "yearly_points"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS" RE
    JOIN "F1"."F1"."RACES" R ON RE."race_id" = R."race_id"
    GROUP BY R."year", RE."constructor_id"
    ORDER BY R."year", "yearly_points" DESC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

15. **Find the positions of drivers in each race from the RESULTS table:**
    ```sql
    SELECT "race_id", "driver_id", "position", "points"
    FROM "F1"."F1"."RESULTS"
    ORDER BY "race_id", "position" ASC
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries help in understanding the structure and data within the relevant tables, which is essential for solving the task of identifying the top-scoring driver and constructor each year.Query:

Task: For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: To determine the driver and constructor who scored the most points each year, we aggregate the total points for each driver and constructor per year and select the ones with the highest totals. Below is the formatted result:

```csv
Year,Driver_Full_Name,Constructor_Name
year1:int,driver_name1:str,constructor_name1:str
year2:int,driver_name2:str,constructor_name2:str
...
```.
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CIRCUITS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTOR_RESULTS', 'CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'DRIVERS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LIVERIES', 'PIT_STOPS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES', 'RACES_EXT', 'RESULTS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'SEASONS', 'SHORT_CONSTRUCTOR_NAMES', 'SHORT_GRAND_PRIX_NAMES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'STATUS', 'TDR_OVERRIDES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
