4216891,"This invention relates to a surgical stapler for stitching body organs. A surgical stapler of this general type is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,494,533. It is necessary to maintain the front and rear jaw legs in alignment so that the staple cartridge and anvil are properly aligned for stapling operation. In the device described in the U.S. Pat. No. 3,494,533, a pin extends through the rear leg and into the front leg of the jaw to maintain this alignment. When it is desired to staple tissue which has one end extending beyond the end of the gap between the staple cartridge and the anvil, the tissue will be punctured by the jaw-aligning pin when the pin is inserted. This punctured tissue requires additional surgical procedures, and could result in medical complications. This surgical stapler enables stapling of tissue without perforating the tissue which may extend beyond the end of the gap between the staple cartridge and the anvil by the means used to maintain alignment of the jaw legs and alignment of the staple cartridge assembly and the anvil. The surgical stapler has a jaw which includes spaced apart front and rear legs rigidly interconnected by a cross leg at one end, the front and rear legs having opposite free ends. An anvil is on the front leg, while a movable frame is located between the front and rear legs. A staple cartridge assembly including staples is carried by the movable frame. The position of the movable frame determines a gap between the staple cartridge assembly and the anvil for receiving tissue. A pusher member is included for ejecting staples from the staple cartridge assembly to staple tissue located in the gap between the cartridge assembly and the anvil. A C-clamp is detachably connected to the free ends of the front and rear legs of the jaw for maintaining alignment of the front and rear legs during stapling operation. In one aspect of the invention, the C-clamp includes a first end engaging the free end of the front leg, and a second end engaging the free end of the rear leg, while an integral web interconnects the first and second ends. A first jaw-aligning means fixes the first end of the C-clamp to the front leg, and a second jaw-aligning means fixes the second end of the C-clamp to the rear leg. In one aspect of the invention, the C-clamp is fixed to the jaw with the C-clamp and the jaw in the same plane. The web of the C-clamp is spaced from the free ends of the legs of the jaw for accommodating tissue extending outwardly of the gap between the staple cartridge assembly and the anvil. In one aspect of the invention, the first jaw-aligning means includes a first alignment pin. The first end of the C-clamp engages the outside of the front leg. The first alignment pin is attached to the first leg of the C-clamp with the alignment pin extending into a hole in the front leg for aligning the first end of the C-clamp with the front leg of the jaw. In one aspect of the invention, the second end of the C-clamp engages the outside of the rear leg. The second jaw-aligning means includes a sleeve on the second end of the C-clamp, the sleeve being received in a slot in the rear leg and being detachably connected to the rear leg of the jaw for aligning the second end of the C-clamp with the rear leg of the jaw. More particularly, the second end of the C-clamp is bifurcated having spaced arms between which the sleeve extends, one of the arms engaging the outside of the rear leg. In one aspect of the invention, a second alignment pin is detachably connected to the second end of the C-clamp, and extends through the movable frame and into the staple cartridge assembly for maintaining alignment of the staple cartridge assembly relative to the anvil. The second alignment pin includes an end that terminates within the staple cartridge assembly for preventing injury to the tissue in the gap between the staple cartridge assembly and the anvil. The second alignment pin is attached to and extends through the sleeve. More particularly, the first and second alignment pins are coaxial. The front and rear legs of the jaw are aligned without puncturing the tissue in the gap by either of the first and second alignment pins during stapling of the tissue."
4518172,"The invention relates to a flexible, energy-dissipating knee-restraining element for vehicles, and in particular, to a knee-restraining element which is installed beneath the instrument panel of a passenger automobile. Knee-restraining elements are known. German Offenlegungsschrift No. 23 35 958 describes such an element. The known arrangements are used to restrain movement of the lower body of a passenger in the event of an emergency, particularly in vehicles which provide a safety belt, such as a shoulder belt for restraining only the upper body. In these known arrangements, the knee-restraining element comprises a hollow beam which extends without interruption over the width of the vehicle, and is typically secur

2025-01-24 20:49:32 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering:

```
100035 (22007): 01b9eee1-0004-7d15-0001-11c300f9a9e2: Timestamp '1983-11-00' is not recognized
```

indicates that there are invalid date values in the `"date"` columns of your tables. Specifically, the date `'1983-11-00'` is not a valid date because the day `'00'` does not exist.

**Reason for the Error:**

The `DATEDIFF` function is attempting to calculate the difference between two dates, but it encounters an invalid date format, causing the query to fail. This often happens when date fields contain placeholders, incomplete dates, or incorrect formats in the dataset.

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, we need to:

1. **Filter out invalid dates:** Exclude records where the date fields contain invalid or unrecognized dates.
2. **Use TRY_TO_DATE function:** This function attempts to convert a string to a date and returns `NULL` if it fails, allowing us to safely filter out invalid dates.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT 
    c."patent_id", 
    c."citation_id", 
    a."date" AS "application_date", 
    c."date" AS "citation_date"
FROM PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.USPATENTCITATION c
JOIN PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.APPLICATION a 
    ON c."patent_id" = a."patent_id"
WHERE 
    TRY_TO_DATE(a."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL 
    AND TRY_TO_DATE(c."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL
    AND ABS(DATEDIFF(
        day, 
        TRY_TO_DATE(a."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 
        TRY_TO_DATE(c."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    )) <= 30
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **TRY_TO_DATE Function:**
  - `TRY_TO_DATE(a."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')`: Attempts to parse the application date into a valid date format. If unsuccessful, it returns `NULL`.
  - We check for `IS NOT NULL` to ensure only valid dates are used in the `DATEDIFF` function.

- **Filtering Invalid Dates:**
  - By adding the conditions `TRY_TO_DATE(...) IS NOT NULL`, we exclude any records where the date conversion fails due to invalid formats.

- **Calculating Date Difference:**
  - We use `DATEDIFF` with the parsed dates to compute the difference in days.
  - The `ABS` function ensures we get the absolute difference regardless of the date order.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Date Format Specification:**
  - If your dates are in a different format, adjust the `'YYYY-MM-DD'` in the `TRY_TO_DATE` function to match your date format.
  - For example, if dates are in `'MM/DD/YYYY'` format, use `TRY_TO_DATE(a."date", 'MM/DD/YYYY')`.

- **Data Quality:**
  - The presence of invalid dates suggests there may be data quality issues in your dataset.
  - Consider cleaning the data or handling such cases as per your requirements.

- **Ensuring Comprehensive Results:**
  - While filtering out invalid dates ensures the query runs without errors, be aware that you might lose some records.
  - If necessary, analyze the extent of data loss and assess the impact on your analysis.

**Testing the Corrected Query:**

Run the corrected query to verify that it executes successfully and returns the expected results.

**Next Steps:**

- **Verify Data Integrity:**
  - Check the source of the invalid dates to prevent similar issues in the future.
  - If possible, correct the invalid date entries in the database.

- **Extend the Analysis:**
  - Once you've confirmed the query works, you can integrate it into a larger query to fetch additional details as required for your task.

6862842,"REFERENCE TO MICROFICHE APPENDIX Not applicable. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not applicable. The present invention relates generally to green roof systems, also known as roof landscaping systems and roof gardens, that are suitable for supporting live plant growth on building roofs. More particularly, the invention relates to modular green roof systems, and methods and apparatus for use therewith. Briefly, prior green roof systems typically comprise several layers of materials suitable to support vegetation on a roof. These layers are typically supplied in bulk or earthen rolls that are rolled into position on the roof. Common types of vegetation used in green roof systems include herbs, grasses, mosses, wild plants and flowers, and other types of perennials. A typical prior green roof system includes at least (i) a waterproofing membrane laid over the roof or roof supporting structure, (ii) based on the roof grade, a layer over the waterproofing membrane of one of: (a) a drainage layer and an overlaying blanket of root growth protection material (for a grade of approximately 2 to 5 degrees), (b) a root growth protective fleece (for a grade of approximately 6 to 10 degrees), and (c) a substrate fixing or erosion control blanket including root growth protection (for a grade of approximately 10 to 20 degrees); (iii) a layer of mineral wool or other substrate for water retention, and (iv) a top layer of vegetation growing in a fiber fleece or other suitable growing medium. Other green roof designs include additional layers of various materials for various roof protection and vegetation growth support purposes. It is believed that prior green roof systems of the above general type were first used in Europe approximately 20 years ago. Since that time, use of similar and derivative green roof systems has become common in many parts of Europe on commercial, institutional, industrial, and residential buildings, and interest in green roof systems is growing in the United States. The advantages typically attributed to green roof systems include extending the roof service life; reducing heating and cooling energy costs; conserving and utilizing valuable commercial space; reducing runoff from roof surfaces; and increasing property values. However, inspection of such prior systems also reveal the following disadvantages: the prior systems are relatively expensive and are difficult to install, typically requiring the need for and assistance of a specially trained consultant; the systems are not designed to be installed over an existing functional roof without the necessity of reroofing; thus, a complete new waterproofing membrane must typically be installed before the green roof system can be used on existing buildings, resulting in additional costs; since the green roof materials are delivered in bulk or earthen rolls, design freedom is limited, alternating designs of plants are not easily incorporated in the design of the green roof; terracing or variations of surfaces are also not easily accomplished; and changing of the design layout after installation requires removal and destruction of the effected area and replanting with the new design; selection of pre-growing plants in the upper fiber fleece is typically limited to low-growing plants, mosses, etc., since the fleece is supplied to the roof in rolls; selection of pre-grown plants available is further typically limited because: the need to maintain the plants in the growing state prior to shipment results in additional costs; the demand must be estimated in advance of the installation season in order to have the pre-grown plants ready; and such estimates are typically conservative in order to prevent overstocking and spoilage if not used during that season; and maintenance and repair to the roof is difficult and expensive; if a leak develops in the roof membrane, or if other maintenance or repair is required, the entire green roof, or at least large portions of the green roof, must be removed to locate and repair the leak or accomplish the desired maintenance; the removed green roof must then be replaced and replanted. Thus, it is clear there is a need for new and improved green roof systems which: are less expensive and more easily installed than prior green roof systems; can be installed over existing roofing materials on existing buildings, thus eliminating the need and associated cost to install completely new roofing membranes or systems prior to installation of the green roof; provide for substantially enhanced design flexibility and freedom, including;     the ability to change the design layout of the green roof after initial installation, and the ability to be used either as a standalone system, or in combination with prior green roof systems       as an original green roof layout and design including both prior systems and systems in accordance with the present invention, and to enable re

10165737,"Warm cloud catalyst, preparation method therefor and application thereof",A01,A01G,"The present invention relates to the field of weather modification catalyst, and particularly to a warm cloud catalyst, and a preparation method and an application of the same. BACKGROUND Since humans began weather modification in the 1940s, warm cloud catalysts have always been a worldwide problem that is difficult to crack. In the theoretical research on warm cloud precipitation mechanisms, the theory of collision, coalescence and breaking has been explicitly proposed. However, in the research on warm cloud catalysts, the idea that has been used for a long time is that hygroscopic substances can absorb moisture to grow at a pressure lower than the saturation vapor pressure, as for the hydrophilicity of the cloud condensation nuclei, there is no distinction, which hides the cognition to the wetting nuclei, no detailed research on surface tension difference is made with regard to the phenomena of large cloud droplets coalescing with small cloud droplets, and little is known about the source regions and features of the atmospheric aerosol particles capable of forming large water droplet-started collision mechanism. In the related art, hygroscopic substances such as sodium chloride, calcium chloride, urea or ammonium nitrate, etc. are generally used as warm cloud catalysts; and these common hygroscopic substances all have certain corrosivity (which will corrode spraying devices), and are easy to agglomerate, and when such type of hygroscopic substances are used as warm cloud catalysts, since the falling speed of the catalyst particles is too fast, and the factor of surface tension of the aqueous solution thereof is not taken into account, the effect of artificial precipitation is extremely unsatisfactory, and at present, there is no repeatable successful case. Thus, it is difficult to practically use such kind of warm cloud catalysts in production and life. Therefore, it is a technical problem to be solved urgently by people to provide a warm cloud catalyst which directly uses the theory of collision, coalescence and breaking as the guidance, is non-corrosive, is not easy to agglomerate, can continuously grow cloud droplets into raindrops and can be practically used. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a completely new research approach of warm cloud catalyst and a completely new product of warm cloud catalyst, so as to solve the aforesaid technical problem. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing the aforesaid warm cloud catalyst. In one aspect, the present invention provides a warm cloud catalyst comprising the following components in parts by weight: 80-120 parts of a plant ash/plant powder/plant carbon powder, 15-32 parts of a surfactant solution or 0.5-5 parts of a surfactant dry powder, and 2-10 parts of a thickening agent. Optionally, in the surfactant solution, the mass concentration of the solute is 0.5%-35%. Optionally, the plant ash/plant powder/plant carbon powder used comprises dry powders of plant materials or powders resulting from burning or carbonizing thereof, and further comprises non-plant materials having a density smaller than that of water, wherein the plant materials further comprise a starch, a cellulose, a lignin and/or a colloid which constitute a plant body. Optionally, the plant ash/plant powder/plant carbon powder has a particle size in the range of 0.5-150 μm. Optionally, the surfactant comprises surface active substances capable of reducing the surface tension of water by 20%-85%. Preferably, the surfactant comprises a silicon-containing or fluorine-containing surfactant or a degradable surfactant. Preferably, in the surfactant solution, the solute comprises one or more of polyether modified organosiloxane, polyether modified polydimethylsiloxane and perfluoroalkyl ester solution; and the solvent is water or ethanol. Optionally, the surfactant dry powder comprises water-soluble surfactant powders. Preferably, the surfactant dry powder comprises sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and Akzo Morwet EFW. Optionally, the thickening agent comprises aqueous phase thickening agents. Preferably, the thickening agent comprises xanthan gum, konjac gum, guar gum or pectin. In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for preparing the aforesaid warm cloud catalyst, wherein when the surfactant is in a form a solution, the method includes the steps of: 1) preparing a surfactant solution, wherein in the surfactant solution, the mass concentration of a solute is 0.5%-35%; 2) evenly mixing 15-32 parts by weight of the prepared surfactant solution with 80-120 parts by weight of plant ash/plant powder/plant carbon powder to obtain a mixture; and 3) drying the mixture, then adding 2-10 parts of the thickening agent, evenly mixing, and sieving to obtain a warm cloud catalyst.

2025-01-24 20:53:00 - root - INFO - The error message you're encountering:

```
002031 (42601): None: SQL compilation error:
Unsupported subquery type cannot be evaluated
```

**Reason for the Error:**

The error occurs because the SQL engine does not support correlated subqueries in the `IN` clause that reference columns from the outer query, specifically `a."date"` in your subqueries. In Snowflake SQL, subqueries used in `IN` or `EXISTS` clauses cannot contain references to columns from the outer query if they can't be flattened into a join.

In your query, the subqueries in the `IN` clause are correlated with the outer query through `a."date"`, which is not allowed and leads to the error.

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, we need to rewrite the query to avoid using correlated subqueries in the `IN` clause. Instead, we can use `JOIN`s or restructure the query to eliminate the correlation.

**Corrected SQL Query:**

Here's how you can rewrite your query using `JOIN`s:

```sql
WITH citations_within_30_days AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT c."patent_id" AS "patent_id"
    FROM PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.USPATENTCITATION c
    JOIN PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.APPLICATION a1 ON c."patent_id" = a1."patent_id"
    WHERE 
        TRY_TO_DATE(a1."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL 
        AND TRY_TO_DATE(c."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL
        AND ABS(DATEDIFF(
            day, 
            TRY_TO_DATE(a1."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 
            TRY_TO_DATE(c."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')
        )) <= 30
    UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT c."citation_id" AS "patent_id"
    FROM PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.USPATENTCITATION c
    JOIN PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.APPLICATION a2 ON c."citation_id" = a2."patent_id"
    WHERE 
        TRY_TO_DATE(a2."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL 
        AND TRY_TO_DATE(c."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL
        AND ABS(DATEDIFF(
            day, 
            TRY_TO_DATE(a2."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 
            TRY_TO_DATE(c."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')
        )) <= 30
)
SELECT DISTINCT p."id", a."date" AS "application_date"
FROM PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.PATENT p
JOIN PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.APPLICATION a ON p."id" = a."patent_id"
JOIN citations_within_30_days c30 ON p."id" = c30."patent_id"
WHERE TRY_TO_DATE(a."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Creating a CTE (Common Table Expression):**

   - We use a CTE named `citations_within_30_days` to collect all patent IDs that have either forward or backward citations within 30 days of their application dates.
   - The first SELECT in the UNION finds patents where their citations (`c."date"`) are within 30 days of their application dates (`a1."date"`).
   - The second SELECT in the UNION finds patents that are cited by other patents within 30 days of their own application dates.

2. **Avoiding Correlated Subqueries:**

   - By moving the correlated subqueries into the CTE, we eliminate the correlation to the outer query, which resolves the compilation error.

3. **Joining with the CTE:**

   - In the main query, we join the `PATENT` and `APPLICATION` tables, then join with the `citations_within_30_days` CTE to filter patents that meet the citation criteria.

4. **Filtering Invalid Dates:**

   - We continue to filter out invalid dates using `TRY_TO_DATE` in both the CTE and the main query.

**Alternative Solution Using EXISTS:**

If you prefer to use `EXISTS` instead of `IN`, you can rewrite the query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p."id", a."date" AS "application_date"
FROM PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.PATENT p
JOIN PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.APPLICATION a ON p."id" = a."patent_id"
WHERE 
    TRY_TO_DATE(a."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL
    AND (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.USPATENTCITATION c
            WHERE c."patent_id" = p."id"
                AND TRY_TO_DATE(c."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL
                AND ABS(DATEDIFF(
                    day,
                    TRY_TO_DATE(a."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD'),
                    TRY_TO_DATE(c."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')
                )) <= 30
        )
        OR
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.USPATENTCITATION c
            WHERE c."citation_id" = p."id"
                AND TRY_TO_DATE(c."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NOT NULL
                AND ABS(DATEDIFF(
                    day,
                    TRY_TO_DATE(a."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD'),
                    TRY_TO_DATE(c."date", 'YYYY-MM-DD')
                )) <= 30
        )
    )
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Using EXISTS:**

  - The `EXISTS` clause allows for correlated subqueries that reference columns from the outer query (`p."id"` and `a."date"`).
  - Each `EXISTS` clause checks whether there is at least one citation meeting the date criteria for either forward or backward citations.

- **Note on Performance:**

  - While this query avoids the compilation error, it may be less efficient on large datasets due to the correlated subqueries being evaluated for each row in the outer query.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Ensure Correct Date Comparisons:**

  - It's important to consistently use `TRY_TO_DATE` when comparing dates to handle any invalid date formats.
  - Ensure that the date columns (`a."date"` and `c."date"`) are in the same format.

- **Validation:**

  - After updating the query, test it to confirm that it runs successfully and returns the expected results.

**Summary:**

The error arises from using unsupported correlated subqueries in the `IN` clause that reference the outer query's columns. By restructuring the query to eliminate these correlations—either by using a CTE with joins or by using `EXISTS`—we can resolve the error and obtain the desired results.

   - `"id"`: Patent ID; used to identify patents and join with other tables.
   - `"title"`: Title of the patent.
   - `"country"`: Country of the patent; condition `"country" = 'US'`.

2. **PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.APPLICATION**
   - `"patent_id"`: Patent ID; used to join with the PATENT table.
   - `"date"`: Application date of the patent.

3. **PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.CPC_CURRENT**
   - `"patent_id"`: Patent ID; used to join with the PATENT table.
   - `"section_id"`: CPC section code.
   - `"subsection_id"`: CPC subsection code; condition `"subsection_id" = 'C05'`.
   - `"group_id"`: CPC group code; condition `"group_id" = 'A01G'`.

   - `"patent_id"`: ID of the citing patent.
   - `"citation_id"`: ID of the cited patent.
   - `"date"`: Date of the citation (may represent the date of the cited patent).
   - Used to count **backward citations** (`"patent_id"` is our patent) and **forward citations** (`"citation_id"` is our patent).

5. **PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.BRF_SUM_TEXT**
   - `"patent_id"`: Patent ID; used to join with the PATENT table.
   - `"text"`: Summary text of the patent.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- Patents from the USA: `"PATENT"."country" = 'US'`.
- CPC classification in subsection 'C05' or group 'A01G':
  - `"CPC_CURRENT"."subsection_id" = 'C05'` or `"CPC_CURRENT"."group_id" = 'A01G'`.
- At least one forward or backward citation within one month of the application date:
  - Need to calculate the difference between citation dates and application dates (within ±30 days).

   SELECT "id", "title", "country"
   FROM PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.PATENT
   WHERE "country" = 'US'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

2. **Get CPC classifications where `subsection_id` is 'C05':**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT "patent_id", "section_id", "subsection_id", "group_id"
   FROM PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.CPC_CURRENT
   WHERE "subsection_id" = 'C05'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

   SELECT "patent_id", "text" AS "summary_text"
   FROM PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.BRF_SUM_TEXT
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

6. **Count backward citations for each patent (citations made by the patent):**

   ```sql
   SELECT "patent_id", COUNT(*) AS "backward_citation_count"
   FROM PATENTSVIEW.PATENTSVIEW.USPATENTCITATION
   GROUP BY "patent_id"
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

4216891,"This invention relates to a surgical stapler for stitching body organs. A surgical stapler of this general type is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,494,533. It is necessary to maintain the front and rear jaw legs in alignment so that the staple cartridge and anvil are properly aligned for stapling operation. In the device described in the U.S. Pat. No. 3,494,533, a pin extends through the rear leg and into the front leg of the jaw to maintain this alignment. When it is desired to staple tissue which has one end extending beyond the end of the gap between the staple cartridge and the anvil, the tissue will be punctured by the jaw-aligning pin when the pin is inserted. This punctured tissue requires additional surgical procedures, and could result in medical complications. This surgical stapler enables stapling of tissue without perforating the tissue which may extend beyond the end of the gap between the staple cartridge and the anvil by the means used to maintain alignment of the jaw legs and alignment of the staple cartridge assembly and the anvil. The surgical stapler has a jaw which includes spaced apart front and rear legs rigidly interconnected by a cross leg at one end, the front and rear legs having opposite free ends. An anvil is on the front leg, while a movable frame is located between the front and rear legs. A staple cartridge assembly including staples is carried by the movable frame. The position of the movable frame determines a gap between the staple cartridge assembly and the anvil for receiving tissue. A pusher member is included for ejecting staples from the staple cartridge assembly to staple tissue located in the gap between the cartridge assembly and the anvil. A C-clamp is detachably connected to the free ends of the front and rear legs of the jaw for maintaining alignment of the front and rear legs during stapling operation. In one aspect of the invention, the C-clamp includes a first end engaging the free end of the front leg, and a second end engaging the free end of the rear leg, while an integral web interconnects the first and second ends. A first jaw-aligning means fixes the first end of the C-clamp to the front leg, and a second jaw-aligning means fixes the second end of the C-clamp to the rear leg. In one aspect of the invention, the C-clamp is fixed to the jaw with the C-clamp and the jaw in the same plane. The web of the C-clamp is spaced from the free ends of the legs of the jaw for accommodating tissue extending outwardly of the gap between the staple cartridge assembly and the anvil. In one aspect of the invention, the first jaw-aligning means includes a first alignment pin. The first end of the C-clamp engages the outside of the front leg. The first alignment pin is attached to the first leg of the C-clamp with the alignment pin extending into a hole in the front leg for aligning the first end of the C-clamp with the front leg of the jaw. In one aspect of the invention, the second end of the C-clamp engages the outside of the rear leg. The second jaw-aligning means includes a sleeve on the second end of the C-clamp, the sleeve being received in a slot in the rear leg and being detachably connected to the rear leg of the jaw for aligning the second end of the C-clamp with the rear leg of the jaw. More particularly, the second end of the C-clamp is bifurcated having spaced arms between which the sleeve extends, one of the arms engaging the outside of the rear leg. In one aspect of the invention, a second alignment pin is detachably connected to the second end of the C-clamp, and extends through the movable frame and into the staple cartridge assembly for maintaining alignment of the staple cartridge assembly relative to the anvil. The second alignment pin includes an end that terminates within the staple cartridge assembly for preventing injury to the tissue in the gap between the staple cartridge assembly and the anvil. The second alignment pin is attached to and extends through the sleeve. More particularly, the first and second alignment pins are coaxial. The front and rear legs of the jaw are aligned without puncturing the tissue in the gap by either of the first and second alignment pins during stapling of the tissue."
4518172,"The invention relates to a flexible, energy-dissipating knee-restraining element for vehicles, and in particular, to a knee-restraining element which is installed beneath the instrument panel of a passenger automobile. Knee-restraining elements are known. German Offenlegungsschrift No. 23 35 958 describes such an element. The known arrangements are used to restrain movement of the lower body of a passenger in the event of an emergency, particularly in vehicles which provide a safety belt, such as a shoulder belt for restraining only the upper body. In these known arrangements, the knee-restraining element comprises a hollow beam which extends without interruption over the width of the vehicle, and is typically secur

6862842,"REFERENCE TO MICROFICHE APPENDIX Not applicable. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not applicable. The present invention relates generally to green roof systems, also known as roof landscaping systems and roof gardens, that are suitable for supporting live plant growth on building roofs. More particularly, the invention relates to modular green roof systems, and methods and apparatus for use therewith. Briefly, prior green roof systems typically comprise several layers of materials suitable to support vegetation on a roof. These layers are typically supplied in bulk or earthen rolls that are rolled into position on the roof. Common types of vegetation used in green roof systems include herbs, grasses, mosses, wild plants and flowers, and other types of perennials. A typical prior green roof system includes at least (i) a waterproofing membrane laid over the roof or roof supporting structure, (ii) based on the roof grade, a layer over the waterproofing membrane of one of: (a) a drainage layer and an overlaying blanket of root growth protection material (for a grade of approximately 2 to 5 degrees), (b) a root growth protective fleece (for a grade of approximately 6 to 10 degrees), and (c) a substrate fixing or erosion control blanket including root growth protection (for a grade of approximately 10 to 20 degrees); (iii) a layer of mineral wool or other substrate for water retention, and (iv) a top layer of vegetation growing in a fiber fleece or other suitable growing medium. Other green roof designs include additional layers of various materials for various roof protection and vegetation growth support purposes. It is believed that prior green roof systems of the above general type were first used in Europe approximately 20 years ago. Since that time, use of similar and derivative green roof systems has become common in many parts of Europe on commercial, institutional, industrial, and residential buildings, and interest in green roof systems is growing in the United States. The advantages typically attributed to green roof systems include extending the roof service life; reducing heating and cooling energy costs; conserving and utilizing valuable commercial space; reducing runoff from roof surfaces; and increasing property values. However, inspection of such prior systems also reveal the following disadvantages: the prior systems are relatively expensive and are difficult to install, typically requiring the need for and assistance of a specially trained consultant; the systems are not designed to be installed over an existing functional roof without the necessity of reroofing; thus, a complete new waterproofing membrane must typically be installed before the green roof system can be used on existing buildings, resulting in additional costs; since the green roof materials are delivered in bulk or earthen rolls, design freedom is limited, alternating designs of plants are not easily incorporated in the design of the green roof; terracing or variations of surfaces are also not easily accomplished; and changing of the design layout after installation requires removal and destruction of the effected area and replanting with the new design; selection of pre-growing plants in the upper fiber fleece is typically limited to low-growing plants, mosses, etc., since the fleece is supplied to the roof in rolls; selection of pre-grown plants available is further typically limited because: the need to maintain the plants in the growing state prior to shipment results in additional costs; the demand must be estimated in advance of the installation season in order to have the pre-grown plants ready; and such estimates are typically conservative in order to prevent overstocking and spoilage if not used during that season; and maintenance and repair to the roof is difficult and expensive; if a leak develops in the roof membrane, or if other maintenance or repair is required, the entire green roof, or at least large portions of the green roof, must be removed to locate and repair the leak or accomplish the desired maintenance; the removed green roof must then be replaced and replanted. Thus, it is clear there is a need for new and improved green roof systems which: are less expensive and more easily installed than prior green roof systems; can be installed over existing roofing materials on existing buildings, thus eliminating the need and associated cost to install completely new roofing membranes or systems prior to installation of the green roof; provide for substantially enhanced design flexibility and freedom, including;     the ability to change the design layout of the green roof after initial installation, and the ability to be used either as a standalone system, or in combination with prior green roof systems       as an original green roof layout and design including both prior systems and systems in accordance with the present invention, and to enable re

10165737,"Warm cloud catalyst, preparation method therefor and application thereof",A01,A01G,"The present invention relates to the field of weather modification catalyst, and particularly to a warm cloud catalyst, and a preparation method and an application of the same. BACKGROUND Since humans began weather modification in the 1940s, warm cloud catalysts have always been a worldwide problem that is difficult to crack. In the theoretical research on warm cloud precipitation mechanisms, the theory of collision, coalescence and breaking has been explicitly proposed. However, in the research on warm cloud catalysts, the idea that has been used for a long time is that hygroscopic substances can absorb moisture to grow at a pressure lower than the saturation vapor pressure, as for the hydrophilicity of the cloud condensation nuclei, there is no distinction, which hides the cognition to the wetting nuclei, no detailed research on surface tension difference is made with regard to the phenomena of large cloud droplets coalescing with small cloud droplets, and little is known about the source regions and features of the atmospheric aerosol particles capable of forming large water droplet-started collision mechanism. In the related art, hygroscopic substances such as sodium chloride, calcium chloride, urea or ammonium nitrate, etc. are generally used as warm cloud catalysts; and these common hygroscopic substances all have certain corrosivity (which will corrode spraying devices), and are easy to agglomerate, and when such type of hygroscopic substances are used as warm cloud catalysts, since the falling speed of the catalyst particles is too fast, and the factor of surface tension of the aqueous solution thereof is not taken into account, the effect of artificial precipitation is extremely unsatisfactory, and at present, there is no repeatable successful case. Thus, it is difficult to practically use such kind of warm cloud catalysts in production and life. Therefore, it is a technical problem to be solved urgently by people to provide a warm cloud catalyst which directly uses the theory of collision, coalescence and breaking as the guidance, is non-corrosive, is not easy to agglomerate, can continuously grow cloud droplets into raindrops and can be practically used. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a completely new research approach of warm cloud catalyst and a completely new product of warm cloud catalyst, so as to solve the aforesaid technical problem. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing the aforesaid warm cloud catalyst. In one aspect, the present invention provides a warm cloud catalyst comprising the following components in parts by weight: 80-120 parts of a plant ash/plant powder/plant carbon powder, 15-32 parts of a surfactant solution or 0.5-5 parts of a surfactant dry powder, and 2-10 parts of a thickening agent. Optionally, in the surfactant solution, the mass concentration of the solute is 0.5%-35%. Optionally, the plant ash/plant powder/plant carbon powder used comprises dry powders of plant materials or powders resulting from burning or carbonizing thereof, and further comprises non-plant materials having a density smaller than that of water, wherein the plant materials further comprise a starch, a cellulose, a lignin and/or a colloid which constitute a plant body. Optionally, the plant ash/plant powder/plant carbon powder has a particle size in the range of 0.5-150 μm. Optionally, the surfactant comprises surface active substances capable of reducing the surface tension of water by 20%-85%. Preferably, the surfactant comprises a silicon-containing or fluorine-containing surfactant or a degradable surfactant. Preferably, in the surfactant solution, the solute comprises one or more of polyether modified organosiloxane, polyether modified polydimethylsiloxane and perfluoroalkyl ester solution; and the solvent is water or ethanol. Optionally, the surfactant dry powder comprises water-soluble surfactant powders. Preferably, the surfactant dry powder comprises sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and Akzo Morwet EFW. Optionally, the thickening agent comprises aqueous phase thickening agents. Preferably, the thickening agent comprises xanthan gum, konjac gum, guar gum or pectin. In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for preparing the aforesaid warm cloud catalyst, wherein when the surfactant is in a form a solution, the method includes the steps of: 1) preparing a surfactant solution, wherein in the surfactant solution, the mass concentration of a solute is 0.5%-35%; 2) evenly mixing 15-32 parts by weight of the prepared surfactant solution with 80-120 parts by weight of plant ash/plant powder/plant carbon powder to obtain a mixture; and 3) drying the mixture, then adding 2-10 parts of the thickening agent, evenly mixing, and sieving to obtain a warm cloud catalyst.

Task: I wonder which patents within CPC subsection 'C05' or group 'A01G' in the USA have at least one forward or backward citations within one month of their application dates. Give me the ids, titles, application date, forward/backward citation counts and summary texts.

Please answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
id,title,application_date,forward_citation_count,backward_citation_count,summary_text
id1:str,title1:str,date1:str,forward_count1:int,backward_count1:int,summary1:str
id2:str,title2:str,date2:str,forward_count2:int,backward_count2:int,summary2:str
...
```

The table above lists patents in the USA within CPC subsection 'C05' or group 'A01G' that have at least one forward or backward citation within one month of their application dates. It includes the patent ID, title, application date, counts of forward and backward citations, and the summary text for each patent..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'PATENTSVIEW': {'PATENTSVIEW': ['APPLICATION', 'ASSIGNEE', 'BOTANIC', 'BRF_SUM_TEXT', 'CLAIM', 'CLAIMS_2021', 'CPC_CURRENT', 'CPC_GROUP', 'CPC_SUBGROUP', 'CPC_SUBSECTION', 'DETAIL_DESC_TEXT_2021', 'DRAW_DESC_TEXT', 'DRAW_DESC_TEXT_2021', 'FIGURES', 'FOREIGNCITATION', 'FOREIGN_PRIORITY', 'GOVERNMENT_INTEREST', 'GOVERNMENT_ORGANIZATION', 'INVENTOR', 'INVENTOR_GENDER', 'IPCR', 'LAWYER', 'LOCATION', 'LOCATION_ASSIGNEE', 'LOCATION_INVENTOR', 'MAINCLASS', 'MAINCLASS_CURRENT', 'MATCH', 'NBER', 'NBER_CATEGORY', 'NBER_SUBCATEGORY', 'NON_INVENTOR_APPLICANT', 'OTHERREFERENCE', 'PATENT', 'PATENT_ASSIGNEE', 'PATENT_CONTRACTAWARDNUMBER', 'PATENT_GOVINTORG', 'PATENT_INVENTOR', 'PATENT_LAWYER', 'PCT_DATA', 'PERSISTENT_ASSIGNEE_DISAMBIG', 'PERSISTENT_INVENTOR_DISAMB', 'PERSISTENT_INVENTOR_DISAMBIG', 'RAWASSIGNEE', 'RAWEXAMINER', 'RAWINVENTOR', 'RAWLAWYER', 'RAWLOCATION', 'REL_APP_TEXT', 'SUBCLASS', 'SUBCLASS_CURRENT', 'USAPPLICATIONCITATION', 'USPATENTCITATION', 'USPC', 'USPC_CURRENT', 'USRELDOC', 'US_TERM_OF_GRANT', 'WIPO', 'WIPO_FIELD']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
Be careful of information in nested columns. e.g. When it comes to completed purchase, `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` Indicates the type of ecommerce action and '6' represents completed purchases.
Be careful one country may have different country_name and country_region in different columns in a database.
Don't be misled by examples. For instance, a question related to Android development on StackOverflow might include tags like 'android-layout,' 'android-activity,' or 'android-intent.' However, you should not limit your analysis to just these three tags; instead, consider all tags related to Android: "tags" LIKE '%android%'.

9179608,Plant container assembly and method,2013-04-24,0,1,"The present invention relates generally to containers for growing woody perennial plants. More particularly, the present invention relates to a container base designed to encourage air root pruning on the outside of the container sidewall in order to develop a fibrous root system, prevent stem girdling, and prevent circling and/or root defects from developing at the container sidewall and/or bottom. Currently, the majority of the nursery grown landscape plants, such as trees and shrubs, are initially grown in conventional smooth-wall, non-porous containers made of plastic, steel or other materials. The smooth-wall containers, however, tend to deflect root growth, causing it to then follow along the interior surface of the container, or deflect the root around the sidewall creating a root defect. This often results in root circling and a stem girdling root system. Such containers cause the primary roots to revolve around the container, which can cause significant stability problems when the tree matures. Such poor root development and anchorage problems are especially detrimental to trees of the larger variety. Generally, the roots of a plant grow and extend in a radial fashion from the main stem or trunk. Thus, a root will extend in a naturally promoted direction (i.e., outwardly and downwardly) until it contacts something that it cannot move or penetrate. At that point, the root is deflected in a new direction and extends until it encounters something else that would change its direction of growth or travel. Many seedling woody perennials, in particular, will first develop a tap root that plunges downward. The tap root on some woody perennials will develop a foot of primary root for every inch of top growth. Once the taproot is cut or pruned, the apical dominance of its root tip is lost and the development of some secondary lateral rooting commences. These secondary roots tend to grow a little more horizontally, although generally downwardly, in direction. When these roots run out of room to grow, they begin to circle around the inside of the container. Hence, unless air root pruning is permitted, a phenomenon in which the growth of a root ceases when the root extends into the vicinity of an aperture that is exposed to the atmosphere, these roots will grow to the bottom of the container where they continue to grow in a circular pattern. Air pruning, hence, is highly desirable, and naturally occurs when roots are exposed to air in the absence of high humidity. The roots are effectively “burned” off, causing the plant to continually produce new and healthy branching roots. If roots are not exposed to air, they continue to grow around the container in a constricted pattern. The roots may spiral, twist, kink or become stem girdling. When such a plant is later installed into the landscape, it will likely fail to establish a normal root structure, and instead will have reduced uptake of water and nutrients. Eventually abnormal growth should be obvious and could cause the plant to fail. Damaged root systems also cause leaves to turn yellow or brown, shrivel or drop. Healthy, highly branched root structures allow a plant to more efficiently uptake water and nutrients while increasing growth and overall plant health. A strong, fibrous radially extending root system will make a plant better able to establish itself when installed in a planting project. Many plant containers have been developed that attempt to encourage side root growth, via air root pruning, and reduce circling of the roots. For instance, many cylindrical plant containers exist that incorporate small size side apertures in an attempt to inhibit such concentrated spiral and circular root growth. In all these designs, however, the side apertures are relatively small, and are not sufficiently abundant. This is due to the fact that too large and too many apertures will not retain the soil properly, allows the water to pass through the sides too quickly, not allowing the soil to absorb moisture, and accelerates evaporation. Although the mere presence of a side aperture or apertures do function to encourage side root growth, air-pruning of the roots, and initially reduce the incidence of spiraled or circled roots, eventually the small sidewall apertures become filled with roots or the secondary roots the encounter sidewall and deflect, causing spiraling and circling to ensue. The large amounts of obstructive material greatly increase the opportunity for the development of circling and stem girdling roots. Once the apertures have become filled with roots, the opportunity for air pruning is diminished and root circling begins. Typical of such designs are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,442,628; 4,497,132; 4,510,712; 4,753,037; 4,939,865; 5,099,607; 5,131,185; 5,241,784; 5,557,886; and 5,937,577. Accordingly, it is therefore highly desirable to provide a transplantable plant container that encourages regenerative root growth though the container sidewall, even after air pruning has commenced, until the plant is transplanted or planted into the landscape. It is further desirable to provide an improved plant container for growing transplantable plants, whereby spiral and circular root growth is reduced or substantially prevented, and the development of lateral root tips at the bottom and around the sides of the container is maximized by air root pruning. It is still further desirable to provide a plant container that is formed to improved plant growth wherein the production of lateral root tips is promoted at all levels in a plant growth medium and the root tips quickly grow in all natural directions radially from the plants main stem, whereby the plant is quickly laterally anchored when transplanted and maximum water and nutrients are absorbed. Despite the abundance of container designs available that improve the health of a transplantable plant, there remains a need for a container that enhances root development by air pruning of the roots and significantly prevents circling and stems girding roots. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a bounding system for a transplantable plant for bounding a growing medium in which the transplantable plant is grown. Therefore, root regeneration is vastly improved. The bounding system includes a bounding apparatus having a sheet-like lattice framework, which is comprised of a plurality of elongated rib members, spaced apart from one another. Each elongated rib member defines an interior facing surface that is convex-shaped in a transverse cross-sectional dimension thereof. Further, each adjacent elongated rib member defines an elongated, spaced sidewall apertures therebetween, and hence a plurality of sidewall aperture that collectively define a sidewall aperture area. This sidewall aperture area comprises at least about 50% of the sidewall surface area. The bounding apparatus further includes s bottom support having a support surface area. The bottom support and the sidewall framework cooperate to define a cavity formed for receipt of the growing medium therein. The bottom support further include a sheet-like bottom framework having a plurality of spaced bottom wall apertures which promote and encourage air root pruning of the transplantable plant proximate the bottom support when vertically oriented at a location above the ground by a sufficient distance. Accordingly, the convex interior profile of the interior facing surface of each elongated rib members (regardless of their orientation) facilitates any root growth contacting these surfaces to be deflected into and through the respective adjacent sidewall apertures. Unlike the current designs were the interior wall are relatively flat, any such root growth directly contacting such a surface will not be directed back inward toward into the container. In one specific embodiment, the rib members and the sidewall apertures are generally vertically oriented. The rib members are relatively uniformly spaced about a longitudinal axis of the sidewall framework. In another specific configuration, the sidewall aperture area comprises at least about 60% to about 95% of the sidewall surface area. The bottom wall apertures are relatively uniformly spaced about the longitudinal axis, and collectively define a bottom wall aperture area that comprises at least about 60% to about 95% of the support surface area. In still another embodiment, the sufficient distance is in the generally in the range of about one inch to about six inches, and could be as little as ⅛ inch for smaller containers. In another aspect of the present invention, a bounding system for a transplantable plant is provided for bounding a growing medium in which the transplantable plant is grown. The bounding system includes a bounding apparatus having a sheet-like sidewall framework and a bottom support, which cooperates to define a cavity, formed for receipt of the growing medium therein. The sidewall framework, having a sidewall surface area, defines a plurality of elongated, spaced sidewall apertures therebetween that collectively define a sidewall aperture area. The sidewall aperture area comprises at least about 50% of the sidewall surface area. The bottom support includes a sheet-like bottom framework having a support surface area, and defines a plurality of spaced bottom wall apertures. The bottom and bottom wall apertures are adapted to promote and encourage air root pruning of the transplantable plant proximate the bottom support when vertically oriented at a location above the ground by a sufficient distance. In accordance with the present invention, the bounding system further includes a support tray, which is comprised of a relatively solid sheet material. The support tray includes a tray top portion and a surrounding sidewall. The tray top portion supportively accommodates the bounding apparatus such that the bottom support thereof is vertically oriented at least at the sufficient distance above the ground. The surrounding sidewall and the sidewall framework define a humidifying airspace therebetween in a manner reducing rapid dry-down. Accordingly, the support tray significantly reduces, if not eliminates, sun exposure of the exposed growing media contained at the sidewall apertures and the bottom support wall apertures significantly reducing rapid dry-down of the exposed growing media. Moreover, the air movement of the immediately surrounding the sheet-like sidewall framework is also significantly reduced, essentially creating a dead airspace (i.e., the humidifying airspace therebetween). In effect, the significant reduction of the rapid dry down, as well as the significant reduction of air movement, in this dead airspace creates a surrounding high humidity area, which further promotes air root pruning. In one specific embodiment of the present invention, the support tray includes a regulating system that cooperates with the surrounding sidewall to regulate the humidity in the humidifying airspace. In another configuration, the bounding apparatus is removably mounted to the support tray, and includes a collar member at an upper portion of the sidewall framework. The tray top portion of the support tray defines an opening therethrough for sliding axial receipt of the sidewall framework until the collar member is supportively seated atop tray top portion. In yet another specific embodiment, the bounding apparatus is integrally formed with the support tray. In another embodiment, the bounding system includes two or more bounding apparatus, and the tray top portion is configured to supportively accommodate each of the two or more bounding apparatus."
10006994,Systems and methods for detecting soil characteristics,2017-07-27,0,1,"BACKGROUND Agricultural growing operations operate efficiently when, among other things, seeds are planted in soil having optimal soil characteristics and the seeds are provided optimal amounts water and nutrients. Soil characteristics (e.g., soil composition, soil density, nutrient presence, humus presence, etc.) vary from location to location, both globally (e.g., from geographic region to geographic region) and locally (e.g., from spot to spot within a single area of land). Further, the presence of soil moisture from natural sources or from man-made irrigation systems, varies from location to location. Generally, a single agricultural growing operation involves planting a specific type of seed according to a set pattern over many acres of land (e.g., planting a field of corn in rows). Soil characteristics will often vary over the area of land used for the agricultural growing operation. Despite the variances in soil characteristics, seeds are generally planted in the same manner across the entire area of land used for growing operation. Further, many agricultural growing operations utilize man made delivery systems for water, nutrients, fertilizers, and/or other chemicals and soil additives. The delivery systems are buried or placed on the surface of the soil. The delivery systems are at risk of being damaged or destroyed as agricultural equipment disturbs the soil to plants seeds, harvests crops, and tills soil material. One exemplary embodiment relates to a soil detection and planting apparatus. The apparatus includes a vehicle and a controller coupled to the vehicle. The apparatus further includes a planting device coupled to the vehicle, the planting device configured to plant seeds or plants into a soil material. The apparatus includes a ground penetrating radar sensor coupled to the vehicle.

The apparatus includes a location sensor coupled to the aircraft. The location sensor is configured to provide a location feedback signal to the controller. The controller is configured to create a map of the soil material including a location of the portion of the irrigation system based on the sensor feedback signal and the location feedback signal. A further exemplary embodiment relates to a method of operating a vehicle including a controller. The vehicle is configured to map soil characteristics and plant seeds or plants. The method includes detecting intrinsic soil characteristics of a soil material through a ground penetrating radar unit coupled to the vehicle, wherein the ground penetrating radar unit is configured to scan the soil material up to a designated depth beneath a surface of the soil material, and wherein the ground penetrating radar unit is further configured to provide a sensor feedback signal to a controller with respect to the intrinsic soil characteristics. The method further includes, in response to the intrinsic soil characteristics, instructing a planting mechanism coupled to the vehicle to plant a seed or a plant.

The method includes tracking a location of the vehicle through a location sensor coupled to the vehicle. The method further includes creating a map of an area of land traversed by the vehicle, wherein the map includes detected intrinsic soil characteristics, wherein the map is configured to be later updated to include the location of a planted plant or a planted seed. The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description."
5143481,Method of treating municipal sewage sludge and product produced thereby,1991-04-18,0,1,"This invention relates to a method of using waste materials to form a material usable as a fertilizer fill material or landfill cover. The invention relates to the combination of municipal sewage sludge and combustion residue such as that produced in coal burning electricity generating operations. Fly ash is essentially fine solid noncombustible mineral residue typically resulting from coal-burning operations. It does not however include other more coarse combustion by-products such as bottom ash, cinders, or slag. Fly ash typically comprises very fine particles, usually containing silica (SiO.sub.2), alumina (Al.sub.2 O.sub.3), ferric oxide (Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3), calcium oxides (CaO), and small quantities of other oxides and alkalies. Fly ash is an artificial possolan and is generally not cementious in itself, but with the presence of water and lime compounds, it forms a cementious product. These lime compounds often exist naturally in the fly ash or can be supplied by the addition of a lime source such as cement or kiln dusts. Fly ash by-product can be a problem for many coal burning industries, because the fly ash can be swept away by ordinary air currents, thereby polluting the air and ultimately settling in undesirable places. As a result, the coal-burning industry must be ever mindful of present and possible future environmental regulation, potential negative public opinion, and potential legal liability. The methods of wasting fly ash which have traditionally been used are the """"sluicing"""" method and the """"dampening"""" method. The """"sluicing"""" method mixes fly ash and liquid to a liquid content of greater than 90% by weight. The mixture is then pumped into a holding pond where it is exposed to ambient conditions and allowed to dry until the next batch of fly ash and water is added. The sluicing process has several disadvantages. First, in arid regions, large quantities of liquid are sometimes not readily available or only available at a very high cost. Second, the sluicing method often requires expensive site preparation, including the need for special cell liners and embankments. Third, the volume of water used in this method causes it to be very land consumptive, and the necessary land is not always available. Finally, a large holding pond of the end-product can be hazardous, because the cell liner or embankment could leak; also, wildlife or curious children could be attracted to the holding pond, which could result in any one of a number of serious consequences. Due to the aforementioned disadvantages, the sluicing method of wasting fly ash is not well suited to the needs of today's coal-burning industry. In the """"dampening"""" method, just sufficient liquid is added to the dry fly ash to calm the dust, and this facilitates the handling of the fly ash with conventional earth moving equipment. Although the liquid content will vary with the type of fly ash, a liquid content of about 5% to about 25% by weight is typically used. Current dampening systems commonly mix a continuous flow of fly ash with a continuous flow of liquid. Although the liquid flow rate can be easily controlled, the fly ash flow rate often cannot; as a result, the liquid content of the dampened fly ash often varies by 50% or more. This lack of uniformity produces handling problems. At lower liquid concentrations, unwanted fugitive dust is often generated; at higher concentrations, the end product becomes a paste or sludge which makes handling more difficult. Dampening systems are therefore becoming less suitable for today's needs. Due to the inadequacies of the sluicing and dampening methods, an innovative alternative method has been created and is disclosed in Pound, U.S. Pat. No. 4,313,762, """"Method of Wasting Fly Ash and Product Produced Thereby"""" and Pound, U.S. Pat. No. 4,461,601, """"Slurry System for Wasting Fly Ash Having Nonleachable Self-Sustaining End Product"""". Briefly, the Pound patents disclose a fly ash disposal system where, after the fly ash cools and is removed from a coal-burning plant boiler, it is transported by conventional means to a closed storage area to await transportation to a site located some distance from the coal-burning facility. The bone dry fly ash is discharged from the power station storage area into a pneumatic bulk transport truck. After filling, the truck is sealed to prevent dust leakage during transit. The substantially dust free closed chambered transport vehicle then brings the fly ash to a processing plant storage unit. The fly ash is ultimately transferred from the storage unit into a slurrier where it is mixed with an amount of liquid. The resultant slurry is then discharged via a slurry pump to a disposal cell. Sewage sludge is the end by-product of typical community waste treatment facilities. In typical sewage treatment facilities, the sludge is chemically conditioned and dewatered by vacuum filters. The dewatered sludge is then transferred to trailer dump trucks and hauled to a disposal site for further treatment or disposal. Disposing of sewage sludge has been accomplished by a number of methods. In some waster disposal methods, the sludge is incinerated. However, incineration typically results in high energy costs. Furthermore, incineration disposal methods also produce gaseous by-products which may cause environmental concerns. Other disposal processes involve the transporting of sludge to a disposal site in dump trucks. These trucks are then driven over refuse located at the disposal site. The sludge, including its contained water, is thereby dumped onto the refuse. The sludge is mixed with the refuse and then compacted with a bulldozer. In this way, the refuse is intended to soak up the liquid contained in the sludge, thereby reducing the environmental impact upon the surrounding region. The amount of sludge which can be mixed with refuse is typically controlled by regulatory agencies. Whether regulated or not, however, landfills can become saturated with waste, thereby generating environmental hazards and concerns. Other methods of sewage disposal include burying the sewage sludge at a disposal site dedicated solely for such sludge. However, this method of disposal also raises environmental concerns due to ground water pollution, general instability and undesirable settling of the completed fill, and other hazards. The effective and safe disposal of municipal sewage sludge is becoming more difficult. Locations where such material can be economically disposed are becoming more scarce. It has been found that methods previously thought safe are not completely effective in the long term. Sewage sludge contains large amounts of bacteria and other pathogens which must be destroyed or, at least, contained and prevented from spreading. The U.S. EPA has promulgated rules governing the type of processes that can be used to treat waste water sludge. These processes are directed at reducing pathogens at various levels. Other prior art techniques for treating municipal sludge have included combining such sludge with fly ash and cement kiln dust, as suggested in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,781,842; 4,554,002; 4,432,800; 4,341,562; 4,101,332; 4,038,095 and 4,018,617, or with fly ash and lime, as suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 4,028,130. However, depending upon their availability, kiln dust and lime can be prohibitively expensive to use. It has been found that a material resulting from the use of a coal burning technique known as the fluidized bed process is usable as a replacement for lime. The fluidized bed process produces fluidized bed combustion residue (""""FBCR"""") or bottom drain, which has been suggested for use, after wet pre-treatment (hydration) thereof, in combination with fly ash to stabilize scrubber sludge. In U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,250,134; 4,397,742; 4,344,796 and 4,397,801 (the """"Minnick patents""""), the inventor pretreats the FBCR with a process called """"blunging"""", wherein water is added to the FBCR and the combination is mixed. The Minnick patents do not suggest the use of FBCR to treat municipal sludge. In Nowicki et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,472,198, """"Process and System of Wasting Fly Ash And Product Produced Thereby"""", a method and system is disclosed for disposing of fly ash and liquid industrial waste. The product of this method is environmentally safe and comprises a mixture of dry fly ash and liquid additive having a liquid additive content of about 5%-25% by weight. The process relates to a mixing operation which closely controls the liquid additive to yield a uniformly conditioned product; this product can be subjected to earth handling equipment pressures almost immediately. The process also typically eliminates cell preparation and greatly reduces leaching at the disposal site. However, the Nowicki process is not applicable to all forms of waste disposal. The disclosure of Nowicki is directed to liquid waste disposal which may not be suitable for sewage sludge disposal due to the sludge's non-aqueous physical properties. The treatment of sewage sludge, as contrasted with the treatment of scrubber sludge, must address the serious problem of bacteria. Sewage sludge contains large amounts of bacteria which must be destroyed and prevented from regeneration. It may also contain amounts of undesirable """"heavy"""" metals which must, in accordance with EPA regulations, be disposed of in a controlled manner. Generally, sewage sludge also contains a higher water-to-solids ratio than other industrial sludge. On the other hand, sewage sludge contains many nutrients which make it a possible source of fertilizer. The handling and delivery of raw, de-watered sewage sludge is, however, difficult, because of odor, bacterial content, and other physical properties. Regulations concerning methods of handling and application can be found in Title 35 Subtitle C, """"Land Applications of Municipal Sludge"""" from the EPA. Also, the fact that sewage sludge is a result of human activity means that its source will necessarily be near densely populated areas. In contrast, scrubber sludge may be produced at power generating stations quite distant from populated areas, making disposal thereof less critical or less costly. As a result, an object of this invention is to provide a fly ash and sewage sludge wasting method and system which is environmentally safe, economical and reliable. It is an object of the present invention to treat municipal sewage sludge with FBCR, FBCR and fly ash, or fly ash alone for the purpose of solidification and/or detoxification. Yet another object of the invention is to produce a fertilizer from municipal sewage sludge, which is easily stored, handled and delivered. Still another object of the invention is to produce a material comprised of sewage sludge, an activator comprised of either FBCR, fly ash, or FBCR and fly ash, which is suitable for use as a landfill material. Yet a further object of the invention is to produce a stabilized sewage sludge composition which is substantially free of pathogenic agents. A further object of the invention is to provide a method of and system for wasting fly ash and sewage sludge whereby the fly ash is handled during transit and processed in a manner which is pollution free. Yet another object is to provide a process and system of wasting fly ash and sewage sludge in which the end product will harden into a stable, environmentally acceptable mass. Yet another object is to provide a fly ash and sewage sludge wasting system in which the final, hardened product meets all current environmental requirements, and is resistant to leaching and to percolation from ground water and rainfall whereby the pollution potential in the disposal area is greatly reduced. Yet a further object is to provide a fly ash sewage sludge wasting system in which on-site dust at the disposal location is reduced to a minimum. A further object is to provide a fly ash and sewage sludge wasting system and process which is more economical to operate than other conventional systems. A still further object is to provide a sewage sludge and wasting system which is less land consumptive and more space efficient than previously known methods. Other objects and features of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following specification when read in conjunction with the annexed drawings. These and other objects of the invention are obtained with a method by which sewage sludge, FBCR and fly ash are blended in a pug mill. The mixture is then stockpiled where it is allowed to cure for a minimum period of about 72 hours. During that period, the temperature of the mixture is maintained at a minimum level of about 100.degree. F. The alkalinity of the mixture is such that its pH is not less than 10."
5070576,Hedge trimmer extension handle apparatus,1990-11-21,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to devices for yard maintenance, decorative tree and hedge trimming, and tree pruning. 2. Description of Related Art When pruning tall hedges or decorative trees, the user of an electric hedge trimmer constantly faces the problem that bushes, branches, or other vegetation that needs trimming are beyond the reach of the hedge trimmer when the operator stands on the ground and holds the hedge trimmer as normally intended. Therefore, most users resort to utilizing a ladder. If the vegetation is too high, the operator will position the ladder, climb the ladder, trim the area within an arm's reach, climb down, move the ladder and then repeat the process. This becomes tiresome and frustrating. Often, in an attempt to minimize this cumbersome process, the operator will reach beyond a safe distance in order to maximize the area trimmed with each move of the ladder. Unfortunately, this poses a substantial risk of falling from the ladder when an operator extends his or her reach beyond the bounds of safe balance. If the hedge is too wide, then a similar problem develops. The operator cannot reach across the hedge, so the operator climbs a ladder or some other apparatus and precariously leans over the hedge while balancing on the ladder. This process is time-consuming, tiresome, and again compromises the operator's safety. Tree pruning is also a slow process usually involving an extension saw or sheer which cuts one limb at a time. Hedge trimmers would be much faster for small limbs, but the operator is again limited to an arm's reach or proceeding with the previously described ladder process. Notwithstanding these inconveniences, few improvements have been introduced to solve these problems. Ott, et. al (U.S. Pat. No. 3,218,789) describes a rotary lawn and hedge trimmer device which configures a household electric drill as a lawn edger or hedge trimmer. This device holds the drill and includes a handle so the operator can stand erect and trim the lawn. However, when the device is used as a hedge trimmer, the handle is generally removed in order to make handling the device more convenient (Column 4, Lines 14-16). Furthermore, were the handle not removed, it appears that the torque and shear forces exerted on the hedge trimmer as the rotary blade cuts the vegetation would be sufficient to render the use of the handle unsafe. Orr (U.S. Pat. No. 2,153,771) discloses a grass cutter and hedge trimmer which has an attached handle. This device is a rotary trimmer which provides a function similar to modern fish-line trimmers. This device does not provide a way to extend the reach of an operator using a sickle type electric hedge clipper. Janata (U.S. Pat. No. 2,762,186) describes a self-contained hedge cutting machine. The machine uses an electric sickle knife connected to an independent power source mounted on the machine. However, this device is cumbersome for household use because the machine is bulky and must be set up for use. An operator might just as well proceed with the ladder process described. Moreover, this machine does not provide a simple way to extend an operators reach for pruning trees or for free-hand trimming of hedges and decorative vegetation because the machine is intended to cut at a predetermined angle. Finally, this device does not make accommodations for a hedge that is too wide. Albrecht (U.S. Pat. No. 1,897,543) also describes a hedge cutter. This device provides a hedge cutter powered by the operator who pushes the device along the ground. This device does hold a sickle knife for trimming hedges; however, it does not allow free-hand trimming of non-uniform hedges, decorative plants or trees. It also does not accommodate hedges that are too wide for the sickle knife swath. None of these devices provides an economical, quick and easy to use system for extending an operator's reach when using a hand-held electric hedge trimmer. Accordingly, a device which extends the users reach when used in connection with an electric hand held hedge trimmer would greatly simplify and increase the safety and versatility of this device when vegetation is beyond the operator's reach. Such a device, to be useful, should be easy to attach and remove from the hedge trimmer without the use of tools or cumbersome mechanisms. The device should also be economical, lightweight, durable, and strong enough to prevent breakage when the user applies sufficient pressure to use the trimmer as intended to trim vegetation. The present invention provides a new and simple to use hedge trimming system which can be used quickly without the need of any other tools or apparatus to extend an operator's reach while permitting the free maneuverability of the hedge trimmer. One aspect of the invention is a hedge trimming system including a standard hedge trimmer, such as those produced by Black & Decker, and an extension device. The hedge trimmer includes an elongate body, a generally U-shaped handle and an elongate sickle knife assembly The elongate body includes a wider and deeper front body portion, a narrower and shallower rear body portion and a central body portion connecting the front body portion to the rear body portion. As used herein, """"deeper"""" is used to describe a portion which depends downward further than another portion which is considered to be """"shallower."""" The central body portion includes a raised motor containing portion. The generally U-shaped handle is formed by a pair of elongate arms and a connecting gripping section, wherein the ends of the pair of arms distal the gripping section are secured to the body on either side of the motor containing portion. The elongate sickle knife assembly extends longitudinally outward from the front body portion and includes an elongate central bar having blades extending horizontally outward from its elongate sides and an elongate longitudinally reciprocating cutter having blades extending horizontally outward from its elongate sides. The blades of the bar and the blades of the cutter cooperate to slice vegetation between them as the cutter reciprocates. A finger grip depends from the central body portion of the trimmer body to permit the trimmer to be firmly grasped by the operator when the trimmer is held in the hand. The extension device enables an operator to safely hold the body of the hedge trimmer away from the body of the operator so that the user can reach vegetation which would have been out of reach if the operator stood on the ground and held the hedge trimmer directly. The extension device includes an elongate securing member and an elongate shaft. The elongate securing member has a front end and a rear end and defines a longitudinal channel. A forward cradle portion defines a forward portion of the channel. This forward channel portion is generally U-shaped, having a generally flat horizontal bottom between a pair of vertical sides. The bottom has a width slightly greater than the width of the front body portion of the trimmer and the sides have a height sufficient to prevent the side to side movement of the front body portion of the trimmer when it is secured within the securing member. A first securing strap extends from one side of the forward cradle portion to the other side of the forward cradle portion. A first fastener secures the first securing strap between the sides of the forward cradle portion tightly over and against the front body portion of the trimmer. A rearward cradle portion defines a rearward portion of the channel. This rearward channel portion is generally U-shaped, having a generally flat horizontal bottom between a pair of vertical sides. The bottom has a width slightly greater than the width of the rear body portion of the trimmer and sides which have a height approximately one-half the height of the rear body portion of the trimmer. A second securing strap extends from one side of the rearward cradle portion to the other side of the rearward cradle portion. A second fastener secures the second securing strap between the sides of the rearward cradle portion tightly over and against the rear body portion of the trimmer. A center cradle portion connects the forward cradle portion and the rearward cradle portion. This center cradle portion defines a center portion of the channel connecting the forward portion of the channel to the rearward portion of the channel. The center portion of the channel is generally U-shaped, having a bottom and a pair of vertical sides. The bottom of the center cradle portion defines a generally arcuate vertical shoulder between the forward portion of the channel and the rearward portion of the channel. The bottom of the center cradle portion is also of decreasing width from front to rear so that the sides of the center portion of the channel form a pair of horizontal shoulders between the forward portion of the channel and the rearward portion of the channel. The bottom of the center cradle portion further defines a longitudinally elongate vertical recess having a depth which is slightly greater than the height of the finger grip and a width slightly greater than the width of the finger grip. The trimmer end of an elongate shaft is secured to the rear end of the securing member, wherein during operation the operator end of the shaft is supported and the angle and position of the operator end of the shaft is controlled by the hands of the operator allowing the operator to freely maneuver the trimmer end of the shaft. Desirably the sides of the center cradle portion extend vertically above the ends of the pair of arms of the trimmer handle, distal the gripping section and each of the sides further defines a notch which restricts the forward and rearward movement of the distal ends of the handle relative the trimmer handle. Desirably the sides of the forward body portion of the extension are at least one-quarter of one inch tall, thereby ensuring that the front body portion of the trimmer is prevented from moving side to side. Additionally, it is desirable that the first and the second securing strap surround both the trimmer and the securing member. Another aspect of the invention is a novel extension device forming a portion of the hedge trimming system described above. The hedge trimming system of the present invention provides an economical, quick and easy to use system for extending the operator's reach when using a hand-held electric hedge trimmer. Importantly, due to the danger to the operator of being cut by the reciprocating blade should the hedge trimmer ever become separated from the extension device, the unique structural configuration of the extension device insures that the hedge trimmer is safely and firmly secured within the securing member during operation and is able to withstand the torque and shear forces acting on the extension device, even when the hedge trimmer handle is 12-14 feet along. Advantageously, the securing member defines a longitudinal channel which is desirably configured so as to prevent any movement of the hedge trimmer relative the channel. Specifically, the raised sides of the forward channel portion and the rearward channel portion prevent the rotation of the trimmer about a vertical axis (i.e., an axis perpendicular to the elongate knife assembly of the trimmer). Additionally, due to the snug fit of the body portion of the trimmer within the channel, the opposing sides of the channel resist the rotation of the hedge trimmer about a longitudinal axis (i.e., about an axis parallel to the length of the elongate single knife assembly of the trimmer). Any tendency of the trimmer to """"pop out"""" of the channel is further resisted by the first and second securing straps and fasteners which bind the trimmer firmly in place. Preferably, one strap is positioned forward of the raised motor-containing portion of the trimmer and one strap is positioned rearward of the raised motor-containing portion of the trimmer so that, even if the straps are somewhat loosened and the hedge trimmer somehow pops out from its secure seat within the channel, the straps will prevent the raised motor-containing portion of the trimmer from moving in front of the first strap or rearward from the second strap so that the operator is protected from the full separation of the hedge trimmer from the extension device. Desirably, the configuration of the channel of the securing member is such that it provides a firm seat and prevents any rearward motion of the hedge trimmer relative the securing member. Specifically, the bottom of the center cradle portion of the securing member desirably includes a vertical shoulder between the front portion of the channel and the rearward portion of the channel, thereby preventing the front body portion, which is deeper than the shallower rear body portion of the trimmer, from moving toward the operator. Likewise, since the bottom of the center cradle portion is also of decreasing width from front to rear, the sides of the center portion of the channel form a horizontal shoulder between the forward portion of the channel and the rearward portion of the channel. As will be appreciated, the horizontal shoulders prevent the rearward motion of the front body portion of the trimmer relative the securing member. Desirably, the hedge trimmer also includes a finger grip depending from the central portion of the trimmer and the bottom of the central cradle portion of the securing member defines a longitudinally elongate vertical recess having a depth which is slightly greater than the height of the finger grip and a width slightly greater than the width of the finger grip. As will be appreciated, the finger grip and the recess cooperate to prevent the longitudinal movement of the tremor relative the securing number, side to side movement of the tremor relative the securing member and rotation of the securing member within the channel about a longitudinal access. Desirably, the sides of the center cradle portion extend vertically above the ends of the pair of arms of the trimmer handle distal the gripping section and each of the sides defines a notch which cooperates with one of the distal ends of the trimmer handle to restrict the forward and rearward movement of the trimmer relative the shearing member. Additionally, the notch and the handle of the trimmer further cooperate to prevent the rotation of the trimmer about a longitudinal axis. Due to the unique structural configuration of the securing member, even if extreme tensile force causes a strap to break, a single tightened strap is sufficient to keep the body of the trimmer securely within the channel so that the horizontal and vertical shoulders, as well as the side notches, prevent the disengagement of the hedge trimmer from the securing member and the potentially disastrous consequences. Finally, the U-shaped channel further acts to direct the electric cable (if any) of the electric hedge trimmer away from the single knife assembly of the trimmer to prevent the inadvertent cutting of the electric cord by the operator."
4044806,Tree processing machine,1975-02-24,0,1,"Tree harvesting machines are available on the market today which perform one or more of the following operations: felling, delimbing and bucking of trees. One of the problems with these prior art tree harvesting machines was that they were extremely large in size and complicated in construction thereby rendering them prohibitively expensive to construct and maintain. Moreover, the bulkiness of the machine and the lack of maneuverability of the machine substantially precluded the use of the machine when selective harvesting or thinning of trees was desired. Also, once a tree was felled, the prior art machines generally were unable to maneuver with the felled tree before processing was complete. These and other problems and disadvantages associated with the prior art are overcome by the invention disclosed herein by providing a tree harvesting machine that is small and compact with a high degree of maneuverability. Moreover, the invention is simple in construction, operation and maintenance and capable of automatic operation for rapidly felling, delimbing and bucking trees. Once the tree is felled, the machine with the tree thereon can be easily maneuvered prior to processing of the tree. The machine includes generally a prime mover capable of turning in a short radius with a relatively short base support frame as compared to the prior art mounted on the prime mover. A carriage frame is pivoted on the top of the base support frame about a roll axis generally parallel to, vertically aligned with and spaced above the longitudinal centerline of the prime mover. A main support bed is pivotally mounted at its upper end to the forward end of the frame for pivoting from a vertically position in which the lower end thereof is near the ground to a horizontal position above the prime mover. A cutting assembly is mounted on the end of the bed opposite its pivoted end and movable with the bed as well as with respect to the bed for selectively felling trees and cutting them into selected lengths. The support bed is equipped with a set of traversing drive assemblies for holding a tree stationary with respect to the bed during felling of the tree and for selectively driving the tree longitudinally across the bed. An adjustable delimbing mechanism is carried by the bed and carriage frame for selectively delimbing the tree as it is driven by the traversing drive assemblies. Topping means is provided for shearing the top from the trees. Automatic control means is provided for controlling the operation of the bed, cutting assembly, traversing drive assemblies, delimbing assembly, and topping means. These and other features and advantages of the invention will become more apparant upon consideration of the following specification and accompanying drawings wherein like characters of reference designate corresponding parts throughout the several views and in which:"

6862842,"Modular green roof system, apparatus and methods, including pre-seeded modular panels",2001-07-18,0,1,"REFERENCE TO MICROFICHE APPENDIX Not applicable. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not applicable. The present invention relates generally to green roof systems, also known as roof landscaping systems and roof gardens, that are suitable for supporting live plant growth on building roofs. More particularly, the invention relates to modular green roof systems, and methods and apparatus for use therewith. Briefly, prior green roof systems typically comprise several layers of materials suitable to support vegetation on a roof. These layers are typically supplied in bulk or earthen rolls that are rolled into position on the roof. Common types of vegetation used in green roof systems include herbs, grasses, mosses, wild plants and flowers, and other types of perennials. A typical prior green roof system includes at least (i) a waterproofing membrane laid over the roof or roof supporting structure, (ii) based on the roof grade, a layer over the waterproofing membrane of one of: (a) a drainage layer and an overlaying blanket of root growth protection material (for a grade of approximately 2 to 5 degrees), (b) a root growth protective fleece (for a grade of approximately 6 to 10 degrees), and (c) a substrate fixing or erosion control blanket including root growth protection (for a grade of approximately 10 to 20 degrees); (iii) a layer of mineral wool or other substrate for water retention, and (iv) a top layer of vegetation growing in a fiber fleece or other suitable growing medium. Other green roof designs include additional layers of various materials for various roof protection and vegetation growth support purposes. It is believed that prior green roof systems of the above general type were first used in Europe approximately 20 years ago. Since that time, use of similar and derivative green roof systems has become common in many parts of Europe on commercial, institutional, industrial, and residential buildings, and interest in green roof systems is growing in the United States. The advantages typically attributed to green roof systems include extending the roof service life; reducing heating and cooling energy costs; conserving and utilizing valuable commercial space; reducing runoff from roof surfaces; and increasing property values. However, inspection of such prior systems also reveal the following disadvantages: the prior systems are relatively expensive and are difficult to install, typically requiring the need for and assistance of a specially trained consultant; the systems are not designed to be installed over an existing functional roof without the necessity of reroofing; thus, a complete new waterproofing membrane must typically be installed before the green roof system can be used on existing buildings, resulting in additional costs; since the green roof materials are delivered in bulk or earthen rolls, design freedom is limited, alternating designs of plants are not easily incorporated in the design of the green roof; terracing or variations of surfaces are also not easily accomplished; and changing of the design layout after installation requires removal and destruction of the effected area and replanting with the new design; selection of pre-growing plants in the upper fiber fleece is typically limited to low-growing plants, mosses, etc., since the fleece is supplied to the roof in rolls; selection of pre-grown plants available is further typically limited because: the need to maintain the plants in the growing state prior to shipment results in additional costs; the demand must be estimated in advance of the installation season in order to have the pre-grown plants ready; and such estimates are typically conservative in order to prevent overstocking and spoilage if not used during that season; and maintenance and repair to the roof is difficult and expensive; if a leak develops in the roof membrane, or if other maintenance or repair is required, the entire green roof, or at least large portions of the green roof, must be removed to locate and repair the leak or accomplish the desired maintenance; the removed green roof must then be replaced and replanted. Thus, it is clear there is a need for new and improved green roof systems which: are less expensive and more easily installed than prior green roof systems; can be installed over existing roofing materials on existing buildings, thus eliminating the need and associated cost to install completely new roofing membranes or systems prior to installation of the green roof; provide for substantially enhanced design flexibility and freedom, including;     the ability to change the design layout of the green roof after initial installation, and the ability to be used either as a standalone system, or in combination with prior green roof systems       as an original green roof layout and design including both prior systems and systems in accordance with the present invention, and to enable repair of a prior green roof such as when a portion of the prior green roof has been removed for repairs of the building roof deck, to eliminate the current need to re-install the entire prior green roof systems after such removals or repairs; and permit ease of access to desired portions of the roof for maintenance and repair without the need to destroy and then replace large portions of the green roof. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The general aim of the present invention is to provide new and improved green roof systems, and methods and apparatus therefore—to address the above-identified disadvantages of prior green roof systems and achieve the advantages and benefits flowing from addressing the above-identified needs thereof. More particularly, it is an objective of the invention to provide a modular green roof system comprising pre-seeded modular panels having a surrounded space suitable for supporting live plant growth and adapted for installing onto an existing roof deck in side-by-side positioning while allowing water flow on the roof thereunder. The panels are filled with growing medium and pre-seeded prior to delivery to the roof site, and delivered in either a preserved condition or a germinated condition, and are adapted for packaging, shipping and delivery in either condition. In preferred embodiments, the panels are also provided with a watering system to assist in supporting the growing plants therein. The panels are further adapted for, and associated apparatus and methods are provided for, interconnecting to adjacent panels, connection to an edge finishing/edge termination system and a support structure, and lifting and positioning into place on the roof, or removing from the roof, without disturbing adjacent panels. Consequently, the pre-seeded modular panels of the invention are more easily installed than prior green roof systems. The pre-seeded modular panels enhance design-layout flexibility by enabling provision of a greater selection of growing and non-growing materials for the green roof system without concern for spoilage, enabling the growing materials to include those requiring greater soil depth than is available in prior green roof systems, and enabling the panels to be rearranged after installed. These aspects allow the designer or architect to select a broad variety of various colored or height plants to be incorporated within the system. In addition, the panels can be filled with proper growing soil composition for optimal growth potential for each pre-planted species, the panels can be alternately filled with any desired or decorative material such as gravel or concrete for walkways, and the filled panels can be used to achieve a desired weight for desired ballast required for loose-laid membrane roof such as of at least approximately 10-12 lb./sq. ft. In combination with the edge termination/edge finishing system and support structure, the panels enable provision of multi-level terracing of the green roof, provision of bounded areas for uses such as a water pond, a field planted area, walkway areas, and putting greens, provision of above-panel structures, and other elements to the designer's imagination. The modular panels also provide for ease of repair of the roof structure by simply removing the necessary panels, thus eliminating the need to destroy a substantial portion of the installed green roof as with prior green roof systems."
10371814,Systems and methods for detecting soil characteristics,2018-06-25,0,1,"BACKGROUND Agricultural growing operations operate efficiently when, among other things, seeds are planted in soil having optimal soil characteristics and the seeds are provided optimal amounts water and nutrients. Soil characteristics (e.g., soil composition, soil density, nutrient presence, humus presence, etc.) vary from location to location, both globally (e.g., from geographic region to geographic region) and locally (e.g., from spot to spot within a single area of land). Further, the presence of soil moisture from natural sources or from man-made irrigation systems, varies from location to location. Generally, a single agricultural growing operation involves planting a specific type of seed according to a set pattern over many acres of land (e.g., planting a field of corn in rows). Soil characteristics will often vary over the area of land used for the agricultural growing operation. Despite the variances in soil characteristics, seeds are generally planted in the same manner across the entire area of land used for growing operation. Further, many agricultural growing operations utilize man made delivery systems for water, nutrients, fertilizers, and/or other chemicals and soil additives. The delivery systems are buried or placed on the surface of the soil. The delivery systems are at risk of being damaged or destroyed as agricultural equipment disturbs the soil to plants seeds, harvests crops, and tills soil material.

7879236,Micro gas attendant system,2008-10-09,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention This invention pertains in general to a system for remediation of biological waste, and more particularly to a system for remediation of livestock waste through aerobic and anaerobic bacterial digestion. 2. Description of the Related Art As the global population increases there is a corresponding need to increase food production. Large scale food production operations such as concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) produce large volumes of livestock waste. Livestock waste can contain compounds such as manure, fertilizer compounds, hydrocarbons and antibiotics. Many of these compounds must be remediated in order to attenuate negative environmental impact caused by the compounds. Accordingly, efficient methods of livestock waste remediation are needed to support environmentally sustainable food production for a growing global population. One popular method of livestock waste remediation is through the use of livestock waste lagoons. A livestock waste lagoon is a sealed tank into which liquid livestock waste is combined with water to create an effluent for remediation. Typically, the liquid livestock waste is combined with water collected from rainfall. Livestock waste lagoons act as “digesters” in which anaerobic or aerobic bacteria decompose the compounds in the effluent into gases, liquids and sludge, thus remediating the compounds. Anaerobic bacteria are bacteria which do not survive in the presence of free oxygen. Aerobic bacteria require free elemental (dissolved) oxygen for survival. Anaerobic lagoons are most commonly used for livestock waste treatment. Anaerobic bacteria can decompose or “digest” more organic compounds per unit lagoon volume than aerobic bacteria and are predominantly used for treatment of concentrated organic waste. Since anaerobic digestion is not dependent on dissolved oxygen, lagoons can be much deeper and require less surface area, thus enabling a greater volume of waste to be remediated. However, anaerobic digestion results in the production and emission of noxious gases, primarily hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and intermediate organic acids. Aerobic lagoons remediate livestock waste through digestion of the waste by aerobic bacteria. The main advantage of aerobic lagoons is that aerobic digestion of livestock waste tends to more thoroughly remediate organic compounds present in effluent than anaerobic digestion. Aerobic digestion of livestock waste also produces relatively odor-free end products. In aerobic lagoons, oxygen diffusion occurs across the surface of the lagoon resulting in an increased dissolved oxygen concentration which enables the proliferation of aerobic bacteria. Because of the need for an increased dissolved oxygen concentration, naturally aerobic lagoons are designed on the basis of surface area rather than volume. Water depths of aerobic lagoons are typically shallow, ranging from 3 to 5 feet. Consequently, large amounts of land are required for naturally aerobic lagoons—as much as 25 times more surface area and 10 times more volume than an anaerobic lagoon 10 feet deep. Thus, naturally aerobic lagoons are impractical and are generally not used for livestock waste remediation. To compensate for lack of surface area, some aerobic lagoons are mechanically aerated. Double-stage lagoons provide one method of combining the benefits of aerobic digestion and anaerobic digestion of livestock waste. In double stage lagoons, incoming waste is first input to an anaerobic first-stage lagoon. Overflow from the anaerobic first-stage lagoon is output to an aerobic second-stage lagoon. This produces an effluent end product that has less odor and fewer organic solids than anaerobic digestion alone. However, double-stage lagoons require the maintenance of two separate lagoons and their respective bacterial populations. Further, the anaerobic first-stage lagoon still produces noxious gases. Accordingly, there is a need for systems which maximize both the efficiency of remediation and completeness of remediation. There is an additional need for systems which utilize the by-products of remediation. BRIEF SUMMARY One embodiment of the present invention includes a method for remediating an effluent containing livestock waste. The micro gas attendant system establishes a lagoon of waste effluent. The lagoon comprises a set of sub-portions or “levels”, each level having a unique concentration of dissolved oxygen according to an oxygen gradient present in the lagoon. The micro gas attendant system transmits the effluent from each level of the lagoon to a corresponding level of an incubator having a same concentration of dissolved oxygen as the level of the lagoon. The incubator contains a set of micro-organisms which digest organic compounds in the effluent, generating a remediated effluent. The micro gas attendant transmits the effluent and micro-organisms from the incubator to the lagoon. Another embodiment of the present invention includes method for proliferating algae using by-products of anaerobic digestion. The micro-gas attendant system transmits anaerobic waste from an anaerobic level of the lagoon to a reaction vessel containing meso-thermophilic and thermophilic bacteria. The meso-thermophilic and thermophilic bacteria perform anaerobic digestion of the anaerobic waste in the reaction vessel. The micro-gas attendant system collects gaseous by-products from anaerobic digestion in a manifold. The micro-gas attendant system transmits gaseous by-products from the manifold to growth tubes containing algae. The algae proliferate in the growth tubes, consuming the gaseous by-products. The micro-gas attendant system transmits algae from the growth tubes to a level of the lagoon where the algae contribute to the dissolved oxygen concentration of the level by performing photosynthetic reactions. Another embodiment of the present invention includes a method for producing methane. As described above, the micro-gas attendant system collects gaseous by-products from anaerobic digestion in a manifold. The micro-gas attendant system transmits the gaseous by-products to a filter. The micro-gas attendant system filters the gaseous by-products to produce methane."
5103882,Rotary cutter wheel and removable tooth structure,1991-09-10,0,1,"This invention relates to rotary cutters and, more specifically, to such a cutter having a base portion to which a plurality of teeth are removably secured, each said tooth having a plurality of surfaces that abut surfaces on the base portion of the cutter that are substantially tangent to the cutting direction. Rotary cutters are used in various applications, including brush cutting and tree clearing and trimming applications. Whatever the use for rotary cutting apparatus, it is desirable to be able to quickly and easily remove and install cutting teeth on the cutter to replace or sharpen worn or damaged teeth, or substitute a different type of tooth for a different operation. A number of different types of removable tooth structures have been proposed and/or patented. Some of the problems that are associated with known tooth structures are relative difficulty in removing and/or installing the teeth, relatively complex structure of the teeth themselves or the mounting structure for the teeth, and vulnerability of the teeth to being broken off or dislodged. The subject of the present invention is rotary cutting apparatus. According to an aspect of the invention, the apparatus comprises a cutter base and a plurality of removable teeth. The base is mountable for rotation about an axis and defines a circular cutting direction perpendicular to the axis. The base includes radially outer peripheral portions with a plurality of projections and a plurality of edge surfaces corresponding to the projections, respectively. The edge surfaces extend substantially tangent to the cutting direction. Each projection has opposite side surfaces substantially tangent to the cutting direction, and an end surface extending between the side surfaces. The base defines a slot between each edge surface and a radially adjacent one of the side surfaces of the corresponding projection. The slot has an open end radially adjacent to the projection end surface. There is a removable tooth corresponding to each projection. Each tooth defines a socket with opposite inner surfaces. The projection is snugly received into the socket with the socket inner surfaces and an outer surface of the tooth abutting the projection's side surfaces and edge surface, respectively, to removably secure the tooth to the base. The socket provides clearance for the end surface of the projection to allow cutting forces to tend to tighten engagement of the projection in the socket. The shapes of the projection and the teeth may be varied. However, in the preferred embodiment, the inner surfaces of the socket and the tooth outer surface are essentially parallel to each other, and the projection is substantially rectangular to help maximize the simplicity of structure of the invention. The overall form of the cutter base may also be varied. In the currently preferred embodiment, the cutter base comprises a substantially disk-shaped cutter wheel. Other possible embodiments of the cutter base include a cutter bar having its axis of rotation at its longitudinal center. The apparatus of the invention is preferably provided with additional securing of the tooth onto the projection in order to enhance resistance to unintentional displacement of the tooth from its installed position on the projection. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, each projection has a first hole with a first width extending therethrough. The corresponding tooth has a second hole with a second width extending therethrough and aligned with the first hole. The second width is less than the first width. The apparatus further comprises a pin interference fit into the second hole and loosely received through the first hole. This further secures the tooth on the projection while maintaining a tendency of cutting forces to tighten engagement of the tooth on the projection. A preferred feature of the invention is the inclusion of confronting surfaces on opposite sides of the projection. In apparatus having this feature, the slot defined by the base has a closed end opposite its open end. The base defines a confronting surface radially outwardly of the projection. The tooth has a pair of rear surfaces positioned on opposite sides of its socket and confronting the closed end and the confronting surface, respectively. Another preferred feature, which is preferably provided in combination with the last described preferred feature, is the feature of offset rear surfaces on the tooth. The tooth has opposite top and bottom portions terminating in an end portion that defines a socket opening through which the projection is received. Each of the rear surfaces on the tooth extends between the top and bottom portions and is inwardly offset from the end portion to permit the top and bottom portions to extend over opposite top and bottom surfaces of the base beyond the projection. This provides additional support for the tooth. According to another aspect of the invention, the apparatus comprises a cutter base, a plurality of removable teeth, and a plurality of pins. The base is mountable for rotation about an axis and defines a circular cutting direction perpendicular to the axis. The base includes radially outer peripheral portions with a plurality of projections extending substantially tangent to the cutting direction. Each projection has opposite side surfaces and an end surface extending between the side surfaces. The projection has a first hole with a first width extending therethrough. The teeth correspond to the projections. Each tooth defines a socket with opposite inner surfaces. The projection is snugly received into the socket with the inner surfaces abutting the projection's side surfaces to removably secure the tooth to the base. The socket provides clearance for the end surface to allowing cutting forces to tend to tighten the projection in the socket. Each tooth has a second hole with a second width extending therethrough and aligned with the first hole in the corresponding projection. The second width is less than the first width. The pins are positioned in the holes as described above The apparatus may also include one or more of the other features discussed above. The apparatus of the invention has a number of advantages. The apparatus allows for quick and easy removal and installation of teeth on the cutter base. The apparatus is also relatively simple in structure and can be manufactured and maintained at a reasonable cost. The plural abutting surface arrangement of the invention enhances the stability of the tooth attachment to the cutter base and helps prevent movement of the tooth relative to the base. The loosely mounted pin provides further security against displacement and adds to the safety of the apparatus. The solid securing of the teeth to the cutter base in turn enhances the cutting effectiveness of the cutting apparatus and helps minimize wearing of the apparatus to further increases its cost effectiveness. The apparatus of the invention also has the advantage of being highly versatile. It can be used in a number of different types of applications and can accommodate different types of rotary cutters and various types of teeth."
9919290,Production of biochar absorbent from anaerobic digestate,2016-06-08,0,1,"This invention relates to the formation of a novel type of carbonized absorbent which is particularly suitable for removing sulfur contaminants from biogas. The carbonized absorbent after use has value in horticulture and agriculture. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION The development of non-petroleum sources of fuels is important in long term energy sustainability for most countries. One of these potential sources is from growing biomass and directly or indirectly using the fuel value. A criticism of this approach is that productive farm land may be displaced for these fuel crops. A less controversial source of energy is from wastes produced from agriculture. These materials include animal wastes, food wastes and crop residues. These materials may be used to produce methane using anaerobic digestion technology. Methane is the primary component of Natural Gas and may be substituted for Natural Gas in many applications. Methane when pure is a very clean burning fuel and can be used in vehicles, for heating and when used as the fuel for an engine in an electrical generator can produce electricity. Although there are many potential sources of wastes that could be anaerobically digested, most are not utilized at the present time because of unfavorable economic payback for small-scale systems. One of the significant issues is that the methane produced from anaerobic digestion is not pure but contains substantial amounts of carbon dioxide, an inert gas that dilutes the fuel value of the biogas, and contains contaminants such as sulfur compounds which have an unpleasant odor and cause significant corrosion and environmental emissions. Removal of these sulfur compounds is thus an important step in utilizing biogas. Many techniques are known for sulfur compound removal from gases. Reactions of the compounds with iron or zinc oxides with or without catalysts, are commonly used in large scale systems where disposal of the reacted products is not a significant issue or cost. Membrane technology is also used in large systems where there is sufficient expertise on staff to maintain the operation. For smaller scale systems water scrubbing and carbon absorption beds have been used. These systems are relatively easy to operate but also produce wastes which require disposal. These wastes typically have significant odor from hydrogen sulfide, a common sulfur compound produced during anaerobic digestion. Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic gas as well as being odorous which complicates the waste disposal. The production of charcoal from biomaterials is known. The focus was on producing a relatively clean burning solid, a fuel still used in barbecues and cooking stoves. The non-carbon elements are removed by heating the biomaterial in the absence of air and causing the volatilization of these species. More recently, there has been emphasis on converting as much of the biomaterial as possible to volatiles that have fuel value in a process known as pyrolysis. The residual carbon in both cases is somewhat porous but does not have high surface area. For high surface area carbon absorbents, chemical treatment is applied either before pyrolysis or afterwards with a second thermal treatment. This is often followed by a water wash to remove the activating chemical or the unwanted ash. For activated carbon production, two steps are used. The first produces the elemental carbon and the second activates the carbon. For producing activated carbons with specific absorption characteristics a third step is used in which specific catalytic chemicals are loaded onto the carbon surface. As should be clear, the cost of the activated carbon product increases with the extent of processing required for the final product. The use of waste materials as a source for activated carbon production is not commonly discussed because the carbon content is relatively low. In an article by Chen et al. (“Physical and Chemical Properties Study of the Activated Carbon made from Sewage Sludge 2002, Waste Management, 22, 755-760) they describe the use of sewage sludge; an anaerobically digested residue from municipal waste water treatment. Zinc chloride was required as an activating agent to enhance the surface area of the carbon product and the carbon content of the activated carbon was only 38.9% C by weight. The use of anaerobic sludge was also reported to be poor for activated carbon production by Tay et al. In a publication entitled “A Comparative Study of Anaerobically Digested and Undigested Sewage Sludges in Preparation of Activated Carbons” Chemosphere 2001, 44, 53-57, Tay et al. found that the undigested sludge produced an activated carbon with higher carbon content, lower ash content, higher surface area and better phenol adsorption characteristics. Thus the use of digested sludge is discouraged. Martin et al. (“Feasibility of Activated Carbon Production from Biological Sludge by Chemical Activation with ZnCl2 and H2SO4”, Environmental Science and Technology 1996, 17, 667-672) showed that optimal activation conditions produced a surface area of 257 m 2 /g with an ash content of 38% and a yield of 34%. This material had a contaminant removal of only 20% of that for a commercial activated carbon. Again this suggests that anaerobic sludge is a poor material for activated carbon production. In a patent on activated carbons from animal manures (U.S. Pat. No. 7,524,795 issued to Lima et al.) a process is described whereby carbonization of poultry manure followed by activation is used to produce an activated carbon with good metal ion adsorption characteristics. In this work, the starting material is raw poultry manure and not the anaerobic sludge digestate from poultry manure. A patent by Freel et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 7,199,080) describes how agricultural corn derivatives can be used to produce activated corn carbon. The process involves pyrolysing the corn derivatives to generate carbon char and then activating the char using a steam activation stage. An additional acid washing step is also suggested to remove ash from the product. This process differs from the current process by being a 2 step operation and by starting with raw corn derivatives and not the anaerobically digested solids. Bandosz et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,616) teach a process for removing acidic sulfur species from wet gas streams using a carbon absorption material which is produced from dewatered and dried sewage sludge. This process for sewage sludge preparation requires a drying operation, addition of mineral oil and a pyrolyzing step before the carbon material is ready for use as a adsorbent. It will be clear that the current process has advantages over the process of Bandosz et al. in that no mineral oil is required and the starting material is from anaerobic digestate solids and not restricted to sewage sludges. When used for removing acidic sulfur species from a gas stream Bandosz et al. rely on inorganic constituents from the pyrolyzed solids to convert hydrogen sulfide. In claim 3 the authors state that the hydrogen sulfide reacts with the inorganic constituents of the carbon to produce sulfur dioxide or elemental sulfur or salt forms thereof. In the current process for removing hydrogen sulfide from the gas stream there is insufficient inorganic content or chemicals to oxidize the hydrogen sulfide in the gas stream. For the current process a small percentage of oxygen or air should be added to the gas stream and is the oxidant which converts hydrogen sulfide to either sulfur or solid oxidized sulfur compounds. The use of a low percentage of air addition to the gas stream to be cleaned is particularly advantageous in maximizing the capacity of our carbon material for hydrogen sulfide removal. Without this addition, hydrogen sulfide is simply adsorbed and would be a problem for the used absorbent carbon disposal. This is also a problem for commercial activated carbons which can adsorb hydrogen sulfide but are not able to convert hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur or oxidized sulfur salts. The carbon material produced by the current process has the capability of converting essentially all of the hydrogen sulfide in the gas stream to sulfur or oxidized sulfur solids when the gas stream has a few percent air addition. The conversion of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur has a significant advantage in that the used absorbent carbon solids can then be utilized as a secondary value-added product in horticulture or agriculture. A patent by Beckler and Miller (U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,780) describes preparation of an activated carbon from a variety of carbonaceous sources and a thermal treatment, but in order to make this material suitable as an absorbent the material must be loaded with a phosphorous containing chemical. Clearly simple heat treatment is not sufficient for preparation of a carbon absorbent. A patent by Khalili et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,030,922) describes the preparation of an activated carbon from raw sludge but which requires chemically activating the dried sludge material before thermal treatment. It is clear that this chemical addition is required to produce a useful activated carbon. A patent by Piskorz et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,853,548) describes a two stage process for converting biosolids into fuels and for further heat treating the residual char to produce an activated carbon. In the first stage a temperature range of 390 to 450° C. was used. In the current process, the minimum temperature that was found to be effective was 500° C. A significant difference is that the Piskorz et al. patent has focused on using shredded biomass material rather than anaerobic digestate that is used in the current process. Microbial degradation of biomass in anaerobic digesters reduces the content of readily degradable organic species and hence would reduce the fuel value of the material. The second stage char treatment in the Piskorz et al. patent attempts to minimize the char volume by heating at a temperature of 700° C. for thermal annealing. In the current process, production of an absorbent carbon is the intended product and its minimization is not a desirable goal. In a patent by Abe et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,338,462), a method for decomposing water contaminants such as hydrogen peroxide, hydrazines, quaternary ammonium salts, organic acids and sulfur-containing compounds using an activated carbon is described. The hydrocarbon source material is a nitrogen-rich protein-containing sludge or a waste material comprising microbial proteins or biologically activated sludge. This material is first carbonized at a temperature of from 150° C. to 600° C. then activated at a temperature of from 700° C. to 1,100° C. in an inert gas or a reducing gas atmosphere consisting essentially of steam or gaseous carbon dioxide. It should be clear that the carbon sources and the end use applications are very different in the Abe et al. patent compared to the current application. The current process claims as a starting material acidogenic digestate which is the fibrous undigested cellulosic and lignin structures from anaerobic digestion of waste materials and not the biologically activated sludge material in the patent by Abe et al. The nitrogen content of our starting material would be poor for the purposes claimed in the patent by Abe et al. and the microbial proteins required by the patent by Abe et al. by would not have the structure required for producing our carbon absorbent. In a patent by Lewis (U.S. Pat. No. 4,122,036), a process for pyrolysing sewage sludge to produce activated carbon is described. The sewage sludge, which has a high moisture content is mixed with recycled hot char from a rotating kiln to produce a dry, free-flowing product which is fed into the kiln. It is clear that this patent does not teach the conditions required by the current technology for producing a carbon absorbent from anaerobic digestate. Thus, what is needed is an improved process for producing a carbon absorbent material from anaerobic digestate. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The current invention addresses a number of the problems as identified further above. More particularly, the invention uses a carbon source (acidogenic digestate) which is available from the anaerobic digestion process, thus avoiding environmental impact of purchasing and using activated carbons produced from coals and petroleum sources. More particularly, the inventors have developed a novel carbon absorbent material from anaerobic digestate which possesses enhanced activity for cleaning biogas and which creates a valued-added sulfur-containing byproduct after use. The potential for on-site generation has additional benefits in eliminating transportation green-house gas emissions. The carbon absorbent does not use or require chemical additives such as potassium hydroxide for pore development or activation. The carbon absorbent is produced in a single operation thus simplifying production. The carbon produced does not simply adsorb hydrogen sulfide from biogas but converts it to a useful form of sulfur and thus creates a useful byproduct rather than a noxious waste material. This property does not require treatment of the carbon with catalysts or chemical additives. As a result of the avoidance of chemical additions, the used carbon can be applied advantageously to horticulture and agricultural operation, thus eliminating any waste generation or disposal problems. The carbon adsorbent is created without the requirement for chemical additions for pore enhancement or surface activity and is an ecofriendly material for use in horticulture, agriculture or as a generic adsorbent for water or airborne contaminants. A further object of this invention is to provide a method to produce said carbon absorbent material from anaerobic digestate."
10231389,Stump cutter,2014-06-09,0,1,"The present disclosure relates to material reduction machines and methods of using the machines and manufacturing the machines. In particular, the methods and machines according to the present disclosure are adapted to be used to remove tree stumps. BACKGROUND Various methods and machines for removing stumps are known. Generally, the stump reduction devices and associated methods can be divided into two types: those where the engine is mounted to the frame of the device and those where the engine is mounted to the articulating arm, which supports the cutting or grinding tool. The engine remains at a constant angle relative to the ground during operation in the first type of machine, whereas the engine operating angle changes during operation in the second type of machine. Though the first type of machines provide an inherently compact layout, there are associated disadvantages relating to the second type of machines (e.g., possible engine failure due to excessive tilting and a higher than desired center of gravity). Examples of the first type of stump reduction machine are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,014,996, titled Control System for Stump Cutters assigned to Vermeer; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,011,124, titled Stump Grinder Having Automatic Reversing Feed Assembly assigned to Tramor. For example, of the second type of stump reduction machine see U.S. Pat. No. 6,026,781, titled Stump Cutter Safety System assigned to Rayco; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,230,770, titled Stump Chipper and Method for the Operation Thereof assigned to Vermeer-Holland. The present disclosure generally relates to the first type of stump reduction devices and related methods. The present disclosure provides a device and method that enable the efficient reduction of stumps. In one embodiment the stump removal methods and devices according to the present disclosure allow the operator to have a clear view of the work area during operation, and the ability to move the reduction device through a wide range of motion during operation. In one embodiment, the material reduction tool pivots relative to the chassis in the vertical plane about multiple pivot points. In some embodiments the device includes a retractable auxiliary control panel located at the end of the device opposite the material reduction tool. The control panel enables the operator to direct the movement of the device from the end of the device and thereby enable the device to maneuver through narrow spaces."
9668427,Battery-powered blower,2015-03-25,0,1,"The invention relates to a blower. More particularly, the invention relates to a battery-powered blower having a compact housing configuration that facilitates ease of user operation. Hand-held blowers are generally used for cleaning and/or removing light objects from surfaces, such as blowing away fallen leaves, and/or blowing away light debris, for example. Conventional hand-held blowers include an air outlet or tube, which extend in a generally outward direction from a frontal portion of the blower. During operation, the user selectively points the tube of the blower in the direction of the object(s) and presses a trigger. The trigger is connected to a switch, which activates a fan within the blower. Accordingly, the fan generates a relatively powerful force of air, which is exerted from the tube. By pointing the tube at the objects, the user is able to move the objects towards a selected location using the force of air. In general, most mobile blowers are either gas-powered or battery-powered and have a self-contained power source, allowing the blower to be transported without the restriction of a cord. Most gas-powered blowers include an internal combustion engine, a blower section driven by the engine, and a handle coupled to the body. One disadvantage of gas-powered blowers during operation is that they may release undesirable emissions into the environment, which is not environmentally favorable. In addition, gas-powered blowers require that the user maintain a constant supply of fuel for the engine. This requires repetitive refilling of the blower that may result in further negative environmental impact as a result of storage and/or spillage. Most battery-powered blowers use a high powered battery to provide power the blower. Such batteries may be between 18V to 80V, and may have between twenty to forty cells. One common problem with generally high powered batteries are that the batteries are relatively heavy in comparison to the overall weight of the blower. Also, the batteries are typically positioned at the rear of the blower and at a position, front to back that is vertically under the handle, which requires the user to exert high torque forces to turn the blower and overcome the forces created by its location. To optimize the user's experience, and reduce user fatigue during operation, it is important to balance the component masses within the blower. It is further important to reduce the torque forces required by the user to operate the blower during operation. The two heaviest components of the battery-powered blower are generally the battery and the motor. In most existing blowers, the battery is positioned at a rearward end of the blower. One disadvantage of positioning the battery near the rear of blower is that the distance from the handle (the suspension point) to the rear of the blower can be rather long. As such, the torque forces required to rotate the blower left to right, or vice-versa, during operation, are relatively high, requiring the user to exert an high amount of energy to operate the blower. Accordingly, blowers having such a configuration may be rather difficult for a user to operate over an extended period of time. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In light of the present need for a battery-powered blower with a compact configuration, a brief summary of various exemplary embodiments is presented. Some simplifications and omissions may be made in the following summary, which is intended to highlight and introduce some aspects of the various exemplary embodiments, but not to limit the scope of the invention. Detailed descriptions of a preferred exemplary embodiment adequate to allow those of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the inventive concepts will follow in later sections. The battery-powered blower includes a housing assembly including a first housing portion having a first inner surface, a second housing portion having a second inner surface, and connected to the first housing portion, and a third housing portion connected to the second portion, the third housing portion having a side outer surface configured to receive a battery. The battery powered blower further includes a battery mountable to the side outer surface of the third housing portion. The second housing portion in connection with the first housing portion forms an inner chamber therebetween. A fan is provided in the inner chamber to facilitate airflow through the housing assembly and out an outlet, and a motor is provided intermediate to the second housing portion and the third housing portion The battery-powered blower has a handle portion formed by connecting the second housing portion and the third housing portion. The second housing portion includes a first part of the handle portion and the third housing portion includes a second part of the handle portion. The battery is secured to the side of the third housing portion with a battery mount. Additionally, the motor is positioned laterally below the handle portion. An aperture is formed on the side of the first housing portion to facilitate air flow into the inner chamber. The battery-powered blower includes a foot that is removably attached to a lower portion of the housing assembly.

The top plate is circular in shape and is made of ALMAG 35, an aluminum and magnesium alloy. This plate has a flat top side and a centerhole extending from the top side through to a bottom side. Its bottom side is characterized by the presence of a slightly elevated circular rim circumscribing its outer perimeter. Moreover, its bottom side is characterized by a cylindrically shaped downwardly directed well therefrom co-extensive with a conically inclined recession downward which is in turn co-extensive with the flooring of the bottom side, the greatest diameter of which downwardly directed well is significantly less than that of the plate. The vertical axis of symmetry of the centerhole, the downwardly directed well and the plate itself is one and the same. Extending from and co-extensive with the outer walls of the recession and the well are each of three solid rectangularly shaped abutments that are likewise co-extensive. with the flooring of the bottom side the recession and the above-mentioned circular rim. Each abutment, the vertical axes of symmetry of each of which are 120.degree. removed from the vertical axes of symmetry of the two adjacent abutments, contains one of the abovementioned top plate through holes into which, one each respectively of the cylindrical pins have been press-fitted. A first rounded concave depression in the wall of the well is found just adjacent the left side of one abutment and a second rounded concave depression in the wall of the well is found just adjacent the right side of an adjacent abutment such that the depressions are 180.degree. removed from one another. At the base of the inner wall of the well there is also flooring of the bottom side within the center of which there is the centerhole. An arrow pointing in a clockwise direction is etched into this portion of the bottom side flooring. Finally, there is also a bottom plate. This bottom plate is made of ALMAG 35 alloy material as well. It is likewise circular in shape with an outer diameter equal to that of the top plate. The bottom side of the bottom plate has a flat external surface that is slightly recessed closer to the center of the bottom plate. Closer still to the center of the bottom plate there is to be found a hollow cylindrical elevation extending from bottom to top within the center of which there is a center hole extending from the floor of the hollow cylindrical elevation through to the top side of the bottom plate and about and co-extensive with the lower portion of which hollow cylindrical elevation there is a conically shaped elevation surfacewise co-extensive with the base surface of the top side. The top side of the bottom plate is characterized by the presence of a slightly elevated circular rim that circumscribes its outer perimeter. On the top outer surface of the cylindrical elevation in the bottom plate there is etched an arrow pointed in a counterclockwise direction. The top outer surface of the previously described conically shaped elevation of the bottom plate which is co-extensive with the outer wall of the bottom plate hollow cylindrical elevation is also co-extensive with each of three solid rectangularly shaped abutments jutting therefrom and reaching to the outer rim of the top side of the bottom plate. The long vertical central axis of symmetry of each abutment is 120.degree. removed from the long vertical central axes of the two adjacent abutments. In each of these abutments near the outer rim of the top plate is a closed hole just large enough to receive the bottom portions of each one of the abovementioned pins each holding a beveled blade when the top plate and bottom plate are assembled to one another. Extending from and co-extensive with the outer surface of the hollow cylindrically shaped elevation on the top side of the bottom plate and co-extensive with the top outer surface of the concave shaped elevation of the bottom plate are each of two rounded convex ridges 180.degree. removed from one another that each fit respectively snug into one of the abovementioned concave depressions in the bottom side of the top plate when the two plates are assembled together. When the two plates with pins and blades are assembled together, they are then fitted to the rotatory head of a motorized brush cutter stem, top side of top plate first and affixed thereto by way of an appropriate nut and bolt combination depending on the type of head to be fitted to. The instant invention so affixed to a rotatory head is then ready to serve as a heavy duty vegetation cutting tool. There is a virtually never ending need for the expeditious commercial forging of ski trails, snowmobile trails, cross-country trails, horse trails and commercial clearing of power line rights-of-way and golf courses throughout the country. Such undertakings often prove to be laborious, time-consuming and relatively expensive. The instant invention however serves to greatly minimize such labor, time and cost. To begin with, one of the major problems with respect to the utilization of any currently used brushcutting device is the one wherein invariably it proves virtually impossible to cut level to ground. Consequently, after cutting, there are nevertheless vestiges of stumps still left standing that can prove to be problematic with respect to vehicular tires or to ski units after cutting. The instant invention unlike all of the prior art however permits cutting right level to ground rather than only to a level of two inches or so above ground such that therefore such problems associated with stump vestiges are totally eliminated. Additionally, the plates of the instant invention being made of ALMAG 35, an alloy of aluminum and magnesium make for a much lighter cutting tool to be fitted to the head of a brush cutting stem unit. Ease of use by a workman is thus greatly facilitated. The instant invention consisting of two plates, one with three press fitted pins and three freely rotatable beveled blades is extremely easy to assemble. This feature together with its relatively light weight as well as its facility for absorbing the shock of cutting and thereby greatly reducing any flow of cutting shock up the stem of a brush cutter renders the instant invention inherently much more user friendly than any of the various currently in vogue cutting tools utilized for such clearing. Also, the instant invention is amenable to being fitted to a counterclockwise turning rotatory head or to one that turns clockwise simply by fitting its three blade components to its pin components during assembly such that blade beveled ends face in the direction of rotation of the head. If a user cuts right to left when utilizing a cutter with a counterclockwise turning head, he or she will avoid kickback when hitting a tree, once again due to the swivel capability of each of the invention's blade components held by its press fitted pins. This feature of swivelability about pins permits a simple collapsing inward of blades upon impact with rocks thereby alleviating problems associated with rock impact shock. Also, the plate components are rust proof and shatterproof under all conditions of cutting thereby rendering the instant invention eminently more durable and inherently much safer than any of the cutting tools currently in use for such heavy brush and stump cutting purposes in areas where lots of rocks are located. Finally, unlike any other cutting tool available for clearing heavy, thick brush and small tree stumps during the course of a significant commercial undertaking, deformation with use and wear to the extent it might ever occur at all occurs only uniformly throughout the whole tool by virtue of the manner in which the two plates fit together when assembled. Also, blades of varying length and hardness can be utilized in conjunction with the plates and pins. Short, relatively thick blades are particularly useful to cut small tree stumps flush to the level of ground. Longer not quite so thick blades serve to cut heavy clumps of grass and weeks flush to the level of ground. Respectfully submitted, the instant invention in view of its above-described user and rock friendly features that enable heavy vegetation cutting and clearing to be undertaken on the average 27 percent faster on the basis of studies conducted by your inventor comparing its capabilities to other cutting heads currently in use render it indeed not only new, useful and unique but indeed virtually revolutionary in the art of brush cutting tools."

4326874,Process and apparatus for preparing compostable material,1979-03-12,0,1,"This invention relates to a process and apparatus for preparing compostable material on a storage surface comprising a displaceable loading bridge spanning the storage surface at a distance above it, and a delivery member arranged on said bridge facing said storage surface and connected to at least one conveyor means which brings the material to said member. Ordinarily, compostable material is piled on very large storage surfaces to form compost heaps where it is stored--possibly aerated by ditches--for a relatively long period of time. For the forming of such compost heaps portal frames are known which extend over the storage surface and bear at least one conveyor belt. The latter charges the material fed to it via a loading chute to a drop chute which extends downward in lance shape and from which the compost drops out in part in very large lumps and forms individual conical heaps; these conical heaps produce an undulated surface for the finished compost pile; if it is desired to eliminate this undulation, special smoothing work must be carried out with the use of expensive labor. A further deficiency has been found in that so-called compost heaps or similar piles are repeatedly turned over or aerated during their existence. For the bottom aerating of such heaps it is known to establish a tunnel system of profiled shapes on the ground before they are produced, the tunnel system forming an air feed system for the finished heap; even after removing the profiled shapes out of the heap a loosened zone remains. This method has the disadvantage that both in the above procedure and in the case of ditches which are dug into the heap only given edge regions are aerated and between them columns of compacted compost or the like remain. Not least of all, this leads to an excessively malodorous heap. Another problem resides in the relatively large amount of space required. It has been attempted to form the waste materials into compacts in order thereby to reduce by almost two-thirds the space required by the loose heap. It is also believed that compacted waste materials cause less annoyance by odor. For this purpose there are employed ordinary brick presses from which the compacts are removed in a separation operation and loaded onto pallets. The latter are carried by forklift trucks to a piling station and in another operation a dense heap of compacts placed one upon the other is established there. In view of the foregoing, an object of the invention is to provide an apparatus and method of the aforementioned type by means of which it is possible to produce heaps which are well aerated in completely automatic fashion. These heaps take up relatively little area--for a given volume--and are not detrimental to the environment. Furthermore, a high efficiency of the system is desired. In order to achieve this object, a thin layer of compost material of a height of, for instance, 40 mm is produced from strips which are placed with their longitudinal edges alongside each other and at least one additional layer of this type is placed on top; in this connection during the laying of the layer or layers hard substances are removed from the compost material by the accelerating particles of material and separating from each other components having good and poor rebound properties. In order to be able to produce a compost heap in this manner, a belt-shaped conveyor member which extends over the storage surface is provided approximately horizontally as a delivery member, it being movable, for instance, parallel to the storage surface as well as perpendicular or at an angle thereto. Furthermore, it has proven favorable to provide on the conveyor or loading bridge a milling or similar loosening member which is movable at least vertically with respect to and/or with same--and preferably furthermore variable in position along the loading bridge and with it--and/or at least one pressing device with movable pressing channels or the like for the production of compacts. In this way several layers can be jointly loosened or milled stepwise transverse to the direction of the laying thereof or laid compacted--and possibly thereupon milled. It lies within the scope of the invention for the compost material to be conducted as loose material to a piling station and shaped there into compacts and the compacts then stacked directly thereafter is spaced relation from each other. In this connection the defecation sludge, as deposition sludge of more than 80%, and preferably more than 90%--water content, is to be mixed with crushed portions of refuse and then compacted at the piling station. In accordance with another feature of the invention, the compacts are produced with expression of liquid, which is used for the wetting of compacts which have already been stacked. By this process, several operations are saved and a simplified depositing of the compressed waste material is achieved. An improvement in the pressing process can furthermore be obtained in the manner that in accordance with the invention the waste material prior to the pressing is subjected to vibration. In order to obtain improved drying, the compacts in accordance with the invention are piled with spaces between each other so as to form air channels and allow air to flow at least on two of their outer surfaces. A particularly effective aerating or working of the heap of compostable material is obtained by blowing the air into the compost heap by means of aeration lances introduced at least vertically from the surface of the heap and at the same time a system of aeration channels or the like is produced by said aeration lances. The compost heap is traversed in checkerboard fashion, preferably completely automatically controlled, in its horizontal direction and/or vertical direction and subjected to blast an air. In accordance with another feature of the invention, the temperature and/or the strength of the heap is determined in checkerboard fashion in its horizontal direction and/or vertical direction; the values thus obtained are introduced into a computer which, for instance, after a comparison of the actual values with preestablished desired values, sends pulses to control members for the feeding of the blast of air. This feed can be varied both in respect of its quantity and pressure, which permits regulating the consistency heap, without requiring the need for ordinary workers. The system in accordance with the invention can operate completely automatically. The aerating of compost heaps can be effected in economical manner if gases given off by the heap are returned at least in part to the heap for the aeration thereof. In this connection, said gases should be cleaned in a circuit through which they pass and possibly fed in part to a so-called after-retting heap. For this purpose an exhaust system for gases is provided above a heap of compostable material and is connected with an aeration system for the heap. The exhaust device is connected to at least one fan or blower the discharge end of which conducts the air or gas to the aeration system of the heap. In accordance with another feature of the invention, liquid is removed from the gases in a condensate separator before they are returned to the heap, and these liquids can be used economically to spray the surface of the heap. In order to facilitate the aeration of the heap, it has in accordance with the invention approximately vertical ventilation channels which are drilled into the heap and into which the gases are fed through a system of pipes in the supporting surface. By the circuit described, an emanation-free composting is obtained without the use of special earth filters; the circuit permits optimal utilization of the substances and heat stored in the off-gases as well as, as a whole, an economical working of the compost. This method is particularly favorable in the case of heaps which consist of thin layers which are laid one after the other and jointly aerated. Such heaps can be aerated in relatively favorable manner and accordingly it is more difficult for unpleasant odor-forming substances to develop as compared to the case of traditional compost heaps. The system which is particularly suitable for carrying out the aeration in accordance with the invention is characterized by a lifting device which extends at least partially over the surface of the compost heap and on which at least one lance-like aeration member is movably arranged and connected with at least one air feed line. It has proven particularly favorable to construct the aeration lance so that its length can be varied, for instance to make the tip of the aeration lance telescopically extractable from a tubular body. In this case, the tubular body is seated in fixed position--possibly pivotably, on the lifting device: from the tubular body the tip is movable downward into the heap up to a height determined by the control apparatus, at which height the aeration process then commences therein. For this purpose there is used at least one blast nozzle arranged at the tip of the lance, which nozzle may possibly in accordance with the invention be concealed upon the lowering of the aeration lance behind protection screens and brought into extended position when the intended place of aeration is reached. It has been found favorable to provide, at least in the region of the tip of the lance, temperature sensors or pressure-measuring capsules in order to be able to use the aeration lance simultaneously for the above-described observation of the temperature and strength of the heap. The tip of the lance may also be provided with a sampling device. It may be of importance, depending on the measured temperature of the heap, to spray the surface of the latter with water or the like, for which purpose spray members for the liquid are arranged at least on the aeration lance; further spray members can be connected directly with the lift device, for instance a conveyor or loading bridge. In accordance with another feature of the invention, it is possible, due to the control and verification apparatus, to control the said temperature sensors, pressure-measuring capsules and spray or blast members so that the points of working, as seen in top view on the heap, form a checkerboard of selectable width of square and also are predeterminable in height, which leads to a three-dimensional coordinate system. Another advantage of the apparatus of the invention is that as a result of the insertion of the aeration lances into the heap hollow spaces are produced which permit further aeration even after the removal of the aeration lances. The delivery element is preferably constructed as a rake-type chain conveyor with rake flights or the like traveling around an approximately horizontally directed screen bottom and the delivery element is connected by an intermediate conveyor of variable length to the feed means; between the rake chain conveyor or a corresponding conveyor element and the feed means there is arranged, in accordance with the invention, within the path of movement of the compost material, a member for the accelerating of particles. As a result of these measures it is now possible to effect cleaning of the compost simultaneously with the depositing of the layers and to do this without any great expense. The separation between the hard substances and the finer compost material is effected upon acceleration by the bucket wheel; the hard particles of material thrown against the short conveyor rebound upwards against the baffle plate and are deflected by the latter onto a separating conveyor while the softer parts of compost are carried upward by the short conveyor and removed via its outlet end located on the top. If the short conveyor, which is preferably provided with steel parts, is adjustable in its inclination, the boundary layer between hard substances and softer particles of material can be controlled as desired. In accordance with another feature of the invention, between the telescope shaft or intermediate conveyor adjoining said steel conveyor belt on the one hand and the horizontal rake conveyor on the other hand there is arranged at least one blocking member which forms a switch in the path of conveyance; in one end position the compost flows to the rake conveyor while in the other end position of the blocking member the compost drops past the rake conveyor onto a bottom part arranged below it in accordance with the invention. The compost is conducted to the latter, in particular, when a relatively coarse compost is to be laid this compost is pushed over one edge of the bottom part and the surface of the layer thus produced increases the length of the slide path for the following particles. Each edge of the bottom part defines a bottom opening of the conveyor device which extends below the rake type chain conveyor through which the compost leaving the openings of the rake type chain conveyor or of the screen bottom can fall. The bottom recess thus defines the size of the conical pile produced the surface of which is smoothed by a scraping edge of the conveyor device. Said scraping edge can be a fixed part of the conveyor or loading bridge but it has proven favorable to make the scraping edge itself movable, for instance with the interposition of telescopic supports or the like. In accordance with another feature of the invention, the apparatus is provided with hydraulically or pneumatically movable and electronically controlled telescopic columns which permit relative movement between the loading bridge on the one hand and the actual conveyor device and/or the milling mechanism on the other hand. It furthermore lies within the scope of the invention for the conveyor device together with the milling mechanism and the additional aeration lances to form a compact unit whose individual parts can be controlled, even independently of each other. With the compact system of the invention there can be effected a milling controlled in a coordinate system, a moistening of the heap of compost or other compostable material as well as the very effective aeration by the lances, the latter however only when the conveyor bridge is at a standstill. The positive aeration is controlled by an electronic coordinate control so that every point of the heap is aerated. There is the further advantage that due to the insertion of the air lances, hollow spaces or conduits are produced which form an aeration system after the removal of the lances. The pressing device in accordance with the invention has movable press channels or the like for the production of compacts, each press channel being developed as stack member for the compacts. In this connection, the belt-like conveyor element should extend over the place of stacking and said element be connected with the movable pressing device. The pressing device should be able to be moved along the conveyor bridge and at right angles to it, which is effected by means of lift members to which the pressing device is fastened and by means of which it is moved in controllable manner between the conveyor bridge and the surface of the place of stacking. Furthermore, it has been found to be particularly advantageous to provide below the bottom of the stacking station air channels, preferably in the form of a network, which conducts the air to the stacked compacts. In this connection, the surface at the stacking station is perforated in accordance with the invention so that the air can rise in vertical spaces remaining between the individual piles of the compacts. It has proven particularly favorable to provide between the press channel and the associated conveyor element at least one bunker which receives the waste material delivered by the conveyor element of the conveyor bridge and forwards it in controlled manner to the press channel. The bottom of the bunker is preferably constructed as a conveyor belt with which there is associated, at the outlet of the bunker, a dosaging element in order to assure a controlled delivery of the waste material into the individual press channels. The press channel is placed in vibration before the pressing process as well as during the pressing process by means of a vibration generator so as to accelerate the compacting of the compact. In this connection any liquid which may emerge is collected below the press channel and fed to spray nozzles. These nozzles are so arranged that they wet the compacts which have already been stacked by means of the liquid which has been collected. The press channel and/or pressing device are controllable for horizontal displacement after each pressing process in order to simplify the depositing of the resultant compact on the surface at the stacking station or on another compact. In addition to or instead of the movability of pressing device or pressing channel, the bottom and/or wall of the pressing channel can be made displaceable or swingable in the region of the outlet so that the compact can readily slide out. The pressing device is preferably controlled completely automatically in the manner that for the stacking of the compacts in columns it is moved stepwise approximately by the height of the compacts or even moved in different forms of so-called brick patterns in order to form the piles of compacts. In order to achieve a favorable efficiency of the apparatus, a rotary drum is provided in front of the storage surface which drum has a mixing section for rubbish and sludge with inserts which effect a repeated reversal in direction of the material being mixed, a comminuting section in the form of a ball mill with walls having screening sections and a jacket surrounding the screen surfaces on their outer surface remote from the axis of the drum. It has furthermore been found favorable to arrange a screen drum behind the ball mill as seen in the direction of conveyance and to connect the fine-material outlet thereof with the outer space of the ball mill. Further advantages, features and details of the invention will become evident from the following description of preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the drawings."
7584542,Trimmer,2003-11-03,0,1,"This invention relates to a grass trimming device which is capable of being switched between at least two alternative configurations which are suitable for grass trimming and edge trimming respectively. A known grass trimming device (trimmer) comprises a cutting head mounted at one end of a shaft, an operator handle being positioned at the other end of the shaft. The cutting head includes a cutter constituted by a rotatable blade or a rotatable flexible cutting line. The cutting head can be moved relative to the shaft, to position the cutter generally horizontal for grass trimming and generally vertical for edge trimming. DE-A-3 010 092 describes a known trimmer of this type, the trimmer having a handle that can be moved from a first socket on the cutting head to a second socket on the same head, in order to shift the cutting head from a configuration in which the cutter plane is horizontal for grass trimming to a configuration in which the cutter is vertical for edge trimming. In both configurations of the device, a shaft fitted to the handle is directed upwardly towards the operator. This device suffers from the drawback that changing from one function to the other is difficult, because it is necessary to release and then remove the handle from one socket, and then replace it and lock it into position in the second socket. EP-A-0 005 540 shows a similar device where the handle is pivotally adjustable in a plane which is perpendicular to the cutting plane. Changing the configuration of this device requires releasing a handle catch, turning the handle through 180°, releasing the cutting head, and then adjusting it to the required angle. Moreover, a relatively complex arrangement of parts is necessary to achieve the changeover. This results in considerable expense, and a risk that the components, which are not totally covered may be damaged by the ingress of dirt and debris. EP-A-0 296 789 describes a trimmer in which the shaft includes a coupling section to which the cutting head is pivotally attached. The cutting head includes a surface defining a parting plane at which plane the coupling section is coupled to the cutting head. The parting plane, extends laterally with respect to the shaft, so that relative movement at the parting plane between the coupling section and the cutting head is about an axis which is perpendicular to the parting plane and obliquely to the shaft, so that relative movement between the coupling section and the cutting head about the parting plane positions the cutter in grass trimming and edge trimming configurations. Each of the trimmers described above is relatively easy to operate when in the trimming configuration. However, when in the edging configuration, the user must stand at right-angles to the edge of a lawn being trimmed, and move sideways along that edge as trimming progresses. This is disadvantageous, in that it is difficult to align the cutter accurately with the edge of the lawn (owing to the eye of the user not being in alignment with the lawn edge), and this can lead to a poor edging performance. Moreover, each of the known trimmers requires a relatively complex series of operations to convert between trimming and edging configurations. The aim of the invention is to provide a trimmer having improved edging capabilities. The present invention provides a trimmer comprising a cutting head housing a cutter means, and an elongate shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being connected to the shaft by connection means permitting the cutting head to be positioned with its cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical without disconnecting the cutting head and the shaft, the shaft having a hand-grippable portion at a position remote from the cutting head, the arrangement being such that the line joining a point within the hand-grippable portion and the connection means is substantially parallel to plane of rotation of the cutter means when the cutter means is substantially vertical. Preferably, the connection means is such that the cutting head is movable between positions in which its cutter means is substantially horizontal and substantially vertical in a single movement. Advantageously, the connection means is such that the cutter means is movable between the substantially horizontal position and the substantially vertical position by an effective rotation of the cutting head relative to the handle of 120° in one direction or 240° in the other direction. Preferably, the connection means is constituted by a rotatable joint. In this case, the rotatable joint is such that the cutting head is movable between positions in which its cutter means is substantially horizontal and substantially vertical about a single axis. In a preferred embodiment, the axis of rotation of the rotatable joint lies substantially at 35.5° to the plane of rotation of the cutter means, and lies substantially at 35.5° to the horizontal when the cutting head is positioned with the cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical. Connection means of this nature enables the cutting head to be moved between a trimming mode (in which the cutter means is substantially horizontal) and an edging mode (in which the cutter means is substantially vertical) by a simple rotation of the cutting head relative to the shaft. A particular advantage of this connection means is that the elongate shaft is generally aligned with a lawn edge in the edging mode, so that the user can carry out an edging operation when positioned behind the cutting head and moving forwards (or backwards) along the edge portion of the lawn. Advantageously, the rotatable joint is constituted by a ball-and-socket joint. Preferably, the ball is fixed to the cutting head, and the socket is defined by a generally spherical socket portion formed at the end of the shaft remote from the hand-grippable portion. The trimmer may further comprise a motor for driving the cutter means. Conveniently, the cutter means is rotatable, and the drive engagement between the motor and the cutter means is a rotatable drive engagement. Preferably, the motor is housed within the ball, and is an electric motor. Preferably, a rotatable cutter line constitutes the cutter means, In a preferred embodiment, the trimmer further comprises a wheel rotatably mounted on the cutting head. The axis of rotation of the wheel may be substantially coincident with the axis of rotation of the cutter means. Advantageously, the radius of the wheel is of the order of, but slightly less than, the effective radius of the cutter means. The invention also provides a cutting head housing a cutter means, and a shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being adjustably mounted with respect to the shaft by connection means enabling the cutter means to be moved between substantially vertical and substantially horizontal positions by adjusting the position of the cutting head relative to the shaft by an effective rotation of 120° in one direction or 240° in the other direction. The invention further provides a cutting head housing a cutter means, and a shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being rotatably mounted with respect to the shaft by means of a rotatable joint whose axis of rotation lies substantially at 45° to the plane rotation of the cutter means, and lies substantially at 45° to the horizontal when the cutting head is positioned with its cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical."
5433759,Underground system for treating soil,1994-01-05,0,1,"This invention relates to apparatus for treating turf and the subsoil under the turf to maintain the turf and subsoil. The term turf as herein used refers to the upper layer of earth that is exposed to ambient air. The turf may be bare of vegetation or support grass or the like. The term subsoil or subsoil profile as herein used refers to one or more soil layers that are situated immediately below the turf and may be made up of natural or prepared layers of various constituents such as sand, gravel, and mixes containing organic and other substances that might promote the growth and well being of plant life. In many soil related environments, it is important to maintain the soil and turf temperature at a desired level. One such application involves putting greens found on golf courses. The special grasses used in the construction of these greens are typically temperature sensitive and some grasses cannot tolerate even relatively small changes in temperatures once beyond their adaptation range. Bent grasses used on some courses in southern states are native to more northern climates and cannot tolerate high summer time temperatures and humidities. As a consequence, the grass can quickly wilt if special precautions are not taken to protect it. One such procedure is to move air over the green surface using rather large and noisy electric fans. Needless to say, the equipment involved is extremely expensive to both procure and operate and detracts from the game itself. Constant watering and syringing of the grass is also employed, however, this procedure is expensive, time consuming and not wholly satisfactory due to increase of disease potential. Heating greens has proven to be an even greater problem. There are also other applications where it is important to maintain soil and turf temperatures within a desired range. One such application relates to brooder houses for poultry where the poultry is raised on bare turf. Poultry are susceptible to many diseases and are generally intolerant to climatic changes. Keeping the soil of these brooder houses at a healthy temperature has long been a problem. Here again, different types of above and below ground heating systems have been tried with varying degrees of success. It is a primary object of this invention to improve systems for treating soil and turf. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an underground system for heating and cooling soil and subsoil profiles. A still further object of the present invention is to improve underground systems for treating golf course putting greens. It is a still further object of the present invention to oxygenate the soil profile. Another object of the present invention is to improve the health of grass areas found on golf courses and outdoor playing fields. Yet another object of the present invention is to retrofit existing golf course greens with a system for treating the soil of the green. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a system for utilizing energy from the earth to heat or cool specific soil regions. While another object of the present invention is to provide an underground heating and cooling system for a golf course green that has the further capability of quickly drawing excess water from the soil of the green. A further object of the present invention is to provide an underground system for heating and cooling a grassy area that has the further ability of providing nourishment to the grass. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a system for heating and cooling a golf course green that will not impede play on or around the green. Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide underground heating and cooling to a golf green using a ground source heat exchanger. Another object of the present invention is to provide an underground system for heating and cooling a golf green that can be retrofitted to an existing green drainage system."
7563302,Apparatus and method for manure reclamation,2005-06-14,0,1,"The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for manure reclamation, and more particularly to manure reclamation that integrates a manure treatment system, and a custom fertilizer production system. In the northern parts of the United States, dairy cattle are confined in dairy farms and fed with phosphate-rich feed during the long winter periods. During this long period of confinement, that lasts from the early fall until the early spring, the “in barn” produced manure accumulates in the farm. Similarly, poultry-based farms produce different but sometimes more concentrated manure. The concentrated manure from the dairy farms, the poultry farms or any other type of animal farms is usually stored outside of the barn in a manure pit and then spread over the fields in the spring. Government agencies have recommended this practice of spreading of manure over fields during spring as a method of disposing of agricultural waste while fertilizing the ground. This practice has led to purchase, maintenance and paying of taxes on land that is kept primarily for manure overspread, which is a major financial burden for the farmers. Manure is composed of 96% water and of 4% solid nutrient materials. In other words, unprocessed manure is a very dilute source of fertilizing nutrients. Furthermore, studies have shown that phosphorous and other nutrients present in manure are water soluble, which causes these nutrients to be washed out by rain or snow. Therefore one ton of manure yields only 7 to 10 pounds of nutrients to the ground. Spreading of manure is not allowed during the winter months on top of snow to prevent runoff of phosphates and other contaminants to nearby rivers, lakes and other groundwater systems with the melting of the snow. However, the process of spreading of the concentrated manure in the spring still causes excess runoff of phosphates and other contaminants to nearby rivers, lakes and other groundwater systems. Agricultural runoff, rich in nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen has been linked to toxic microorganisms. These microorganisms are known to kill and/or cause diseases in fish and other animals and pose a serious health risk to humans. Typical dairy manure contains nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) at a ratio of 3 to 1. The optimum fertilizer ratio of N:P for growing corn is 8 to 1. Therefore, the farmer has to spread in addition to the manure a large amount of urea for adding nitrogen in order to generate the required 8 to 1 ratio of N:P in the ground. Other plants require different ratios of N:P and the amount and type of additives need to be modified accordingly. This process of adding and spreading urea or other additives increases both the labor and material cost of farming and requires that the farmer goes out in the fields several times during the year. As was mentioned above, phosphorus is water soluble which leads to phosphorus being washed out from the manure pit and soil by rain and carried to rivers, lakes and other groundwater systems, thereby causing pollution and reducing the fertilizing value of the manure. Also, nitrogen evaporates from the manure pit as ammonia which generates undesirable odors and causes the concentration of insects and vermin, while again reducing the fertilizing value of the manure. Several prior art methods have been suggested for treating manure on the barn site and for converting manure to fertilizer. However, most of the prior art methods are not efficient, not scalable, or not economical and may require the addition of other chemicals for producing fertilizer. Accordingly, there is a need for an efficient, scalable, economically viable and environmentally friendly process for treating manure and for producing stable custom fertilizer without the need to add chemicals. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In general, in one aspect, the invention features a method for processing liquid manure that includes transferring the liquid manure among a plurality of processing stations in a predetermined sequence starting at an input station and ending at an output station.

6923888,Process for recovering organic acids from bleaching liquors,2001-02-27,0,1,"The invention relates to pulping processes based on organic acids and particularly to the recovery of organic acids from bleaching liquors, such as alkaline filtrates and washing filtrates, obtained from bleaching or from stages closely associated with bleaching. At the same time, the process of the invention produces a valuable fertilizer by-product. The invention further relates to recycling of bleaching liquors. The invention is applicable in pulping processes based on organic acids, especially formic acid and/or acetic acid, wherein herbaceous plants or trees are used as raw material. The invention is also applicable in pulping processes employing other solvents and reagents. Organic acids are produced in all pulping processes, but their utilization remains unsolved. In conventional processes, organic acids are usually harmful and consume the alkali used in the processes. Organic acids are formed not only in cooking, evaporation and drying of lignin, but also in bleaching. In alkaline hydrogen peroxide and/or oxygen/hydrogen peroxide bleaching, formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid and glycolic acid are typically produced. These acids react in the bleaching with alkalis to corresponding alkali metal salts. They add to the load of organic matter (COD) in waste waters and to the use of chemicals in water purification plants. The same problem appears in closed bleaching, because the salts do not evaporate, but remain in the concentrate. The treatment of the concentrate therefore continues to be an environmental and waste water issue. FI patent publications 103 588 (WO 96/35013) and 103 899 (WO 98/20198) disclose processes based on formic acid which make use of the acids formed in cooking, evaporation and drying of lignin, the organic acids thereby formed being advantageous in view of process economy because they save cooking chemicals. Organic acids are formed as a result of hydrolysis reactions of hemicellulose and lignin and from acetyl groups of plants. In highly acid concentrations, esters are also produced. Esters may be converted back to organic acids, as described in FI patent application 973474 (WO 99/10595). However, these processes do not take advantage of the organic acids formed in the bleaching; on the contrary, the acids are lost in the alkaline bleaching, because they react immediately with the sodium hydroxide used in the bleaching, whereby salts are formed. Such salts are undesirable also in conventional processes because they get into waste waters. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved process based on organic acids for preparing pulp from herbaceous plants and trees in a manner which allows also the organic acids included in the bleaching liquors to be utilized. This allows any environmental and waste water problems involved in organic acids to be avoided and all the chemicals used in the process to be either returned to the process or utilized as commercial products. The process operates with a completely closed chemical and water cycle. The invention relates to a process for treating bleaching liquors in pulping processes based on an organic acid/organic acids. The process comprises cooking and bleaching of pulp in a manner known per se. The cooking is carried out using an organic acid, typically formic acid or acetic acid, a combination thereof, or a mixture comprising both acids or one of them. The bleaching is carried out using chlorine-free bleaching processes known per se. The raw material of the pulp comprises herbaceous plants or trees. The invention is based on the idea of (a) adding inorganic acid, such as nitric acid, phosphoric acid and/or sulphuric acid, to bleaching liquor obtained from bleaching or a stage closely associated with bleaching, in order to release organic acids contained in the bleaching liquor into the bleaching liquor; (b) separating the organic acids from the bleaching liquor and recycling the same to cooking to be used as cooking chemicals; and (c) recovering the nitrogen-, phosphor- and/or sulphur-containing product thus obtained, from which organic acids have been separated, to be used as a fertilizer or as raw material for a fertilizer. In this context, the expression “bleaching liquor obtained from bleaching or a stage closely associated with bleaching” refers to a liquor obtained from the actual bleaching stages, pre-bleaching stages or pulp screening, or from any washing stages associated with these, after the pulp itself has been separated. The term “bleaching filtrate” means any bleaching liquor obtained from a stage associated with the actual bleaching, for example a bleaching liquor obtained in connection with alkaline hydrogen peroxide bleaching from the alkaline extraction stage or peroxide stage after the separation of pulp. Before stage (a), the bleaching liquor may be concentrated, typically by first filtering and then evaporating it to a dry matter content of 10 to 75%, for example. The evaporated water is used as process water. The bleaching liquor may, however, also be used in a non-concentrated form. The silicon compounds in herbaceous plants may be precipitated before stage (a) by adjusting the pH of the bleaching liquor to a range of 7 to 9. This may be carried out using the same inorganic acid as in stage (a), i.e. nitric acid, phosphoric acid and/or sulphuric acid. The precipitated silicon compounds are separated and the bleaching liquor obtained is concentrated, typically by evaporating it to a dry matter content of 10 to 75%. The evaporated water is used as process water. The separation of the silicon compounds before the evaporation improves the evaporation conditions. At the same time, the content of formiate and acetate salts in the concentrate increases, which allows as high acid concentrations in stage (a) as possible to be ensured. However, a non-concentrated bleaching liquor may also be used. The inorganic acid used in stage (a) of the process of the invention is selected on the basis of the desired nutrient content of the fertilizer by-product to be obtained. If a nitrogen-containing fertilizer is to be obtained, nitric acid is used, if a phosphor-containing fertilizer is to be obtained, phosphoric acid is used, and if a sulphur-containing fertilizer is to be obtained, sulphuric acid is used. The pH range of the filtrate leaving the alkaline bleaching stage is typically 7 to 11.5 (when the bleaching is carried out for example as an alkaline hydrogen peroxide bleaching where potassium hydroxide is used as the alkali). In stage (a) of the process of the invention, inorganic acid is added to the bleaching liquor to reduce its pH to a level where organic acids are released for example from their esters or salts to the bleaching liquor. In an industrial implementation of the process, the inorganic acid added in stage (a) is as concentrated as possible to minimize the amount of water supplied together with the acid. The concentration of the acid may be for example 60 to 95%, although less concentrated acids can also be used in the present invention. The amount of the inorganic acid to be added is such that the pH range of the bleaching liquor is typically 0 to 6, preferably 0 to 3. To obtain a nitrogen-containing fertilizer, nitric acid alone is used for adjusting the pH of the bleaching liquor to the range of 0 to 6, preferably 0 to 3. A fertilizer containing nitrogen and phosphor can be obtained for example by adding first phosphoric acid to provide a neutral pH, i.e. of about 7 to 8. Then, nitric acid is added to provide the pH of about 0 to 6, preferably 0 to 3. When an inorganic acid is used to acidify the bleaching liquor in stage (a) of the process of the invention, the formiates and acetates contained in the bleaching liquor are released and corresponding organic acids, i.e. formic acid and acetic acid, are formed. The formiates and acetates formed from the washing losses of pulp react similarly, organic acids (formic acid and acetic acid) being thereby formed into the solution. In other words, organic acids are released using inorganic acids which are stronger than the organic ones, inorganic salts being formed at the same time. As mentioned above, the acids in question are particularly acids producing salts that can be used as fertilizers. The organic acids released into the bleaching liquor are separated from it, typically by means of evaporation or extraction and/or drying, which allows the inorganic salts to separate at the same time by crystallizing. The evaporation may be carried out using a thin film evaporator/drier, for example. The organic acids are then usually concentrated by distillation to provide the desired acid concentration after which they are recycled to cooking to be used as a cooking acid and/or sold as a commercial product. It has been observed that the amounts of organic acids thus recovered are significant with regard to the total amount of chemicals needed. The total amount of formic acid, acetic acid and oxalic acid that can be separated from the bleaching liquor may be as much as 6 to 8% (60-80 kg per 1000 kg) of dry pulp. The total amount of make-up cooking chemicals is typically 5 to 10% (50-100 kg per 1000 kg) of pulp. The nitrogen-, phosphor- and/or sulphur-containing product obtained from stage (b), from which organic acids have been separated, is recovered in stage (c) to be used as a fertilizer or as raw material for a fertilizer. The product obtained from stage (c) is usually also concentrated. The concentration is typically carried out by evaporation, drying and/or crystallization to a dry matter content of 80 to 100%, for example. The final fertilizer is typically produced for example by granulating the nitrogen-, phosphor- and/or sulphur-containing product thus obtained to convert it into a solid form suitable to be used as a fertilizer. The nutrient value of the fertilizer may be further increased if the bleaching that produces the bleaching liquor in stage (a) is carried out by using a bleaching sequence comprising alkaline stages and, particularly, by using potassium hydroxide as the alkali, as it will produce potassium, which is most important for plants, into the bleaching liquor. The bleaching liquor, typically a bleaching filtrate, used as the starting material in stage (a) originates therefore preferably from a bleaching sequence containing alkaline stages. The bleaching is typically an alkaline hydrogen peroxide bleaching. The bleaching sequence may also comprise an oxygen phase, ozone phase or peracetic phase. The alkali used in bleaching sequences comprising alkaline stages is preferably potassium hydroxide, either alone or together with sodium hydroxide and/or ammonium hydroxide. Potassium hydroxide can also be used for increasing pH before the bleaching. In addition to potassium hydroxide, other potassium compounds may also be used. This allows a potassium-containing bleaching liquor rich in potassium nutrients needed by plants to be obtained. In addition to potassium, magnesium compounds may also be used in connection with bleaching since magnesium compounds also have nutrient value in fertilizer use. The most common way to use magnesium in pulp bleaching is to use magnesium sulphate as a stabilizer. Magnesium in the form of Mg(OH) 2 can also be used before the bleaching to increase the pH of acidic pulp. At the same time, it serves as a stabilizer in oxygen-based bleaching stages, for example in hydrogen peroxide and peracetic bleaching. However, bleaching comprising alkaline stages can also be used together with ozone or per(carboxylic)acid bleaching, the fertilizer produced as a by-product naturally being then free of potassium. As a result of bleaching in which potassium hydroxide is used and in which phosphoric acid serves as the inorganic acid in stage (a), formic acid, acetic acid and potassium phosphate are produced. Formic acid is returned to cooking and acetic acid is either returned to cooking and/or offered for sale. Potassium phosphate is recovered to be used in compound fertilizers, for example (potassium phosphate being an important part of compound fertilizers). Correspondingly, when the bleaching is carried out using potassium hydroxide and nitric acid is used as the inorganic acid in stage (a), formic acid, acetic acid and potassium nitrate are produced. The last one is an important nitrogen-potassium fertilizer. Potassium hydroxide, phosphoric acid and nitric acid used together allow an NPK fertilizer to be prepared. The inorganic acid used in stage (a) may also be sulphuric acid which together with potassium hydroxide produces potassium sulphate used in chlorine-free fertilizers. Chlorine-free fertilizers are useful for example in the preparation of high-quality garden fertilizer products. The composition of the fertilizer can be further adjusted by adding ash obtained from a bio power plant of a pulp mill to the potassium-, nitrogen-, phosphor- and/or sulphur-containing bleaching concentrate thus produced. The lignin fraction recovered from the cooking and washing stage and, together with it, possibly other organic matter produced as a by-product of the pulp production are burned in the power plant. Said ash fraction contains nutrients (K, Ca, P, Mg, Fe and other acid-soluble components) which have been separated during the cooking into the cooking liquor and further into the lignin-hemicellulose fraction during the recovery of formic acid used as the cooking chemical. The ashes may also contain an ash component obtained from the burning of cellulose raw material, such as straw screenings. In hydrogen peroxide bleaching, the hemicellulose contained in the pulp reacts from 1 to 5 percentage units, depending on the bleaching requirements. Pulp typically contains about 15% of hemicellulose, the proportion of unreacted hemicellulose left in the pulp after the bleaching amounting up to 10-14%. The hemicellulose obtained from plants and hardwoods mainly consists of xylans that react to xylose, after which they are hydrolyzed to form organic acids. Similarly, some of the lignin separated in the bleaching forms organic acids. The process of the invention allows such organic acids to be recovered. Moreover, the process of the invention allows to utilize any free acids and formiate and acetate esters possibly left as washing loss in the unbleached pulp, because they react with the alkaline bleaching chemical to corresponding salts. Also these salts react in the acid treatment to organic acids, the process of the invention thus allowing them to be reused, which significantly reduces the losses in the washing of unbleached pulp, the losses being 0.5 to 5% of pulp, depending on the process applied. The concentrate produced by the evaporation of the bleaching liquors also contains other organic compounds, such as lignin and hemicellulose. These compounds are included in the bleaching concentrate obtained in accordance with the invention, the invention thus allowing the compounds to be utilized as additional components in the fertilizer. The above process operations allow a fully closed water cycle to be implemented in a pulp mill. The organic acids formed in the pulping process can be utilized as cooking chemicals, and the hemicellulose dissolved in the bleaching can be completely hydrolyzed into organic acids which in turn can be utilized in the cooking. The evaporated water is reused as process water. The acids formed in the process can be used to compensate for the chemical losses occurring in the process. In an optimum situation, the overall consumption of cooking chemicals in the process may be compensated for by using acids formed in the process, and all inorganic chemicals may be utilized as a fertilizer. The consumption of cooking chemicals in pulping processes based on organic acids is typically 5 to 10% (50-100 kg per 1000 kg) of pulp. The process of the invention allows a total amount of organic acids of 6 to 8% (60 to 80 kg per 1000 kg) of dry pulp to be obtained. Correspondingly, salts suitable for use as fertilizers are produced in an amount of 12 to 16% (120 to 160 kg), of which potassium, nitrogen and phosphor (K, N, P) account for 50% (the bleaching being carried out using potassium hydroxide and the inorganic acids used in stage (a) being nitric acid and phosphoric acid). The process of the invention is particularly suitable for pulping processes based on formic acid and/or acetic acid and using herbaceous plants and corresponding non-wood fibre sources as raw material. The most important fibre sources are straw, typically corn straw (wheat, rye, oats, barley, rice), grasses, e.g. giant reed, esparto grass, sabai grass and lemon grass, reeds, such as papyrus, common reed, sugar cane, or bagasse, and bamboo, bast fibres, e.g. stems of fibre flax or seed flax, kenaf, jute and hemp, leaf fibres, e.g. manilla hemp and sisal, and seed hairs, such as cotton and cotton linter fibres. Useful grasses that grow in Finland are e.g. common reed, reed canary grass, tall fescue and timothy. The process of the invention can also be applied to wood material. The invention applies not only to processes based on organic acids, such as formic acid, but also to pulping processes using other solvents and reagents. A closed bleaching cycle is particularly well suitable for the process of the invention and for other processes employing acidic delignification and pulp washing stages. For example, calcium (Ca) is dissolved and washed from the pulp and not taken to bleaching, where oxalic acid is formed in all bleaching sequences. If calcium is present in the bleaching, as for example in kraft and soda processes and other similar processes, calcium oxalate is formed, which is known to be poorly soluble and which may precipitate even quite firmly to filtrate containers, wires and on the surfaces of evaporators. In the process of the invention the calcium contained in the raw material is separated in the cooking and pulp washing, wherefore it cannot form calcium oxalate in the bleaching liquors. The calcium ends up in the ash produced from the burning of the lignin. The process of the invention can be applied in sulphate processes and other similar processes, provided that the impact of calcium has been eliminated by an acidic washing stage having pH of 3 or lower. Organic acids can then be utilized in a sulphate process to adjust the pH in the recovery of tall oil, for example, which allows excessive amounts of sulphur (extra sulphur load) in the process to be avoided by replacing sulphuric acid with organic acids. The following examples illustrate the invention:"
4921002,Automatic watering zone switcher,1988-12-09,0,1,"This invention relates to devices for switching the flow of fluid between two or more outlets. More particularly, the invention relates to valves for automatically switching fluid flow from one line outlet to one of two or more device outlets in response to a fluctuation of fluid pressure at the line outlet, especially for residential and agricultural irrigation systems. While the present invention is generally applicable to sequentially distribute fluids from a source which is at least at a modest pressure above ambient over a number of outputs, a principle aim of the invention is for irrigation systems comprised of irrigation lines or circuits intended to feed water to a series of sprinkler heads, drip irrigation outlets and the like. It is generally the case that the available water source pressure limits the total number of irrigation devices which may be supplied by any one circuit. If this limit is exceeded, the devices fed by the circuit generally receive too little water, or water at too low a pressure to properly perform their function. Consequently, it is desirable to lay out irrigation systems comprised of a number of different circuits. Another rising concern in the design of such systems relates to the prudent management of water. Being able to group the plant materials to be watered according to their water quantity requirements in separate circuits permits far more flexible and economical use of water, by appropriately adjusting the time periods for which the different circuits are supplied with water. The above advantage or indeed the need of using multiple circuits has been recognized previously. There are available a variety of systems for switching a source of water sequentially between a number of circuits. However, such devices are generally electrically operated valve systems, which are expensive and relatively complicated, usually required to be installed by professionals. Also, owing to the more complicated nature of such systems, their operation, adjustment and maintenance represent more formidable problems. Accordingly, a principal object of the present invention is to provide a simple alternative means of connecting a water supply to more than one fluid circuit and permit the source of water to be sequentially switched between these circuits. Another object of the invention is to provide a switching device which does not require an external, particularly electrical, supply of power, but whose switching action is automatically activated by a drop and rise in the pressure of the supply water, such as by turning the water supply off and on. Still another object of the invention is to proivde a switching device which is readily compatible with standard faucets and simple automatic on-off valve systems for domestic water supply systems. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a water diverter device which is rugged, easily cleaned and comprised exclusively of mechanical components with a long service life. These and other objects will become more clearly apparent upon consideration of the following description. In a specific aspect, the invention provides a device for alternately switching water from one outlet to one and then the other outlet of two circuits, each time the water is turned off and on again. This is accomplished by providing a body defining a cylindrical barrel of circular cross-section, each end of which houses a piston capable of axial movement within the barrel in sealed relationship thereto. The water outlet communicates with the barrel volume between the pistons. The openings, which lead into the outlets for the two circuits to be alternately supplied with water, are disposed respectively in the end regions of the barrel housing the pistons. Their precise location is chosen such that the sealing portions of the pistons are able to slide across these openings and thereby alternately establish and prevent fluid communication with the central volume. Water pressure from the outlet powers the travel of the pistons away from the central volume. A pair of springs, one each associated with each piston, are loaded in response to movement of the piston by water pressure, and provide the necessary energy to return the spring toward the center of the barrel. Now, in order to guide the motion of each piston, each piston is provided with projections which engage a circumferential recess in the barrel. The boundaries of the recessed areas are such that the pistons sequentially come to rest in desired axial positions leaving alternately one or the other inlet connected to the central volume. Features of a preferred embodiment include keyed sliding means for locking the circumferential motion of the pistons together. Another feature relates to specific means for draining the central volume of fluid when the outlet pressure is relieved. Still another preferred feature is a recess configuration comprising ratchet like boundaries which provide ramps for incrementally turning the piston in a circumferential direction to bring the projections into axial alignment with slotted guide sections for determining the axial piston position. More generally, the invention provides a body defining a cylindrical volume, at one end of which is disposed a piston, which is able to move rotationally and axially back and forth. The other end of the cylindrical volume is sealed with respect to flow of fluid, defining a bounded interior volume which is connected to the source of fluid. The piston engages an energy storage device, such as a spring disposed on the side of the piston distal to the interior volume, so that when the interior volume is pressurized by water, the piston moves and the spring is compressed to store energy for moving the piston in the opposite direction. Again, a piston guide means sequentially positions the piston at locations so that fluid conduit means may connect the fluid outlet with unique fluid inlets from the cylindrical volume. In its most general aspect, the present invention exploits the fluctuation of pressure in the fluid to be switched between a variety of outputs in that the fluid is forced to do work against a suitable energy storage device, such as a spring or air reservoir, for example. The stored energy is then used to incrementally move some suitable conduit means for selectively establishing a fluid path between a fluid source and a particular outlet to a desired fluid dispensing circuit. A conduit means may be a simple piston with one or more circular seals, where fluid communication is established or interrupted by movement of the seals across a given outlet port. However, as used here, the term conduit means is intended to apply to any body with fluid passages, which is able to be moved so that the passages selectively connect a desired output port to the fluid inlet into the switching device. The movement of the means for establishing a selected fluid path is confined to a closed-loop one directional path with discrete stops, each of whic uniquely position the conduit means to establish fluid flow between the fluid source and a desired outlet or set of outlets. The timing of movement and arresting movement at each stop is controlled by the force of the inlet pressure of the fluid, i.e., the pressure the fluid exerts is sued to counteract the force exterted on the conduit means by the energy storage device, until its motion is arrested at one of the stops, whereas when the fluid pressure is reduced to or below a desired value, the force exerted by the energy storage device, until its motion is arrested at one of the stops, whereas when the fluid pressure is reduced to or below a desired value, the force exerted by the energy storage device will overcome the fluid pressure on the conduit and set it in motion until arrested at another stop. In this fashion, the invention accomplishes switching of fluid supply automatically by simple passive means, in response to the throttling or increasing of fluid flow above or below predetermined values of pressure."

7422682,"Compositions, devices, and methods for use in environmental remediation",2005-06-28,0,3,"FIELD OF THE ART The field of art disclosed herein pertains to compositions, devices, and methods suited for a variety of applications in environmental remediation. BACKGROUND The uses of structural barriers for a variety of applications in environmental remediation are generally well described. Several types of environmental remediation barriers (ERBs) are used in earth and hydraulic engineering, such exemplary structures including fiber rolls, mats, blankets, and berms. Originally, major applications of ERBs included erosion and sedimentation control, revegetation, and revetment. More recently, the potential for such structures to serve additionally in the capacity of removal of natural and manmade pollutants from residential, industrial, and agricultural sources, and remediation of eutrification has been described. As the name of one type of ERB, fiber roll, suggests, ERBs packed into a covering, such as a netted material, may be filled with fibers; typically a single natural fiber such as abaca, hemp, jute, flax, sisal, coir, or straw materials. For a major application of fiber-filled ERBs in erosion and sediment control, the purpose of the fiber filling is primarily structural. In that regard, though the natural fibers described are capable of absorbing water, one necessary attribute of the fiber filler has been to provide an effective porosity once packed that allows for the ready passage of water, while promoting the retention of mud, sediment, gravel, and the like. Other desirable attributes of natural fibers used in ERBs include ready availability in high volume and low cost, requirement to be germ, insect and weed free, free of chemical pollutants, ability to degrade after use; thereby obviating creation of harmful waste, and ease of processing into targeted devices. Materials in addition to natural fibers have been suggested as supplemental constituents in ERBs. Particularly, vegetative matter, as well as nutrients and fertilizers for revegetation and revetment have been described. Materials that have been suggested include saw dust, wood chips, bark, compost, flocculants, water absorbents, and pesticides. A major objective in the field has been to establish environmental remediation practices that are consistent with good practices for environmental protection in general. In that regard, the reuse of natural materials, such as saw dust, wood chips, bark, and compost, that would otherwise go to waste has been a motive for creating fillings for ERBs. Especially in consideration of the use of ERBs in functions where the filling has a requirement that is more than structural; moreover where the filling must perform additional multiple functions, such as clarification of runoff water and removal of pollutants, the targeted and judicious selection of materials tailored for such multifunctional use throughout the lifetime of the ERBs still remains a challenge. Accordingly, a need exists for more effective compositions of materials that are multifunctional for a variety of environmental remediation needs, and for a range of ERBs utilizing such compositions and their use."
8301309,Irrigation system utilizing actual and historical components of ET data,2010-12-10,0,1,"The present invention relates to electronic controllers that control valves that supply water to sprinklers that irrigate turf and landscaping. In many parts of the world due to inadequate rainfall it is necessary at certain times during the year to artificially water turf and landscaping. An ideal irrigation system for turf and landscaping should utilize a minimum number of valves, supply lines and sprinklers. Preferably the valves should be turned ON and OFF by an inexpensive, yet reliable electronic irrigation controller that is easy to program and can carry out a wide variety of watering schedules. The goal is to uniformly distribute the optimum amount of water over a given area. The type, placement and flow rates for each of the sprinklers are pre-selected when an irrigation system is designed and/or installed. The optimum flow rate provided by each sprinkler should preferably fall within plus or minus one-quarter gallon-per minute (GPM). The amount of water supplied by each sprinkler is largely determined by the size and configuration of its nozzle orifice(s), although variations result from fluctuations in water pressure that cannot be fully negated with regulators. Residential and commercial irrigation systems typically include one or more solenoid operated valves that are turned ON and OFF by the electronic irrigation controller. The valves admit water to various subterranean branch lines usually made of PVC pipe that typically have several sprinklers connected to risers coupled to the branch lines at spaced intervals. Each combination of a solenoid valve and its associated sprinklers is referred to in the irrigation industry as a station or zone. A modern electronic irrigation controller typically includes a microprocessor that executes one or more watering programs. The watering programs can, typically, be pre-programmed by the user via push button and/or rotary controls. The watering programs contain one or more watering schedules which consist of run and cycle times for each station. The controller usually has an LCD or other display to facilitate programming by the user. Often the controller will revert to a default watering program in the case of a power failure. The microprocessor controls the solenoid valves via suitable drivers and switching devices. The valves are opened and closed by the microprocessor in accordance with the pre-programmed run and cycle times for each of the stations. Homeowners, conservationists and water purveyors are increasingly interested in minimizing the amount of water used for irrigation, especially in areas like the Southwest where water is in short supply. Some municipalities have enacted restrictions on residential and commercial watering. While such restrictions do save water, they are often arbitrary and do not take into account the watering needs of different types of vegetation in different geographic locations. Techniques have been developed for tailoring watering schedules in an electronic irrigation controller to accommodate different kinds of plants and atmospheric conditions based on evapotranspiration (ET) rate. This is a number that represents the amount of water lost by a plant via evaporation and also the amount of water lost by the plant through transpiration, i.e. loss of water through its leaves. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,097,861 granted Mar. 24, 1992 to Hopkins et al. and assigned to Hunter Industries, Inc. of San Marcos, Calif., which discloses a controller that utilizes stored historic ET data for each zip code, along with other stored data, to calculate watering schedules. The primary environmental factors needed to calculate ET are temperature, amount of solar radiation, relative humidity and wind speed. Rainfall is not included because it is only a source of water and has little effect on how quickly plants lose water. However, an irrigation controller should take into account the effective rainfall, via rain interrupt sensor or otherwise, in determining the optimum watering schedule. Effective rainfall depends upon such things as soil type, slope and root depth as these determine the amount of water that actually makes it to the plant roots as opposed to the amount of runoff. Atmospheric conditions affect both evaporation and transpiration. Plant type also affects transpiration. U.S. Pat. No. 6,298,285 of Addink et al. granted Oct. 2, 2001 and assigned to Aqua Conservation Systems, Inc. discloses an irrigation controller that is capable of making daily adjustment of irrigation duration based upon historical, environmental and/or received information. The controller can automatically skip days and make changes to account for daily and seasonal environmental changes. Published U.S. Patent Application US 2003/0109964 A1 of Addink et al. discloses an irrigation controller that uses a regression model to estimate ET and uses it to affect the irrigation schedule executed by the controller. The regression model is based on a comparison of historical ET values against corresponding historical environmental values such as temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, humidity, barometric pressure, cloud cover and soil moisture. Published U.S. Patent Application US 2004/0011880 A1 of Addink et al. discloses an irrigation scheduler that attaches to the output lines of an irrigation controller and interrupts the output signals to the valves to effectuate an improved watering schedule based on ET or weather data. Conventional techniques for using ET data in an irrigation controller often require a fee to be paid for receiving and utilizing the ET information. Irrigation controllers capable of calculating watering schedules based on ET are typically complicated to use and expensive to buy. Those schedulers which “piggy back” onto an existing controller have limitations because they can only reduce the existing watering schedules in the base controller. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention an irrigation system includes a processor and at least one user input operatively connected to the processor for entry or selection of a watering program. A memory is operatively connected to the processor for storing the watering program and a historical set of components of ET data. A signal generated by at least one environmental sensor installed on an irrigation site is communicated to the processor. The signal represents an actual value of at least one component of the ET. Programming stored in the memory enables the processor to calculate changes to a set of watering schedules including cycles and run times of the watering program based on the actual value and the historical set of components of ET data. Circuitry operatively connected to the processor enables the processor to turn a plurality of valves ON and OFF in accordance with the watering program."
6828132,Biological fertilizer compositions comprising garbage,2002-07-09,0,2,"1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to biological fertilizers that comprise yeasts and an organic substrate. The yeasts in the compositions of the invention have been stimulated to perform a variety of functions including the conversion of the organic materials into non-hazardous plant nutrients. The invention also relates to methods for manufacturing biological fertilizers, and methods for using the biological fertilizers to increase crop yields. 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Use of fertilizer is essential in supporting the growth of high yield crops. Of the basic nutrients that plants need for healthy growth, large amounts of nitrogen (taken up as NO3- or NH4+), phosphorus (taken up as H2PO4-), and potassium (taken up as K+) nutrients are required by most crops on most soils (Wichmann, W., et al., IFA World Fertilizer Use Manual). Such large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium nutrients are supplied mainly in the form of mineral fertilizers, either processed natural minerals or manufactured chemicals (K. F. Isherwood, 1998, Mineral Fertilizer Use and the Environment, United Nations Environmental Programme Technical Report No. 26). Despite the importance of mineral fertilizers in providing mankind with abundant agricultural products, the harm done to the environment has been recognized in recent years. Mineral fertilizers may incurred damages to soils. For example, most nitrogen fertilizers may acidify soils, thereby adversely affecting the growth of plants and other soil organisms. Extensive use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers may also inhibit the activity of natural nitrogen fixing microorganisms, thereby decreasing the natural fertility of soils. The long term use of mineral fertilizers may also cause severe environmental pollution. For example, the loss of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers due to leaching and soil erosion has led to contamination of soil and ground water, and eutrophication of surface water. Cleaning up polluted soil and water has been a complicated and difficult task. The cost for such a task is also astronomical. In search for a solution to the problem, some are going back to organic fertilizers, such as manure (Wichmann, W., et al., IFA World Fertilizer Use Manual). The use of manure as fertilizer dates to the beginnings of agriculture. Large amounts of manure are produced by livestock. For example, in the United States, farms (including confined animal feeding operations) generate more than 136 million metric tons (dry weight basis) of waste products annually. Manure has value in maintaining and improving soil because of the plant nutrients, humus, and organic substances contained in it. Studies have shown that a high percentage of the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fed to dairy cattle are excreted in manure. As manure must be managed carefully in order to derive the most benefit from it, some farmers may be unwilling to expend the necessary time and effort. Manure must be carefully stored to minimize loss of nutrients. It must be applied to the right kind of crop at the proper time. In general, manure does not provide all the plant nutrients needed and very large amount of organic fertilizers have to be applied to soil. Thus, there is a tendency to discount the value of manure as fertilizer. Manure may also contain undesirable chemicals, such as antibiotics and hormones. Only in underdeveloped countries, where artificial fertilizer may be costly or unavailable and where labor is relatively cheap, manure is attractive as a fertilizer. Furthermore, manure may contain significant levels of nitrogen and phosphorous which threaten water resources if not managed correctly. If not stored or disposed of properly, it can pose health and environmental threats. For example, it can cause air pollution, i.e., odor and dust; and contamination of surface and ground water with excess nutrients, organic matter, salts, and pathogens. For example, manure contains pathogenic microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Campylobacter jejuni. Biological fertilizers utilizing microorganisms have been proposed as alternatives to mineral fertilizers. Naturally occurring nitrogen fixing microorganisms including bacteria, such as Rhizobium, Azotobacter, and Azospirilluml, (See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,071,462) and fungi, such as Aspergillus flavus-oryzae, (See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,670,037) have been utilized in biological fertilizers. Naturally occurring microorganisms capable of solubilizing phosphate rock ore or other insoluble phosphates into soluble phosphates have also been utilized in biological fertilizers either separately (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,398) or in combination with nitrogen fixing microorganisms (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,464). Genetically modified bacterial strains have also been developed and utilized in biological fertilizers. An approach based on recombinant DNA techniques has been developed to create more effective nitrogen fixing, phosphorus decomposing, and potassium decomposing bacterial strains for use in a biological fertilizer, see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,486; PCT publication WO 95/09814; Chinese patent publication: CN 1081662A; CN 1082016A; CN 1082017A; CN 1103060A; and CN 1109595A. However, the biological fertilizers that are based on naturally occurring microorganisms are generally not efficient enough to effectively replace mineral fertilizers. It is therefore important to develop more advanced biological fertilizers that can replace mineral fertilizers in supplying nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to crops for producing high quality agricultural products while avoiding the problems associated with mineral fertilizers. The present invention provides a biological fertilizer based on non-recombinant yeasts, which can replace mineral fertilizers and provide an effective and environmentally-friendly method of using certain organic materials.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to biological fertilizer compositions. The biological fertilizer compositions of the invention comprises up to nine different yeast cell components, garbage, and optionally an inorganic substrate component.

In preferred embodiments, the present invention uses yeasts that are commercially available and/or accessible to the public, such as but not limited to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Generally, the yeast cell components of the invention are produced by culturing the pluralities of yeast cells under activation conditions such that the abilities of the pluralities of cells to perform the functions are activated or enhanced. Accordingly, in another embodiment, the invention encompasses methods of activating or enhancing the abilities of yeast cells to perform one of the ten functions. The invention also relates to methods for manufacturing the fertilizer comprising mixing garbage with the yeast cells of the present invention, followed by drying and packing the final product. The invention further relates to methods for using the fertilizer compositions of the present invention. The biological fertilizer compositions of the present invention are used to support and enhance the growth and maturation of a wide variety of plants."
9334201,Organic composition for use with plants,2015-06-15,0,1,"FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT None. 1. Field of the Invention The invention generally relates to a composition compatible with plant life and suitable as a medium, amendment, additive, or supplement. Specifically, the invention is an organic composition including a filtration waste and sand with optional soil(s) and/or compostable material(s) and/or non-compostable material(s) whereby filtration waste is a mixture of carbon, diatomaceous earth, and sugar. 2. Background Sugar refining is the process whereby high-quality sugars are produced from sugarcane. After sugarcane is harvested, the stalks are crushed to extract juices which are eventually processed into a variety of edible sugars. Bagasse is a fibrous matter that remains after the crushing process. Bagasse is often burned to produce steam that powers the refinery which processes the juices. Bagasse is also used as a composition for conditioning the soil environment around plants to improve the rate and uniformity of plant growth. However, bagasse has a relatively high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio which tends to inhibit plant growth. Therefore, bagasse requires further processing, conditioning, and/or additives to avoid this and other problems associated with its use as a soil supplement. Sugarcane juices are dried and processed to form a raw sugar, often in the form of a course crystal. The raw sugar is shipped to refineries for processing into a final product, examples including but not limited to granulated sugars, soft brown sugars, and sugar cubes. The raw sugar is affined, melted, clarified, decolorized, and crystallized. Sugar products are dried and packaged for sale. Affination is the mixing of raw sugar with a warm syrup which removes the molasses coating from the sugar crystals. The syrup and crystals are separated by spinning within a centrifuge, and the crystals are further washed with a water spray. The sugar crystals are then fed into a melter, wherein the crystals are dissolved within hot water to form a liquor. The raw liquor is often clarified via a process which includes either phosphatation or carbonatation. Phosphatation includes addition of phosphoric acid and lime to the liquor resulting in the formation of calcium phosphate. The liquor is placed in a floatation clarifier which allows the calcium phosphate byproduct to float to the top of the liquor for eventual removal by surface scraping. Carbonatation includes addition of carbon dioxide gas and lime to the liquor resulting in the formation of calcium carbonate. The liquor is placed in a flotation clarifier which allows the calcium carbonate byproduct to float to the top of the liquor for eventual removal by surface scraping. It may be possible for the calcium phosphate or the calcium carbonate to be filtered from the liquor in addition to or instead of scraping. The liquor may be decolorized via the addition of carbon adsorbents, examples including but not limited to granular activated carbon and bone charcoal. The liquor is passed through pressure leaf filters which include layers of diatomaceous earth. The filters separate the carbon from the liquor by trapping the carbon within the filters and allowing the liquor to pass through the filters. A portion of the sugar coats or is trapped by the diatomaceous earth, filters, and/or carbon, the latter formed on the filters during filtration. The filters are cleaned to remove the filtration waste, namely, carbon, diatomaceous earth, and sugar. In other refinement methods, the liquor with or without carbon, is passed through pressure leaf filters which include layers of diatomaceous earth and carbon. The filters separate the carbon, if present, from the liquor by trapping the carbon within the filters and allowing the liquor to pass through the filters. A portion of the sugar coats or is trapped by the diatomaceous earth, filters, and/or carbon. The filters are cleaned to remove the filtration waste, namely, carbon, diatomaceous earth, and sugar. It is understood that the components of the filtration waste, namely, carbon, diatomaceous earth, and sugar are critical to the present invention. The refinement methodology resulting in the combination of components is not part of the present invention and does not limit the scope of the invention. Furthermore, the refinement methodologies are in no way limited to the examples provided herein. Presently, the filtration waste has little or no reuse value and is discarded and often disposed of in a waste disposal site. In view of the deficiencies associated with bagasse as a soil conditioner, it would be highly advantageous if the filtration waste could be used within an organic composition to improve the growth characteristics otherwise achievable with various formulations of soils, compostable materials, and non-compostable materials. Therefore, what is required is an organic composition including filtration waste that improves the growth characteristics otherwise achievable with various formulations of soils, compostable materials, and non-compostable materials.

5226236,Nipper including anvil having locator hooks,1992-06-09,0,1,"The present invention relates to a nipper for pruning plants and trees and, in particular, to a nipper whose anvil has locator hooks which capture and position objects to be cut depending on their size. Nippers typically provide cutting action with a single blade against an anvil surface, and have been used in a wide variety of applications. It is a common experience for gardeners and others who use nippers for pruning to experience a stick, stem or branch sliding or squirting outward upon attempting to cut it by squeezing it between the blade and anvil. In addition, because a wide variety of stick, stem and branch sizes are typically presented during pruning, it is also a common experience for gardeners and others to encounter sticks, stems and branches which are too large to cut effectively with a particular nipper. To provide restraint against movement, notches, such as semi-circular and v-shaped notches, in anvils, have long been used in other applications to locate articles in a fixed position for cutting. Other elements, such as removable clamps, have been used to rigidly position articles on anvils for cutting. With less precision, a stem stop element has been added to a jaw of a clipper to limit inward travel and generally block a stem outward in the jaws for cutting. While such features have been effective in positioning or restraining articles for cutting in other applications, nippers for pruning plants and trees continue to lack effective means for restraining twigs, stems and branches for cutting, as well as, effective means to prevent engaging oversized twigs, stems and branches. Those needs are satisfied by the present invention in which a nipper for pruning sticks, stems and branches is provided in its preferred embodiment with an anvil having locator hooks which partially block the jaw opening of a nipper, but moreover, serve to restrain and position twigs, stems and branches for cutting. The nipper of the present invention includes opposing first and second jaws for engaging a stick, stem or branch for cutting. The first and second jaws define a jaw opening therebetween which has an open end and a closed end. The first jaw includes a cutting edge, while the second jaw includes an anvil having a receiving surface against which the cutting edge acts. The anvil further includes at least one locator lug, preferably shaped like a hook, which extends from the receiving surface into the jaw opening to partially block the jaw opening. The locator lug is spaced between the open and closed ends of the jaw opening and defines a first cutting area extending to the closed end. The hook-shaped locator lug has its curved surface facing the closed end of the jaw opening. In operation, the locator lug of the nipper serves to permit only a stick, stem or branch of limited size to be admitted between the first jaw and the locator lug into said first cutting area, preventing oversized sticks, stems or branches which cannot be effectively cut from being engaged in the first cutting area between the first and second jaws. The locator lug further serves to restrain and position sticks, stems and branches which enter into the first cutting area for cutting. That is, sticks, stems and branches are prevented from squirting out during cutting. The hook shape helps to restrain twigs, stems or branches which may bias against it during cutting. As well, larger ones of those sticks, stems and branches are caused to extend further back into the jaw opening, so that, as is preferred, higher cutting forces are applied to the thicker and larger sticks, stems and branches. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide locator lugs on the anvil of a nipper which serve to limit the size of sticks, stems and branches engaged in the first cutting area of the nipper. It is a further object of the present invention to restrain sticks, stems and branches which enter the first cutting area. It is a further object of the present invention to position larger sticks, stems and branches so that higher cutting forces are applied to larger sticks, stems and branches. It is a still further object of the present invention to provide two locator lugs shaped like hooks, with their curved surfaces facing the closed end of the jaw opening to restrain sticks, twigs and branches. It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an anvil having locator lugs which is a separate component of a nipper for use on one jaw. It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an anvil having locator lugs which is integral with the jaw of a nipper. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the drawings and detailed description which follow."
6769495,Device for the harvesting of cultivated turfs,2002-04-29,0,1,"BRIEF DESCRIPTION This invention relates to a sod harvesting device, comprising a mobile chassis with a first knife that is capable of cutting a sod free from a field, and a second knife that is capable of chopping the sod in a direction that is transverse to the direction of travel, whereby the second knife is equipped with electronically controlled mechanisms that allow the second knife to work into the sod when a desired sod length has been reached, and where transport mechanisms are present near to the first knife to collect the cut away sod and to carry it away. Such a device is mainly used for the harvesting of cultivated turfs. A known device for the harvesting of grass turfs contains a chassis that is possibly self-propelled and contains a first knife on the front side, when viewed in the direction of travel, for cutting away a sod of a certain width and thickness from the field. The knife thus grasps at the desired thickness below ground level, while a drum rolls over the field next to the knife in order to enclose the sod between the knife and the drum so that a uniform thickness is obtained. Moreover, the device contains a second knife that is activated after the desired length of grass turf has been cut away, in order to chop the sod transverse to the longitudinal direction. The sod that has been harvested to the desired length is guided behind the first knife to a means of transport in the form of a conveyor belt that carries it away. In the meantime, the next grass turf is already cut away. The known device operates automatically to a certain extent since the second knife rests under considerable spring tension on a cam disc and is always released when this cam disc turns, where the cam disc is linked to the drum via a chain drive. After an exact predetermined number of revolutions of the drum, the second knife is activated and the harvested sod is chopped. A drawback of this is that the transition to a different sod length requires relatively major adjustment of the device since in order to achieve this, a different gear ratio must be obtained in the chain drive. In practice, this means that the existing gear wheels must be removed in order to make room for other gear wheels. This not only takes time and results in the device being out of service, but is above all relatively inaccurate since only lengths that match a specific gear ratio can be used. In practice, it is often desirable to adjust the length of the grass turf rather accurately in order to ensure that the diameter of a roll of turf is virtually constant. If, during the harvesting, due to the subsoil, a different depth is used for the first knife, this means that a different length must also be chosen in order to obtain the same diameter. This cannot, or is almost impossible to achieve using the known device. Moreover, the known device is rather inaccurate since the drum often slips due to the resistance that the drum encounters in the chain drive and the limited friction on the field. This results in the harvested sod having a greater length than was intended. This is in any event what happens to the sod that is first to be harvested after the device starts operating. The distance between the drum and the second knife will inevitably cause this sod harvested over this distance to be too long, with this having to be manually corrected and resulting in rejection of the relevant sod part. A somewhat better construction is revealed by the sod harvesting apparatus disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,966,239. Also this apparatus comprises a harvesting knife in the front section of the machine capable of cutting loose a sod from the field together with a cutting knife which is capable of cutting the sod in the traverse direction over it's entire thickness once the desired length is obtained. Different from the prior art device described hereinbefore, the apparatus known from this US patent comprises electronic means for determining the length of sod and an electronic signal is given to the cutting knife in order to cut the sod . These electronic means consist of a inductive, eddy current pick up which counts the number of passing teeth on a gear in the harvesting transmission and sends pulses to an electronic pre-determining counter. The counter sends a signal to actuation means of the cutting life once a programmed number of pulses is exceeded, which causes the sod being cut. Although this allows for more precise, finer and especially much more easily finer setting of the desired length compared to the previously described prior art device, also this device does not take into account any irregularities which may arise in the harvested product, such as interruptions and temporary variations in the length of the product due to stretching and crimping. In stead just the number of revolutions of the gear wheel is taken as a basis for activating the cutting knife. This invention is intended, in a device of the type mentioned in the introduction, to ensure that these disadvantages are barely apparent, and in particular, to ensure that a fine adjustment is available for the harvested sod length. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In order to attain this objective, according to the invention, a device of the type mentioned in the introduction, is characterised in that an electronic sensor installed near to a conveyor track for the sod is at least capable of recording a size for a length of passing sod and producing this as an electronic signal, and that the sensor is linked by electronic means to the electronically controlled mechanisms for the second knife in order to release the second knife upon reaching a predetermined sod length. Thus the invention provides a sensor that directly or indirectly measures the length of the passing sod, unlike the known device where the rotation of the drum essentially represents a displacement of the device as a whole. Thus, in the device according to the invention, the sod that is first to be harvested will be processed in the same way as successive sod s. Since measuring takes place after the harvesting, instead of before as is the case for the known device, the device according to the invention is thus much less susceptible to stretching and shrinking of the harvested sod s that can result from a difference in speed between the discharge rates of the transport mechanisms and the driving speed of the device as a whole. In accordance with the invention, the length of the grass turf can be recorded as the grass turf is ultimately delivered. Since the invention is based on an electronic sensor and the same transmission to the second knife, measuring can take place virtually without any friction, and the sod can be adjusted electronically to any desired length, without having to take the device out of service to do this. A preferred embodiment of the device according to the invention is characterised in that the sensor is linked to the electronically controlled mechanisms via the medium of a central processing unit. The central processing unit enables other relevant parameters to be taken into account, such as the actual thickness of the sod, so that an optimal end product can be obtained. In a particular embodiment, the device according to the invention is characterised in that the electronic sensor contains a measuring wheel to rest on a passing sod and to be driven by it, and that a sensor is linked to the measuring wheel that records a rotation of the measuring wheel and produces an electronic signal. In this case, the harvested sod is directly measured in order to obtain an extremely accurate measuring result. This measuring result is sent to the central processing unit for further processing. A preferred embodiment of the device is characterised in that the sensor is capable of recording the direction of rotation of the measuring wheel. Since the sensor is capable of not only sensing a rotation, but also the direction of rotation of the measuring wheel, the travelling forwards and backwards and any shocks in the transportation of the sod can be taken into account, so that the final length of the sod is not altered. A particular embodiment, the device according to the invention is, in this respect, characterised in that the sensor contains an incremental pulse generator. Another preferred embodiment of the device according to the invention is characterised in that an electronic means of detection is used to record the presence of a sod in the conveyor track and to produce this as an electronic signal. This results in not only the length of the harvested sod being measured, but the presence of the sod in the conveyor track also being detected, and this is produced as an electronic signal. In particular, the length of the harvested sod is determined, indirectly, if not on the sod itself, thus allowing corrections to be made for the cases or periods when a sod is not in the conveyor track. This is in particular relevant for a length correction for the first sod to be harvested, and for a correction for gaps between consecutive sod s resulting from the occurrence of stretching and shrinking as previously described. In a particular embodiment, the device according to the invention is characterised in the aforementioned context in that the sensor is essentially commonly suspended in a direction transverse to the conveyor track for the sod in order to be raised from a point of departure when a sod passes, and in that the means of detection is linked to a suspension attached to a sensor. This embodiment enables the presence or non-presence of a sod to be recorded in a relatively simple yet not less efficient manner. As soon as the sod is no longer present, the suspension will return to the point of departure and touch the means of detection that produces this as an electronic signal. In another embodiment, the device according to the invention is characterised in that the means of detection contains an electric switch that is capable of working together with the suspension attached to the sensor, at least when leaving its point of departure. Because sod s are often rolled up after they have been harvested, with this roll preferably having a constant diameter, not only the length of the sod is important, but the thickness of the sod also plays a role. With this in mind, another embodiment of the device according to the invention is characterised in that means are installed next to a conveyor track for the sod in order to determine the thickness of a harvested sod and to produce this as an electronic value. Another embodiment of the device according to the invention is characterised in that the sensor is commonly suspended in a direction transverse to the conveyor track and in that the means for determining the thickness of the sod contains a raise detector that is capable of recording an amount of raising of the sensor and producing this as an electronic value. The amount of raising provides a guideline for the actual thickness of the sod and can, as such, produce an electronic value, for example to a central processing unit Thus thickness variations in the sod s can be taken into account completely automatically, so that a constant diameter is attained when a sod is rolled up. Another particular embodiment of the device according to the invention is characterised in that the raise detector contains a slide resistor that is linked to the sensor. The raising of the measuring wheel thus results in a corresponding sliding in or sliding out of the slide resistor and the associated change in resistance that can be processed electronically. Another embodiment of the device according to the invention is characterised in that the first knife is adjustable and is equipped with a means of adjustment that can be controlled by a central processing unit. Thus not only the length of the sod is controlled, but electronic control of the thickness is also possible with an electronic link between both in order to ensure that the final diameter of the rolled up product is constant. Thus, an extremely user-friendly system is obtained where, in practice, only one operator is required. The means of adjustment can be implemented in several ways, for example, via the medium of a hydraulically or pneumatically controlled pressure cylinder. An embodiment of the device according to the invention that has been proven in practice is, in this respect, characterised in that the means of adjustment contains an electronically controlled actuator that is linked to the first knife. The actuator can for example be a spindle that is driven by an electrical stepper motor or an adjustment cylinder that is possibly hydraulic. In both cases, the first knife can be accurately adjusted to the desired depth. The electronic control mechanism for the second knife can also be implemented in various ways. Another particular embodiment of the device according to the invention is also characterised in that the electronically controlled mechanisms for the second knife contains an electronic clutch that is incorporated in a transmission between a drive for the chassis and a cam disc on which the second knife rests under spring pressure. As soon as the clutch is activated, the cam disc will be driven and the second knife will be released so that the sod is chopped. This can for example be controlled by a central processing unit."
9085496,Organic composition for use with plants,2013-09-03,0,1,"CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is based upon and claims priority from Patent Cooperation Treaty Application No. PCT/US2013/057876 filed Sep. 3, 2013 entitled Organic Composition for Use with Plants. The subject matter of the prior application is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference thereto. FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT None. 1. Field of the Invention The invention generally relates to a composition applicable as a ground covering capable of supporting plant life. Specifically, the invention is an organic composition including a mixture of filtration waste with topsoil, dirt, manure, wood chips, leaves, and/or sand. The filtration waste is a mixture of carbon, diatomaceous earth, and sugar removed from filtering equipment as a waste byproduct after the refinement of raw sugar. 2. Background Sugar refining is the process whereby high-quality sugars are produced from sugarcane. After sugarcane is harvested, the stalks are crushed to extract juices which are eventually processed into a variety of edible sugars. Bagasse is a fibrous matter that remains after the crushing process. Bagasse is often burned to produce steam that powers the refinery which processes the juices. Bagasse is also used as a composition for conditioning the soil environment around plants to improve the rate and uniformity of plant growth. However, bagasse has a relatively high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio which tends to inhibit plant growth. Therefore, bagasse requires further processing, conditioning, and/or additives to avoid this and other problems associated with its use as a soil supplement. Sugarcane juices are dried and processed to form a raw sugar, often in the form of a course crystal. The raw sugar is shipped to refineries for processing into a final product, examples including but not limited to granulated sugars, soft brown sugars, and sugar cubes. The raw sugar is affined, melted, clarified, decolorized, and crystallized. Sugar products are dried and packaged for sale. Affination is the mixing of raw sugar with a warm syrup which removes the molasses coating from the sugar crystals. The syrup and crystals are separated by spinning within a centrifuge, and the crystals are further washed with a water spray. The sugar crystals are then fed into a melter, wherein the crystals are dissolved within hot water to form a liquor. The raw liquor is often clarified via a process which includes either phosphatation or carbonatation. Phosphatation includes addition of phosphoric acid and lime to the liquor resulting in the formation of calcium phosphate. The liquor is placed in a flotation clarifier which allows the calcium phosphate byproduct to float to the top of the liquor for eventual removal by surface scraping. Carbonatation includes addition of carbon dioxide gas and lime to the liquor resulting in the formation of calcium carbonate. The liquor is placed in a flotation clarifier which allows the calcium carbonate byproduct to float to the top of the liquor for eventual removal by surface scraping. It may possible for the calcium phosphate or the calcium carbonate to be filtered from the liquor in addition to or instead of scraping. The liquor may be decolorized via the addition of carbon adsorbents, examples including but not limited to granular activated carbon and bone charcoal. The liquor is passed through pressure leaf filters which include layers of diatomaceous earth. The filters separate the carbon from the liquor by trapping the carbon within the filters and allowing the liquor to pass through the filters. A portion of the sugar coats or is trapped by the diatomaceous earth, filters, and/or carbon, the latter formed on the filters during filtration. The filters are cleaned to remove the filtration waste, namely, carbon, diatomaceous earth, and sugar. In other refinement methods, the liquor with or without carbon, is passed through pressure leaf filters which include layers of diatomaceous earth and carbon. The filters separate the carbon, if present, from the liquor by trapping the carbon within the filters and allowing the liquor to pass through the filters. A portion of the sugar coats or is trapped by the diatomaceous earth, filters, and/or carbon. The filters are cleaned to remove the filtration waste, namely, carbon, diatomaceous earth, and sugar. It is understood that the components of the filtration waste, namely, carbon, diatomaceous earth, and sugar are critical to the present invention. As such, the refinement methodology resulting in the combination of components does not limit the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, the refinement methodologies are in no way limited to the examples provided herein. Presently, the filtration waste has little or no reuse value and is discarded and often disposed of in a waste disposal site. In view of the deficiencies associated with bagasse as a soil conditioner, it would be highly advantageous if the filtration waste could be used within an organic composition to improve the growth characteristics otherwise achievable with various formulations of topsoil, dirt, manure, wood chips, leaves, and sand. Therefore, what is required is an organic composition including filtration waste which promotes the growth of plant life whereby the filtration waste is a waste byproduct from the processing of raw sugar.

10315963,Composting facility,2017-08-23,0,1,"The present disclosure relates to composting facilities, and more particularly to an above-grade facility having floor channels for ventilation and draining. BACKGROUND As environmental awareness improves and conscientious practices are more in demand, large-scale material composting is likely to become more prevalent. Material to be composted in small batches can be turned or churned so as to permit aeration and to help accelerate aerobic processes that serve to decompose the material under treatment. But as the demands for increased bulk and improved efficiencies arise, methods of rotating small batches of material for aeration and maintenance may be found to be cost prohibitive and logistically difficult. The scale of potential composting needs is likely to support large permanent structure composting facilities that can each process tens if not hundreds of thousands of tons of material yearly. At such scales, aeration to support aerobic composting and the heat production of decomposition will need to be managed. Liquids can also be released from composting material, posing another challenge to large-scale operations. In some cases, trenches are dug below grade and both aeration and liquid collection are facilitated by the trenches. A trench however is susceptible to liquid accumulation and so further below-grade liquid management is needed such as a sunken collection tank, which requires occasional purging and maintenance. Improved composting facilities and methods are need for large-scale material composting. This summary is provided to introduce in a simplified form concepts that are further described in the following detailed descriptions. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it to be construed as limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter. A composting facility according to at least one embodiment includes: a floor for receiving compostable material thereon, wherein the floor is constructed above-grade; a dovetail extending from the floor to allow ingress of a vehicle from a grade level to the floor; one or more channels defined within the floor and extending through the dovetail; a covering extending over the one or more channels to maintain the compostable material away from the channel, the covering defining at least one aperture extending from above the covering into the one or more channels for allowing flow through of air; and a fan or blower for providing air through the channels to provide temperature control over the compostable material and oxygen to aid the aerobic process associated with composting, wherein, in operation, liquids draining from the composting material pass through at least one aperture into the channel and out through a portion of the channel extending through the dovetail. In at least one example, the floor includes parallel pads extending in a longitudinal direction, and wherein the channels extend in the longitudinal direction between the pads. In at least one example, the dovetail includes multiple parallel ramps, each ramp abutting a respective pad and extending in the longitudinal direction therefrom. In at least one example, each channel is defined along the floor between two of the pads and along the dovetail between two of the ramps. In at least one example, each channel has a first end that opens in the longitudinal direction at a forward end of the dovetail. In at least one example, each channel has a second end opposite the first end, and wherein the second end of each channel is closed. In at least one example, the floor includes a continuous rearward floor section from which the pads extend in the longitudinal direction, and wherein the second ends of the channels are defined at the continuous rearward floor section. In at least one example, a first sidewall extends in the longitudinal direction along a first lateral side of the floor; and a second sidewall laterally spaced from and parallel to the first sidewall extends in the longitudinal direction along a second lateral side of the floor. In at least one example, there is a laterally extending end wall from which the first sidewall and second sidewall extend in the longitudinal direction. In at least one example, the first sidewall includes a first terminal sidewall end; the second sidewall includes a second terminal sidewall end; and an open end of the composting facility opposite the laterally extending end wall is defined between the first terminal sidewall end and second terminal sidewall end. In at least one example, the dovetail is positioned between the first terminal sidewall end and the second terminal sidewall end. In at least one example, there is at least one conduit through which the fan or blower provides the air to the channels. In at least one example, each channel has a bottom that is below the floor and that is at or below the grade level."

8573323,Hand-held power tool,2011-03-29,0,1,"The invention relates to a hand-held power tool comprising a tool member that is driven by a motor, a battery for driving the tool member, and a guide shaft. It is known to use in such hand-held power tools, for example, trimmers, pole pruners or the like, a battery as an energy supply of the electric motor. In known power tools, simple mechanically commutated brush-type motors are used. Such a power tool is disclosed, for example, in JP 06-062637 A. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a hand-head power tool with which the tendency of the motor housing to become soiled is minimal. A further object of the present invention is to provide a hand-head power tool that is of a robust construction. In accordance with the present invention, this is achieved in that the hand-held power tool, comprising a tool member driven by a motor, wherein the power tool comprises a battery for driving the tool member and comprises a guide shaft, wherein on the first end of the guide shaft the battery and on the second end a motor housing and the tool member are arranged, wherein on the motor housing a rotating power output part is arranged that supports the tool member and that is driven by the motor in rotation, wherein cooling air is sucked in through the guide shaft into the motor housing, is characterized in that between the power output part and the motor housing an annular air exit gap is formed through which the cooling air exits and in that at least one guide vane is provided that projects into the annular air exit gap. The object is further achieved in that the hand-held power tool, comprising at least one tool member that is driven by a motor, wherein the power tool comprises a battery for driving the tool member and comprises a guide shaft, wherein on the first end of the guide shaft the battery and on the second end of the guide shaft the motor and the tool member are arranged, wherein the motor is arranged in a motor housing, is characterized in that the motor is elastically supported in such a way that the motor can tilt within the motor housing when transverse forces are introduced into or act on the tool member. In operation of the hand-held power tool it must be prevented that dirt or contaminants can enter the motor housing. At the same time, it must be ensured that the cooling air that has been sucked into the motor housing can exit. For this purpose, it is provided that between the power output part and the motor housing an annular air exit gap is formed through which the cooling air exits and in that at least one guide vane is provided that projects into the annular air exit gap. The guide vane thus reduces the flow cross-section of the air exit gap. Advantageously, the guide vane is arranged on the power output part. Because of the rotation of the power output part, sufficiently large free (unobstructed) sections can be formed circumferentially between neighboring guide vanes through which the air can exit. As a result of the rotation of the guide vane(s), the penetration of foreign matter into the motor housing is not possible or only possible with difficulty through the section between neighboring guide vanes so that the motor housing can be kept substantially free of any dirt or contaminants. The cooling air that is blown out through the air exit gap blows dirt particles away from the air exit gap and prevents in this way entry of dirt particles into the motor housing. Advantageously, several guide vanes are provided. The guide vanes are in particular approximately radially oriented. An advantageous design results when the air exit gap is formed on an annular channel of the power output part, the annular channel being substantially U-shaped in cross-section. A housing rim of the motor housing projects into this U-shaped annular channel. In this way, between the housing rim and the annular channel a labyrinth-type air guiding path with several deflections is formed that further makes difficult penetration of dirt or contaminants into the motor housing. The guide vane is in particular arranged in the annular channel. The housing rim projects up to a location near the guide vane. The spacing between housing rim and guide vane is advantageously selected such that contact between housing rim and guide vane is prevented in usual operation of the power tool. The spacing or distance between housing rim and guide vane is advantageously selected to be as small as possible, taking into consideration the manufacturing tolerances. The spacing is in particular approximately 0.5 mm up to approximately 2 mm. The housing rim may extend in axial direction of the motor shaft into the annular channel. However, it may also be provided that the annular channel in circumferential direction is located outside or inside the housing rim and that the housing rim projects radially relative to the longitudinal axis of the motor shaft to the exterior or to the interior. It may also be provided that the housing rim, in lateral direction relative to the guide vane, has relative to the annular channel only a very small spacing, for example, a spacing of approximately 0.5 mm up to approximately 2 mm. In this way, an even further improved sealing action with regard to dirt or contaminants is provided. Advantageously, the power tool has a cutting head that comprises a rotating tool member, for example, a blade or a trimmer line, wherein the annular channel is formed on a disk that is fixedly connected to the cutting head. In this way, a simple configuration is provided. The disk is advantageously comprised of plastic material, in particular of a fiberglass-reinforced polyamide. The material of the disk and the motor housing are advantageously matched to each other in such a way that upon contact of housing rim and disk no fusing of the two components with each other can take place. By using an electronically commutated brushless motor, the servicing expenditure for the motor is reduced because no wear-prone brushes are required. Such an electronically commutated motor is operated with rotating field with at least three phases. For generating the rotating field of at least three phases from the direct current that is supplied by the battery, an electronic control unit is provided. In order to keep exitance of the electromagnetic radiation as small as possible, it is provided that the electronic control unit is arranged at the second end of the guide shaft, i.e., spatially directly adjacent to the motor. In this way, electric lines that connect the control unit to the motor and through which the rotating field of at least three phases is made available, are very short so that the electromagnetic exitance can be kept minimal. The lines or cables that are passed through the guide shaft from the battery to the electronic control unit supply pulsed direct current. The arrangement of the electronic control unit in the motor housing is in particular possible when, by means of a suitable air guiding path and sealing action of the motor housing, the motor housing is substantially kept free of any dirt or contaminants. Advantageously, the motor and the electronic control unit are arranged in the motor housing. In order to provide excellent cooling action of the electronic control unit, it is provided that in the motor housing at least one flow guiding rib is provided that deflects the cooling air exiting from the guide shaft in the direction toward the electronic control unit. Advantageously, the electronic control unit in the regular or usual working position of the power tool is arranged below the mouth (opening) of the guide shaft. With this arrangement an advantageous deflection and swirling action of the cooling air flow are provided. At the same time, the motor housing can be configured to be compact and in the front area where the tool member is arranged can be of a small height. For conveying the cooling air advantageously fan blades are arranged in the motor housing that are driven in rotation and suck cooling air into the motor housing through the guide shaft that is hollow. By sucking in the cooling air through the guide shaft, it is ensured that substantially clean air from the area of the first end of the guide shaft is sucked into the motor housing. A simple configuration results when the motor is embodied as an external rotor motor wherein at least one fan blade for conveying the cooling air is arranged on the rotor of the motor. A separate fan wheel for conveying the cooling air can be eliminated by configuring the motor as an external rotor motor so that the number of required components is reduced. It may also be provided that a separate fan wheel is fixedly connected to the rotor, for example, is connected with positive fit on the rotor. In order to prevent soiling of the electronic control unit in operation as much as possible, it is provided that the motor housing is divided by a wall into a pressure side and a suction side wherein the fan blade is arranged within the pressure side and the electronic control unit is arranged within the suction side. The suction side is advantageously significantly larger than the pressure side. In this way, the suction side provides a convection space for the cooling air which provides for an effective cooling action. A simple configuration is achieved when the cooling air is sucked into the guide shaft through a gap that is formed at a receiving opening for the battery between the battery and the battery housing. Additional air intake openings in the battery housing are thus not required. Advantageously, on the battery housing at least one handle is arranged for guiding the power tool. An ergonomic handling is provided when the power tool has at least one loop handle that in particular is secured adjacent to the battery housing on the guide shaft. The loop handle is advantageously mirror-symmetrical to a mirror plane that divides the guide shaft in longitudinal direction so that the power tool can be operated by right-handed people as well as left-handed people. An especially ergonomic configuration of the loop handle results when the loop handle, when viewed in the direction from the first end to the second end of the guide shaft and in the usual or regular working position of the power tool, extend upwardly and is curved. The center of the bending radius of the loop handle is located advantageously above the battery housing and on the side of the loop handle that is facing the battery housing. In known internal rotor motors the motor shaft is supported in the area of its ends. In case of an external rotor motors, this is not possible as a result of the tool member being arranged at one end of the motor shaft. Since the motor shaft can be supported only at the upper end and its central area, in operation of the power tool very high bending moments acting on the motor shaft may result. In order to prevent in operation of the power tool an excessive loading of the motor shaft by bending moments, it is provided that the motor as a whole is elastically supported. In this way, when transverse loads occur, the motor can yield and tilt so that the entire bending moment is not introduced into the motor shaft. This can be achieved in a simple way in that the fastening flange of the motor is inserted between housing ribs of the motor housing and in this way is secured in the motor housing. The housing ribs are comprised in particular of plastic material and therefore have themselves a sufficient elasticity. The plastic material is advantageously a substantially shape-stable plastic material and not an elastomer. In this way, a sufficient stability in operation of the power tool can be achieved. Alternatively, it can also be provided that the motor is supported by means of a separate component with its own defined elasticity, for example, a piece of sheet metal, in the motor housing. In order to prevent excessive movement of the motor shaft, it is provided that the power output part upon loading transverse to the longitudinal direction of the motor shaft is supported on a housing rim of the motor housing. The housing rim delimits in this connection in particular an air exit gap for the cooling air that is formed between the rotating power output part and the motor housing.

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that one stereoisomer may be more active than the other stereoisomers. Individual stereoisomers may be obtained by known selective synthetic procedures, by conventional synthetic procedures using resolved starting materials, or by conventional resolution procedures. Certain molecules disclosed in this document can exist as two or more isomers. The various isomers include geometric isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers. Thus, the molecules disclosed in this document include geometric isomers, racemic mixtures, individual stereoisomers, and optically active mixtures. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that one isomer may be more active than the others. The structures disclosed in the present disclosure are drawn in only one geometric form for clarity, but are intended to represent all geometric forms of the molecule.

Biopesticides The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may also be used in combination (such as in a compositional mixture, or a simultaneous or sequential application) with one or more biopesticides. The term “biopesticide” is used for microbial biological pest control agents that are applied in a similar manner to chemical pesticides. Commonly these are bacterial, but there are also examples of fungal control agents, including Trichoderma spp. and Ampelomyces quisqualis (a control agent for grape powdery mildew). Bacillus subtilis are used to control plant pathogens. Weeds and rodents have also been controlled with microbial agents. One well-known insecticide example is Bacillus thuringiensis , a bacterial disease of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera , and Diptera . Because it has little effect on other organisms, it is considered more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides. Biological insecticides include products based on: 1. entomopathogenic fungi (e.g. Metarhizium anisopliae ); 2. entomopathogenic nematodes (e.g. Steinernema feltiae ); and 3. entomopathogenic viruses (e.g. Cydia pomonella granulovirus). Other examples of entomopathogenic organisms include, but are not limited to, baculoviruses, bacteria and other prokaryotic organisms, fungi, protozoa and Microsproridia. Biologically derived insecticides include, but not limited to, rotenone, veratridine, as well as microbial toxins; insect tolerant or resistant plant varieties; and organisms modified by recombinant DNA technology to either produce insecticides or to convey an insect resistant property to the genetically modified organism. In one embodiment, the molecules of Formula One may be used with one or more biopesticides in the area of seed treatments and soil amendments.

Formulations A pesticide is rarely suitable for application in its pure form. It is usually necessary to add other substances so that the pesticide can be used at the required concentration and in an appropriate form, permitting ease of application, handling, transportation, storage, and maximum pesticide activity. Thus, pesticides are formulated into, for example, baits, concentrated emulsions, dusts, emulsifiable concentrates, fumigants, gels, granules, microencapsulations, seed treatments, suspension concentrates, suspoemulsions, tablets, water soluble liquids, water dispersible granules or dry flowables, wettable powders, and ultra low volume solutions. For further information on formulation types see “Catalogue of Pesticide Formulation Types and International Coding System” Technical Monograph no. 2, 5th Edition by CropLife International (2002). Pesticides are applied most often as aqueous suspensions or emulsions prepared from concentrated formulations of such pesticides. Such water-soluble, water-suspendable, or emulsifiable formulations are either solids, usually known as wettable powders, or water dispersible granules, or liquids usually known as emulsifiable concentrates, or aqueous suspensions. Wettable powders, which may be compacted to form water dispersible granules, comprise an intimate mixture of the pesticide, a carrier, and surfactants. The concentration of the pesticide is usually from about 10% to about 90% by weight. The carrier is usually selected from among the attapulgite clays, the montmorillonite clays, the diatomaceous earths, or the purified silicates. Effective surfactants, comprising from about 0.5% to about 10% of the wettable powder, are found among sulfonated lignins, condensed naphthalenesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkyl sulfates, and non-ionic surfactants such as ethylene oxide adducts of alkyl phenols. Emulsifiable concentrates of pesticides comprise a convenient concentration of a pesticide, such as from about 50 to about 500 grams per liter of liquid dissolved in a carrier that is either a water miscible solvent or a mixture of water-immiscible organic solvent and emulsifiers. Useful organic solvents include aromatics, especially xylenes and petroleum fractions, especially the high-boiling naphthalenic and olefinic portions of petroleum such as heavy aromatic naphtha. Other organic solvents may also be used, such as the terpenic solvents including rosin derivatives, aliphatic ketones such as cyclohexanone, and complex alcohols such as 2-ethoxyethanol. Suitable emulsifiers for emulsifiable concentrates are selected from conventional anionic and non-ionic surfactants. Aqueous suspensions comprise suspensions of water-insoluble pesticides dispersed in an aqueous carrier at a concentration in the range from about 5% to about 50% by weight. Suspensions are prepared by finely grinding the pesticide and vigorously mixing it into a carrier comprised of water and surfactants. Ingredients, such as inorganic salts and synthetic or natural gums may also be added, to increase the density and viscosity of the aqueous carrier. It is often most effective to grind and mix the pesticide at the same time by preparing the aqueous mixture and homogenizing it in an implement such as a sand mill, ball mill, or piston-type homogenizer. Pesticides may also be applied as granular compositions that are particularly useful for applications to the soil. Granular compositions usually contain from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the pesticide, dispersed in a carrier that comprises clay or a similar substance. Such compositions are usually prepared by dissolving the pesticide in a suitable solvent and applying it to a granular carrier which has been pre-formed to the appropriate particle size, in the range of from about 0.5 to about 3 mm. Such compositions may also be formulated by making a dough or paste of the carrier and compound and crushing and drying to obtain the desired granular particle size. Dusts containing a pesticide are prepared by intimately mixing the pesticide in powdered form with a suitable dusty agricultural carrier, such as kaolin clay, ground volcanic rock, and the like. Dusts can suitably contain from about 1% to about 10% of the pesticide. They can be applied as a seed dressing or as a foliage application with a dust blower machine. It is equally practical to apply a pesticide in the form of a solution in an appropriate organic solvent, usually petroleum oil, such as the spray oils, which are widely used in agricultural chemistry. Pesticides can also be applied in the form of an aerosol composition. In such compositions the pesticide is dissolved or dispersed in a carrier, which is a pressure-generating propellant mixture. The aerosol composition is packaged in a container from which the mixture is dispensed through an atomizing valve. Pesticide baits are formed when the pesticide is mixed with food or an attractant or both. When the pests eat the bait they also consume the pesticide. Baits may take the form of granules, gels, flowable powders, liquids, or solids. They can be used in pest harborages. Fumigants are pesticides that have a relatively high vapor pressure and hence can exist as a gas in sufficient concentrations to kill pests in soil or enclosed spaces. The toxicity of the fumigant is proportional to its concentration and the exposure time. They are characterized by a good capacity for diffusion and act by penetrating the pest's respiratory system or being absorbed through the pest's cuticle. Fumigants are applied to control stored product pests under gas proof sheets, in gas sealed rooms or buildings or in special chambers. Pesticides can be microencapsulated by suspending the pesticide particles or droplets in plastic polymers of various types. By altering the chemistry of the polymer or by changing factors in the processing, microcapsules can be formed of various sizes, solubility, wall thicknesses, and degrees of penetrability. These factors govern the speed with which the active ingredient within is released, which in turn, affects the residual performance, speed of action, and odor of the product. Oil solution concentrates are made by dissolving pesticide in a solvent that will hold the pesticide in solution. Oil solutions of a pesticide usually provide faster knockdown and kill of pests than other formulations due to the solvents themselves having pesticidal action and the dissolution of the waxy covering of the integument increasing the speed of uptake of the pesticide. Other advantages of oil solutions include better storage stability, better penetration of crevices, and better adhesion to greasy surfaces. Another embodiment is an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the emulsion comprises oily globules which are each provided with a lamellar liquid crystal coating and are dispersed in an aqueous phase, wherein each oily globule comprises at least one compound which is agriculturally active, and is individually coated with a monolamellar or oligolamellar layer comprising: (1) at least one non-ionic lipophilic surface-active agent, (2) at least one non-ionic hydrophilic surface-active agent and (3) at least one ionic surface-active agent, wherein the globules having a mean particle diameter of less than 800 nanometers. Further information on the embodiment is disclosed in U.S. patent publication 20070027034 published Feb. 1, 2007, having patent application Ser. No. 11/495,228. For ease of use, this embodiment will be referred to as “OIWE.” For further information consult “Insect Pest Management” 2nd Edition by D. Dent, copyright CAB International (2000).

Other Formulation Components Generally, when the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III are used in a formulation, such formulation can also contain other components. These components include, but are not limited to, (this is a non-exhaustive and non-mutually exclusive list) wetters, spreaders, stickers, penetrants, buffers, sequestering agents, drift reduction agents, compatibility agents, anti-foam agents, cleaning agents, and emulsifiers. A few components are described forthwith. A wetting agent is a substance that when added to a liquid increases the spreading or penetration power of the liquid by reducing the interfacial tension between the liquid and the surface on which it is spreading. Wetting agents are used for two main functions in agrochemical formulations: during processing and manufacture to increase the rate of wetting of powders in water to make concentrates for soluble liquids or suspension concentrates; and during mixing of a product with water in a spray tank to reduce the wetting time of wettable powders and to improve the penetration of water into water-dispersible granules. Examples of wetting agents used in wettable powder, suspension concentrate, and water-dispersible granule formulations are: sodium lauryl sulfate; sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate; alkyl phenol ethoxylates; and aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates. A dispersing agent is a substance which adsorbs onto the surface of particles and helps to preserve the state of dispersion of the particles and prevents them from reaggregating. Dispersing agents are added to agrochemical formulations to facilitate dispersion and suspension during manufacture, and to ensure the particles redisperse into water in a spray tank. They are widely used in wettable powders, suspension concentrates and water-dispersible granules. Surfactants that are used as dispersing agents have the ability to adsorb strongly onto a particle surface and provide a charged or steric barrier to reaggregation of particles. The most commonly used surfactants are anionic, non-ionic, or mixtures of the two types. For wettable powder formulations, the most common dispersing agents are sodium lignosulfonates. For suspension concentrates, very good adsorption and stabilization are obtained using polyelectrolytes, such as sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates. Tristyrylphenol ethoxylate phosphate esters are also used. Non-ionics such as alkylarylethylene oxide condensates and EO-PO block copolymers are sometimes combined with anionics as dispersing agents for suspension concentrates. In recent years, new types of very high molecular weight polymeric surfactants have been developed as dispersing agents. These have very long hydrophobic “backbones” and a large number of ethylene oxide chains forming the “teeth” of a “comb” surfactant. These high molecular weight polymers can give very good long-term stability to suspension concentrates because the hydrophobic backbones have many anchoring points onto the particle surfaces. Examples of dispersing agents used in agrochemical formulations are: sodium lignosulfonates; sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates; tristyrylphenol ethoxylate phosphate esters; aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates; alkyl ethoxylates; EO-PO block copolymers; and graft copolymers. An emulsifying agent is a substance which stabilizes a suspension of droplets of one liquid phase in another liquid phase. Without the emulsifying agent the two liquids would separate into two immiscible liquid phases. The most commonly used emulsifier blends contain alkylphenol or aliphatic alcohol with twelve or more ethylene oxide units and the oil-soluble calcium salt of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid. A range of hydrophile-lipophile balance (“HLB”) values from 8 to 18 will normally provide good stable emulsions. Emulsion stability can sometimes be improved by the addition of a small amount of an EO-PO block copolymer surfactant. A solubilizing agent is a surfactant which will form micelles in water at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration. The micelles are then able to dissolve or solubilize water-insoluble materials inside the hydrophobic part of the micelle. The types of surfactants usually used for solubilization are non-ionics, sorbitan monooleates, sorbitan monooleate ethoxylates, and methyl oleate esters. Surfactants are sometimes used, either alone or with other additives such as mineral or vegetable oils as adjuvants to spray-tank mixes to improve the biological performance of the pesticide on the target. The types of surfactants used for bioenhancement depend generally on the nature and mode of action of the pesticide. However, they are often non-ionics such as: alkyl ethoxylates; linear aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates; aliphatic amine ethoxylates. A carrier or diluent in an agricultural formulation is a material added to the pesticide to give a product of the required strength. Carriers are usually materials with high absorptive capacities, while diluents are usually materials with low absorptive capacities. Carriers and diluents are used in the formulation of dusts, wettable powders, granules and water-dispersible granules. Organic solvents are used mainly in the formulation of emulsifiable concentrates, oil-in-water emulsions, suspoemulsions, and ultra low volume formulations, and to a lesser extent, granular formulations. Sometimes mixtures of solvents are used. The first main groups of solvents are aliphatic paraffinic oils such as kerosene or refined paraffins. The second main group (and the most common) comprises the aromatic solvents such as xylene and higher molecular weight fractions of C9 and C10 aromatic solvents. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are useful as cosolvents to prevent crystallization of pesticides when the formulation is emulsified into water. Alcohols are sometimes used as cosolvents to increase solvent power. Other solvents may include vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters of vegetable and seed oils. Thickeners or gelling agents are used mainly in the formulation of suspension concentrates, emulsions and suspoemulsions to modify the rheology or flow properties of the liquid and to prevent separation and settling of the dispersed particles or droplets. Thickening, gelling, and anti-settling agents generally fall into two categories, namely water-insoluble particulates and water-soluble polymers. It is possible to produce suspension concentrate formulations using clays and silicas. Examples of these types of materials, include, but are not limited to, montmorillonite, bentonite, magnesium aluminum silicate, and attapulgite. Water-soluble polysaccharides have been used as thickening-gelling agents for many years. The types of polysaccharides most commonly used are natural extracts of seeds and seaweeds or are synthetic derivatives of cellulose. Examples of these types of materials include, but are not limited to, guar gum; locust bean gum; carrageenam; alginates; methyl cellulose; sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC); hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). Other types of anti-settling agents are based on modified starches, polyacrylates, polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene oxide. Another good anti-settling agent is xanthan gum. Microorganisms can cause spoilage of formulated products. Therefore preservation agents are used to eliminate or reduce their effect. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to: propionic acid and its sodium salt; sorbic acid and its sodium or potassium salts; benzoic acid and its sodium salt; p-hydroxybenzoic acid sodium salt; methyl p-hydroxybenzoate; and 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT). The presence of surfactants often causes water-based formulations to foam during mixing operations in production and in application through a spray tank. In order to reduce the tendency to foam, anti-foam agents are often added either during the production stage or before filling into bottles. Generally, there are two types of anti-foam agents, namely silicones and non-silicones. Silicones are usually aqueous emulsions of dimethyl polysiloxane, while the non-silicone anti-foam agents are water-insoluble oils, such as octanol and nonanol, or silica. In both cases, the function of the anti-foam agent is to displace the surfactant from the air-water interface. “Green” agents (e.g., adjuvants, surfactants, solvents) can reduce the overall environmental footprint of crop protection formulations. Green agents are biodegradable and generally derived from natural and/or sustainable sources, e.g. plant and animal sources. Specific examples are: vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters thereof, also alkoxylated alkyl polyglucosides.

Pesticidal Activities The disclosed pesticidal compositions may be used, for example, as nematicides, acaricides, pesticides, insecticides, miticides, and/or molluscicides. In one particular embodiment, a method of controlling pests comprises applying a pesticidal composition comprising a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III near a population of pests. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III are generally used in amounts from about 0.01 grams per hectare to about 5000 grams per hectare to provide control. Amounts from about 0.1 grams per hectare to about 500 grams per hectare are generally preferred, and amounts from about 1 gram per hectare to about 50 grams per hectare are generally more preferred. The area to which a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III is applied can be any area inhabited (or maybe inhabited, or traversed by) a pest, for example: where crops, trees, fruits, cereals, fodder species, vines, turf and ornamental plants, are growing; where domesticated animals are residing; the interior or exterior surfaces of buildings (such as places where grains are stored), the materials of construction used in building (such as impregnated wood), and the soil around buildings. Particular crop areas to use a molecule of Formula One include areas where apples, corn, sunflowers, cotton, soybeans, canola, wheat, rice, sorghum, barley, oats, potatoes, oranges, alfalfa, lettuce, strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, crucifers, pears, tobacco, almonds, sugar beets, beans and other valuable crops are growing or the seeds thereof are going to be planted. It is also advantageous to use ammonium sulfate with a 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound when growing various plants. Controlling pests generally means that pest populations, pest activity, or both, are reduced in an area. This can come about when: pest populations are repulsed from an area; when pests are incapacitated in or around an area; or pests are exterminated, in whole, or in part, in or around an area. Of course, a combination of these results can occur. Generally, pest populations, activity, or both are desirably reduced more than fifty percent, preferably more than 90 percent. Generally, the area is not in or on a human; consequently, the locus is generally a non-human area. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used in mixtures, applied simultaneously or sequentially, alone or with other compounds to enhance plant vigor (e.g. to grow a better root system, to better withstand stressful growing conditions). Such other compounds are, for example, compounds that modulate plant ethylene receptors, most notably 1-methylcyclopropene (also known as 1-MCP). Furthermore, such molecules may be used during times when pest activity is low, such as before the plants that are growing begin to produce valuable agricultural commodities. Such times include the early planting season when pest pressure is usually low. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be applied to the foliar and fruiting portions of plants to control pests. The molecules will either come in direct contact with the pest, or the pest will consume the pesticide when eating leaf, fruit mass, or extracting sap, that contains the pesticide. The 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound can also be applied to the soil, and when applied in this manner, root and stem feeding pests can be controlled. The roots can absorb a molecule taking it up into the foliar portions of the plant to control above ground chewing and sap feeding pests. Generally, with baits, the baits are placed in the ground where, for example, termites can come into contact with, and/or be attracted to, the bait. Baits can also be applied to a surface of a building, (horizontal, vertical, or slant surface) where, for example, ants, termites, cockroaches, and flies, can come into contact with, and/or be attracted to, the bait. Baits can comprise a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be encapsulated inside, or placed on the surface of a capsule. The size of the capsules can range from nanometer size (about 100-900 nanometers in diameter) to micrometer size (about 10-900 microns in diameter). Because of the unique ability of the eggs of some pests to resist certain pesticides, repeated applications of the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be desirable to control newly emerged larvae. Systemic movement of pesticides in plants may be utilized to control pests on one portion of the plant by applying (for example by spraying an area) the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III to a different portion of the plant. For example, control of foliar-feeding insects can be achieved by drip irrigation or furrow application, by treating the soil with for example pre- or post-planting soil drench, or by treating the seeds of a plant before planting. Seed treatment can be applied to all types of seeds, including those from which plants genetically modified to express specialized traits will germinate. Representative examples include those expressing proteins toxic to invertebrate pests, such as Bacillus thuringiensis or other insecticidal toxins, those expressing herbicide resistance, such as “Roundup Ready” seed, or those with “stacked” foreign genes expressing insecticidal toxins, herbicide resistance, nutrition-enhancement, drought resistance, or any other beneficial traits. Furthermore, such seed treatments with the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may further enhance the ability of a plant to better withstand stressful growing conditions. This results in a healthier, more vigorous plant, which can lead to higher yields at harvest time. Generally, about 1 gram of the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III to about 500 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide good benefits, amounts from about 10 grams to about 100 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide better benefits, and amounts from about 25 grams to about 75 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide even better benefits. It should be readily apparent that the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used on, in, or around plants genetically modified to express specialized traits, such as Bacillus thuringiensis or other insecticidal toxins, or those expressing herbicide resistance, or those with “stacked” foreign genes expressing insecticidal toxins, herbicide resistance, nutrition-enhancement, or any other beneficial traits. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used for controlling endoparasites and ectoparasites in the veterinary medicine sector or in the field of non-human animal keeping. The 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound are applied, such as by oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, granules, by dermal application in the form of, for example, dipping, spraying, pouring on, spotting on, and dusting, and by parenteral administration in the form of, for example, an injection. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be employed advantageously in livestock keeping, for example, cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, and geese. They may also be employed advantageously in pets such as, horses, dogs, and cats. Particular pests to control would be fleas and ticks that are bothersome to such animals. Suitable formulations are administered orally to the animals with the drinking water or feed. The dosages and formulations that are suitable depend on the species. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used for controlling parasitic worms, especially of the intestine, in the animals listed above. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be employed in therapeutic methods for human health care. Such methods include, but are limited to, oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, granules, and by dermal application. Pests around the world have been migrating to new environments (for such pest) and thereafter becoming a new invasive species in such new environment. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used on such new invasive species to control them in such new environment. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used in an area where plants, such as crops, are growing (e.g. pre-planting, planting, pre-harvesting) and where there are low levels (even no actual presence) of pests that can commercially damage such plants. The use of such molecules in such area is to benefit the plants being grown in the area. Such benefits, may include, but are not limited to, improving the health of a plant, improving the yield of a plant (e.g. increased biomass and/or increased content of valuable ingredients), improving the vigor of a plant (e.g. improved plant growth and/or greener leaves), improving the quality of a plant (e.g. improved content or composition of certain ingredients), and improving the tolerance to abiotic and/or biotic stress of the plant. Before a pesticide can be used or sold commercially, such pesticide undergoes lengthy evaluation processes by various governmental authorities (local, regional, state, national, and international). Voluminous data requirements are specified by regulatory authorities and must be addressed through data generation and submission by the product registrant or by a third party on the product registrant's behalf, often using a computer with a connection to the World Wide Web. These governmental authorities then review such data and if a determination of safety is concluded, provide the potential user or seller with product registration approval. Thereafter, in that locality where the product registration is granted and supported, such user or seller may use or sell such pesticide. A 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be tested to determine its efficacy against pests. Furthermore, mode of action studies can be conducted to determine if said molecule has a different mode of action than other pesticides. Thereafter, such acquired data can be disseminated, such as by the internet, to third parties. The disclosed pesticidal composition comprising a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used to control a wide variety of pests.

10160941,Photobioreactor,2016-04-20,0,1,"This invention relates to the field of photobioreactors for growing or producing microorganisms or biomass such as microalgae. BACKGROUND As the atmospheric prevalence of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) has increased over the previous decades, both governments and private entities have increasingly focused on new technologies for reducing and sequestering CO 2 and other anthropogenic emissions. This is especially true in the field of power or electricity generation where power plants operate through the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal or natural gas, and emit significant amounts of CO 2 along with other greenhouse gases (GHG). Microorganisms such as microalgae and cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae) are well known to consume CO 2 as a part of their growth process. Thus, one area of CO 2 emission reduction research and technological advancement has been in the development of photobioreactors. A photobioreactor (PBR) may refer to a device or system that supports biological activity or growth and can rely on the use of a light source. Photobioreactors may be used to grow and cultivate microorganisms such as algae or cyanobacteria. Aiding in the microorganisms' growth process, a photobioreactor may be utilized for removal of CO 2 and GHG emissions from a power plant or other GHG emitting structure by capturing the emitted CO 2 or GHG and introducing it into the photobioreactor. The introduced CO 2 or GHG may thus assist the growth of the microorganisms, and the microorganisms' consumption of the flue gas thus operates to remove the GHG from the system, effectively filtering the gaseous emissions. Photobioreactors may also be similarly utilized in a variety of pollution control or treatment systems by relying on the microorganisms grown in the photobioreactor to capture or remove harmful particles, such as fertilizers from runoffs or effluent discharge in farms or chemicals in sewage. In addition to acting as a treatment system, photobioreactors offer the ability to effectively grow and harvest algae, which has many known beneficial uses. Various types of algae are known to be useful as a biofuel, fertilizer, or nutritional source, to name a few current uses for algae. Presently known photobioreactors tend to be extremely complicated systems consisting of elaborate tube structures with a flow control mechanism for circulating water within the tube structures. In one example of a known photobioreactor, Burbidge et al. reportedly disclose a photobioreactor comprising an upstanding core structure; a plurality of substantially transparent tubes supportable by the core structure; flow means; and withdrawal means, where the plurality of transparent tubes are helically wound in parallel (U.S. Pub. Application No. 2003/0228684). In U.S. Pub. Application No. 2011/0159581, Another example of a known photobioreactor is reported by Zhang et al. to disclose an airlift circulation microalgae photoautotrophic-heterotrophic coupling photo bioreactor for wastewater treatments carbon emission mitigation. Furthermore, non-patent literature including “Closed Photobioreactor Assessments to Grow, Intensively, Light Dependent Microorganisms: A Twenty-Year Italian Outdoor Investigation,” published in 2008 by the Open Biotechnology Journal, generally discusses the state of photobioreactor technology. Each of these references is incorporated herein, by reference, in its entirety. These and other complex design features increase the cost to produce, install, and operate these known photobioreactors, while not necessarily improving their efficiency or production output. Additionally, due to the size and complication of the system, presently known photobioreactors are usually embodied in large, gaudy structures which have marginal utility beyond the structure's primary purpose as a photobioreactor. Moreover, large structures generally lack transportability. Accordingly, new photobioreactor systems and structures are desired to improve upon one or more of these deficiencies and expand photobioreactors' uses. The invention is directed to these and other important ends.

4074997,Plant plug,1976-06-17,0,1,"There is a need in the aquarium field for means of using soil in aquariums for growing certain rooted aquatic plants. Prior to the present invention soil was placed in a small pot; the pot was carefully lowered into an aquarium with some sand or gravel on top of the soil to keep the soil from dispersing (by floatation) in the water of the aquarium; and then the pot was buried under gravel in the aquarium. Fish in the aquarium would inevitably disturb the gravel covering the pot, and the soil thereunder would disseminate throughout much of the aquarium. Pruitt I [USPat. No. 2,988,441] alleged that when polymeric materials which are foamable (to form a stable open-celled foam structure) are mixed with plant nutrients in chemical combination with a water-insoluble ion-exchange resin and thereafter foamed, a stable synthetic water-insoluble foamed product (which provides a unitary plant-growing medium for intensive plant culture) results. This growing medium is purported to require no added nutrients, soil or other plant-supporting matrix. It is said to support good plant growth without exacting care, to require only watering and to be adaptable to small household or larger greenhouse, garden or decorative operations. Pullen [USPat. No. 3,102,364] concerns transplanter pot compositions comprising bagasse pith, a celluslosic fibrous material, and one or more of the following materials: Spanish moss, a wet-strength resin and/or a fungicide. Germano [Canadian Pat. No. 722,589] provides a synthetic plant-culture medium or carrier comprising an agglomerate with a binder. The synthetic medium or carrier, e.g. in the form of a block of any desired shape, preferably consists of an agglomerate with two types of particles having different properties; one may be a resilient synthetic substance capable of absorbing and retaining water, air and/or plant nutrition elements, whereas the other may comprise particles of at least one hard filler of organic or mineral origin. Herret [USPat. No. 3,336,129] concerns formulations of, e.g., soil and/or known active agents or agricultural chemicals incorporated within or admixed with insoluble cross-linked polymeric materials. His plant growth media comprise minor amounts (in the order of from about 0.001 weight percent to about 5 weight percent or greater) of particulate insoluble cross-linked polymeric materials in admixture with major amounts of natural growth media. Natural growth media include soil, sand, peat moss and/or vermiculite. In addition, his plant growth media may, alternatively, contain active agents, such as water, fertilizer, herbicides, fungicides, nematocides, and/or insecticides, soil-conditioning agents as well as diluents. What is meant by active agents, soil-conditioning agents and diluents is well illustrated by exemplification. Pruitt II [USPat. No. 3,373,009] concerns an integral nutrient plant growth medium having a stable, water-insoluble, open-celled foamed polymer matrix in which is intimately imbedded plant nutrients in a leach-resistant nutrient mixture. Rack [USPat. No. 3,834,072] makes a shape-retaining substrate for a plant by reacting foaming-agent-free polyurethane constituents in situ with dried peatmoss, foam flakes and a plant-nutrient mixture. Bishop [USPat. No. 3,842,537] provides a shaped solid plant-growth medium from water-soluble adhesive admixed with coconut-husk fiber and pulp. The medium is stated to have the ability to absorb moisture and nutrients that may be added thereto without becoming water-logged form over-watering. Schwab [USPat. No. 3,877,172] is directed to a foamed hydrophilic plastic plant-growth medium which may contain one or more fillers, such as vermiculite, montmorillonite and perlite. Glueck [USPat. No. 3,899,850] contemplates a shaped solid carrier body for a plant which comprises a mixture of foam flakes and nutritives bonded together by means of a non-water-soluble foamed-plastic binding agent. The carrier body includes filler materials, and the nutrient is preferably uniformly distributed throughout the foamed plastic so that it is gradually supplied to the plant and also easily absorbed by the latter. In connection with plastic foam material a number of patents have issued which involve plastic foam of particular interest to the instant inventor. Some of these patents are reviewed: Wood I [USPat. No. 3,812,618] relates to a method for preparing a seedfoam-fabric composite (wherein the foam is a crosslinked hydrophilic foam) for protecting seed during germination. Wood II [USPat. No. 3,812,619] relates to horticultural foam structures using hydrophilic crosslinked polyurethane foam as a carrier, such foam allegedly providing an effective means to protect dormant seed, as well as means to sustain seed germination and plant growth. The foam can contain organic filler, such as humus, sand, vermiculite, nutrients, fertilizer, pesticide and dye, intimately combined therewith and uniformly distributed therein. Wood III [USPat. No. 3,833,386] uses a similar hydrophilic foam as a precursor in the preparation of porous ceramic structures. Cogliano [USPat. No. 3,874,964] uses similar hydrophilic foam as carpet backing. Wood IV [USPat. No. 3,889,417] contemplates a hydrophilic foam for seed germination and which may also contain fertilizer (nitrogen, potassium, potash and magnesium), insecticide, fungicide, nematocide, soil conditioner, mulch, dye, radiation-control substance, enzymes, hormones and/or vermiculite. Wood V [USPat. No. 3.903,232] relates to foam structures prepared by using an isocyanate-capped polyoxyethylene polyol reactant with large amounts of an aqueous reactant. HYPOL is the trademark for a presently-marketed foamable hydrophilic polymer. A weighted plant plug for use in aquariums for rooting and growth aquatic plants in water comprises a growth-supporting and plant-holding (preferably hydrophilic foam composition substantially permanently bound to a solid weighted component which precludes the plant plug from floating in water. The invention has several (product) aspects, each of which is an intermediate in the preparation of the weighted plant plug (e) and is not necessarily devoid of independent utility: (a) A plant-food enriched admixture, e.g. one having equal parts by weight of loam, clay, peat moss and builders' sand; (b) A substantially homogeneous composition comprising approximately equal volumes of admixture (a) and a plastic-foam-forming water/hydrophilic-prepolymer admixture, the volume ratio of water to prepolymer being, e.g. from about 7 to 1 to about 13 to 1, and preferably about 10 to 1; (c) A substantially homogeneous composition comprising admixture (a) as filler in hydrophilic prepolymer which is subsequently water-cured to a water-retaining, non-rigid, open-cell foam, the amount of prepolymer being sufficient to sustain (after curing) the entire composition as an integral solid, the integral solid preferably comprising moisture; (d) A substantially homogenous sand-filled and water-cured hydrophilic-prepolymer foam, the amount of prepolymer being sufficient (on curing) to sustain the cured foam as a rigid integral solid and the volume ratio of water to sand prior to prepolymer cure being, e.g., about 1 to 3; and (e) A composite shaped article having two ends, one end of which comprises a major proportion by volume and is of composition (c), whereas the other end of which serves as a weighting component and is foam (d) in which the volume ratio of water/prepolymer/sand (prior to prepolymer cure in situ) is, preferably, about 10/1/30; the two ends being firmly secured to each other, and the weighting component being sufficient to preclude the composite from floating in water. The process aspects of the invention are apparent from the ensuing description. An object of the instant invention is to provide a substrate which favors the rooting and growth of plants, even when submerged in water. Another object is to provide a substrate which will remain integral under conditions prevailing when submerged in aquarium water. A further object is to provide a substrate which will not float and which will tend to remain where placed on a surface submerged in water. A still further object is to provide the substrate in the form of hydrophilic foam. Other objects include chemically bound soil, such soil bound to nutrients and a plural-part substrate with the several parts firmly and substantially-permanently bonded together even when submerged in water over an extended period of time. Additional objects are apparent from the detailed description of the invention. A plant-food-enriched admixture (a) of loam, clay, peat moss and builders' sand is prepared. The plant food comprises any ingredient which enhances or facilitates the growth or health of a plant as well as any ingredient which counteracts, retards or prevents attack of plant life by elements, conditions, microorganisms, parasites, insects, etc. Such plant food is primarily, but not necessarily, concerned with providing a source of nitrogen, phosphorus (e.g. in the form of phosphoric acid) and/or potassium (e.g. in the form of a potash) and includes one or more ingredients referred to by Herrett [U.S. Pat. No. 3,336,129] as an """"active agent"""", defined as a material (organic, inorganic, organo-metallic or metallo-organic) which, when in contact or in close association with plants, alters, modifies or promotes their growth, their well-being or longevity either directly or indirectly. Available marketed plant foods having, e.g., equal parts by weight of sources of nitrogen, phosphours and potassim, such as """"NUTRI-20"""", are suitable either alone or in combination with any other plant food. The weight ratio of loam/clay/(peat moss)/builders' sand) can vary, e.g. independently, from about 0.8 to about 1.2 parts of each, but it is preferred to have substantially equal amounts by weight of each. The amount and precise type of plant-food enrichment are not critical factors beyond the limitation that the amount must be sufficient to effect its purpose in the context of the cured, water-retaining foam product filled therewith. It has been found that by increasing the amount of builders' sand so that the ratio of loam/clay/(peat moss)/(builders' sand) is about 1:1:1:1.2, the water-cured hydrophilic prepolymer foam is denser than water and will not float in an aquarium even without a separate weighting component. By """"loam"""" is meant any rich, dark soil. The term, """"clay"""", is used to include natural plastic mixtures of silica and alumina, e.g. bentonite and montmorillonite, which contain other constituents. Peat moss is any plant, e.g. of the genus, Sphagnum, which becomes peat. A hydrophilic foam-forming prepolymer is admixed with admixture (a) and with from about 7 to about 13, preferably about 10, times its volume of water before being cured into a substantially homogeneous, solid, water-retaining, non-rigid, open-cell foam. Since the prepolymer is thoroughly admixed with the components of admixture (a) prior to curing, such components act as filler for and an integral part of the resulting foam. The amount of prepolymer necessary is only that required to maintain the resulting cured foam integral both in air and when submerged in water. Ordinarily the volume of foam-forming prepolymer is from about one eighth to about one fourteenth that of admixture (a) combined therewith. Any hydrophilic foam-forming prepolymer is useful for this purpose as long as the cured foam obtained therefrom is water-retentive, non-rigid, open-cell foam which is effectively water insoluble and non toxic to plants and to fish. The filled and cured foam must effectively retain its integrity even when submerged in water over prolonged periods of time. A water-curable plastic-foam-forming prepolymer is most advantageously employed for this purpose. Suitable prepolymers are the foam-forming prepolymers disclosed by Wood [USPat. No. 3,812,618, USPat. No. 3,812,619 and USPat. No. 3,889,417] or by Cogliano [USPat. No.3,874,964]. Water-curable hydrophilic foam-forming polyurethane prepolymers of the type disclosed in these patents are particularly useful for the intendedpurpose. The thus-prepared filled foam (plant-growth medium) chemically bonds and holds together the soil, plant food and other ingredients of which it is composed, and yet it permits roots to penetrate without hampering their growth. The bonding of components and the insolubility of the composite provides a product which will not cloud an aquarium in which it is submerged and is not adversely affected by under-gravel filters. The plant-growth medium is useful for sprouting seeds, starting (rooting) cuttings and growing terrestial house plants in addition to providing a substrate for growing plants submerged in an aquarium. Moreover, plants grown in such a plastic-foam medium are easily transplanted without disturbing their roots or shocking their growth. Unfortunately, thus-filled foam is less dense than and thus floats in water. This is a deterrent to its use for growing aquatic plants in an aquarium. A, e.g., shaped volume of such foam can be weighted to an extent sufficient to preclude its floating in water. Any water-insoluble material which has a sufficiently-high density, is substantially non-toxic to plants and fish and will not deteriorate or decompose when submerged in water over prolonged periods is useful for this purpose, particularly if it can be firmly secured in or to the filled foam. A weighting component which is particularly useful is prepared by admixing the same or a similar hydrophilic prepolymer with sand, the proportion of prepolymer being at least that required (after curing) to retain the sandfilled cured polymer as an integral solid. Since the sand is denser than the polymer, particularly when the prepolymer is a foam-forming prepolymer, the greater the ratio of sand to prepolymer, the greater the density of the sandfilled product. If the same foam-forming hydrophilic prepolymer is employed, the volume ratio of water to prepolymer is, e.g., from about 7 to about 13 and preferably about 10, whereas the volume ratio of sand to prepolymer is from about 20 to about 35, preferably about 30. When a shaped volume of plant-growth medium is cured concurrently and in contact with a shaped volume of sand-filled prepolymer (of the same type as used in the plant-growth medium), the polymer secures the two shaped volumes together at their interface to make an effectively permanent bond therebetween. The larger the interface, the more permanent and secure the bond. The produced composite can be in any shape, e.g. the form of a right circular cylinder (one end of which is the weighting component) or that of a truncated cone (flower-pot shape). Likewise, if the filled and cured foam is prepared without a weighting component, it can also be in any desired shape. When the shaped plant-growth medium (with or without a weighting component) is used for rooting a seed or a cutting or for growing a plant, it should be thoroughly wetted first. This can be accomplished by placing it in water and squeezing it from one end to the other a sufficient number of times, e.g. about ten, to remove most of the air therein. Then, slice (from one end) through about half of the foam and separate sufficiently to insert the roots, seed or cutting in the separation. If the foam does not spring back to essentially its precut position, a rubber band or other holding device can be used around the upper portion to hold the foam together. The stem of plant cuttings placed into the shaped foam should be free of leaves. When the foam has a weighting component and is used in an aquarium, it need not be placed under gravel. If it is, it should not be covered by more than a fine layer. In any event, the """"crown"""" of a plant should not be covered. From the preceding description one skilled in the art can prepare and use the subject invention in each of its aspects. The following specific embodiments merely illustrative and do not, in any way, limit the remainder of the disclosure. In the examples which follow, quantities are expressed in parts by weight and in parts by volume. The relationship between parts by weight and parts by volume is the same as that between grams and cubic centimeters or between 62.5 pounds and one cubic foot."

10098276,Soil injection system and method,2017-02-06,0,1,"The present invention relates in general to soil injection systems and methods. It more particularly relates to such systems and methods for injecting a various different substances into soil for a variety of purposes. There is no admission that the background art disclosed in this section legally constitutes prior art. The use of fluid substances such, for example, as hydrogels or liquids as a soil amendment or other is well established. There are a number of different types of fluid substances including liquids and gels have been injected into the soil to help plant growth. For example, polyacrylamide (PAM), starch and polyacrylate gels have been used for this purpose. Use of hydrogels allows the retention of moisture in the soil or around crop roots. Substantial reduction in the use of irrigation water may be achieved by applying appropriate dosages of PAM to soil or other growing mediums for many applications. Reduction in the amount of irrigation water applied in agricultural and landscape applications may have the additional benefit of slowing the build-up of unwanted salts introduced through irrigation water. Additionally, additives may be incorporated into hydrogels, thereby effecting large savings in the amount of additives used, and consequently, in the amount of additives released to the environment. Such additives may include fertilizers and pesticides as well as others. For record purposes, the following is a list of prior patents and applications disclosing various methods and devices for applying products to the soil: U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,871,529; 2,214,083; 2,789,522; 3,017,200; 3,148,643; 3,602,166; 3,791,322; 3,926,131; 4,018,170; 4,034,686; 4,178,860; 4,850,291; 5,115,750 and 5,667,019; and U.S. patent applications Nos. 2002/0148396 and 2006/0230997. A variety of machines have been developed to facilitate the placement of hydrogels below the soil surface. These include tractor powered units that open up the soil surface through the use of specially designed plows and then drop dry granular material into the open slit. Other hand-held machines may use water and/or air to assist with insertion and transport of hydrogel solutions into soil at various depths through an injection device such as a hollow needle or spike. Landscape applications may require application of hydrogels in areas that have existing landscaping such as turf, shrubs and trees. Therefore, a machine used for many such applications should be maneuverable and compact. A number of methods for applying hydrogels are known in the art. These include broadcasting, mixing with soil, or filling holes in the soil with a mixture of gel and a soil mix. These methods are all discussed in product literature from various manufacturers and/or distributors of these materials. Most methods are labor intensive, often involve an additional step in the planting process, and may cause damage to existing crops, plants, or turf. Each of these factors may contribute to inefficient use of the gel. Furthermore, each of these factors suffer from the disadvantage that they fail to distribute a uniform and consistent layer of the somewhat viscous gel below the surface of the soil to hold water for the plant roots. In short, the prior known distribution techniques have failed to effectively and efficiently deposit desired quantities of fluid substance below the surface of soil in a uniformly consistent manner to help plant growth or otherwise serve as an effective soil amendment."
7562682,Hydraulic pruning attachment,2008-08-20,0,1,"This invention relates to an apparatus for use with landscaping equipment and, more specifically, to a pruning attachment that may be connected to working end of a hydraulic machine, such as a front-end loader or a back-hoe, that has auxiliary hydraulic line connections for such attachments. Existing industrial hedgers and cutting tools are typically single purpose vehicles that include either a single cutting blade or a plurality of cutting blades that are fixed to either a stationary or a rotating cutting blade arm. These hedgers operate in a single or at most two planes. As a result, such hedgers are limited as to the types of operations they can perform. Where multiple operations are contemplated, the operator is required to change either an attachment or the orientation of the blades. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,404,655 to Randall, dated Jul. 23, 1946, describes a Machine for Felling Trees. This machine provides two saws, one mounted horizontally and the other mounted vertically. The horizontal blade is used for felling trees, whereas the vertical blade is used for cutting the felled trees into logs. The two blades are not mounted on the same bearing member and cannot be used concurrently. A Dec. 11, 1951 patent issued to Miller et al. for Tractor Mounted Brush Saw, U.S. Pat. No. 2,577,906 identifies a machine having two or more saws mounted on a frame positioned at the front end of a tractor. The saws are operated by individual power units, so that the speed of each can be varied independently. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 2,624,380 for Brush Saw to L. N. Haynes, dated Jan. 6, 1953, has two saw blades that are carried forward of the front end of a tractor. Although each saw blade assembly may be tilted upwardly from a horizontal position, there appears to be no structure which would allow for the blades to be positioned alongside the tractor. Vertically-Adjustable Tree-Felling Tractor Mounted Saw was issued to Ryals on Dec. 1, 1953, as U.S. Pat. No. 2,661,035. This invention describes a saw blade apparatus attached to the front end of a tractor. The assembly includes a frame that allows the single blade to be raised or lowered and to be moved sideways from one front corner of the tractor to the opposite front corner. The structure of this invention does not permit the blade to be moved to the side of the tractor or to be tilted from the horizontal to the vertical. Whitmore obtained U.S. Pat. No. 2,940,486 on Jun. 14, 1960, for Pruning Apparatus. This invention is permanently mounted, and is not adapted as an attachment. The Whitmore machine also appears not to be capable of lowering the saw blade bearing arm to ground level with the blades in a horizontal orientation. The downwardly movement of the saw blade arm is limited by the height above ground of the trailer frame. Accordingly, this machine does not appear capable of orienting the saws so that they are at ground level. U.S. Pat. No. 3,157,016 was granted on Nov. 17, 1964, to Leydig et al. for a Tree Topper With Reciprocating Cutter Boom. This machine, includes an articulated boom which carries a cutter arm having multiple saw blades. The cutter arm is raised and extended from the front of a self-propelled vehicle, such as a tractor, however the cutting apparatus is not an add-on that can be adapted to various vehicles. Additionally, in the Leydig invention the cutting apparatus is carried on the front of the vehicle and, is not borne laterally on the vehicle and thus would be unable to prune the lower sides of hedges. A second patent was issued on Jul. 6, 1965, to Leydig as U.S. Pat. No. 3,192,695 for Tree Trimming Machine Or the Like. This machine is somewhat different from that of the previous Leydig patent, but is also a dedicated piece of equipment rather than an attachment adaptable to various vehicles. The cutter arm in this machine is capable of trimming bushes in a direction lateral to the direction of travel of the machine on the side of the vehicle. The cutting arm may also be tilted, but appears incapable of being extended to ground level. A third patent to Leydig et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,487,615 dated Jan. 6, 1970 is for Double-Boom Hedger. This is an interesting machine in which the vehicle resembles a bulldozer having two cutting arms connected forward of the vehicle. The cutting arms hydraulically extend upwardly, and may also be deployed laterally from the vehicle; however, the cutting arms cannot be tilted sufficiently to reach ground level. U.S. Pat. No. 4,592,398 was issued on Jun. 3, 1986, to Golob et al. for Continuous Tree Harvestor [sic]. This invention appears directed to the cutting, harvesting and bundling of small trees such as Christmas trees. The cutting apparatus is positioned along the front of the vehicle and at relatively close to ground level but does not have the capability of being turned sideways relative to the vehicle. Grant received U.S. Pat. No. 5,430,999 on Jul. 11, 1995, for Tree Trimming And Pruning Machine. This invention provides a cutting arm bearing multiple saw blades. The cutting arm is extendable hydraulically to reach the tops of trees and the blades may be turned so as to be oriented horizontally, However this machine cannot cut a vertical swath beside the vehicle as the hydraulic arm extends only directly ahead of the vehicle and not beside it. Industrial Vehicle With Adjustable Boom Members to Edwards, U.S. Pat. No. 6,085,505, dated Jul. 11, 2000, describes a machine that is dedicated to cutting and is not an attachment for a pre-existing vehicle. Saw blades are borne on a hydraulically extendable boom and the cutting arm includes a pivot linkage that allows the blades to be turned from a vertical alignment to a horizontal alignment allowing the topping of trees. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION With the foregoing in mind, the present invention advantageously provides a saw attachment, rather than a dedicated vehicle, having cutting blades mounted on an elongated cross-arm member that may be oriented horizontally, vertically and at any angle therebetween relative to the direction of travel so that topping, trimming, cutting, and brush removal may all be accomplished using a single piece of equipment that can be attached to the working end of a front-end loader, a back-hoe or any other piece of industrial machinery, referred to herein as a host vehicle. In the preferred embodiment, the host vehicle will have connections for accepting hydraulic attachments. The invention commonly includes a base plate on which is mounted the base unit of a pivot plate hydraulic cylinder, the base plate is pivotally connected to a pivot plate to which a working end of the pivot plate hydraulic cylinder is also connected. Attached to the underside of the pivot plate is a swing arm which is carried on a rotatable connection, such as a pivot or axle, so that it is capable of turning through 180° of arc relative to the connection. The swing arm has at either end along its lengthwise extent a circular saw blade that is also borne on a mechanical rotatable connection that is driven by a belt or chain-drive mechanism located inside the swing arm that rotates the circular saw blades. The mechanism is driven by a swing arm motor mounted on the pivot plate and hydraulically connected to the rotatable connection of the swing arm. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention could work equally well with an electrical swing arm motor driven from connections to the battery of the host vehicle In a first embodiment this saw attachment assembly is connect able to a hydraulic host vehicle, such as a Bob Cat™ or a front-end loader by replacing the bucket of those vehicles with an extension assembly that is slidably connected to the connector plate. The extension assembly has a hydraulic cylinder actuator that can be used to slide the support plate to the side of the connection plate. This attachment will properly be completed by the addition of a safety guard that attaches to the arm on either blade, or across the length of the entire arm. In an alternative embodiment, the base plate, pivot plate and swing arm having two circular saw blades are mounted laterally at the terminal end of an articulated, hydraulic extension arm. The hydraulic extension arm is attached to the working end of a back-hoe in place of its shovel. In the specification there have been disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention, and although specific terms are employed, the terms are used in a descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. The invention has been described in some detail, but it will be apparent that various modifications and changes can be made within the spirit and scope of the invention as described in the foregoing specification and as defined in the appended claims."
6056885,"Ozone disinfecting, decontaminating and deodorizing of animal manure",1998-03-23,0,1,"This invention relates to a method and apparatus for using ozone to disinfect, decontaminate and deodorize animal manure. The appropriate disposal of organic waste has long been a problem, and this problem continues to grow as human and animal population densities increase. A broad variety of pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, parasites and protozoans, survive in this organic environment. Specific microorganisms that might be present include: Fusarium monthforme Cladosporium (fungi species) Flavobacterium urborescens Clastridtum sporogenes Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Aerobacter aerogenes Bacillus subtilin Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pseudomonas fluorescens Cladosporium resinoe Aeromonium Fusarium Alternaria Bacillus terminalis Flavobacterium diffusm Achromobacter Pseudomonas oleovorans Pseudomonas (all species) formicans Salmonella schottmuellen Salmonella typhimurium Salmonella oranienburg Salmonella typhosa Klebsiella pneumonine Achromobacter sp. Aerobacter acrogenes Aerobacter cloacae Diplococcus pneumoniae Escherichia coli Escherichia freundii Escherichia intermedium Micrococcus vitreus Micrococcus pyogenes var. albus Micrococcus pyogenes var. aureus Paracolobactrum intermediates Proteus mirabilis Proteus morganii Proteus sp. Proteus vulgaris Sarcina sp. Shigella madampenis Streptococcus pyogenes, alpha hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes, beta hemolytic Yeast is also present in addition to the fungi and bacteria listed above. Additionally, bacteria that might be present include heterotrophic bacteria, autotrophic bacteria, sheathed and stalked bacteria, and sulfur bacteria. Heterotrophic bacteria includes the following: Bacillus megatherium sp. Staphylococcus epidermitis and var. Pseudomonas sp. Serratia sp. Flavobacterium sp. Bacillus myocides Bacillus subtilin Aerobacter aerogenes Clostridium sp. Coccus sp. Pseudomonas fluorescens Escherichia sp. T. thiooxidans T. tiopartus T. dentrificans Sulfur bacteria includes the following: Desulfovibrio sp. Iron bacteria Thiobacillus sp. Industry has long sought a method of disposing of the wastes and pathogenic organisms without infecting the environment, humans, domestic animals, or the food chain. Great volumes of manure are produced each year which are exported or repackaged for domestic use. For example, manure could be used as fertilizer for gardens, farms, golf courses, etc., or as feed for animals. Such reuses are dangerous, however, if the manure contains significant amounts of pathogens. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized the problems which disposal of pathogen infested waste can present. In response to these problems, the EPA has issued guidelines at 40 CFR .sctn. 257 concerning land disposal of waste which contains pathogens. The EPA regulations recognize three separate categories of waste in the form of sludge: unstabilized sludge, sludge exposed to a process to significantly reduce pathogens (PSRP), and sludge exposed to a process to further reduce pathogens (PFRP) """"Unstabilized sludge"""" has not been exposed to any pathogen reducing process, is not suitable for land disposal, and can only be incinerated, buried or heat dried. Sludge which undergoes a process to significantly reduce pathogens PSRP, such as anaerobic digestion, heat treatment, lime stabilization, or air drying, can be disposed on land only if public access to the land is controlled for a period of from 12 to 18 months. Finally, sewage which undergoes a process to further reduce has PFRP has no disease related restrictions on reuse. Unfortunately, previous PFRP methods have been expensive, highly energy intensive processes such as irradiation or thermal processing which are unsuitable for transforming the sewage sludge into a readily reusable end product such as fertilizer. Another drawback with these PFRP met hods is that they fail to destroy some parasites, such as the ascarid. The ascarid is a type of helminth worm that is a common parasite in the intestines of humans and animals. Particularly susceptible to helminthiasis (intestinal infestation with helminths) are ruminants such as sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, horses, and mules. Ammonia has been found to be toxic to ascarides. A known method of disinfecting waste involves mixing the waste with an ammonia source. However, such method is not suitable if the waste is to be used as fertilizer or feed. U.S. Pat. No. 4,793,927 to Meehan et al., which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses such a method for disinfecting waste with ammonia. According to Meehan et al., sewage is mixed with ammonia, a silicate and a setting agent to form an impermeable mass in which the ammonia may be used to destroy parasites in the sewage. The problem with using ammonia is that large quantities of ammonia are required to disinfect the manure. In addition, the resulting product is in the form of a friable, clay-like mass. Another problem with the use of ammonia is that the pH in the manure is raised. As a result, if the disinfected manure were later used as fertilizer, the beneficial life forms generally found in soil, such as earthworms and vegetation, would not be able to survive in the basic environment. In addition, because of the high pH, the disinfected manure, especially chicken manure, could not later be used as animal feed. Primarily, disinfected manure with a high pH has a burning effect on animals and vegetation with which it comes it contact. Another problem with using ammonia is the hazards in transportation and handling. Human exposure to high concentrations of ammonia can result in serious injuries. Ozone has been used to disinfect soil. Ozone (O.sub.3) is a powerful oxidizing agent. Ozone has 150% of the oxidation potential of chlorine and almost twice the oxidation potential of bromine. Unlike chlorine or bromine or halogenated compounds, ozone has a negligible deleterious effect on the environment because ozone breaks down into simple diatomic oxygen on reaction with an organic or inorganic agent. Moreover, ozone also readily self-destructs into simple diatomic oxygen due to its inherent instability especially under U.V. radiation. Ozone breaks down large complex organic molecules into smaller molecules and eventually into H.sub.2 O and CO.sub.2 or very small organic molecules. Ozone kills living cells and organisms by oxidizing the cell walls. When living cells are exposed to ozone for a sufficient period of time, lysing of cell walls occurs releasing the cytoplasm of the cells and causing death of the cells. While methods of using ozone to disinfect contaminated soil are known, they have not been applied to decontaminating manure. U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,635 to Pryor, which is herein incorporated by reference, discloses a method for killing biological life forms in soil including good bacteria by injecting an ozone-containing gas into the soil. According to Pryor, the soil is either left in the earth or removed from the field for in-vitro treatment of ozone gas. Ozonation is also used as a method to decontaminate soil that has been contaminated with hazardous hydrocarbons. This method is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,508 to Hansen et al., which is herein incorporated by reference. Hansen, et al. teaches creating a small particle slurry from the soil, and treating it with ozone gas. According to Hansen et al., the contaminated soil is mixed with water and a suitable surfactant to form a slurry. The small particle slurry is then reacted with ozone gas. An important step the method disclosed by Hansen et al. is the continuous exposure of the ozone enriched slurry to ultraviolet light. Then, a flocculating material is added to the slurry and it is pressed into discrete segments such as blocks or brickettes of soil which is decontaminated and suitable for standard soil uses. In contrast to known methods for disinfecting soil, disinfecting manure heretofore has involved the use of ammonia as a disinfectant which has the aforementioned drawbacks. However, there exists a need for an efficient and effective method, such as ozonation, to disinfect manure, while simultaneously preserving nutrients and maintaining substantially a neutral pH in the disinfected manure. The disinfecting of manure heretofore has traditionally used large amounts of ammonia as a disinfectant. However, the use of ammonia is inefficient and cumbersome, as very large amounts of ammonia are required to be effective. Another drawback to the use of ammonia is that it dramatically raises the pH level of the manure so as to effect its utility on some soils and plants. This invention relates to a method for disinfecting animal manure that uses the efficient method of ozonation. A feature of the invention consists of rotating a manure slurry in a sealed ozonation chamber, where ozone gas is bubbled through the manure slurry. The living organisms, including microorganisms, bacteria, fungi, viruses, parasites and protozoans, in the manure are thereby killed from the oxidation of their cells walls, which is an effect of exposure to ozone. Thereafter, the disinfected manure is conveyed out of the ozonation chamber and collected for various safe and healthy uses as fertilizer and feed. The principle object of the invention is the provision of a method for efficiently and effectively disinfecting, decontaminating and deodorizing manure, especially pig and chicken manure. A further object of the invention is the provision of a method that will disinfect, decontaminate and deodorize manure, while at the same time preserving nutrients in the manure. Still another object of the invention is the provision of a method that will disinfect, decontaminate and deodorize manure, while maintaining substantially a lower pH level in the manure than the use of ammonia."
10104740,LED structure with a dynamic spectrum and a method,2017-06-08,0,1,"The present invention relates to artificial lighting arrangements and methods used in agriculture, horticulture and in biomass growing industry. In particular, the present invention relates to the field of optoelectronics and photobiology. The present invention relates to use of an integrated LED structure and a method in grow lights. BACKGROUND ART Greenhouse industry is experiencing an era of rapidly advancing technologies for artificial illumination. LED based luminaries have entered commercial use as grow lights relatively recently. HPS and conventional arc light sources are now moving aside and more efficient LED luminaries are emerging into markets including advanced functionalities e.g. integrated pest management (Vanninen et al., 2012). However, the potential modes of LEDs for illuminating plants are still rarely fully optimized. Currently used LED based luminaries still suffer low efficiency and provide emission spectra not well overlapping with the absorption spectra of photobiological processes such as photosynthesis. Over-exposing of plants with high intensity sources and lack of advanced control modes such as pulsed illumination are still topics not fully researched or solved in practice. A LED spectrum can be matched with photobiological requirements to enhance plants' growth and to increase the total organic output i.e. the harvested volume of a greenhouse products e.g. tomatoes or lettuce. Photobiological requirements are mainly defined by the absorption spectrum of the photosynthesis and other photobiological processes in question. There is also a need to meet the timing requirements of the illumination when operating with a pulsed light. The timing requirement arises from the chlorophyll B excitation and electron transfer delay to the chlorophyll A associated process and the potential to optimize the energy usage for driving the photosynthesis. Other natural parameters that account for the illumination requirements include e.g. partial pressure of carbon dioxide, irrigation level of soil, temperature and type of canopy. Other requirements that constitute to the required illumination spectrum may arise e.g. from marketing motives to grow vegetables with certain skin colors or the need to enhance the product's nutrition content or other effective substance. Different plants and biomass applications require slightly differing type of illumination conditions to reach optimal growth. This induces greenhouse industry to invest on many types of artificial grow lights. It is the objective of the disclosed invention to provide an integrated LED structure with adjustable emission characteristics to meet the different requirements of various biomass growing applications. A good example is e.g. the growth of red and black soybeans. According to CN103947470A and CN103947469 particular light spectrum conditions are preferred for optimum growth of red and black soyabeans, with rough blue, red, and yellow spectrum band ratios being 3:1:5 and 4:3:3 respectively, demonstrating the need for adjustable spectrum type light source to enable one artificial grow light to be used with a variety of different plants. Similarly for example tomato plant and spruce require quite different type of light to grow efficiently. The required spectrum components also vary between different growing cycles of a same plant e.g. during vegetation phase blue rich light is preferred, and flowering and fruit grow phases are typically connected with red rich light. Another requirement for adjusting the spectrum of the grow light is the need to grow e.g. vegetables with varying skin colors of e.g. bell paprika for marketing purposes or for enhancing certain nutrition components in the paprika fruit. A grow light with adjustable spectrum would also allow new functionalities not yet fully exploited in the greenhouse industry. For example it is known that a pre-harvesting treatment of kale affects strongly on the nutrition content (Carvalho et al., 2014; Lefsrud et al., 2008). Another example is the UV flash-treatment of cultivated mushrooms prior harvesting or post harvesting to enrich their vitamin D content (Beelman et al., 2009). Another example of potential benefits of a source with an adjustable emission spectrum becomes apparent when considering biomass growth applications such as algae (Nicklish, 1998). The absorption spectrum shifts from around 680 nm peak towards lower wavelength peak around 630 nm when the photoperiod becomes shorter. Similar shift in absorbance is documented in the literature (Eytan, 1974). The ratio of chlorophyll A and chlorophyll B concentration has been shown to change in time when plant is subjected to continuous illumination as e.g. in case of Red Kidney bean plants (Argyroudi-Akoyunoglou, 1970). Such change presupposes an alteration in the emission spectrum to maintain optimum growth conditions. It is clear that the grow light should allow flexible modification of spectrum characteristics to enable its use for growing different types of plants and even modifying spectrum characteristics during the different growth phases. These requirements combined with the idea of growing biomass with a pulsed light source are now tackled with the disclosed invention. Two main approaches exist to build a LED source for luminaries used as grow lights. In the first approach, the emission spectrum can be generated by combining optical output of different color discreet LEDs. This type of hybridized LED structure is often called an RGB LED. In this approach the LEDs are discreet LED components and e.g. blue-red emissions have clearly distinct spatial source points. The light is produced within the compound semiconductor pn-junction while the emission spectrum from a single pn-junction is relatively narrow, typically only 10 to 40 nm. Due to narrow emission spectrum several semiconductor chips are used in combination to provide the required wider spectrum to fully cover the red and blue wavelength bands of the visible spectrum required by e.g. photosynthesis. The required semiconductor chips can be packaged discreetly or mounted inside a same package however optically forming still a large source point. In the second approach the emission spectrum is generated within a single LED package. In this case one or several LED semiconductor chips excite wavelength conversion material or typically a phosphor material layer to generate continuous emission spectrum matching closely with the photobiological requirements. For example 425 nm LEDs chip excite an appropriately selected phosphor material layer and can provide typical double peak spectrum offering a relatively good match with the above explained requirements with the primary photobiological process of photosynthesis. One such phosphor material is based on nitridoaluminates and provides an narrow band emission spectrum with full width half maximum being only 50 nm or less and matching well the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll molecules. In short, commercial light sources, being LED, fluorescent or HPS, all still commonly apply continuous light with fixed optical spectrum. It is known that it would be beneficial to apply pulsed light to firstly save energy and secondly to apply light source that would enable spectrum adjustment to meet changing spectral requirements during the plant growth cycles, or phase of photosynthesis, or to allow use of same luminaire supporting varying light requirements. Pulsed light arrangement has been shown to benefit also algae growth (Sforza et al, 2012). PPF (photosynthetic photon flux) should be kept at level similar or equal to sun light level that is roughly 2000 μmols/m 2 /s to avoid excess light and stressing plants. Now this applies for continuous light. With pulsed light the situation changes as the dark cycle can be adjusted so that the photobiological process has time to ‘use’ the light energy absorbed during the light cycle. Thus the maximum light intensity can be increased substantially from nominal sun light level of 2000 μmols/m 2 /s e.g. to 10000 μmols/m 2 /s to allow even faster growth. However, such arrangements presumes considering the excess heat from the light source, other growth limiting parameters such as the level of carbon dioxide, and also how to avoid self-shadowing from the canopy to best utilize high intensity source. Artificial grow lights have been under research and delopment for decades (Olle et al., 2013; Klueter et al. 1980; Yeh et al. 2009). Also pulsed light sources have been introduced earlier (JPS6420034A). This source was based on discharge lamps and was able to produce pulse lengths between 1 to 50 ms. This early innovation was impaired by the fact that the discharge lamps did not meet well the required spectrum characteristics as large part of the light energy is emitted at wavelengths not needed by photobiological processes. Furthermore, the pulse lengths were not short enough to fully exploit the benefits of pulsed light. A study carried out by Tennesen with co-workers (Tennessen et al, 1995) shows the benefits of pulsed light. In this study the pulse period of 100 μs and dark periods of few ms were used. The experimental light source was assembled from discreet LED components emitting at narrow fixed wavelength bands of 658/668 nm only. First pulsed grow light based on LEDs appears in U.S. Pat. No. 5,012,609 (Ignatius). This approach was based on discreet emitters for each required wavelength band i.e. 400-500, 620-680, and 700-760 nm. The driving circuit was able to produce pulses in duration of 100 μs, i.e. at optimum length. However, the driving circuit was based on current-limiting-resistor and is considered to have a modest energy efficiency when compared to modern solutions such as the one disclosed in the disclosed invention. The main drawback of the approach was that it did not provide means to adjust the spectrum for different growth cycles. The spectrum was fixed as the discreet visible range wavelength emitters were all required to be in the same serial-parallel circuit. U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,432 (Ignatius) presents some innovations on the packaging and mounting of discreet LEDs on heat sinking substrate. However, driver circuit is still in the form of current-limiting-resistor and the spectrum is fixed with all emitters coupled in series-parallel fashion, excluding the possibility to somehow control the intensity at certain wavelength bands or to adjust the emission spectrum. WO 02/067660 discloses a system level arrangement of red and white light LEDs to optimize the emitted spectrum to speed-up the plant growth. In the disclosed structure the spectrum is fixed after the discreet LEDs have been mounted on the carrier substrate. It is clear from this and later publications discussed below that the pulsed light is preferred mode of operation to reduce the total growth time. The AC driver arrangement disclosed in US2010/244724 (Philips) provides means to reduce total cost of the system by applying same driver circuit for two discreet light sources, emitting in opposite phases of the sinusoidal AC current. Obvious issue becoming the spatial separation of the two LED strings to avoid over exposing the plants under and to gain the benefits of the pulsed lighting. U.S. Pat. No. 8,302,346 (UoG) discloses a growth enhancing system with a feedback based arrangement applying pulsed light source based again on discreet LED chips each emitting a fixed spectrum. CN 201797809 discloses light source arrangement that applies discreet LED emitters to form the required total spectrum including UV, UVB, blue and near IR. CN103947470 and CN103947469 disclose light spectrum conditions preferred for optimum growth of black and red soyabeans, with rough blue, red, and yellow spectrum band ratios being 3:1:5 and 4:3:3 respectively, demonstrating the need for adjustable spectrum type light source to enable wider use for growth of different plants. CA 2,856,725 discloses hybridized light source arrangement that would allow spectrum tunability and pulsed operation mode to prevent photosynthesis saturation. However, the presented light source structure has a system level approach based on discreet LED components mounted on printed circuit board with different emission wavelengths, and with a fixed ratio of LED emitters at individual wavelength ranges to create required spectrum. The expensive feedback system approach based on absorption and/or fluorescence sensing gives coarse feedback to allow tuning of intensity, and of the light on and off periods i.e. the light patterns. However, as the absorption of other than chlorophyll molecules such as carotenin molecules, play important role in ‘plant's’ heat sinking capability, and effectively large part of light energy is wasted when absorbance is used as a feedback. WO 20014/188303 discloses means for enhancing plant growth by adjusting the ratio of blue and red lights alone. US 2014/152194 (Beyer) discloses another system to be able to provide necessary spectrum bands for enhancing the growth. US 2013/318869 has fixed intensity ratios of characteristic peaks at wavelength bands of 400-500 nm (blue), 500-600 nm (green), 600-800 nm (red), and with 500-600 nm band to have lower intensity compared to other two. However, the said arrangement does not allow adjusting the ratio between the intensities of the said blue and red wavelength bands. US 2014/034991 and US 2006/261742 both disclose similar LED arrangement to each other that enable the tuning of the color coordinates and thus the chromaticity of the light emitted from the LED arrangement. However, these arrangements are not addressing the requirements of biomass growing applications or e.g. pulsed light operation. The emission spectrum is not meeting the photobiological requirements. The operation is defined to be continuous, while not meeting the requirement of having alternating emission spectrum of pulsed type. WO2013141824 discloses a similar LED arrangement that enables tuning of the spectrum for matching with the chlorophyll b and a absorbance. However, the arrangement is not addressing other requirements of biomass growing applications such as the pulsed light operation. The operation is defined to be continuous failing to benefit from alternating emission spectrum. SUMMARY OF INVENTION It is an aim of the present invention to provide a device for achieving biomass growth. It is another aim of the present invention to provide a method of achieving biomass growth. It is a further aim of the present invention to provide a method of adjustment of luminaire emission spectrum to allow for predetermined artificial illumination for different applications in greenhouses or for different growth cycle phases of a same plant. It is still a further aim of the invention to provide new uses for grow lights. It is still a further aim of the invention to provide a method of illumination using an integrated light emitting diode (LED) structure with an adjustable emission spectrum and ability to support pulsed light emission. The present invention provides an LED structure comprised of a substrate, a plurality of optically isolated and electrically non-independent light emission areas integrated on the substrate, a light emitting semiconductor source of a first type mounted in the emission area(s), and a light emitting semiconductor source of a second type mounted in the emission area(s). The LED structure further comprises an electrical circuit layer for connecting the light emitting semiconductor sources in serial fashion for each emission area, and a wavelength conversion material of the first type formed on the top of the said first type of light emitting semiconductor sources and a wavelength conversion material of the second type formed on the top of the said second type of light emitting semiconductor sources. The present invention also provides a method of adjusting the emission spectrum of the integrated LED structure for photobiological processes comprising the steps of generating the emission output by supplying a common current to the semiconductor light emitting sources in the LED structure; tuning the emission spectrum's multiple intensity peaks to a nominal operating point by adjusting the common current value to a mid value range; and tuning the emission spectrum's multiple peaks' intensity ratios within the full range by adjusting common current from a minimum value to a maximum value. The method allows for selecting applications requiring emission spectrum with equal intensity between 620 and 640 nm and between 650 and 670 nm by tuning the common current to a low value within the operating range of the integrated LED structure. The method also allows for selecting application requiring emission spectrum with high intensity between 620 and 640 nm and low intensity between 650 and 670 nm by tuning the common current to a high value within the operating range of the integrated LED structure. Finally, the method allows for selecting application requiring emission spectrum with low intensity between 620 and 640 nm and high intensity between 650 and 670 nm by tuning the common current to a low value within the operating range of the said integrated LED structure. Typically, the “low value” of the common current is at least 10%, preferably at least 20%, in particular 30 to 80%, lower than the mid value of the common current in the range from said minimum value to said maximum value, and the “high value” of the common current is at least 10%, preferably at least 20%, in particular 30 to 80%, higher than the mid value of the common current in the range from said minimum value to said maximum value. Considerable advantages are obtained by the present technology. Thus, the disclosed integrated LED structure finds use in grow light systems previously presented in the art, for example in WO 2013/141824 and WO 2009/045107. The disclosed integrated LED structure perfectly suits grow light systems that are applying various sensors for CO 2 , soil humidity, canopy height, or growth phase to control the illumination by the feedback from the plants and require dynamic luminaries with adjustable spectrum, tunable intensity and controllable pulse mode operation. The disclosed invention also provides an integrated LED structure that enables flexible usage of one luminaire for a large variety of biomass growing applications. The integrated LED structure, with densely packed emission areas, produces high spectral uniformity in the far field, which is difficult to produce with e.g. a discreet LED approach. Thus, the present integrated LED structure with adjustable emission characteristics will meet the different requirements of various biomass growing applications. No expensive feedback system is needed in the present technology; rather a system approach has been adopted that is based on preset or programmable pulse patterns."
8915692,Adaptable container handling system,2009-02-18,0,1,"The subject invention relates to nursery and greenhouse operations and to an adaptable container handling system including a robot which is able to pick up and transport containers such as plant containers to a specified location. Nurseries and greenhouses regularly employ workers to reposition plants such as shrubs and trees in containers on plots of land as large as thirty acres or more. Numerous, for example hundreds or even thousands of containers may be brought to a field and then manually placed in rows at a designated spacing. Periodically, the containers are respaced, typically as the plants grow. Other operations include jamming, (e.g., for plant retrieval in the fall), consolidation, and collection. See U.S. Patent Application No. 2005/0135912 incorporated herein by this reference. The use of manual labor to accomplish these tasks is both costly and time consuming. But, attempts at automating such container handling tasks have met with limited success. Large-scale or hard automation is practiced at some greenhouses especially in Europe. The “Walking Plant System” (WPS Horti System, BV) is one prominent greenhouse automation scheme. In this method, conveyor belts, tables on tracks, and other centrally controlled mechanisms maneuver containers throughout the entire production cycle—plants are never placed on an outdoor floor or on un-actuated surfaces. Thus, from seed to sale, virtually no direct human labor is needed. Such hard automation methods can be cost effective where land and labor prices are high and in operations where only one variety of plant is produced. But, in other circumstances (more typical of the U.S.), this form of automation loses some of its advantage. Because the automation components are fully integrated into the greenhouse, hard automation installations cannot easily be scaled up or down in response to demand. Further, the initial costs of a hard automation system is very high—growers essentially purchase a plant factory. Visser International Trade and Engineering, BV has automated one container manipulation task known as “spacing.” Spacing involves positioning containers on an outdoor field or greenhouse floor with a surrounding buffer space so that plants have room to grow. A forklift-sized device called the “Space-O-Mat” uses multiple actuated forks to position plants in a regular pattern as the device backs up under autonomous control. The disadvantages of the Space-O-Mat become apparent when it is used on real-world field. If the surface is somewhat soft or uneven, the Space-O-Mat may fail to deposit containers properly. Also, many greenhouse are too tightly configured to accommodate Space-O-Mat. A research project begun in 2000 and sponsored by NASA, Carnegie Mellon University, and the American Nurseries and Landscape Association developed a semi-autonomous device called Junior also intended to perform container spacing. Junior, a tractor-sized mechanism, automated part of the spacing task. Two workers move containers from a wagon to a conveyor on Junior that reaches across the wagon. The conveyor transports the plants to a mechanism with about a dozen grippers mounted on an arm. When each of the grippers has been loaded with a container, the arm activates. The arm maneuvers the plants onto the ground, spacing them relative to plants already on the ground. Then Junior backs up positioning itself to accept the next group of plants from the wagon. Junior has not been developed into a commercial product. Were Junior to be offered for sale, it would likely have a high price. Junior is also a very complex piece of equipment and might require special expertise to operate. Because of its large size Junior cannot be used inside many greenhouses. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the subject invention to provide a new robot for container handling. It is a further object of the subject invention to provide a robot which is low cost, and simple and intuitive to operate. It is a further object of the subject invention to provide such a robot which is simple in design and reliable. It is a further object of the subject invention to provide such a robot which is small enough to maneuver indoors such as inside a typical greenhouse. It is a further object of the subject invention to provide such a robot which eliminates much of the manual labor associated with nursery, greenhouse, and other growing operations. It is a further object of the subject invention to provide such a robot which reliably operates even in adverse conditions. It is a further object of the subject invention to provide such a robot which can operate for many hours and even work throughout the night. It is a further object of the subject invention to provide such a robot which is able to place containers in their designated configuration with better accuracy than human workers. It is a further object of the subject invention to provide a complete container handling system. It is a further object of the subject invention to provide such a system which is scalable. It is a further object of the subject invention to provide such a system which is safe. The subject invention, however, in other embodiments, need not achieve all these objectives and the claims hereof should not be limited to structures or methods capable of achieving these objectives. The subject invention features an adaptable container handling system including a boundary subsystem and one or more robots. Each robot typically includes a chassis, a container lift mechanism moveable with respect to the robot chassis for transporting at least one container, a drive subsystem for maneuvering the chassis, a boundary sensing subsystem, and a container detection subsystem. A robot controller is responsive to the boundary sensing subsystem and the container detection subsystem and is configured to control the drive subsystem to follow a boundary once intercepted until a container is detected and turn until another container is detected. The controller then controls the container lift mechanism to place a transported container proximate the second detected container. In one preferred embodiment, the controller controls the drive subsystem to return the robot to a prescribed container source location and controls the container lift mechanism to retrieve another container at the source location. In one example, a transmitting beacon is located at the source transmitting a signal and each robot further includes a receiver for receiving the transmitted beacon signal. The boundary subsystem typically includes reflective tape which may include non-reflective portions denoting distance. In one design, the boundary sensing subsystem includes at least one infrared emitter and at least one infrared detector and the container detection subsystem includes a linear array of infrared emitters and infrared detectors. In another design the container detection subsystem includes a camera based subsystem. One subsystem includes a laser source which emits a beam intersecting the field of view of the camera between x min and x max . The detection subsystem determines the distance between the robot and a container as a function of the angle of the beam. The camera is preferably mounted such that pixels are read out as columns rather than rows. The beam may be turned off between read outs of adjacent columns and then laser off columns are subtracted from laser on columns. The container detection subsystem may also includes a system configured to detect if a container is present in the container lift mechanism. One system includes an infrared source and an infrared detector. The preferred drive subsystem includes a pair of driven wheels one on each side of the chassis. One container lift mechanism includes a rotatable yoke, a pair of spaced forks extending from the yoke for grasping a container, and a drive train driven in one direction to rotate the yoke to simultaneously extend and lower the forks and driven in the opposite direction to simultaneously retract and raise the forks. One preferred drive train includes a first sprocket rotatable with respect to the yoke, a second sprocket rotatable with respect to the chassis, a moving link associated with the yoke interconnecting the first and second sprockets, and a means for driving the second sprocket. The system also includes a motor driving a gearbox, a driver sprocket driven by the gearbox, a third sprocket driven by the driver sprocket and fixed to the second sprocket, and a fork extending from the moving link. A forward skid plate may be mounted to the robot chassis. A typical user interface for the controller includes an input for setting the width of a bed, an input for setting a desired container spacing, an input for setting the desired spacing pattern, and an input for setting the desired container diameter The controller logic is typically configured to detect a container/boundary condition and to operate the drive subsystem and the container lift mechanism in response based on the condition. A first condition is no containers are detected before three boundaries are detected and a response to the first condition is to locate the third boundary or obstruction and place a transported container proximate the boundary or obstruction to place the first container in the first row. A second condition is no container is detected before two boundaries are detected and a response to the second condition is to follow the second boundary, detect a container, and place a transported container proximate the detected container to fill the first row with containers. A third condition is a first boundary is followed, a container is detected, the robot turns, but no additional containers are detected before a second boundary or obstacle is detected. A response to the third condition is to place a transported container proximate the second boundary or obstruction to fill a row with its first container. One container handling robot in accordance with the subject invention may include a chassis; a drive subsystem for maneuvering the chassis; a container detection subsystem; and a container lift mechanism. There is a rotatable yoke, a pair of spaced forks extending from the yoke for grasping a container, and a drive train driven in one direction to rotate the yoke to simultaneously extend and lower the forks and drivable in an opposite direction to simultaneously retract and raise the forks. A preferred version of the robot further includes a controller responsive to the container detection subsystem and configured to control the drive subsystem until a container is detected and to control the container lift mechanism to place a container carried by the forks proximate the detected container.

8418401,Photovoltaic greenhouse structure,2012-04-20,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a greenhouse structure. In particular, the present invention relates to a novel solar-energy type, photovoltaic greenhouse structure. 2. Description of Related Art A greenhouse is useful against typhoons, acid rain and insect pests, as well as in lowering temperature in summertime and keeping temperature high enough in wintertime. Because a greenhouse can provide plants or crops with suitable environment to grow, it is often used to culture plants or crops of high economic value, such as orchids or melons. As well known by persons of ordinary skills in the art, greenhouse engineering resides in selecting suitable covering materials to control the micro-climate inside the greenhouse in accordance with the biological requirements of the plants and with the local climate along with various control equipments installed inside the greenhouse to keep the plants or crops in their best conditions to grow. In order to keep the inner temperature within a suitable range, a greenhouse is usually designed to be equipped with a ventilation apparatus to ventilate excess heat during hot summer days and to raise the temperature by heaters during the harsh, cold winter days which are disadvantageous for the plants and crops. However, in certain extreme conditions, even in the presence of a ventilation apparatus, such as a ventilator, it is still very hard to keep the greenhouse within an ideal temperature condition. Accordingly, additional and expensive air conditioning is needed. Such air conditioning is costly and consumes a lot of energy. Besides, in order to control the light intensity inside the greenhouse, a greenhouse is often shaded. Excess UV light may do damage to both the physiological and biological functions of plants, such as burned leaves. At the same time, a shaded greenhouse keeps harmful UV light out as well so plants inside the greenhouse may grow in a much more favorable condition. However, the traditional way to shade a greenhouse can neither filtrate sunlight of a specific wavelength effectively nor control the light intensity or a pre-selected light band of sunlight effectively. In addition the traditional way to shade a greenhouse also blocks the sunlight, IR for example, which facilitates the growth of plants, or photosynthesis. Given the above, the current greenhouse structure still needs further improving and advancing. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the above technical problems, the present invention proposes an improved greenhouse structure to solve the abovementioned problems and drawbacks successfully. The present invention therefore proposes a novel solar-energy type, photovoltaic greenhouse. The photovoltaic greenhouse of the present invention includes a main greenhouse frame structure with multiple upstanding walls and a roof thereon to enclose a green house space, and at least one thin-film solar cell module mounted on the roof. The thin-film solar cell module is useful in converting solar energy within a pre-selected light band of sunlight into electricity and simultaneously the light which is not absorbed by the thin-film solar cell module freely passes through the thin-film solar cell module and enters the green house inner space. The sunlight freely passing through the thin-film solar cell module includes enough light which can be utilized by plants or crops for photosynthesis. In such a way, no additional money is spent as needed in the traditional way to shade a greenhouse, but adequate light intensity or adequate pre-selected light bands of sunlight is still provided within the greenhouse and, simultaneously sunlight is still sufficiently used for converting into electricity. These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings."
5176284,Reduction of flexure in a plastic container having a thin flexible side wall,1990-11-08,0,1,"The present invention generally pertains to thin-wall plastic containers and is particularly directed to reducing the flexure of such a container that occurs when the container is lifted by being gripped at an upper side wall section adjacent the rim by a thumb and finger while the container contains a substantial weight of material. In some containers, such as flower pots, the upper side wall section adjacent the rim by which the container is gripped is joined with a tapered lower side wall section by a perimetric ledge that extends in a generally lateral direction, with the upper side wall section extending from an outer edge of the ledge and the lower perimetric wall section extending inward toward the base from an inner edge of the ledge. Typically the container is lifted by gripping the upper section of the side wall with the thumb inside the container and the index finger outside the container beneath and supported by the ledge. When the side wall of such a container is made of thin flexible plastic material the interior volume of the container is extremely distorted as a result of flexure of the side wall when the container is lifted by being gripped at the upper wall section by a thumb and finger while the container contains a substantial weight of material. The present invention reduces the flexure of the thin flexible plastic side wall of the container when the container is lifted by being gripped at an upper side wall section adjacent the rim by a thumb and finger while the container contains a substantial weight of material. The plastic container of the present invention includes a base and a thin flexible perimetric side wall extending from the base and terminating in a perimetric rim; wherein the side wall includes a perimetric ledge extending generally in a lateral direction; an upper perimetric wall section extending between an outer edge of the ledge and the rim; a lower tapered perimetric wall section extending inward toward the base from an inner edge of the ledge; and a first perimetric series of longitudinal ribs spaced about all of the ledge and extending between to interconnect the ledge and the upper wall section for reinforcing the container against extreme flexure when the container is lifted by being gripped at the upper wall section by a thumb and a finger while the container contains a substantial weight of material; and a second perimetric series of longitudinal ribs spaced about all of the ledge and extending between to interconnect the ledge and the lower perimetric wall section for further reinforcing the container against extreme flexure when the container is lifted by being gripped at the upper wall section by a thumb and a finger while the container contains a substantial weight of material. The ribs are spaced so that there are at least three said ribs within each inch (2.5 cm) of the ledge. Such spacing of the ribs distributes the weight so that the pressure applied by an individual rib against the thumb and fingers is not of such a magnitude as to injure the thumb and fingers by wear as a result of extended frequent lifting of many such containers. Additional features of the present invention are described with reference to the description of the preferred embodiment."
9596827,Method for reprocessing animal bedding,2013-06-03,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to the reprocessing of animal bedding material; and more particularly to a system and process for cleaning and sanitizing animal bedding material to remove animal waste products commingled therein, permitting it to be reused as bedding or recycled as a raw material for producing other end-use products. 2. Description of Related Art Domestic animals are widely kept by humans for pleasure, sport, or doing useful work. These animals are often housed in stalls, pens, cages, or other confining enclosures in which a bedding material is disposed on the floor to absorb the liquid and solid waste products of the animal. The absorbency of the bedding material reduces the animal's contact with the waste, improving comfort and minimizing skin irritation and disease. Large animals, such as horses, produce proportionately large amounts of waste. For example, it is estimated that a typical horse weighing about 1000 pounds may produce as much as about 30 pounds of feces and 2.5 gallons of urine daily, for a total of some 50 pounds of total raw waste per day. Soiled bedding removed with the manure during stall cleaning may account for another 8 to 15 pounds per day of waste, resulting in about 12 tons of waste a year per horse. Disposal of this matter presents serious aesthetic issues and, more importantly, environmental concerns for air and water pollution if the waste enters surface bodies of water or underground aquifers. The concerns are particularly acute for farms or other facilities that house large numbers of horses or other large animals. Conventional practice is that animal bedding is used once and then discarded. Costs, both for producing new bedding and for disposing it after use, continue to increase. Most commonly, the materials used for animal bedding are plant-based. For livestock such as cattle and poultry, straw, hay, sawdust, kenaf, or wood shavings, or combinations thereof, are typically used. Equine bedding typically includes pressed wood pellets, wood shavings, kenaf, or sawdust. With the decline in construction and in manufacture of wood based products there has been a significant decline in the availability of wood pellets, shavings, and sawdust. As a result, bedding can be difficult to find and the cost has increased. Although certain synthetic, polymeric materials have been proposed for bedding, they have not received widespread acceptance in the agricultural community. Along with the supply problems, costs for disposal have also increased and available techniques are constrained by environmental concerns and, in some cases, by governmental regulations. Current methods of disposal include: i) composting, ii) spreading on land as fertilizer, iii) stockpiling near the point of generation, and iv) landfilling. Although some benefits may be derived, each of these solutions entails significant difficulties and objections. Composted manure can be used as potting soil, but the process requires a significant amount of land that is sufficiently isolated to prevent the inevitable odors from adversely impacting neighboring properties. Spreading the soiled bedding on land disperses both the waste material and the sawdust, shavings, or the like that form the base of the bedding. While the waste gradually decomposes to provide nutrients compatible with some crops, the concomitant bedding material causes dilution of the soil. As a result, dispersing the material is now being scrutinized and may ultimately be banned. Stockpiling poses a substantial risk that undesired substances may be leached into either underground aquifers or surface bodies of water. In addition, odors emanating a waste pile are objectionable. Landfill dumping incurs substantial and increasing costs for transportation and land fill operation. Moreover, many landfills do not accept manure, as it can interfere with the normal anaerobic decomposition processes if applied improperly or in excessive quantities. Governmental agencies are becoming increasingly concerned about waste management, and therefore have provided some funding through grants and low interest loans for landfill diversion. The few processes heretofore proposed for separating animal manure and recycling used bedding are typically expensive and detrimentally alter the physical structure and appearance of the material. Thus, they have not been found satisfactory and readily accepted in the marketplace. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the reprocessing of soiled animal bedding material. In various aspects, the invention provides a system and process for treating soiled bedding material to remove animal waste and provide material that can be recycled and either used again as bedding or further processed into other products. One aspect provides a process for reprocessing soiled animal bedding commingled with manure or like animal waste products. The process comprises in sequence the steps of: (i) separating soiled bedding and manure in a shaker device to send at least a preponderance of the manure to a holding tank and a remainder of the soiled bedding to a cleaning tank; (ii) first washing the soiled bedding in the cleaning tank using a first washing solution comprising water and a cleaning agent, comprising first agitating the contents of the cleaning tank for a first agitating time; (iii) draining the first washing solution; (iv) first rinsing the soiled bedding in the cleaning tank with first rinse water for a first rinsing period; (v) draining the first rinse water; and (vi) drying the bedding. The process may further comprise one or more additional cycles of washing and rinsing and/or a bleaching cycle employing a bleaching solution of water and a bleaching agent, and a rinse thereafter. Thus cleaned, sanitized, and dried, the bedding material may be reused for bedding, and may be packaged, e.g. in bags. It has been found that after a number of cycles of the present cleaning process, the bedding may no longer have a consistency and appearance that is desirable in the marketplace for high-end bedding applications. By using the processed material as a fuel, the need for costly and environmentally acceptable disposal is obviated and the material's energy content may be beneficially used, providing clear environmental benefits. The processed and decontaminated material is also usable as a feedstock for other applications. Thus, in another aspect, soiled animal bedding is cleaned and further processed to form other byproducts. For example, the cleaned bedding can be further processed and compressed into compacted shapes in the form of pellets, briquettes, or other desired shapes. All these forms can be burned as fuel. Pellets additionally may be used as an alternate form of animal bedding. Similar techniques can also be used to form fire logs or fire starter logs for domestic use. As used herein, the term fire log refers to a manufactured article sized and shaped to resemble a section of a conventional log appointed for domestic use as fuel in a fireplace, wood stove, or the like. A fire starter log is a smaller, manufactured article also intended for domestic use and adapted to catch fire readily, thus facilitating the building of a fire using other fuels in a fireplace, wood stove, or the like. Fire logs and fire starter logs are herein referred to collectively as manufactured logs. Processed, sanitized bedding can be used as feedstock for other applications as well, such as particle board. In most cases, bedding appointed for reuse must be bleached to give it the desired appearance and color. On the other hand, appearance is at most a minor issue for manufactured logs, as a dark color is ordinarily acceptable. Thus, bleaching may not be required. The washing and rinsing steps may also be omitted if the soiled bedding is destined for manufactured logs. The shaking operation removes most of the animal excrement, and what remains can be adequately decontaminated by heating and drying the bedding, e.g. in a rotary drum dryer, and with the logs compacted thereafter. Optionally, suitable additives are included in the final manufactured log product, e.g. to give it desired appearance and mechanical integrity. The additives may also be selected to impart a pleasing aroma or to provide different colors in the flames as the product burns. Such additives may include, for example, wax and/or potpourri. In another aspect, there is provided a system for reprocessing soiled animal bedding material commingled with animal manure to form cleaned bedding material. The system has provision for receiving water from a water source and comprises a shaker device, a holding tank, a first cleaning tank, and a dryer, wherein: (i) the shaker is configured to separate the soiled bedding material to send at least a preponderance of the manure to the holding tank and the soiled bedding material to the first cleaning tank; (ii) the first cleaning tank is configured to receive the soiled bedding material from the shaker and water from the water source and to discharge water through at least one drain; (iii) the first cleaning tank comprises an agitator configured to cause motion of bedding material within the first cleaning tank; and (iv) the dryer is in communication with the first cleaning tank to receive washed bedding material therefrom. Optionally, the system includes a second cleaning tank so that two washing steps can be carried out in sequence by transferring material from the first cleaning tank to the second cleaning tank. The second cleaning tank is configured to receive water from the water source and to discharge water through at least one drain. It comprises an agitator configured to cause motion of bedding material within the second cleaning tank. In some embodiments, the system includes a packaging system, such as a bagging system configured to receive the material after the cleaning and drying operations and package it into bags for storage and distribution. Alternatively, the system includes a press configured to compact the cleaned material into a compacted product, such as pellets, briquettes, or manufactured logs. The system also optionally includes one or more waste water holding tanks that receive process water from one or more of the washing, rinsing, and bleaching cycles. The water may then be processed for reuse."
9265192,Systems and methods for detecting soil characteristics,2014-08-26,0,1,"BACKGROUND Agricultural growing operations operate efficiently when, among other things, seeds are planted in soil having optimal soil characteristics and the seeds are provided optimal amounts water and nutrients. Soil characteristics (e.g., soil composition, soil density, nutrient presence, humus presence, etc.) vary from location to location, both globally (e.g., from geographic region to geographic region) and locally (e.g., from spot to spot within a single area of land). Further, the presence of soil moisture from natural sources or from man-made irrigation systems, varies from location to location. Generally, a single agricultural growing operation involves planting a specific type of seed according to a set pattern over many acres of land (e.g., planting a field of corn in rows). Soil characteristics will often vary over the area of land used for the agricultural growing operation. Despite the variances in soil characteristics, seeds are generally planted in the same manner across the entire area of land used for growing operation. Further, many agricultural growing operations utilize man made delivery systems for water, nutrients, fertilizers, and/or other chemicals and soil additives. The delivery systems are buried or placed on the surface of the soil. The delivery systems are at risk of being damaged or destroyed as agricultural equipment disturbs the soil to plants seeds, harvests crops, and tills soil material. One exemplary embodiment relates to a soil detection and planting apparatus. The apparatus includes a vehicle and a controller coupled to the vehicle. The apparatus further includes a planting device coupled to the vehicle, the planting device configured to plant seeds or plants into a soil material.

The soil sensor is configured to scan a soil material up to a designated depth beneath a surface of the soil material to locate at least a portion of an irrigation system contained within the soil material or on a surface of the soil material, wherein the soil sensor is further configured to provide a sensor feedback signal relating to the detected portion of the irrigation system to the controller. The apparatus includes a location sensor coupled to the aircraft. The location sensor is configured to provide a location feedback signal to the controller. The controller is configured to create a map of the soil material including a location of the portion of the irrigation system based on the sensor feedback signal and the location feedback signal. A further exemplary embodiment relates to a method of operating a vehicle including a controller. The vehicle is configured to map soil characteristics and plant seeds or plants. The method includes detecting intrinsic soil characteristics of a soil material through a ground penetrating radar unit coupled to the vehicle, wherein the ground penetrating radar unit is configured to scan the soil material up to a designated depth beneath a surface of the soil material, and wherein the ground penetrating radar unit is further configured to provide a sensor feedback signal to a controller with respect to the intrinsic soil characteristics. The method further includes, in response to the intrinsic soil characteristics, instructing a planting mechanism coupled to the vehicle to plant a seed or a plant.

The method includes tracking a location of the vehicle through a location sensor coupled to the vehicle. The method further includes creating a map of an area of land traversed by the vehicle, wherein the map includes detected intrinsic soil characteristics, wherein the map is configured to be later updated to include the location of a planted plant or a planted seed. The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description."
6056064,Method of harvesting sod,1998-07-15,0,1,"This application discloses an improvement of the invention disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/686,555 filed Jul. 26, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,775,436 issued Jul. 7, 1998. This invention relates to a method of harvesting sod using a sod harvester; that is, a machine for cutting strips of sod from the ground and automatically forming those strips into rolls. A sod harvester usually has a horizontal blade which severs the sod from the ground at the desired thickness, in combination with two vertical side blades which cut the sod to the desired width. Thus, a continuous strip of sod is formed as the harvester travels along its cutting path. A vertical cutter blade periodically is driven into the sod adjacent the undercutting blade to sever the strip to length. As the strip of sod is cut, it is conveyed away from the cutter blade, usually up an inclined conveyor, for forming into rolls. U.S. Pat. No. 3,509,944 (Brouwer et al.) discloses a prior art sod harvester which includes such an inclined conveyor, and in which the rolls of sod are formed adjacent the upper end of the conveyor. The sod harvester disclosed in the '944 patent is designed to be mounted at the side of a farm tractor, by which the harvester is propelled. U.S. Pat. No. 4,832,130 (Brouwer et al.) discloses a self-propelled sod harvester. In this case, the harvester also includes an inclined conveyor but in this case, the strip of sod is delivered by the conveyor into a separate roll-forming enclosure which includes a pair of conveyors disposed generally at right angles to one another, for forming the roll. The formed rolls are discharged onto a cart at the end of the harvester which can convey the formed roll to either side of the cart and clear of the harvester on its next pass. The '130 patent also discloses a curved conveyor for discharging formed rolls clear of the harvester. U.S. Pat. No. Re. 34,827 (Dover, et al.) discloses a method of and apparatus for cutting sod in which a sheet of netting is inserted into the sod roll as it is formed. The disclosures of U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,509,944, 4,832,130 and Re. 34,827 are incorporated herein by reference. Large rolls of sod produced by sod harvesters can be difficult to handle. For example, a large roll may be, say, four feet in diameter and, accordingly, will be relatively heavy. Mechanical equipment such as forklift trucks are required to handle and transport the rolls. At the site at which the sod is to be laid, the roll must be appropriately positioned and oriented so that it can be unrolled where the sod is required to be laid. Manipulating and moving the sod after it has been unrolled can be difficult. Other methods of harvesting and handling sod include formation of small rolls or slabs of sod that are stacked and transported on pallets. While these methods are not as efficient in terms of manpower as methods in which the sod is harvested in large rolls, they do have the advantage that the individual rolls or slabs can easily be handled at the laying site and manoeuvred into place. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method of harvesting sod that combines the advantages of various prior art methods. The method of the invention involves the provision of a sod harvester which includes cutter means for forming a strip of sod as the harvester travels along a cutting path, and sod roll-forming means to which the strip of sod is delivered from the cutter means and which is adapted to form the strip of cut sod into a roll. A strip of sod is formed by causing the sod harvester to travel along the cutting path. The sod is cut transversely with respect to the cutting path at intervals selected to form the strip into a series of discrete end-to-end slabs of sod. In advance of the roll-forming means, a wrapping material is continuously introduced against a surface of a series of slabs of sod which will form the outer side of the roll formed in the roll-forming means. Formation of the roll is continued until the roll comprises a unitary structure of multiple layers of slabs of sod wrapped in the wrapping material. This structure can be handled and transported to a laying site as a unit, and slabs can be removed individually from the structure for laying. In other words, the invention combines the efficiency of mechanically forming sod into a large roll that can be handled and transported as a unit, with the ease of handling and manipulation of the sod at the laying site that is possible with small slabs of sod. A minimum of manual labour is required to form the rolls. The rolls can be transported and handled using forklift trucks or the like. At the laying site, the large roll can be tipped onto its side (so that the axis of the roll is generally upright). The wrapping material can then be peeled away and the individual slabs of sod removed from the roll, transported and laid by hand. Typically, the wrapping material will be a plastic netting that allows the sod to """"breathe"""". The rolls of sod can be formed with the dirt side out in accordance with the teachings of the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/686,555 (the '555 application), or with the grass side out as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,832,130 (supra). The netting or other wrapping material is applied to whichever side of the series of slabs of sod will be at the exterior of the roll. In the case of the sod harvester of the '130 patent, therefore, the netting would be applied to the grass side of the slabs. In this context, it is to be understood that the method of the invention is not restricted in its application to the sod harvester of either the '555 application or the '130 patent mentioned previously. Where the method is used with a harvester as disclosed in the '555 application, the roll-forming means need not comprise a pivotal roll-forming unit as disclosed in that application. Preferably, the roll-forming means includes first and second linear conveyors arranged at a substantial angle with respect to one another so that the second conveyor in use causes the leading end portion of a leading slab in the series of slabs to tend to turn back on itself for forming a roll. Preferably, the harvester also includes an intermediate conveyor that is inclined upwardly from the cutter means of the harvester to the roll-forming means, and the conveyors are driven at ground speed as disclosed in the '130 patent (supra) so that the slabs stay together with no spacing or only minimal spacing therebetween as they are formed into a roll."

Animals often go into areas where they are not wanted. A cat's behavior around the home may be particularly troublesome. For example, a cat may eat garden or house plants. Also, a cat may use any available soil, even an inside planter, as a latrine. This produces undesirable results: plants are dug up and killed, dirt is spread around the house, and undesirable waste and resulting odors are present. Various methods have been tried to prevent this behavior. Substances noxious to cats, for example, peppers and chili peppers, have been spread on the soil. Devices delivering electrical shocks have been installed. Fences of various designs have been used. The previous methods have not proved satisfactory in one or more respects. Some methods are not very effective, some are too expensive, and some prevent easy personal access to the soil for care, such as watering and weeding. Consequently, it has been desirable to have an improved animal barrier, particularly for covering soil containing plants. This invention is an animal barrier and it generally comprises a substantially open, substantially rigid grid of wire or other material, such as plastic, and a plurality of spikes of various lengths, heights and angles connected to the grid and projecting upward therefrom. In a preferred embodiment, the grid has a slit from its periphery inward for placing the grid around said stem of a plant, long spikes are at substantially right angles to the grid and slanted spikes are between 45.degree. and 80.degree. to the grid. The method of making an animal barrier from a grid of transverse and longitudinal wires joined at their intersections comprises the steps of severing a traverse wire adjacent each side of a first intersection, severing the longitudinal wire that is at the first intersection between the first intersection and an adjacent intersection in a first direction, bending the severed traverse wires upward from their adjacent intersections, and bending the severed longitudinal wire upward from the intersection adjacent the first intersection in a second direction opposite the first direction. Other features and many attendant advantages of the invention will become more apparent upon a reading of the following detailed description together with the drawings in which like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout."

5893201,Installation tool for irrigation emitter barbs,1997-09-04,0,1,"This invention relates to the field of irrigation tools, and, more particularly, to a tool for installing irrigation emitter barbs in irrigation tubing. It is common to use plastic tubing to distribute water to various locations for irrigation purposes. In such use, hollow irrigation emitter barbs are mounted as desired on the plastic tubing. Such barbs are hollow allowing the water contained within the tubing to be distributed, or emitted, as desired. Small diameter flexible tubing can be mounted on the barbs to place the water where desired. Irrigation emitter barbs are generally symmetrical and are provided with sharp piercing points at both ends to penetrate the wall of the tubing. Further, enlarged heads are provided to impede the withdrawal of the barb from the tubing. While irrigation emitter barbs can be installed by hand, the sharp piercing points can cause injury to workers. In fact, the present invention was inspired after applicant viewed the bloodied hands of workers installing a large number of such irrigation emitter barbs. Various types of installation tools are well known in art. For example, punch tools have been employed which punch the hole in the tubing for the subsequent placement of irrigation emitter barbs. However, installation still requires handling of the sharp piercing points by the installer. U. S. Pat.

8585796,Bactericidal and fungicidal phosphite compositions and related methods,2012-07-09,0,1,"The invention relates to the field of fertilizer compositions that can be used to treat both fungal and bacterial plant pathogens and, more particularly, to fertilizer compositions that include a phosphite ingredient that is individually effective against both fungal and bacterial plant pathogens. BACKGROUND Phosphorus-based fertilizers are one of three critical nutrients for agriculture around the world. The others are nitrogen and potassium. All important phosphorus-based fertilizers comprise phosphate, e.g. phosphate ion (PO 4 −3 ), and occasionally some proportion of polyphosphates, i.e. P 2 O 7 −4 , are included in the composition. Polyphosphates are ionic species formed by condensed phosphate ions (PO 4 −3 ) as illustrated in Formula 1. 2PO 4 −3 +H 2 O→P 2 O 7 −4 +2OH −   Formula 1 Polyphosphates are sometimes referred to as pyrophosphates. Additional phosphate ions may react further with the polyphosphate, P 2 O 7 4 , to form longer polyphosphates and, in general, there is a mixture of varying polymer chain lengths in any given sample. The presence of some proportion of polyphosphates in a fertilizer is useful for purposes of sequestration of impurities, as suspensions aids, and for making phosphorus more available to plants. U.S. Pat. No. 3,917,475 describes a process for the preparation of a fertilizer containing a significant amount of polyphosphate. Formation of polyphosphate is favored by high concentrations of reactants and by high reaction temperatures, followed by rapid cooling. However, at high temperatures, the chemical bonds in polyphosphate can hydrolyze to yield the starting phosphate ion, (PO 4 −3 ) and acid, as shown in Formula 2 (taken from Western Fertilizer Handbook , Interstate Publishers, Inc., Danville, Ill., Eighth ed., p 148, 1985). P 2 O 7 −4 +H 2 O→2PO 4 −3 +2H +   Formula 2 On the other hand, the lower valent phosphite, (PO 3 −3 ), has never played an important role in the commercial fertilizer industry. A few academic research papers have been published describing alkali metal and organic esters of polyphosphites. For instance, Payne and Skledar of the University of Glaskow in J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem., 1964, Vol. 26, pp 2103-2111 describe the preparation of “pyrophosphates” by thermal decomposition of alkali metal phosphites. An academic paper from Russia in 1970 (CA 76:71456) describes a method of preparing ammonium polyphosphite by starting with phosphorous acid that has already been polymerized and reacting it with ammonia under pressure and at high temperature. Using polyphosphorous acid as a reactant to produce polyphosphites, however, is not economically feasible for commercial production. The analysis of polyphosphite content in a composition is difficult because common wet chemical methods for determination of phosphite depend upon reagents that first convert phosphite to phosphate. These reagents will break up any polyphosphite molecules present in the composition into individual phosphite ions. Polyphosphite, therefore, cannot be detected or quantified by the routine wet chemical methods. For instance, iodine solutions are used to oxidize inorganic phosphites for subsequent analysis as phosphate. Iodine will breakup any phosphite polymer present and the polyphosphite will not be detected. Similarly, commercial labs which analyze fertilizers do not report phosphite levels but rather report them as phosphate. Also, during analytical procedures requiring heat, phosphites would typically be slowly converted to phosphate unless precautions are taken to prevent oxidation by excluding air. Furthermore, at elevated temperatures polyphosphites can be expected to hydrolyze to ordinary phosphite ion, analogously to the hydrolysis of polyphosphates under similar conditions. Accordingly, physical methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry (MS), and other physical molecular weight determining methods are useful methods for characterizing polyphosphites. NMR provides a unique method of detecting phosphite because in most cases, and particularly when in solution, it exists with a hydrogen attached to the phosphorus atom (HPO 3 −2 ). Sophisticated NMR instruments, such as the Varian VXR-300S spectrometer, can not only detect and measure P 31 but can also simultaneously perform measurements on atoms such as hydrogen attached to phosphorus or carbon by transfer polarization. Such an instrument can, therefore, detect and measure phosphite in the presence of other phosphorus species without ambiguity. Inorganic phosphite compositions such as potassium phosphite are known to be useful as fungicides, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,736,164, 5,800,837, and U.S. 2003/0029211A1, for instance. As is common with all commercial chemicals, however, and particularly so with environmentally sensitive chemicals such as fungicides, less is often better. Therefore, there is always a need for enhanced performance at an equivalent dose. In this context, potassium phosphite would be particularly useful because it would provide the second important nutrient of the three critical plant nutrients, potassium. Moreover, a polyphosphite can be expected to provide the sequestration and slow release advantages known with polyphosphate, although phosphites are more active fungicides. Currently available commercial methods for preparation of fertilizer grade potassium phosphite, KH 2 PO 3 and/or K 2 HPO 3 , are carried out by charging an aqueous potassium hydroxide solution to a mixing tank equipped with an agitator and with cooling means (commonly called a batch reactor). Alternatively, potassium carbonate could be used as a reactant instead of potassium hydroxide. Phosphorous acid is added to the potassium hydroxide, slowly at first, then more rapidly toward the end of the reaction. This process is subject to a number of problems. The reaction can be violent and on a large scale, even with good agitation and cooling, the reaction can run away explosively. In fact, at least two fatalities and numerous injuries have resulted recently from such run away reactions. During the early addition of phosphorous acid, even if the reaction does not run away, localized excessive heat release occurs, even when the overall temperature is at or below 200° F. Furthermore, it is known in the art that hazardous toxic phosphine gas, which has a characteristic garlic-like odor, may be emitted during the reaction when the temperature reaches 150° F., which creates a hazard unless properly absorbed. In addition, a batch reactor is difficult to seal and prevent oxygen in the air from entering, which readily oxidizes the phosphorous acid to phosphoric acid, preventing formation of phosphites. The necessary slow addition of the acid results in the hydroxide always being in excess until close to the end of the reaction, thus hindering formation of the desired polyphosphite. As a consequence, and also due to low temperatures, previous processes can be expected to provide little or no formation of polyphosphites. Yet another potential problem which occurs in batch processes is poor control of the addition rate of and total quantity of reactants present in the mixture. Extra care must be taken in measuring ingredients and in the rate of addition which is time consuming and labor intensive. Lack of attention by the technician can lead to an explosive run away reaction. U.S. Pat. No. 3,585,020 by Legal, Jr., et al. describes a process for forming a free-flowing, granular, non-burning and non-crumbling 7-40-6 fertilizer composition. Reference is made at column 3 to the use of an inline mixer. However, the use of spargers in the process suggests that it is specific to batch processing. In any case, the reference by Legal, Jr., et al. is specific to forming granular materials quite different from the liquid solutions prepared in the invention. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,957,947 Yamada et al. describe a process for the continuous production of aqueous basic aluminum salt solutions. The products of Yamada appear to be deodorants, and while a short tubular reactor is involved, it is necessary to provide heat on an indirect basis and the overall reaction scheme is quite different from that of the invention. The Environmental Protection Agency, classifies potassium phosphite compositions as “biopesticides” under their regulatory classification, for reduced registration requirements. As such, the active ingredient, mono- and di-potassium salts of phosphorous acid are synthesized active ingredients involving a mixed mode of action by direct toxicity to plant pathogens, and by activating the plants natural defense mechanisms, in disease suppression or elimination. Potassium phosphites are systemically absorbed by the plant and are mobile within the plant, translocating to the new growth via both the phloem and the xylem. They are rapidly absorbed by the leaf tissue and roots for maximum and efficient plant use by moving systemically upward and downward in the plants vascular system, including the root system. The mode of action is thought to be two-fold, first acting within the fungus by “walling off” the pathogen, killing off surrounding cells when attacked by disease or insects, and inhibiting further fungus growth. This is observed as yellowing around a diseased area. Secondly, the plant then responds further by activating the plant's own immune self-defense system, through rapid cytological action, and triggering other cellular phytoalexin accumulations and metabolic changes and other resistance inducers. Various chemical compounds are released that alert the rest of the plant to begin producing other compounds that increase plant resistance to infection or attack at other sites on the plant. These two types of responses are known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and induced resistance (IR). As a result, phosphites are highly selective, non-toxic fungicides active against numerous fungal pathogens, and provide both protective and curative responses against such plant disease isolates of Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia, Pythium , and Fusarium , and other plant diseases—but typically not against bacterial diseases. The extreme difficulty, or even the total lack of bacterial disease control, by induced systemic resistance compounds, including those based on the salts of phosphorous acid, and particularly the potassium salts, is well known. For example, the benchmark product, “Aliette”, a product comprising aluminum salts of phosphorous acid and EPA-registered pesticide, does not provide for any bacterial disease control. In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the invention to provide fertilizer compositions, methods of making a fertilizer composition and methods of using fertilizer compositions, wherein the fertilizer compositions comprises a first phosphite compound that is individually effective against both fungal and bacterial plant pathogens. An exemplary phosphite compound is a polyphosphite, such as, for example, potassium polyphosphite. In some embodiments in which potassium polyphosphite is used, the concentration of the potassium polyphosphite is approximately 25-75% by weight of the fertilizer composition. In some embodiments, the fertilizer composition comprises a second phosphite compound, the second phosphite having a lower molecular weight than the first phosphite compound. In such embodiments, the first phosphite compound may be a polyphosphite and the second phosphite compound may be potassium phosphite, the polyphosphite being approximately 25-75% by weight of the fertilizer composition. In some embodiments, the fertilizer compound comprises the first phosphite compound and one or more of potassium phosphate, potassium polyphosphate, and potassium phosphite. In a method aspect of the invention, a method of making a fertilizer composition comprises heating phosphorous acid and potassium hydroxide in an aqueous solution at a temperature sufficient to form a first phosphite compound, wherein the first phosphite compound is individually effective against both fungal and bacterial plant pathogens and allowing the solution to cool. Preferred temperatures are at least approximately 260° F., approximately 270° F. to approximately 285° F., or approximately 260° F. to approximately 275° F. An exemplary phosphite compound is a polyphosphite, such as, for example, potassium polyphosphite. In some embodiments in which potassium polyphosphite is produced by the method, the concentration of the potassium polyphosphite is approximately 25-75% by weight of the fertilizer composition. In some embodiments, the temperature is sufficient to form a second phosphite compound in combination with the first phosphite compound, the molecular weight of the second phosphite compound being less than the molecular weight of the first phosphite compound. Examples of second phosphite compounds having lower molecular weights than the first phosphite compound are phosphite salts such as potassium phosphite. In some embodiments, the temperature is sufficient to form both the first phosphite compound and one or more of potassium phosphate, potassium polyphosphate, and potassium phosphite. In another method aspect of the invention, a method of treating a plant for a bacterial or fungal infection comprises applying an effective amount of a fertilizer composition comprising a phosphite compound that is individually effective against both fungal and bacterial plant pathogens to a plant. An exemplary phosphite compound is a polyphosphite, such as, for example, potassium polyphosphite. In some embodiments in which potassium polyphosphite is used, the concentration of the potassium polyphosphite is approximately 25-75% by weight of the fertilizer composition. These and other objects, aspects, and advantages of the invention will be better appreciated in view of the drawings and following detailed description of the preferred embodiments."
9340466,Method for drying spent filter media,2014-08-11,0,1,"The invention relates to methods for treating spent filter media, in particular filter media containing diatomaceous earth. In other embodiments, the invention pertains to compositions that contain spent filter media, and to associated methods. The compositions of the invention are useful in various embodiments as top dressings, soil amendments, and fertilizers in lawn care applications. Vacuum filtration is a commonly used in the manufacture of a variety of agricultural, food, beverage, and biotechnology industries. In addition to the fixed equipment, production scale vacuum filtration systems such as rotary drum vacuum filters, leaf filters, and the like typically employ process aids, which are also referred to as filtration aids. These consumable aids range from fibers, cloths, and the like to particle materials such as clays, diatomaceous earth, carbon, cellulosics and associated materials and are used to coat the filters. These materials retain both insoluble and soluble impurities by various physicochemical means. Particulate materials are also sometimes added to the prefiltration supernatants and subsequently recovered from the filter as a high moisture filter cake as it accumulates on the filter surface. A number of permutations of this approach are practiced in an array of industries today. For example, diatomaceous earth (DE) is a widely used filter medium. Diatomaceous earth is frequently used, alone or in conjunction with other process aids, to clarify water, beverages including beers, wines, juices and the like, and also to clarify food ingredients such as maltodextrins, syrups and the like. An undesirable and problematic aspect of filtration systems that employ a filtration aid is the disposal of the used (spent) filtration aid. Because of the significant cost and time entailed in the recycling of filtration aids, generally the spent filter media is simply disposed of in a landfill. However, disposing of this media in a landfill is wasteful and unproductive. Materials that can be used in filtering aids often have other functionalities and utilities. Diatomaceous earth also is widely used in gardening, landscaping, and potting soil mixes. Diatomaceous earth also is used as a non-toxic, organic insecticide, where it is regarded as a safe alternative to chemical insecticides. For these applications, the diatomaceous earth is typically added as a dry mined powder. The diatomaceous earth is typically added to the final gardening, landscaping, and potting soil mix and dry blended. In these applications, the diatomaceous earth typically is devoid of biomolecules such as carbohydrates and proteins or other extraneous matter. Diatomaceous earth found in spent filter media is generally not suitable in such lawn and garden applications. The spent filter media contains a significant amount of water, and generally also contains particulates and other material such as carbon and nutrients retained from the filtration stream. If the filter media is not dried or preserved immediately, uncontrolled microbial growth can occur in the presence of the media. Such microbial growth generally will render the media unsuitable for lawn and garden applications. Diatomaceous earth may be dried, but known drying processes are deemed to be uneconomical in lawn and garden applications. Moreover, organic material entrapped in the diatomaceous earth often is undesirable. For example, organics are deemed undesired in potting soil mixes and seed bedding soils. Other approaches such as composting (as purportedly disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,604) have been suggested, but these approaches have not been widely adapted. Composting is a slow, laborious process that requires substantial time and space. Moreover, although composting does address some broad disposal issues, composting does not significantly enhance the utility of the media. Thus, the absence of a technology to efficiently recycle spent filter media reduces its value and causes users to incur disposal expense. THE INVENTION It has now been found that spent filter media, such as diatomaceous earth, may be stabilized by blending the filter media with a dry material to form a composition. A preferred source of dry material is lime, but other ingredients, such as clays, binders, surfactants, minerals, fibrous plant materials, or fertilizer ingredients that contribute plant nutrients or micronutrients may be used in conjunction with the invention. The moisture content of the composition is preferably sufficiently low to inhibit mold growth, and in preferred embodiments of the invention is below 18% by total weight. The composition preferably is provided in the form of discrete plural particles, the particles taking the form of pellets or granulated particles. The resulting composition, which preferably is biodegradable and non-toxic is useful in many commercial applications. In particular, the inventive composition has utility in turf, landscape, gardening and agronomic and/or horticultural applications, such as top dressing treatments, fertilizers, and soil amendments. The invention is deemed in preferred embodiments to find utility in highly chemically treated soil where the microbial population/density is depleted. For many such applications, entrapped organic and biological materials are believed to enhance the functionality and value of the composition. In many lawn and garden applications, materials such as peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite are used to provide soil aeration. Soil aeration compositions made with such materials are generally more expensive than those prepared in accordance with the preferred embodiments of the invention. The composition of the preferred embodiments of the invention may be used to provide soil aeration more inexpensively than can be attained using the heretofore described materials. Methods of preparing a composition and methods of use of such composition, such as those described in more detail hereinbelow, also fall within the scope of some of the various embodiments of the invention."
9949490,Agricultural compositions and applications utilizing essential oils,2015-07-02,0,1,"BACKGROUND Pesticides or pesticidal methods, such as insecticides, are generally used to increase food production, decrease the amount of disease carrying pests, and limit human contact with such pests. Currently, the primary method of controlling such pests is through the application of pesticides containing synthetic chemical compounds. Not only are such chemicals becoming less effective at controlling and/or killing the pests, but they can also cause undesirable effects on both the environment and humans. Initially many of the synthetic chemicals utilized as pesticides were very effective in controlling and/or killing the pests. However, after extensive usage the pests eventually build up a tolerance or resistance to some such chemicals. Once one chemical loses its utility, other synthetic chemical that the pests have not yet developed a tolerance for, are used. This cycle can result in a very large number of synthetic chemicals being released, largely unchecked, into the environment. The interaction of any synthetic chemical, let alone a number of such chemicals with the environment always comes with unexpected consequences. The non-selective way in which synthetic chemicals control pests also makes them undesirable. The chemicals can often have unexpected and serious detrimental effects on desirable insects or animals as well as the pest insect or animal. The chemicals can also contaminate areas in which humans have significant contact and cause serious effects on human health. Because of the large number of such synthetic chemicals in the environment, the interaction of such chemicals is inevitable. Often, the combined effect, often called the synergistic effect, of such chemicals can greatly outweigh their singular effects. Furthermore, synthetic chemicals can often persist in the environment almost indefinitely. These concerns, and others, have lead the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate and even ban a number of synthetic chemicals used as pesticides. Because of the often detrimental effects of synthetic chemical pesticides and the EPA's regulatory ban of some such chemicals, a number of alternatives to synthetic chemical pesticides have been proposed and researched. One such alternative is the use of biological organisms to control the undesired pests. Although this approach has had some significant advances and triumphs, concerns regarding the organism that is being released to control the pest will always remain. Another alternative that is seeing an increased level of interest, is the use of natural pesticides. Natural pesticides are compounds that exist in nature (e.g. in plants, animals, or other insects) and have properties that allow them to be used as is, combined, or modified to be used as pesticides. In applications utilizing essential oils, the stability and volatilization of essential oil emulsions make their use in agriculture difficult. Certain emulsifiers are ineffective to use due to their affinity for nutrients, ultimately inhibiting the ability of the composition to deliver the intended value to a seed, plant or soil. In general, embodiments of the present invention provide seed, soil, and plant treatment compositions, and methods of making and using such products and compositions. The use of these products and compositions can act as a plant protectant and increase the growth, health, and yield of various seeds and plants such as crops and grasses, and further provide similar benefit to soils. In general, embodiments of the present invention provide seed, soil, and plant treatment compositions, and methods of making and using such products and compositions. The use of these products and compositions can act as a plant protectant and increase the growth, health, and yield of various seeds and plants such as crops and grasses, and further provide similar benefit to soils. In some embodiments, a seed, soil, or plant treatment composition can comprise one or more essential oils and one or more emulsifiers, wherein the one or more essential oils are present as an emulsion and the average particle size of the one or more essential oils in the emulsion is less than about 25 microns. In other embodiments, a seed, soil, or plant treatment composition can comprise one or more essential oils one or more emulsifiers and a metal chelated compound, wherein the one or more essential oils comprise thyme essential oil, oregano essential oil, or cinnamon essential oil. In other embodiments, a seed, soil, or plant treatment composition can comprise synthetic cinnamaldehyde and one or more essential oils from the Lamiaceae family. In one example, essential oils from the Lamiaceae family can include essential oils from the Thymus genus, the Origanum genus, or combinations thereof.

6148547,Chain saw guide bar for tree harvester,1999-10-18,0,1,"This invention relates to guide bars and related apparatus for chain saws mounted on tree harvesters and more particularly to guide bar features for control of repair costs to the apparatus as a result of tree harvester accidents. The above recited pending application is directed to a tree harvester chain saw having a guide bar configured to slidably mount onto a bar holder of the saw. The invention induces proper mounting (use of supporting pins) which renders the bar less likely to break in an accident and provides for quick removal and replacement in the event a bar breaks. With the chain removed, the bar readily slides free of the bar holder and a new bar slides into its place. The present invention is directed to alternate configurations for such a guide bar and to a further modification and improvement to the guide bar of that invention. As concerns tree harvesters, the forces that are available to a tree harvester operator are great and can readily break guide bars and bar holders when applied under the right conditions. Ideally when operating a tree harvester, the maximum force applied to the bar and bar holder while cutting is about 100 lbs. and both bar and bar holder will withstand such forces for a long period of use. However, it is quite typical that the ideal conditions are interrupted by what is here referred to as accidents. An accident occurs, for example, when an upper portion of the tree being cut slips in the tree harvester grapple and the chain and guide bar are pinched between the upper and lower portions of the tree. The operator has limited means by which to free the chain and bar and often he simply applies the greater power of the tree harvester to pull the bar free of the tree. That force can readily break the chain and bar and will often be done intentionally so as to allow repairs and continuation of the tree harvesting operation. The operator carries extra chain loops and extra guide bars as they are most subject to wearing and require periodic replacement in any event. Thus if the chain and/or guide bar breaks, the operator can effect repair and return of the harvester to operative condition without undue delay. Whereas the preferred situation is that no accidents occur and thus no interruptions for repair, it is far more preferred that when a damage causing accident does happen, the guide bar will break rather than the bar holder. The bar holder is expected to last for years (as compared to the wear rate of a bar, e.g., one to three weeks) and the cost of a replacement bar holder is perhaps ten times that of a bar. Replacement of the bar holder is more complex and time consuming and most often an extra bar holder is not readily available. Thus the out of service cost for breaking a bar holder is far greater than is the breaking of the bar. As indicated, ideally there are no accidents. However, accidents (of the type described above) do happen. In the event of an accident, it is preferred that nothing breaks. The bars can be made sufficiently strong to resist breaking in many types of accidents but an occasional accident will exceed the strongest bar and either the bar or the bar holder will break. It is accordingly a further objective of the present invention to provide a bar that resists breaking but will break before the applied force is so great as to break the bar holder. It has been explained for the prior invention that a bar mounted on a tree harvester with an elongated boss of the bar holder positioned in a center slot of the bar generates a splitting force at the tail end of the bar. The tail of the bar can accordingly split at the center slot when the forces typical for normal cutting action are sufficiently exceeded. The occurrence of such splitting has been largely resolved by drilling a hole in the tail of the bar on the side of the slot that is urged to pivot away from the boss. A bolt is inserted through the hole and into the bar holder. The resistance to bar breakage is greatly increased by this modification but in many cases too much so. It then can occur that the bar holder will break before the bar. The preferred embodiment of the '895 application replaces the hole in the bar with a second or off center slot that extends to the tail end of the bar. This further modification allows the bar to be slid on and off the bar holder and avoids having to insert and remove the bolt. A permanent pin or bolt nested in the off center slot of the bar provides increased strength and resists splitting but not necessarily to the same extent as the bolt and hole arrangement. In the present invention, the bar configuration is specifically designed to protect against the breakage of the bar holder. In the preferred embodiment, the configuration of the '895 application is used. The off center slot projected along side the boss receiving center slot produces an intermediate web or finger of bar steel between the two slots. If that finger of steel breaks off, the bar will immediately break. There are a number of factors that can affect the strength of the steel finger. The length of the finger (or slot), the width and thickness of the finger and the hardness of the steel all impact on the strength of the finger and the force required to break off the finger. In the preferred embodiment, the finger length and width is primarily dictated by the bar design. A narrow tail end of the bar may be dictated by the drive sprocket and the pin diameter and its location in the bar holder does not allow for much modification of the width and length of the finger. Thus, the bar configuration is primarily designed to fit the bar holder. To the extent further strengthening or weakening of the finger is desirable, the finger can be heat treated to increase or decrease the steel hardness to achieve the desired point of breakage. A determination is made as to the force required to break a bar holder in a new condition. Some leeway is provided to account for wearing and fatiguing of a bar holder over a period of use, e.g., three years. Thus in a new condition, the bar will be designed to break at, e.g., 60-90% of the force required to break the bar holder. Assuming a 70% force to be the desired point of bar breakage, the bar finger is weakened or strengthened, e.g., heat treated to establish a breaking point at 70% of the known point of breakage of a bar holder in a new condition. In an example where a known bar holder was broken by a 4,000 lb. force applied to a bar at a point 17 inches from where it mounts to the bar holder, the bar finger of the bar designed to fit the holder was heat treated to generate a point of breakage under the same conditions at a force of 2,800 lbs. The invention will be more fully appreciated upon reference to the following detailed description and drawings referred to therein."

5387401,Method and an installation for producing granulated triple superphosphate (TSP),1993-05-26,0,1,"The present invention relates to a method and an installation for producing granulated triple superphosphate (TSP). To obtain a better understanding of the contribution of the present invention to the state of the art in question, it should be observed that the rate at which a solution of phosphoric acid reacts with phosphate depends, amongst other things, on a good distribution of phosphate grains in the acid solution. The function of this reaction is to transform the phosphorous contained in the ore in a form that cannot be assimilated by plants into another form that can be assimilated. Inserting phosphate directly into a reaction tank, i.e. into a reactor having a stirred reaction tank, would give rise: firstly to a drop in the rate at which phosphate is converted because a portion of the phosphate would leave the reactor without reacting; and secondly to losses due to phosphate escaping in the waste gases. That is why a premixer is used to mix the granulated phosphate and the phosphoric acid solution prior to entering the reaction tank. However, although it is true that a conventional premixer enables the phosphate to be wetted, use thereof gives rise in turn to problems such as blocking or clogging of the premixer and to gases and vapors being given off thereby, thus interferring with operation and requiring frequent unclogging to be performed. An object of the present invention is to eliminate these drawbacks of the methods and installations used in the prior art and it seeks to provide a method and an installation for producing granulated TSP that are substantially improved, that satisfy practical requirements better than previously known methods and installations, in particular in that: 1) present improved granulation efficiency ensuring good physical quality to the finished product with a recycling rate close to three; 2) only a small amount of dust is produced and it is suitable for proper disposal with anti-pollution standards being guaranteed in each case; 3) only a small amount of energy is required to implement the method and the equipment required is simple, reliable, and compact; 4) the method guarantees an increase in the capacity of units already in service in the range 30% to 100%; 5) above all, the method makes it possible, by using appropriate equipments, to avoid the problems usually encountered in the slurry circuits, in particular blocking or clogging by the slurry setting, and also the presence of pockets of gas and pumping; 6) the solution adopted enables starting and stopping to be performed rapidly while also making production easy to run; 7) the method can be adapted to installations that are already in service; and 8) the solution adopted is also remarkable in that it prevents return of the reaction gases. The present invention provides a method of producing granulated triple superphosphate (TSP), comprising the following steps: i preparing a slurry of previously ground phosphate and a solution of phosphoric acid; ii granulating the slurry; iii drying the granulated product; iv separating the granulated product by grain size; v disposing of and scrubbing waste gases; and iv recycling rejected finished product after grain size separation; wherein step i includes an operation of unclogging a premixer for the phosphate and the acid and situated upstream from a reactor having a reaction tank in which the acid solution attacks the granulated phosphate, which unclogging operation is performed by guided insertion of the previously ground and measured-out phosphate along a deformable axial path into the premixer and by spraying the phosphoric acid solution onto the phosphate at the end of the guided axial insertion path. In this manner, it is possible to perform granulation with optimum efficiency giving rise to a recycling rate that is close to three, which value is considerably better than the prior art value which lies in the range 5 to 5.5. In accordance with the invention, the angle between the spraying direction and the guided axial insertion path for the phosphate is greater than 60.degree. and may reach about 75.degree.. The present also provides an installation for producing granulated triple superphosphate (TSP), comprising the following devices: measuring-out equipment for measuring out previously ground phosphate; a premixer for mixing the ground phosphate as measured out with a solution of phosphoric acid, the premixer having a cylindrical top portion running into a tapering bottom portion; a stirred-tank reactor receiving the phosphate and the phosphoric acid solution premixed in this way and intended to allow the phosphoric acid to attack the phosphate; a granulating drum for granulating the slurry leaving the reactor; a drying device for drying the product granulated in this way; a plurality of separators for separating said granulated product by grain size; scrubbing devices for scrubbing the reaction gases, the drying gases, and the waste gases from the various apparatuses and the workshop; and a recycling circuit for recycling to the granulating drum rejected finished product after grain size separation; wherein the premixer includes unclogging means comprising in combination a flexible and resilient axial sleeve, in particular fixed to the top of the premixer by a collar and intended to receive the previously ground and measured-out phosphate, and at least one phosphoric acid solution sprayer injecting the acid solution under pressure level with the free bottom end of the sleeve, said sleeve including at least one slot giving access to the sprayed phosphoric acid solution and also constituting a non-return valve for reaction gases under the effect of the injected phosphoric acid and of its own resilience. In a preferred embodiment of the installation of the invention, the sleeve constituting the unclogging means and the non-return valve is made of a non-vulcanized elastomer. In another preferred embodiment of the installation of the invention, the stirred-tank reactor includes an overflow chute engaged against an overflow opening for the slurry that accumulates in the reaction tank, which chute includes two tapering openings enabling the reaction gases that are given off during flow towards the granulating drum to be separated out. In yet another embodiment of the installation of the invention, the granulating drum co-operates with a sprayer for spraying the slurry coming from the overflow chute of the reactor, said sprayer being constituted by a tubular body terminated by an end whose profile enables a fan of slurry to be distributed inside the granulating drum while also maintaining a constant spraying speed by varying the section of the flow, for which purpose said end has a composite profile defined by a sloping cutout sloping relative to the axis of the tubular body and by an arcuate cutout following on from the above cutout and connected thereto. In addition to the above dispositions, the invention includes other dispositions which appear from the following description."
9733355,Systems and methods for detecting soil characteristics,2017-03-06,0,1,"BACKGROUND Agricultural growing operations operate efficiently when, among other things, seeds are planted in soil having optimal soil characteristics and the seeds are provided optimal amounts water and nutrients. Soil characteristics (e.g., soil composition, soil density, nutrient presence, humus presence, etc.) vary from location to location, both globally (e.g., from geographic region to geographic region) and locally (e.g., from spot to spot within a single area of land). Further, the presence of soil moisture from natural sources or from man-made irrigation systems, varies from location to location. Generally, a single agricultural growing operation involves planting a specific type of seed according to a set pattern over many acres of land (e.g., planting a field of corn in rows). Soil characteristics will often vary over the area of land used for the agricultural growing operation. Despite the variances in soil characteristics, seeds are generally planted in the same manner across the entire area of land used for growing operation. Further, many agricultural growing operations utilize man made delivery systems for water, nutrients, fertilizers, and/or other chemicals and soil additives. The delivery systems are buried or placed on the surface of the soil. The delivery systems are at risk of being damaged or destroyed as agricultural equipment disturbs the soil to plants seeds, harvests crops, and tills soil material. One exemplary embodiment relates to a soil detection and planting apparatus. The apparatus includes a vehicle and a controller coupled to the vehicle. The apparatus further includes a planting device coupled to the vehicle, the planting device configured to plant seeds or plants into a soil material.

The apparatus includes a location sensor coupled to the aircraft. The location sensor is configured to provide a location feedback signal to the controller. The controller is configured to create a map of the soil material including a location of the portion of the irrigation system based on the sensor feedback signal and the location feedback signal. A further exemplary embodiment relates to a method of operating a vehicle including a controller. The vehicle is configured to map soil characteristics and plant seeds or plants. The method includes detecting intrinsic soil characteristics of a soil material through a ground penetrating radar unit coupled to the vehicle, wherein the ground penetrating radar unit is configured to scan the soil material up to a designated depth beneath a surface of the soil material, and wherein the ground penetrating radar unit is further configured to provide a sensor feedback signal to a controller with respect to the intrinsic soil characteristics.

The method includes tracking a location of the vehicle through a location sensor coupled to the vehicle. The method further includes creating a map of an area of land traversed by the vehicle, wherein the map includes detected intrinsic soil characteristics, wherein the map is configured to be later updated to include the location of a planted plant or a planted seed. The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description."
4916857,Castellated chemically coated seedling box,1988-09-19,0,1,"This invention relates to seedling containers and particularly seedling containers which are constructed from expanded polystyrene and used for tree seedlings. In recent years, reforestation has become important and many lumbering concerns plant new tree seedlings after having harvested the forest. Tree seedings are started in nurseries and then transplanted when they reach a certain height. It has been found that trees which have been transplanted from the nursery to the field often lack the root stability of trees which have germinated and grown naturally. In particular, lodge pole pines which have been started in a tree nursery in man-made containers once transplanted, have toppled. One problem in container grown seedlings is root spiralling. This occurs because the walls of the cavities constrict the tree's growth and produce root bound seedlings. A typical tree seedling has both a tap root which goes vertically downwards and also lateral roots which generally grow horizontally. When the horizontal laterals reach the cavity walls, they begin to spiral about the tap root and consequently the tree commences its life after being transplanted with an unstable root system. To overcome this problem, downwardly extending ribs are molded into the inner cavity walls of the seedling container cavities. When the lateral roots hit the rib, they are directed downwards and roots spiralling is prevented. When the roots reach the bottom of the cavity which is open to the air, their growth is temporarily halted by air pruning. This recent method has been found to produce superior root systems on tree seedlings but still has several disadvantages. In particular, because all of the lateral roots are directed vertically downwards around the tap root, tree seedlings once transplanted tend to suffer rotation and can topple in a strong wind. This is due to the lack of horizontal lateral roots. Canadian Patent 1,163,807, although not directed to an expanded polystyrene container, discloses a container having a number of individual compartments which are made of a plurality of mutually spaced depending converging strips defining slits. The seedling and growth medium is placed in this stripped cavity. When some of the lateral roots grow outwardly between the strips, they are air pruned. The air pruned horizontal laterals recommence to grow horizontally after the seedling is transplanted. The invention disclosed in Canadian Patent 1,163,807 overcomes some of the root growth problems but is more expensive and cumbersome than a container made of expanded polystyrene. Research in a different area to overcome the root growth problem has been done by Burdett et al. and published in a paper entitled """"Toppling in British Columbia's Lodge Pole Pine Plantations: Significance, Cause and Prevention"""". The article appeared in the October 1986 edition of the Forestry Chronicle. The authors conducted experiments using chemical root pruning. By coating the entire seedling box and inner walls of the cavities of the seedling container with latex paint containing cupric carbonate, the authors found that when the horizontal lateral roots touched the painted surface of the cavity walls, the roots stop growing, i.e. they are pruned. Once the seedling is transplanted, the horizontal laterals continue their course as before without the impediment of the cavity walls. In South Africa similar experiments have been conducted using copper painted containers. This method of chemically coating the cavity walls has several disadvantages. Firstly, the chemical coating prevents any vertically downwards directed lateral roots because of the pruning effect on all lateral roots which touch the cavity walls. This gives a weaker root ball when the seedling is transplanted than a naturally grown seedling. Secondly, the chemical coating of the entire container is expensive and therefore uneconomical. Thirdly and most important, the abundance of chemicals in the root cavity when mixed with differing soils and excessive moisture levels can cause p.h. fluctuations in the soil which are not suitable for good growth. This can seriously harm or even kill the seedling if chlorosis occurs. It is an object of the present invention to produce a tree seedling container which produces tree seedlings with horizontal chemically pruned lateral roots, air pruned vertically downward directed lateral roots, and a strong tap root. It is a further object of the invention to produce a tree seedling container which produces tree seedlings that once transplanted, have stable, strong root systems which will prevent toppling of the tree as it matures. In the present invention only a portion of a cavity wall is chemically coated. Rather than narrow downwardly directed ribs, the present invention provides a castellated form. In a preferred embodiment, three vertical raised portions and three vertical grooved portions defined by said raised portions make up the inner cavity wall. Either the raised portions or the grooved portions of the inner cavity walls receive a chemical coating during production. Copper paint or latex paint containing cupric carbonate are preferred, but any suitable root pruning chemical can be used. Also, the cavities are downwardly tapered and are open at the bottom. This allows for easy removal when replanting the tree seedlings. Therefore, this invention seeks to provide a seedling container constructed from expanded thermal plastics, comprising a plurality of cavities suitable for holding soil medium for propogating tree seedlings; said cavities being open-ended and having their axes in substantially the vertical plane; wherein 30% to 70% of the inner walls of said cavities are coated with a suitable root pruning chemical. The invention also seeks to provide a method of propogating tree seedlings comprising the steps of (a) applying a suitable root pruning chemical to 30% to 70% of the inner walls of a seedling cavity in a seedling container; (b) filling said cavity with a growing medium and inserting at least one seed; and (c) applying sufficient heat, light and moisture to provide ideal growing conditions. In operation, the tree seedling containers are filled with a suitable growing medium and seeds are placed in each cavity. As a seedling begins to grow, it sends out both a tap root and horizontal lateral roots. When the horizontal lateral roots strike the chemically coated portions of the inner walls, they are chemically pruned. Other lateral roots come in contact with the non-chemically coated portion of the cavity wall and are directed vertically downwards while at the same time prevented from spiralling because of the raised portions. These roots become vertically downward directed lateral roots. The tap root grows downwards until it is air pruned when it reaches the lower opening. The downwardly directed vertical laterals are also air pruned once they reach the bottom of the cavity. The resultant seedling, once transplanted has a well structured natural root system. The chemically pruned horizontal lateral roots recommence their growth in the same direction they held prior to coming into contact with the cavity walls and provide stability to prevent rotation of the tree. The vertically downwardly directed lateral roots are free to grow downwardly and outwardly and seek new soil horizons. The tap root also continues its downward course."
5395418,Solubility compound fertilizer compositions,1992-12-11,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention This invention concerns improved solid fertilizer compositions and in particular solid fertilizer compositions useful for preparing aqueous fertilizer solutions for precision plant nutrition. 2. Prior Art In greenhouses, nurseries and other intensive horticulture environments, best results are attained when macro- and micronutrients are carefully delivered to the growing plants. Many growers choose to utilize compound high analysis water-soluble fertilizers. Typically, these fertilizers are marketed as solids which are dissolved to prepare concentrated stock solutions which are then diluted into irrigation water by means of proportioners or injection devices. The Grace Sierra Horticultural Products Company markets a wide range of water-soluble solid compound fertilizer formulations under the Peters Professional.RTM. trademark. These formulations are designed to dissolve quickly and completely with no precipitation. It is also desired that a fertilizer formulation have good long-term stability as a stock solution so as not to form precipitates which can clog proportioners and irrigation lines. This has led to a limitation with water-soluble fertilizer formulation available heretofore. Calcium is an important nutrient which is called for in many plant nutrition formulations, but calcium salts cannot be used together with the conventional phosphorous sources--monoammonium phosphate and diammonium phosphate--as the pHs which these phosphate sources provide are too high (not acidic enough) to give adequate solubility to the calcium ions and thus give rise to precipitation of the calcium salts in the stock solution and in the proportioners. Potassium phosphate or sodium phosphate can be used as soluble phosphorous sources but these are either expensive or not conducive to plant growth. Phosphoric acid can be used but is a liquid and hazardous to handle. Therefore, a grower wishing to fertilize with both calcium and phosphorous, without resorting to the use of an alkali metal phosphate or liquid phosphorous acid, will need to inject these two elements separately. Secondly, and similarly, the use of chelated trace nutrients (micronutrients) has been widely postulated in order to keep these trace nutrients in solution in stock solutions which also contain the monoammonium and diammonium phosphates. If nonchelated micronutrients (such as simple nitrates or sulfates) are employed with the conventional phosphorous sources, the micronutrients tend to precipitate from solution. Again, these chelated micronutrients increase the cost of the fertilizer formulations. The present invention employs urea phosphate in water-soluble solid fertilizer formulations. Urea phosphate is a known material. The text, Urea and Urea Phosphate Fertilizers by Clifford W. Fowler (Noyes Data Corporation, Park Ridge, N.J., 1976) at page 23, shows a process for preparing this material and suggests that it may be used as a fertilizer. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,456,463 discloses the use of urea-phosphoric acid reaction products as ammonia-stabilized liquid components of fertilizers. Chemical Abstracts 106(3)101311q shows a liquid component for use in fertilizers which contains a urea phosphate polycondensation product. Chemical Abstracts 102(9)77486v also shows this. Other references of interest include Chemical Abstracts 101(23)209498s which concerns the biological fate of urea/phosphate fertilizers; Chemical Abstracts 101(21)190398k which discusses the use of urea phosphate fertilizers; Chemical Abstracts 88(19)135558a which describes the reaction of that phosphoric acid reacts with urea and with calcium salts; and Chemical Abstracts 86(11)70783g which deals with the development of liquid multicomponent fertilizers based on potassium and ammonium nitrates and diphosphates, urea, water and trace elements. An improved solid fertilizer which dissolves completely in water to give a phosphorous-containing stock solution has now been found. This fertilizer is characterized by being a solid, by having urea phosphate as the principal phosphorous source, by containing calcium and/or magnesium and/or nonchelated micronutrient trace metals such as iron, manganese, copper, boron, zinc and molybdenum, and by dissolving completely in water without precipitate formation initially or upon prolonged standing, such as for 24 hours or longer. In one embodiment, this invention provides a calcium-containing solid complex fertilizer which dissolves completely in water to give a water-based precipitate-free stable aqueous stock solution, this solid fertilizer containing solid urea phosphate as the principal phosphorous source and calcium nitrate. In another embodiment, this invention provides a trace metal-containing solid complex fertilizer which dissolves completely in water to give a water-based precipitate free stable aqueous stock solution, this solid fertilizer containing solid urea phosphate as the principal phosphorous source and nonchelated micronutrient trace metal nitrate or sulfate salts such as at least one of iron sulfate or nitrate, manganese sulfate or nitrate, copper sulfate or nitrate, and zinc sulfate or nitrate. This material may contain magnesium sulfate or nitrate, as well. It also may contain calcium nitrate. In addition, this invention provides a method for preparing a stable water-based phosphorous-containing and calcium-containing fertilizer aqueous stock solution. This method involves Obtaining a solid compound fertilizer admixture of urea phosphate as a primary phosphorous component and calcium nitrate, and Mixing this admixture with water at a ratio predetermined to yield to a concentration of the admixture of 2 to 40% by weight and allowing the admixture to dissolve completely. This same general process can be used to prepare a nonchelated trace metal (e.g. FeSO.sub.4, etc.)containing phosphorous-containing fertilizer aqueous stock solution, which also constitutes an aspect of this invention. The inclusion of urea phosphate in a dry blended mixture of nutrient sources which include calcium, and/or magnesium with or without trace metals such as iron and the like in nonchelated forms such as nitrates and/or sulfates offers several advantages. For one the urea phosphate establishes a low pH condition when the blended mixture is added to water to make a concentrated stock solution. A stock solution pH in the range of 0 to 2 may be achieved. This low solution pH maintains solubility and clarity of the concentrated stock solution. Urea phosphate, by the effect it has on solution pH, prevents the formation of calcium phosphate, magnesium phosphate and iron phosphate, which are not soluble. Similarly, the low pH helps prevent calcium from precipitating in the presence of sulfate ions which may be present. Therefore, when urea phosphate is used as a primary phosphorous source, it will make possible the inclusion of phosphorous and a metal such as calcium, magnesium or iron in one compound fertilizer, without the use of chelates or the disadvantage of a precipitate forming. This allows the end user to prepare and apply a complete nutrient solution using one stock solution and utilizing one injector. It also makes possible the inclusion of nonchelated trace nutrients into phosphorous-containing nutrient solutions without precipitation. It also allows the fertilizer solution to have an increased acidifying effect on the growing medium if needed. In summary, the advantages of using urea phosphate as a primary phosphate source in a solid compound fertilizer are: a. The ability to purchase, prepare and apply a complete nutrient solution with one stock solution and one proportioner. b. The ability to use nonchelated micronutrient trace elements without reduction in solubility in the stock solution as is observed using conventional dry phosphorus sources. c. The ability to formulate acidic fertilizers that are sold as dry solids and thus are less hazardous to the end user than liquid phosphoric acid-based materials. The fertilizer compositions of this invention are dry solid materials. This is defined to mean that they are particulate flowing solids having a water content of less than about 10% by weight total composition. The fertilizer compositions of this invention contain urea phosphate ##STR1## as a dry particulate solid. This amount of urea phosphate will vary depending upon the nitrogen and phosphorous analysis desired for the formulated composition. Typically, the urea phosphate is used in place of monoammonium phosphate or diammonium phosphate. Since urea phosphate contributes nitrogen as well as phosphorous in a precise stoichiometric ratio to the dry fertilizer mix, it may be necessary to add additional phosphorus sources or nitrates or urea as additional nitrogen sources to alter the ratio provided by urea phosphate alone. A solid product of the invention will contain at least about 5% by weight (total solids) of urea phosphate which by itself will contribute about 2.5% w phosphorous, (calculated as P.sub.2 O.sub.5) and about 1% w nitrogen as N. The solid product can contain up to about 95% by weight of urea phosphate which would by itself contribute about 43% w phosphorous as P.sub.2 O.sub.5 and about 17% w nitrogen as N. Higher P or N assays can be achieved by the addition of phosphorus sources or various nitrogen sources, such as urea or ammonium nitrate. The range of materials falling within the scope of this invention have phosphorous contents (as % w P.sub.2 O.sub.5) of from about 2.5% to 44%, nitrogen contents (as % w N) of from 1% to 40% and potassium contents (as % w K.sub.2) of from 0% to 35%. Within these formulation ranges and parameters, it is desirable for the urea phosphate to be the primary or principal source of phosphorous in the present solid fertilizers. By """"primary"""" or """"principal"""" source is meant that urea phosphate contributes at least about 50%, and preferably at least about 95% and especially essentially 100% of the phosphorous present in these products. In cases where urea phosphate is not the sole phosphorus source, other phosphates such as potassium phosphate and ammonium phosphate can make up the balance. In addition to the phosphorous and nitrogen and optional potassium, the materials of this invention include calcium and/or at least one metal selected from magnesium, iron, manganese, copper, boron, zinc and molybdenum. Ranges of concentration for these materials are as follows: ______________________________________ Concentration Range as Elemental Nutrient in Nutrient Final Dry Product, % ______________________________________ Ca 0-15 Mg 0-5.0 Fe 0-1.0 Mn 0-1.0 Cu 0-0.5 B 0-0.5 Zn 0-1.0 Mo 0-0.2 ______________________________________ Importantly, these materials are not provided as chelates, such as EDTA chelates or the like, but rather as simple salts, especially nitrates or sulfates. In the case of boron, it may be supplied as boric acid. Molybdenum may be provided as an alkali metal or ammonium molybdate. Magnesium, although often present in higher concentration than typically associated with """"trace metals"""" can be present as magnesium sulfate or nitrate. This means that the following representative materials may be used in the products with minimal concern about precipitation or the like: calcium nitrate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium nitrate, ferrous sulfate, ferrous nitrate, manganese sulfate, manganese nitrate, cupric sulfate, cupric nitrate, boric acid, zinc sulfate, zinc nitrate, sodium molybdate, ammonium molybdate and the like. In addition, the solid products can contain additional materials such as cofactors if desired. These materials are mixed as solids, often with minor amounts of water as hydration and the like being present to allow a homogenous product to be formed. The resulting products are dry solids as that term has been defined herein. They can be sold in bulk or they can be premeasured into units suitable for forming a standard volume of stock solution. In either case, it is often of advantage to distribute the materials in water-resistant packaging to minimize caking and lumping. Similarly, it may be of advantage to include soluble inerts which are dyes, or which promote dispersion, prevent caking, or the like. The solid products of this invention are made up into stock solutions by dissolving in water. This should be carried out in clean equipment usually with some agitation. Commonly, the stock solution contains from about 0.5 to about 5 lbs/gallon of dissolved solid (that is, from about 2% to about 40% by weight of dissolved solid). Preferably, the stock solution contains from about 5% to about 35% by weight of dissolved solid. This stock solution material is diluted by a factor of from 10 to 200 for application to the plants. This gives final concentrations which, for nitrogen, range from about 25 ppm up to about 450 ppm, with the other nutrients scaled accordingly. The materials of this invention will be further described with reference to the following examples. These are provided to illustrate the practice of the invention and not to limit its scope which is defined by the appended claims."

9301461,Systems and methods to adjust irrigation,2014-02-24,0,1,"INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE TO ANY PRIORITY APPLICATIONS Any and all applications for which a foreign or domestic priority claim is identified in the Application Data Sheet as filed with the present application are hereby incorporated by reference under 37 CFR 1.57. BACKGROUND Electronic irrigation controllers are used on residential and commercial sites to water turf and landscaping. They typically comprise a plastic housing that encloses circuitry including a processor that executes a watering program. Watering schedules are typically manually entered or selected by a user with pushbutton and/or rotary controls while observing a display. The processor turns a plurality of solenoid actuated valves ON and OFF with solid state switches according to the watering schedules that are carried out by the watering program. The valves deliver water to sprinklers connected by subterranean pipes. There is a large demand for conventional irrigation controllers that are easy for users to set up and modify watering schedules. The user simply enters the start times for a selected watering schedule, assigns a station to one or more schedules, and sets each station to run a predetermined number of minutes to meet the irrigation needs of the site. The problem with conventional irrigation controllers is that they are often set up to provide the maximum amount of irrigation required for the hottest and driest season, and then either left that way for the whole year, or in some cases the watering schedules are modified once or twice per year by the user. The result is that large amounts of water are wasted. Water is a precious natural resource and there is an increasing need to conserve it. In an embodiment, an irrigation system to irrigate an irrigation site comprises an irrigation controller, at least one sensor configured to generate a signal representative of an irrigation condition, and a control unit. The irrigation controller comprises a plurality of user inputs that enable a user to enter a watering schedule including a run time and to manually adjust an adjustment value of an adjustment feature. The adjustment feature is configured to modify the run time of the watering program by the adjustment value. In an embodiment, the irrigation controller further comprises a computer processor operatively connected to the plurality of user inputs and a memory connected to the computer processor, where programming stored in the memory implements the adjustment feature to change the run time of the watering schedule by the adjustment value. In one embodiment, the adjustment feature is a percentage adjustment feature and the adjustment value is a percentage adjustment value, where the percentage adjustment value is a percentage. For example, the watering program can be set up by the user to water for 30 minutes on selected days. In dry summer months, the user can set the percentage adjustment value to 50% and the irrigation controller adjusts the run time by the percentage adjustment value. In this example, the irrigation controller adjusts the run time by 50% or adjusts the run time to 45 minutes on the selected days based on the user-entered percentage adjustment value. The sensors can be, for example, but not limited to one or more of soil moisture sensors, weather stations, rain sensors, humidity sensors, temperature sensors, solar radiation sensors, wind sensors, and the like. An irrigation condition is a condition that provides an indication of the need or lack of need for irrigation of the irrigation site. For example, the irrigation condition at the irrigation site can be, for example, but not limited to one or more of a soil moisture level of the soil, an amount of recent rain fall, humidity and/or temperature of the air, an amount of solar radiation, wind velocity and/or direction, and the like. In certain embodiments, the one or more sensors comprise a plurality of soil moisture sensors. The control unit comprises a memory storing programming that calculates an irrigation value using the signal from the at least one sensor and communicates an irrigation adjustment value based at least in part on the irrigation value to the computer processor of the stand alone irrigation controller to automatically modify the percentage adjustment value based on the irrigation adjustment value. For example, the summer is not as hot and dry as the user expected and watering for 45 minutes on the selected days is too much water for the plants. If, for example, the at least one sensor comprises a soil moisture sensor and the signal from the soil moisture sensor indicates that the soil is moist, then the control unit calculates an irrigation value using the soil moisture level indicated by the soil moisture sensor and determines an irrigation adjustment value based at least in part on the irrigation value. The irrigation controller receives the irrigation adjustment value from the control unit and automatically adjusts the adjustment value by the irrigation adjustment value, which, in turn, automatically adjusts the run time of the watering schedule. For example, the control unit determines that the run time for the current soil moisture level should be adjusted by only 10%. The irrigation controller then automatically adjusts the percentage adjustment value to 10% such that the run time becomes 33 minutes for the watering program associated with the soil moisture sensor. In further embodiments, the irrigation system iteratively repeats this process to fine tune the irrigation of the irrigation site by providing successive automatic adjustments to the adjustment value. According to various embodiments, an irrigation system is disclosed. The irrigation system comprises a stand alone irrigation controller comprising a plurality of user inputs that enable a user to enter a watering schedule including a run time and to manually adjust a percentage adjustment value of a percentage adjustment feature, a computer processor operatively connected to the plurality of user inputs, and a memory connected to the computer processor, wherein programming stored in the memory implements the percentage adjustment feature to change the run time of the watering schedule by the percentage adjustment value. The irrigation system further comprises at least one sensor configured to generate a signal representative of an irrigation condition, and a stand alone control unit comprising a memory storing programming that calculates an irrigation value using the signal from the at least one sensor and communicates an irrigation adjustment value based at least in part on the irrigation value to the computer processor of the stand alone irrigation controller to automatically modify the percentage adjustment value based on the irrigation adjustment value. In an embodiment, the irrigation value is calculated using the signal from the at least one sensor and a reference point. In another embodiment, the reference point is calculated based on constants selected to simulate local conditions of an irrigation site. In a further embodiment, the stand alone control unit further comprises at least one user input that enables the user to change the reference point.

The programming automatically modifies the percentage adjustment value based on the irrigation adjustment value. In an embodiment, the at least one sensor comprises at least one soil moisture sensor and a temperature sensor and the irrigation value is calculated using signals from the at least one soil moisture sensor and the temperature sensor.

In an embodiment, the method further comprises calculating an irrigation value based at least in part on the signal and one or more constants representative of a geographic region associated with the irrigation site, and determining the irrigation adjustment value based on the irrigation value. In another embodiment, the method further comprises automatically shutting down irrigation based at least in part on detecting a rain event.

5563238,Water and UV degradable lactic acid polymers,1994-10-25,0,1,"The invention relates to modified polymers and polymer blends useful for waste disposal or for agricultural purposes to provide water or UV degradable materials which are environmentally safe. The materials are designed to degrade upon exposure to water or to UV light to environmentally safe naturally occurring materials. The modified polymers and polymer blends when used are also usable for garbage bags or other waste disposal purposes can be incinerated since upon burning only environmentally safe materials are produced. It is now recognized that many plastic materials useful for packaging as well as waste disposal present serious environmental problems because they either do not degrade in landfills or produce toxic components upon incineration. More and more attention has been devoted to environmentally safe plastic materials, particularly since Congressional hearings have determined that over 135 thousand metric tons per year of plastic is discarded at sea alone with some 639,000 plastic containers and bags tossed into the ocean every day. In addition to this intolerable situation, the amount of plastic materials used for packaging as well as garbage disposal which do not degrade has caused landfill areas previously thought to be entirely adequate for urban disposal sites to become filled and unusable. Waste disposal has become a very serious problem in this country as well as world-wide. Accordingly, there is a need to provide plastic materials suitable for packaging and waste disposal which at the same time will also be biodegradable to products which are environmentally safe. Recently, it has been determined that high carbohydrate waste presently produced in the United States as cheese whey and in conjunction with potato processing facilities is convertible in an environmentally benign process to provide a feed stream for lactic acid. Lactic acid is desirable because it is a naturally occurring compound which degrades to environmentally safe products. In addition, it has been discovered that oligomers of polylactic acid are not only environmentally safe but preferable and are useful as plant growth promoters, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,813,997 to Kinnersley et al., issued Mar. 21, 1989. With the discovery by Kinnersley et al. and the conversion of high carbohydrate food waste to feed stocks for lactic acid, a result of research at Argonne National Laboratory, it has become feasible through the present invention to formulate various copolymers and blends of polylactic acid for a wide range of agricultural and packaging uses which meet all the objectives set forth above and provide environmentally safe materials to replace presently used plastics that are difficult to dispose of in a safe manner. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide water and/or UV light degradable modified polylactic acid polymers or blends thereof useful for the agricultural and/or packaging and/or waste disposal industries. Another object of the invention is to provide water degradable or UV light degradable polylactic acid polymers and copolymers which may be used as agricultural coatings and mulches which degrade in the field to provide environmentally safe materials as well as plant growth promoters. Another object of the invention is to provide a water degradable modified polylactic acid polymer comprising a copolymer of monomers of lactic acid and a modifying monomers selected from the class consisting of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, p-dioxanone, 1,5 dioxepan-2-one, 1,4 -oxathialan-2-one, 4,4-dioxide and mixtures thereof, wherein the ethylene glycol is present in the range of from about 5% by weight to about 40% by weight, wherein the propylene glycol is present in the range of from about 5% by weight to about 40% by weight, wherein the p-dioxanone, 1,5 dioxepan-2-one or the 1,4-oxathialan-2-one, 4,4-dioxide is present in the range of from about 2% by weight to about 40% by weight, the modifying polymer not exceeding about 40% by weight of the modified polylactic acid copolymer. A still further object of the invention is to provide a water and UV degradable polylactic acid polymer comprising a copolymer of polylactic acid and a modifying monomer selected from the class consisting of p-dioxanone present in an amount up to about 20% by weight, 1,5 dioxepan-2-one present in an amount up to about 20% by weight, and 1,4 oxathialan-2-one, 4,4 dioxide present in an amount up to about 20% by weight, or mixtures thereof, the modifying monomer being present in an amount not greater than about 20% by weight. Still another object of the invention is to provide a water degradable polylactic acid polymer comprising an alloy of polylactic acid and high molecular weight polyethylene oxide wherein the high molecular weight polyethylene oxide is present in the range of from about 2 to about 50% by weight. A final object of the invention is to provide a method of applying an active material selected from the class of seeds, seedlings, pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers and mixtures thereof of an to agricultural site comprising providing a copolymer of monomers of lactic acid and a modifying monomer selected from the class consisting of ethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, p-dioxanone, 1,5 dioxepan-2-one, 1,4-oxathialan-2-one, 4,4-dioxide and mixtures thereof, wherein the ethylene glycol is present in the range of from about 5% by weight to about 40% by weight, wherein the propylene glycol is present in the range of from about 5% by weight to about 40% by weight, wherein the p-dioxanone, 1,5 dioxepan-2-one or the 1,4-oxathialan-2-one, 4, 4-dioxide is present in the range of from about 2% by weight to about 40% by weight, the modifying polymer not exceeding about 40% by weight of the modified polylactic acid polymer, forming a combination of the copolymer and the active ingredients wherein the active ingredients are present in the range of from about 60% to about 98% by weight of the combination, and applying the combination to the agricultural site.

8132361,Apparatus for staking trees,2010-01-04,0,1,"STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable INCORPORATION-BY-REFERENCE OF MATERIAL SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISC Not Applicable 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to systems and devices for the staking of newly planted immature trees, and more particularly to a system in which the supporting stakes and the tree are configured to provide safe, healthy support for the tree, and which allows for ease in adjustments to prevent damage to the young tree. 2. Description of Related Art The use of stakes in connection with efforts to stabilize newly planted trees is well known in the art. A typical young tree with a small flexible trunk is not self-supporting. Accordingly, it is common practice to drive one or more rigid stakes or poles into the ground adjacent and parallel to the tree. Ropes, ties, straps, or like flexible members are then wrapped around the tree trunk and the adjacent stake or pole in an attempt to stabilize the tree, until the subsequent root growth and trunk stability permits the tree to maintain a vertical orientation without any external assistance. There are a number of problems with the foregoing system. In some instances, the straps or ties which interconnect the stake and the tree trunk tend to gouge or dig into the tree trunk and damage, or even destroy the tree. This is particularly true when the wind urges the tree away from its supporting stake, and/or when the tree grows and its enlarging circumference expands around the supporting strap, tie, etc. Other problems arise due to the fact that the stakes themselves. Even though the stake is made of rigid material and driven into the ground for stability, it may nevertheless list or lean from a normally vertical position, and thus fail to give the appropriate stabilizing effect to the tree to which the stake or stakes are attached. Moving the ropes, ties, or straps vertically on the tree trunk at timed intervals may prevent damage to the tree trunk, but such movement also requires movement of these flexible members along the stakes as well. This can present a time consuming and frequently difficult operation. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is adapted to overcome the difficulties discussed above and to provide a staking arrangement which will support an immature tree trunk in a substantially vertical disposition until the roots of the tree and/or the size of the trunk have grown sufficiently to be self-supporting. All of this is accomplished without harmful damage to the tree. A feature of the invention is to provide a tree staking arrangement in which a plurality of stakes are driven into the ground and positioned at generally equal spacing along a circumference whose center will be occupied by the tree. The apparatus of the invention is preferably adapted to 2, 3 and 4 stake systems that may utilize spring tie sleeves or corded rubber ties in various embodiments. In the preferred 2 stake system the stakes are linearly oriented with the tree positioned between the two stakes. The tree is centered in a triangle formed from stakes in the 3 stake system or in a square shape formed from stakes in the 4 stake systems. A further feature of the present invention is the provision of two discrete but cooperating elements for stabilizing a newly planted immature tree. The first system employs a plurality of stakes driven into the ground in which rigid cross-bracing of the stakes is provided. The second element features flexible ties between each stake and its adjacent tree. In each of the disclosed systems, the connection of the cross-bracing and of the ties to the stakes is such that the vertical position of the cross-bracing and of the ties may be readily adjusted before any damage to the tree occurs Another feature of the invention provides an apparatus for supporting a planted tree adapted to couple to a plurality of stakes, having a tie-supporting member for mounting on each stake for movement along the length thereof with means for releasably securing each supporting member at selected portions along the length of the stake on which it is mounted, and a plurality of flexible tie members, each having a portion attached to one of the members and another portion adapted to wrap around a tree supported by the stakes and at least one cross brace. The various embodiments of the apparatus for supporting a planted tree or other upright workpiece have a plurality of tie brackets that are adapted to reversibly couple to selected positions on stakes that have been driven into the ground and spaced around the trunk of a tree. At least one rigid element extending between tie brackets of two adjacent stakes configured to be releasably secured with the tie brackets is provided. At least two rigid elements are preferred in the 3 stake system and at least three rigid elements are preferred in the 4 stake system embodiments. Flexible tie elements adapted to be wrapped around the supported tree are releasably attached to a second set of tie brackets in the preferred embodiment. One system uses corded rubber strips that are joined to a tie bracket that has the same structure as the tie bracket coupling the rigid element to the stakes. In another system, a different bracket is used to mount and position the spring ties than is used to couple the rigid element to the stakes. The spring tie bracket is capable of receiving and securing one or more wires or cables from the spring tie to the bracket. Further aspects of the invention will be brought out in the following portions of the specification, wherein the detailed description is for the purpose of fully disclosing preferred embodiments of the invention without placing limitations thereon."
9901949,Water spraying system,2013-06-14,0,1,"BACKGROUND The present invention relates generally to the field of garden hose spray systems. More specifically, the invention relates to a system including a pump and control mechanism for boosting the flow rate, pressure, momentum, and/or exit velocity of a water flow (or water stream) through the system. Household garden hoses may be used for a wide variety of tasks around a home. However, at pressures supplied by household plumbing systems, the pressure of outgoing streams may be fairly low, for example approximately 0.4 megapascals (MPa), or approximately 60 pounds per square inch (psi). To compensate, household garden hoses may be fitted with a wide variety of fittings and/or nozzles to increase the water pressure in the system and provide a stream of water with an increased exit velocity. However to increase the outgoing velocity of the water stream, such nozzles may greatly reduce the outgoing flow rate, which is the product of average velocity and flow cross-section—for example from approximately 315 to 630 cubic centimeters per second (cm 3 /s), or approximately 5 to 10 gallons per minute (gpm), down to less than 190 cm 3 /s (3 gpm). Devices other than garden hose boosting pumps, such as powered pressure washers for example, are known to be used to clean dirt, paint, or mold from pavement, brick face, cement, or other surfaces. To achieve such results, these devices may generally provide an energized water stream but with a greatly increased pressure (e.g., approximately 9.6 MPa (1400 psi)) and a greatly reduced flow rate (e.g., approximately 80 to 90 cm 3 /s (1.3-1.4 gpm)). Heavy duty pressure washers may provide streams with even higher pressures (e.g., 20 to 35 MPa (3000-5000 psi)) and possibly greater flow rates (e.g., approximately 225 cm 3 /s (3.5 gpm)). The high pressure streams of heavy duty pressure washers may facilitate more demanding tasks, such as resurfacing or cutting of materials, which may require extremely powerful flows. One embodiment of the invention relates to a water spraying system including an engine, a pump driven by the engine, the pump including a pump inlet configured to be fluidly coupled to a water source and a pump outlet providing water at an increased water pressure, a sprayer fluidly coupled to the pump outlet, the sprayer including a flow restriction valve and a trigger for manipulating the flow restriction valve so that movement of the trigger selectively opens and closes the flow restriction valve, a flow sensor configured to sense a flow of water into the pump, and a controller coupled to the flow sensor. The controller is configured to turn off the engine following a set time period of sensed flow below a threshold flow. Another embodiment of the invention relates to a water spraying system including an engine, a pump driven by the engine, the pump including a pump inlet configured to be fluidly coupled to a water source and a pump outlet providing water at an increased water pressure, a sprayer including a flow restriction valve and a trigger for manipulating the flow restriction valve so that movement of the trigger selectively opens and closes the flow restriction valve, a hose fluidly coupling the pump outlet to the sprayer, a sensor configured to sense a water flow state, and a controller coupled to the sensor. The sensor is located proximate the pump inlet. The controller is configured to turn off the engine when the sensed water flow state is below a threshold for a set time. Another embodiment relates to a pressure washer including an engine, a pump driven by the engine, the pump including a pump inlet configured to be fluidly coupled to a water source and a pump outlet providing water at an increased water pressure, a sprayer including a flow restriction valve and a trigger for manipulating the flow restriction valve so that movement of the trigger selectively opens and closes the flow restriction valve, a hose fluidly coupling the pump outlet to the sprayer, a flow sensor configured to sense a flow of water provided to the pump, and a controller coupled to the flow sensor. The controller is configured to turn off the engine following a set time period of sensed flow below a threshold flow. Alternative exemplary embodiments relate to other features and combinations of features as may be generally recited in the claims."
4534781,Mushroom supplement containing protein and a time delay coating,1982-07-27,0,2,"This invention relates to the art of mushroom cultivation and specifically pertains to an improved nutrient source for promoting mushroom growth. The basic procedure for commercially producing mushrooms involves an initial step of impregnating a suitably prepared compost with mushroom mycelia. This step is referred to as """"spawning"""", and is generally done in a plurality of individual beds or trays to facilitate handling and to economize space. The compost provides the nutrients, e.g., amino acids, essential for mycelium growth. The compost is often prepared from a mixture of horse manure and straw suitably treated, according to well known procedures, to yield a final composition promotive of mushroom growth. The mycelium-impregnated compost is then allowed to develop under carefully controlled conditions of temperature and moisture, until the hyphae of the mycelium have permeated the compost. This process usually takes anywhere from two to three weeks. At this time, the mycelia-permeated compost is covered with a thin layer of soil or sand; peat is often used. This step is referred to as """"casing"""", and the presence to this top layer causes the mushrooms to """"flower"""", i.e., to form the fleshy fruiting body harvested as the product. It genrally takes about three weeks after the beds are cased for the first mushrooms to appear. After harvesting the first crop of mushrooms, the bed goes through another growth cycle in which additional mushroom fruits are produced. These growth cycles are referred to as """"breaks"""", and a commercial compost bed generally undergoes three to five breaks before the compost becomes significantly depleted in essential nutrients. The compost is then discarded and the procedure is initiated anew. The prior art has shown that enhanced mushroom yields can be obtained by adding supplementary nutrients to the compost bed. For example, in Hughes et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,560,190 a dry formulation based on a combination of cottonseed meal and cottonseed oil is disclosed as a suitable supplement. It is also known to use cracked soybeans as a supplement, i.e., soybeans that have been broken into smaller pieces of about 1/6 to 1/10 the size of the whole bean. These materials have been added to the compost bed both at the time of spawning and casing. Nutrient supplementation, however, is susceptible to some undesirable side effects. One problem that has been encountered is excessive bed heating, apparently caused by the ready availability of the nutrient source to the highly active microbial mushroom culture. Temperature excursions above 35.degree. C. (95.degree. F.), sufficient to significantly deplete, if not completely destroy the mushroom mycelia have been observed. Another problem is encountered when adding the supplement to the compost at the time of spawning. In many cases other micro-organisms, primarily molds, pre-existing in the compost, introduced with the supplement, or introduced via airborne contamination, compete with the mushroom mycelium for the added nutrients. This reduces the availability of the supplement for its intended purpose and often hinders the development of the mushroom mycelium. Recognizing these problems, Carroll et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,942,969 provides a supplement suitable for addition to the compost at the time of spawning, in which the release of the nutrient is delayed. This supplement comprises a denatured protein source, including proteins derived from cottonseed, soybean and peanuts. As disclosed, the denaturing can be accomplished by heating or by treatment with alkalies, acids or formaldehyde. Unfortunately, the potential gains in mushroom yields, are disadvantageously offset by the economic penalty associated with the denaturation treatment. It is an object of the invention to provide a mushroom supplement for increasing the yield of mushrooms in commercial mushroom production. It is another object of this invention to provide a mushroom supplement having a delayed release of nutrients for stimulating mycelium growth. It is a further object of this invention to provide a mushroom supplement that can be added to the compost either at spawning or up to casing. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a mushroom supplement that is more economical to produce than the denatured protein of Carroll et al. These and other objects are met by the present invention which comprises an improved nutrient supplement for enhancing the growth of mushroom mycelium in a compost bed comprising a particulate, nutrient supplement having at least a partial coating of a hydrophobic material that is not readily assimilable by competing microorganisms in the compost, whereby the coating delays the availability of the nutrient to the mushroom mycelium while said coating is gradually removed under the conditions of mushroom growth. The present invention also pertains to a method of making the improved supplement and a method for using the supplement to enhance the growth of mushroom mycelium. In another aspect of this invention, the hydrophobic coating may also include a component for inhibiting the growth of molds. As disclosed, the present invention comprises a nutrient supplement for enhancing the growth of mushroom mycelium. By at least partially coating previously known nutrient supplements, such as cracked soybeans, with a thin layer of a hydrophobic material, such as a paraffin wax, we have found that commercial mushroom yields can be significantly enhanced while successfully avoiding the problems of excessive bed heating and competing microbial attack. In the broadest aspects of this invention, the particulate nutrient supplement comprises any material which is known to beneficially enhance the growth of mushroom mycelium, i.e., materials which satisfy the function of a nutrient. Materials such as vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates, sugars, etc. can be employed. Protein-containing nutrients from both vegetable and animal sources are particularly useful. Specific sources of protein-containing nutrients include fish meals, malt sprouts, linseeds, sesame seeds, peanuts, safflower and sunflower seeds, rape seed and many others. Vegetable protein sources such as cottonseed, soybean and peanuts are particularly advantageous. Although the use of soybeans as the particulate nutrient supplement is specifically referred to throughout the specification, such other materials as described above can also be usefully employed. Microbial activity on a substrate material, i.e., the supplement, generally requires a certain degree of hydration, and in fact most molds except certain Aspergilli, require substantial moisture content in order to flourish. Consequently, by applying the hydrophobic coating to the supplement we have eliminated an essential pre-condition for rapid attack by molds in the compost. The coating itself, however, must not be readily assimilable by the molds in the compost, otherwise the purpose of the coating is substantially abrogated. As used in describing the hydrophobic material, the phrase """"not readily assimilable"""" means that the material does not promote as rapid a growth of a competing microbial colony as does the uncoated nutrient supplement. Substances which in appropriate circumstances may be used as the coating material include natural resins, such as shellac, natural waxes, such as beeswax and paraffin waxes; oils, such as mineral oils; animal fats and synthetic low melting or solvent soluble polymers. Generally, the solid paraffin waxes are preferred. Relative to the waxes, the paraffin oils have been found to provide the supplement with less resistance to attack by molds. The vegetable oils such as safflower, cottonseed, soybean, corn, olive, linseed, rape seed, sesame, wheat germ, sunflower seed, and palm oil are known to be particularly subject to competing microbial attack and as such are preferably not used in the present invention, unless a component suitable for inhibiting mold growth to be described in more detail hereafter, is included in the oil coating. A mold inhibitor found to be suitable is benzoic acid. When coating the supplement with a natural wax, for example, a paraffin wax, sized pieces of the raw supplement are first placed in a vessel equipped for heating and stirring. The supplement is initially pasteurized by heating the vessel to about 60.degree. to 65.degree. C. (140.degree.-150.degree. F.), while stirring the contents of the vessel. After an appropriate period at the pasteurization temperature, an appropriate amount of the paraffin wax, in molten form, is added to the vessel. A paraffin wax that can be processed at temperatures sufficiently low so as not to thermally degrade the nutrient is used. The contents of the vessel are cooled, accompanied by constant stirring, until the temperature falls below the congealing point of the wax. If necessary, an anti-caking agent, e.g., Celite, may be added to prevent the coated particulates from agglomerating. While coating levels within the broad range of 2%-15% may be suitable in certain circumstances, we have found that coating levels between 4% and 11% yield the best results. As used in the specification and claims, the term """"coating level"""" means the coating weight percent of a particular component based on the weight of the supplement substrate. For example, a paraffin wax coating level of 7% means that a quantity of paraffin wax coating material equal to 7% of the weight of the supplement substrate is applied as a coating. The lower limit of the coating level range is set by the need to suitably delay the availability of the substrate; while the higher limit should not be exceeded or else the supplement becomes essentially unavailable to the mushroom mycelium within the time frame typical of mushroom growth. High coating levels also present agglomeration problems during manufacture. The coating level to be used in any particular case depends upon a variety of factors including the point in the mushroom growing process when the supplement is added to the compost bed, and the severity of the mold problem associated with a particular compost. For example, a supplement applied at spawning time will generally require a higher coating level than one applied at casing time. The present invention also contemplates the addition of a supplement, or a combination of supplements, with different fractions having various coating levels. Current testing has shown that coating levels between about 4% and 9%, e.g., 7% are suitable for supplements applied at casing time, while coating levels between 7% and 11%, e.g., 10% are appropriate for supplements applied at spawning. In practicing various embodiments of this invention, a compost suitable for promoting the growth of mushroom mycelium is initially prepared. Details of this procedure need not be elaborated as they are well understood by one skilled in this art. Tests have shown that the supplement of this invention is compatible with a wide variety of mushroom composts. Suitable materials for preparing the compost include: horse manure, straw, corn cob, and other vegetative waste materials. The trays to be used for growing the mushrooms are then filled with the compost and the compost is thereafter impregnated with the mushroom mycelia. A wide variety of mushrooms can benefit from the supplement of this invention, and the invention is not limited to any particular mushroom species or strain thereof. As noted above, the supplement can be applied either at the time of spawning or up to the time of casing the compost bed. When applying the supplement at spawning, the particulate supplement will generally be admixed into the compost bed with the mycelia. This procedure eliminates the additional labor associated with applying the supplement at casing. The supplement is provided in a particulate form that allows it to be added to the compost bed using available spawning equipment. Soybeans cracked to about 1/6 to 1/10 the size of the whole beans have been found to be suitable. The supplement is generally added to the bed at a rate of from 2% to 8% based on the dry weight of the compost in the bed. The rate of application in any particular case is based on a number of factors including: the supplement used, the mushroom variety and the compost formulation. As higher supplement application rates are used, the added mushroom yield per weight of added supplement decreases. Consequently, in any case there will be an economically defined upper limit for the supplementation rate. The spawned compost beds are then allowed to develop under carefully controlled conditions until the mycelia have completely permeated the compost. The present invention does not require any special provisions, and conditions normally employed for growing mushrooms can be advantageously employed. This process will usually take about two to four weeks. The beds are then cased with a layer of soil or peat. If the supplement was not added at the time of spawning, it is done at this time. This is simply done by admixing the supplement into the compost bed prior to applying the layer of casing material. Generally, the first crop of mushrooms can then be harvested about three weeks after casing. The mushroom bed then goes through additional growth cycles in which additional mushrooms are produced. Generally, a commercial bed will undergo three to five such growth cycles before the compost is replaced. As disclosed, the coating inhibits the growth of competing microorganisms on the supplement and delays the availability of the nutrient to the mushroom mycelium, while the coating is gradually removed under the conditions of mushroom growth. While we do not wish to be bound by theory, we believe that various microorganisms within the compost bed are capable of gradually breaking down the hydrophobic coating so as to gradually expose the nutrient supplement in a form suitable for assimilation by the mushroom mycelium. These microorganisms apparently comprise a portion of the organism population that survives the compost pasteurization step. While the compost is generally pasteurized to kill harmful pathogens, e.g., heating the compost for two to six hours at 60.degree. to 65.degree. C. (140.degree.-150.degree. F.) is typical, this treatment does not eradicate all of the organisms in the compost. For example, thermophilic and spore-forming microorganisms normally survive this treatment. Of the organisms surviving this treatment, there are apparently some capable of gradually degrading suitable hydrophobic coating materials, such as paraffin wax. Throughout the specification and claims the phrase """"gradually removed under the conditions of mushroom growth"""" is used to describe this process, as well as any other contributing processes by which the coating is gradually removed from the supplement. In another aspect of this invention, the hydrophobic coating material also includes an additional component for inhibiting the growth of molds. The mold inhibitor can be conveniently admixed with the coating material before it is applied onto the nutrient. For example, in the case where a molten paraffin wax is used to coat cracked soybeans, the particular mold inhibitor component can first be admixed into the molten wax. This mixture is then used to coat the soybeans according to the procedure described earlier. Other procedures for including a mold inhibitor in the coating will be apparent to one skilled in the art. The suitability of a particular material as a mold inhibitor in a specific hydrophobic coating material of this invention can be verified by routine experimentation. We have found that benzoic acid applied at a coating level of 2% have been effective in suppressing mold growth to a suitable degree."

9145707,Post driver extractor,2010-09-21,0,1,"This invention relates to devices for driving and extracting posts. Wooden stakes and metal star pickets are popular multipurpose posts that are used in fencing or to support signs, barricades or plants. Generally, a driving device is used to drive the posts into the ground at the desired location. However, a post can easily be driven too far or can twist out of alignment and must be extracted. Also, these posts are often installed temporarily and need to be removed at some point in time. A separate device is then required to pull the post out of the ground. In most circumstances both the driving and extracting devices are required. However, both devices are heavy and cumbersome and are difficult to carry together. Accordingly, a person will generally use the driver and return to get the extractor as needed. This is inefficient and results in wasted time and effort. OBJECT OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a device which can both drive and extract posts or at least to provide an alternative to the prior art. STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention a device for driving and extracting a post comprises a hollow barrel having one closed end and one open end for receiving the post, and two longitudinal handles, wherein at least one handle is pivotally fixed at the closed end of the barrel and releasably secured with a fastener at the other end such that said handle is utilised to facilitate driving of the post or can be released to act as a lever for extracting the post.

9974247,Solar pump device for liquids with movable tank,2016-10-04,0,1,"The present invention relates to a solar pump device for liquids with movable tank, in particular for pumping water for gardening. Italian application n. 1020155000026737 filed on 23 Jun. 2015 by the Applicant describes a pumping device for liquids, also named “solar pump”, which uses a solar panel for maintaining charged a rechargeable battery which supplies a pump adapted to draw water from a tank and to dispense it to the surrounding spaces. In particular, devices of that type are used for irrigating green areas far from usable water sources. Obviously, for such a use, it is important for the pumping device to be simple to construct and easy to transport from one position to another, even not very close. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is the object of the present invention to make a pumping device for liquids of the solar pump type which is simple and easy to transport from various sites of use. According to the present invention, such an object is achieved by a pumping device comprising a tank for liquids, from which a feeding pipe of a pump with a solar panel draws, characterized in that the tank consists of a supporting frame with tubular uprights and upper and lower horizontal connection lengths, which supports and surrounds a flexible bag for containing liquids and has an upper connection crossbar of the upper horizontal lengths of the supporting frame, on which the solar panel pump is mounted.

6883208,Hedge shear extendable handle enhanced structure,2003-03-28,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention This innovation pertains to a hedge shear structure, especially to the new multidimensional architecture of the positioning switching mechanism of the extendable tube. 2. Description of Related Art To accommodate different cutting span, generic hedge shears have an extendable and adjustable structure. Traditional hedge shears use eccentric rotating method to achieve the purpose of positioning and switchable adjustments. However, such operating method can cause slacks as user applies forces opposite to the rotating direction during operation causing deficiencies such as loosening and disengaging. Another legendary switching method is achievable by pushing the sliding positioning button, such method is preferable than the previous but involved continuous switching and sliding to achieve positioning and switchable adjustments is not ideal in terms of operation conveniences and requires future enhancements. On the other hand, the profile structure of the existing hedge shear is either circular or oval and is prone to physical deficiencies such as bending and deformation cause by structural strength issues after long operating durations. Thus, how to develop an ideal and practical hedge shear extendable handle structure are the expectation of the users and the development goal of the industry. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 1. Implementing the press button switching operation mode to achieve enhancement in convenience. 2. When press the button is pressed, user can release the press button without continuously pressing and adjust the inner tube until the positioning block is matching again with the next available positioning fillisters to regain fasten position. 3. The tube body is a H-shape profile structure enforced with anti-bending effort to achieve strength and ruggedness."
4231780,Treatment of phosphate rock on soil in situ with sulfuric acid,1976-09-03,0,1,"This invention relates to fertilizing of croplands, and in particular to a process which enables pulverized phosphate rock to be applied directly to the soil to be fertilized, with the subsequent release of phosphorus in an amount significantly in excess of that which would be secured from solubilization by untreated irrigation water. The process of this invention simultaneously creates gypsum in the soil, can assist in the correction of alkaline soils and can assist in the uptake of useful trace elements. In United States patent application Ser. No. 557,017, entitled """"Treatment of Phosphate Rock in Soil to Provide Fertilizer and Gypsum"""" filed by Dwight D. Collins et al on Mar. 10, 1975, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,979,199, which is assigned to the same assignee as the instant invention, there is shown the process of applying bare untreated finely ground phosphate rock to the surface of cropland, and thereafter applying to it water containing sulfurous acid, thereby to create """"available phosphate"""" and gypsum. It is an object of this invention significantly to advance the attainment of this objective, and to attain additional objectives as well, by applying concentrated sulfuric acid instead of sulfurous acid in accordance with the techniques described below. The use of phosphate fertilizer is widespread. The most common source of phosphate fertilizer is phosphate rock, which contains various phosphorus compounds, some of which are readily solubilized in neutral or nearly neutral aqueous solutions, such as some irrigation waters. These phosphorus compounds provide phosphorus values useful to plants, and these phosphorus values are commonly called """"available phosphate"""". Available phosphates represent only a fraction of the total phosphorus compounds in phosphate rock, but the remaining portion is not practically solubilized by common irrigation waters, and if it does become """"available phosphate"""" at all, it is over a long period of time measured in years. Basically, all phosphorus compounds represent potentially useful fertilizers, and to the extent they are not brought into aqueous solution, they represent a substantial economic loss, and the waste of a natural resource. Phosphate rock, when very finely pulverized, has historically had important but limited use as a fertilizer by itself, especially in regions where the rain tends to be acidic. The limitations upon the direct usage of phosphate rock are chiefly the consequence of the small portion of the available phosphate they inherently contain, and the slow rate at which even that portion is solubilized. Consequently, the preponderant modern usage of phosphate rock for fertilizer is as a raw material for the manufacture of phosphoric acid and for superphosphate. Superphosphate is phosphate rock treated by various processes, primarily involving sulfuric acid, for the purpose of increasing the percentage of available phosphate. To make superphosphate, it is an economic necessity to provide a sulfuric acid plant near the place of treating the rock, and this is a costly installation. Furthermore, the manufacture and application of the superphosphate involve expenses and complications of their own. One disadvantage of using superphosphate as a fertilizer is that, as the available phosphorus is solubilized in the soil from it, the residual calcium product (calcium forming a substantial portion of the phosphate rock) is likely to be other than the sulfate. This residual component will later require corrective treatment of the soil such as by the addition of gypsum. In fact, the treatment of commercial croplands with gypsum is a very common operation. It is an object of this invention to enable raw phosphate rock to be applied directly to the cropland, there to be treated with sulfuric acid so as in a relatively short period of time to solubilize a greater proportion of the phosphorus values in the rock than is possible by direct water leaching of the rock with irrigation water or by the slow dissolution of the rock caused by plant juices. As a matter of fact, substantially all of the phosphorus value can be solubilized in the process of this invention, and in addition a substantially greater residue of the treated rock will be calcium sulfate (gypsum). This will greatly reduce, and in some cases even eliminate, the requirement for a supplementary application of gypsum. It is another object of this invention to provide a method wherein the reaction between the sulfuric acid and the phosphate rock takes place in such a manner as to minimize the reaction of iron or aluminum with the phosphate. Iron and aluminum form phosphates which remain insoluble at pH levels at which croplands are maintained, and thereby lock up the phosphate with which they react. It is still another object of this invention to provide a method wherein a desired ratio between monohydrogen phosphate and dihydrogen phosphate can be produced so as to benefit specifically a type of crop to be grown. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method whereby the reactions take place in such a manner as to produce the desired available phosphate with a minimum of hydroxyl ion. Hydroxyl ions compete with the phosphate for uptake by the plant of the same root sites. This tendency explains the poor growth which occurs in alkaline soil. It is still a further object of this invention to correct alkalinity of soil beneath a layer of phosphate rock, providing the sulfuric acid in a concentration where it is sufficiently viscous to remain in a layer where it completes a localized reaction, without excessive migration between reacting layers. In this manner, the respective desired reactions are likelier to go to completion. The method according to this invention is to apply to a soil surface a layer of pulverized raw untreated granules of pulverized phosphate rock containing phosphorus and calcium which has not been previously treated by sulfuric acid without mixing the granules into the soil or otherwise covering the granules, and then applying to the top of said layer, sulfuric acid of such concentration as to be containable by equipment made of cold-rolled carbon steel without substantial corrosion thereof, which is more viscous than water, and which is deliquescent or hygroscopic. Sulfuric acid of this concentration tends to remain adherently in contact with the phosphate rock granules. When corrective treatment of the soil beneath the layer is not required, the amount of acid is limited to that which will react with the layer, and remain with it. When corrective treatment is desired, the amount of sulfuric acid applied is sufficient to treat both the layer of phosphate rock and the soil beneath it to the desired depth. According to a preferred but optional feature of the invention, after the reaction between the granules and the sulfuric acid is substantially completed, water is applied to the exposed surface in quantity to adjust the pH in the region of the products of reaction in the layer to a level which supplies monohydrogen phosphate and dihydrogen phosphate ion in a ratio best suited for the plant contemplated to be grown in the soil."
4173212,Self-contained solar greenhouse,1977-10-17,0,1,"The use of fuel heated greenhouses for growing plants during winter months has long been practiced. With the impending fuel shortages, it is becoming increasingly important to provide a greenhouse which can be used for growing plants in cold weather but which requires no fuel or, at least, a greatly reduced amount of fuel. Greenhouses provide an environment in which plants receive sunlight for growth and protection against low temperatures. A greenhouse is a natural solar collector during sunlight hours since sun penetrating the transparent covering heats the air and physical objects within the greenhouse. However, the quantity of heat collected during the day is seldom sufficient to maintain a preselected minimum temperature during night hours or during days when no sunlight occurs so that supplementary heating is required. The present invention is a greenhouse which performs the dual function of first providing the environment for the growth of plants and second, functions as a solar collector for the storage of heat to maintain the interior of the greenhouse at acceptable temperatures for growing plants during the night and on cloudy days. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a solar heated greenhouse. More particularly, an object of this invention is to provide a greenhouse having a quonset type roof which extends to the floor level on each side of the greenhouse, the roof having an inner and outer light penetratable member providing a heat collecting chamber therebetween and including means of dispersing water in the heat collecting chamber and storing the heated water in a strata beneath the floor to heat the greenhouse at night and on sunless days. These general objects as well as other and more specific objects of the invention will be fulfilled in the following description and claims, taken in conjunction with the attached views."
8347510,Handle assembly for power tool,2004-08-04,0,1,"The present invention relates to a handle assembly for a power tool, and to a power tool incorporating such an assembly. The invention relates particularly, but not exclusively, to handle assembly for a hedge trimmer, and a hedge trimmer incorporating such a mechanism. Hedge trimmers are power tools for general garden use with an axially reciprocating blade comprising a plurality of teeth disposed adjacent a stationary blade, the teeth of the stationary blade providing a reaction force for the teeth of the reciprocating blade. Most hedge trimmers are provided with two handles for the user to grip. This is generally for two reasons. Firstly, a hedge trimmer is easier to manipulate when held with both hands than when held with one hand. This provides the user with greater control over the hedge trimmer and therefore facilitates more accurate cutting. Secondly, a two handed grip is a safety feature. It is significantly easier to lose control of a hedge trimmer when holding it with one hand, and therefore a two handed grip allows much safer use of the hedge trimmer. Furthermore, hedge trimmers usually have one handle provided forwardly of the other, the handles being disposed perpendicularly to one another. This means that when the user holds the hedge trimmer, the axes of his wrists are perpendicular to one another such that the user's forearms are twisted relative to one another. The handles of prior art hedge trimmers are disposed such that the user can grip front and rear handles with the axes of his wrists substantially parallel to one another. This handle configuration of the prior art suffers from the drawback that if the rear handle is provided such that it lies in the plane of the blade, the user's rear hand, or knuckles, may come in to contact with the hedge being cut and be caused minor injury such as scratching and grazing. Preferred embodiments of the present invention seek to overcome the above disadvantage of the prior art. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a handle assembly for a power tool having a housing, a motor provided in the housing, an output shaft adapted to be caused by said motor to execute reciprocating motion, and a blade assembly extending from the housing along a first axis, the handle assembly comprising:— a front handle; a rear handle integral with said first handle; and a mounting portion adapted to be mounted to the housing of the tool; wherein said rear handle is displaced from the plane of said blade assembly in use. By providing a rear handle displaced from the plane of the blade assembly of the hedge trimmer, this provides the advantage that the users rear hand is clear of the surface of the hedge being cut, and will therefore not come into contact with the hedge and be injured as a result. The front handle and rear handle may be oriented to enable a user to grip the front handle with a first hand and the rear handle with a second hand such that the axes of the user's wrists are substantially parallel to one another. This provides the advantage, especially when the hedge trimmer is being operated with the blade in a vertical plane, that the user can hold the hedge trimmer without twisting one forearm relative to the other. Consequently, when the forearms begin to tire, the extent to which unwanted lateral torque is applied to the hedge trimmer as the user's arms attempt to orient themselves into a more comfortable position is minimised. Said front and rear handles may define a continuous loop. The handle assembly may further comprise first switching means provided on said front handle, and second switching means formed on said rear handle, wherein said power tool is operable on actuation of both first and second switching means. By providing a first switch on the front handle, and a second switch on the rear handle, wherein the switches must be simultaneously actuated to operate the hedge trimmer, this provides the advantage that the user must first hold the hedge trimmer with two hands before he can operate it, thus ensuring safe and correct handling of the hedge trimmer. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a power tool comprising:— a housing; a motor provided in the housing; an output shaft adapted to be caused by said motor to actuate a blade assembly to execute reciprocating motion; a front handle; a rear handle displaced from the plane of the blade assembly in use. The power tool may be a hedge trimmer."
6159262,Fertilizers,1997-08-08,0,1,"The present invention relates to improvements in fertilisers, and specifically to an improved fertiliser composition containing a waste such as manure, a process for its production and methods of using it to improve the growth of plant and/or overcome or at least reduce the deleterious effect of insects upon plants. It has long been known that the growth of plants can be improved with fertilisation, that is by providing the plant with a ready source of the nutrients that it requires for growth. This is especially necessary in areas of poor quality soil which is unable to satisfactorily sustain the growth of a large number of plants. Fertilisers commonly include compounds containing nitrogen and phosphorous as well as other minerals required for plant growth, in forms which can be either sprayed on the soil surrounding the plant or in a solid form which can be directly added to the soil. It is also common for known fertilisers to contain a pH stabilising component, that is either an acid or base which can alter the soil pH, to acidify basic soil or to make acidic soil more alkaline. A particularly common type of fertiliser which has been used in the past is animal manure which contains a large number of nutrients excreted by various animals, which when added to soil will improve its capacity to sustain plant growth. While there are significant advantages with the use of manure, in that it is cheap, easy to obtain and a useful means of utilising a waste product, its use as a fertiliser is also associated with a number of problems. Firstly, animal manure (and human faeces for that matter) contains a large number of bacteria which contribute to the unpleasant odour associated with manure, and can also be dangerous when manure fertilisers are utilised in relation to food crops. Also, the bacteria associated with manure fertilisers contribute to decomposition of the manure and other organic matter associated with it, such that insects are often attracted. The presence of large numbers of insects can also be damaging upon the plant which the fertiliser is intended to aid the growth of, as various insects will utilise the growing plant as a food source. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved fertiliser composition which can overcome the problems associated with manure fertilisers known to date and is relatively inexpensive to produce. It is further an object of the present invention to develop a fertiliser which can enrich soils used for plant growth and thereby enhance the growth of the plants, at the same time utilising waste manure which is high in nutrient value, but overcoming the problems of odour, decomposition and bacterial presence, which currently limit the usefulness of manure based fertilisers. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacture of such a fertiliser and additionally processes by which the fertilizers can be utilised to improve plant growth and possibly also to reduce the damage caused by insects to plants treated with the fertiliser. In one form, the invention resides in a fertiliser composition comprising: (a) an aqueous organic waste solution, (b) an anti-bacterial agent, (c) a wetting agent, (d) an odour control agent In a preferred embodiment the waste is a manure such as poultry manure, the wetting agent is a mixture of sulphonic acid and caustic soda, the anti-bacterial agent, and odour control agents are either eucalyptus oil, tee tree oil, or a mixture of both. An additional nitrogen containing component which is also preferably present is urea, and a foaming agent which is also preferably present is coconut diethanolamide. In another preferred embodiment of the invention an insecticide is also added to the fertiliser and preferably this insecticide is either eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, or a mixture of both. A colouring agent may also be added to the composition. According to another embodiment of the present invention there is also provided a process of preparing a fertiliser comprising the steps of: (a) mixing organic waste with water and stirring to dissolve the manure and optionally adding a flocculent, and then allowing the mixture to stand for at least two hours; (b) removing any solid material from the mixture of (a) and then taking at least a portion of the resulting solution and adding a wetting agent, an anti-bacterial agent, a preservative and an odour control agent; (c) Optionally also adding a nitrogen containing compound and/or a foaming agent; (d) adjusting the pH of the solution to between 7.5 and 10.5, by the addition of acid or base as required; (e) optionally adding a colouring agent. It is preferred that the organic waste is a manure and mixture of manures. Suitably, the mixture of (a) is allowed to stand for at least 48 hours and preferably 72 hours to facilitate some biodegradation of the waste. This can be promoted by ensuring that a temperature is maintained which promotes the degradation. Suitable temperatures can be between 20.degree. C.-30.degree. C. and particularly between 22.degree. C.-28.degree. C. The degradation process can be enhanced further by the addition of bacterial cultures. A suitable culture is of the pseudomonas family. Bacterial cultures can be added to: (a) Assist in the de-composition of the solids. (b) To increase the nutrient value for plants and soil. (c) Suppress plant pest such as fungi, algae and plant pathogenic bacteria. (d) Eliminate harmful pathogens. (e) To incorporate in the product the ability to """"fix nitrogen"""" from the air. According to a still further embodiment of the present invention there is provided a process for improving the growth of plants which comprises treating soil adjacent to the plant with an amount of the fertiliser composition according to the present invention. Optionally, this process may also prevent or at least reduce the deleterious effect of insects upon the plants, by including an insecticide within the fertiliser composition. The primary component of the fertiliser composition according to the present invention is organic waste such as manure. The particular manure utilised may be that of any animal, or indeed even human faeces or sewage sludge. In fact the manure utilised in the present invention can even be mixtures of various different types of manure. As can clearly be recognised, manure is a waste product which is often difficult to dispose of due to its inherent odour and bacterial content. It is therefore most advantageous that manure can be utilised in the present invention as it not only results in the formation of a valuable product, but it also allows safe disposal of a waste product. The present invention can be carried out using manure from animals including for example, cattle, sheep, horses, poultry or other birds or even human faecal wastes or sewage sludge. It may be desirous, depending upon the nature of the fertiliser which is to be prepared to specifically include one type of manure, such as for example poultry manure which may be especially high in phosphorous content. The inclusion of such manure in the fertiliser composition would be particularly suited for treating low phosphorous soils or perhaps to feed plants which have a high demand for phosphorous. In other adaptations however it may be desirable to utilise a blend of various manures to obtain the optimum nutrient content for the particular soil type and plants which are to be sustained utilising the fertiliser composition. Other organic waste products can include fish emulsions and molasses, particularly the """"C"""" molasses fraction from sugar mills. Molasses assists in retention of the fertiliser in the soil and especially sandy soil and also reduces plant damage by nematodes as nematodes are preferentially attracted to molasses. It is also to be borne in mind that the manure used need not be in the form of fresh manure, but may be processed to some extent. For example, it is possible that the manure may have been dried or dehydrated, or in fact even diluted to form a manure or sewage type sludge. As has been explained above, in order to overcome the problems associated with the use of manure fertilisers known to-date, it is necessary to include a number of other agents in the fertiliser in conjunction with the manure base. One of these agents is an anti-bacterial agent, which will significantly reduce the bacterial content of the manure sample, thereby reducing its potential toxicity to various plants and animals, and also contributing at least to some extent to the reduction in the unpleasant odour associated with manure samples. It is to be recognised that operation for the present invention is possible with any known, broad spectrum type anti-bacterial agent, such as for example known commercial anti-bacterial agents, alcohols such as for example isopropyl, alcohol and methylated spirits and quaternary solutions of for example, alkyl, benzyl, dimethyl, ammonium and chloride. However, it is preferred, that the anti-bacterial agent used should be a natural product. In this way the anti-bacterial agent will be somewhat milder and less toxic than particular synthetic anti-bacterial agents and as a result will be more appealing to the users of the fertiliser composition due to health and safety concerns. Examples of natural product anti-bacterial agents are essential oils obtained from plants, especially from Australian native plants. Suitable essential oils can be obtained from the following plant species: ______________________________________ Botanical Name Common Name ______________________________________ Eucalyptus polybractea Eucalyptus blue malee (Australian) E. rad v. Eucalyptus radiata australiana/dives `O` (Australian) Eucalyptus citriodora Eucalyptus, lemon scented Halichrysum italicum Everlast/immortelle Foeniculum vulgare v.

Again, it is possible to use any known odour control agent, including synthetic and natural products. Examples of suitable odour control agents are orthodichloro benzene and various enzymes. Once again however, it is preferred that the odour control agents should be a natural product, for the same reason as referred to above in relation to the anti-bacterial agent. Therefore, extracts of pine or lemon, which are associated with a pleasant odour are particularly suitable. It is especially interesting to note however, that the Australian essential oils referred to above in relation to the anti-bacterial agent, also exhibit a significant odour control activity, and for this reason essential oils such as eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, banksia oil, and the other essential oils referred to above are especially preferred as they exhibit a dual activity. The usefulness of these essential oils is in fact amplified still further as by acting as an anti-bacterial agent, they effectively also slow the rate of decomposition of the manure itself and other organic matter which it comes in contact with, thereby acting as a kind of preservative. It is important to note that various anti-bacterial and/or odour control agents may be mixed, in order to obtain the most effective anti-bacterial odour control characteristics of the fertiliser compositions. In the most preferred form of the present invention a mixture of eucalyptus and tea tree oils is utilised. Another feature of the present invention is the use of a wetting agent. By the terms """"wetting agent"""" what is meant is the use of an agent which will act as a surfactant to reduce the surface tension of the liquid mixture of components in the fertiliser composition. By reducing the surface tension, the various components of the mixture, some of which are immiscible, are able to mix more homogeneously, and because of low surface tension the fertiliser composition is more easily able to flow into the soil upon which it may be applied. In this way the uptake of the fertiliser composition by the plant roots can be maximized. Examples of suitable wetting agents are known wetting agents manufactured from a detergent base, but in the present invention the most preferred wetting agent is comprised of a mixture of caustic soda and sulphonic acid. While any sulphonic acid can be utilised, the wetting agent exhibits the most favourable characteristics when the sulphonic acid is alkylbenzene sulphonic acid. Other wetting agents can include sodium lauryl sulfate. As will be recognised from the comments in relation to the wetting agent, the fertiliser composition according to the present invention is preferably provided as a liquid mixture, with the manure base product being dissolved in water and then having any remaining solid material removed from the solution. This process can be undertaken by adding a flocculent to the water manure mixture, before allowing the mixture to stand for at least two hours. While it is not essential to add a flocculent, this will speed the process of separating the solid material from the manure solution. While other flocculants can be utilised, it is noted that the tea tree oil, which has been referred to above as also having anti-bacterial and odour control activity, also acts as a flocculent. It is therefore desirous that a small amount of tea tree oil should be added to the manure and water mixture prior to allowing this mixture to stand for at least two hours. To allow complete separation of the solid material from the manure solution, it is preferred that the manure and water mixture should be allowed to stand for around 24 hours. The manure solution can then easily be separated from the solid material by draining the solution off from the precipitated solids. The reason for removing the solid material is in order that the resulting fertiliser composition can be effectively sprayed. Naturally, if there is too much solid material in the fertiliser composition, the spraying apparatus could easily be blocked and spraying would be ineffective. It is possible, however, in another embodiment of the invention for the resulting solution to be dried so that a solid fertiliser composition is then formed. Its is also possible that other material such as seaweed, kelp or vegetation wastes can be included to aid the formation of a solid fertiliser composition. This solid composition can then be used in the form of a powder, granules or even pelletised using standard methods, to form a pelleted fertiliser composition. This solid composition would then largely dissolve when the soil upon which it has been applied is either rained upon or watered. In this way, and due to the presence of the wetting agent, the fertiliser composition will dissolve and flow into the soil to be absorbed by the plant roots. Under certain circumstances it may be necessary to include within the fertiliser composition of the present invention an additional nitrogen source. Examples of some other nitrogen containing compounds which can be incorporated into the fertiliser composition to increase the nitrogen content are seaweed, kelp and vegetation wastes such as the pulp of tea tree obtained as a by-product of extracting the essential oil. In a preferred form of the invention the nitrogen containing compound is urea, which apart from being easy to obtain and relatively inexpensive, is also able to enhance the effectiveness of the wetting agent. An additional optional ingredient in the fertiliser composition of the present invention is a foaming agent. By incorporating a foaming agent the fertiliser composition can easily be seen by a person spraying it onto an area of soil being fertilised. This will aid the person spraying the fertiliser to distinguish the areas which have been treated from those which have not. A particularly preferred foaming agent is coconut diethanolamide. This foaming agent is preferred as it not only contributes to the nutrient levels, specifically to the nitrogen content, of the fertiliser composition but it also enhances the wetting agent effectiveness while also, as mentioned above, providing a foaming effect. Although coconut diethanolamide is the preferred foaming agent, other suitable agents are known foaming agent such as lauric diethanolamide. Another preferable feature of the present invention is in incorporation of an insecticide into the composition. Manure based fertilisers often attract many insects, which can be damaging to the plant life which is being sustained by the fertiliser composition, as many of the insects will utilise the plant life as a food source, thereby severely damaging the plants and hindering their growth capacity. It is therefore desirous to reduce the amount of insects attracted by the manure component of the fertiliser and also to reduce the amount of existing insects which may be harmful to plant growth. This can be done by incorporating an insecticide into the composition. Although it is possible to include any known insecticide into the composition, it is once again desirable that the insecticide should be a natural product. Examples of suitable insecticides which can be incorporated into the composition are piperonyl butoxide and natural and synthetic pyrethrins. However, the most preferred insecticide agents are eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil, which as mentioned above, also have the other characteristics of being anti-bacterial and odour control agents, and are particularly effective in combination with the wetting agent. It is to be recognised that the fertiliser composition according to the present invention can be utilised in a broad range of ways. It can be utilised in order to improve the growth of commercial crops, for example in market gardens or in large scale agriculture as well as also having applications for the household gardener to improve the growth of for example vegetable gardens or potted plants. It has also been found that the fertiliser composition of the present invention is especially effective in improving the growth of turf and therefore has broad applications for large scale gardening and sports surfaces such as golf fairways and greens and lawn bowling greens or lawn tennis courts. In general, the fertiliser composition according to the present invention can be utilised in place or any known fertiliser to improve the growth of a broad range of plants. As mentioned previously, it is also possible to vary the fertiliser composition according to specific needs, such as for example the soil nutrient content of pH, as well as particular plant growth requirements. Ideally, the fertiliser composition of the present invention will be applied by spraying to areas of soil directly adjacent to the plants which are to be fertilised. It is also possible however that the fertiliser composition can be dried and possibly added to other solid material such as seaweed, kelp or vegetation waste to form a powder, granules or pellets which can also be applied to the soil on its surface, to be substantially solubilised when the soil is wet, or alternatively mixed into the soil. When the fertiliser composition contains an insecticide agent the process of fertilising the plants will not only result in improved plant growth, but also reduction in insects on or around the plants which may be damaging to the plant health. The fertiliser composition can be prepared by the following process: 1. Mix an amount of manure, which may be a mixture of various types of manure, or manure which has been processed to some extent to form a sludge, with water and stir to solubilise the manure. 2. Optionally add a flocculent such as for example tea tree oil, to aid separation of solid material from the manure solution. 3. Allow the manure solution and solid mixture to stand for at least two hours, and preferably for around 24 hours, and then separate the manure solution from the remaining solids, or maintain the mixture at 22.degree. C.-28.degree. C. while adding a bacterial culture from the pseudomonas family and allowing the mixture to stand for at least 72 hours with occasional aeration, before separation. 4. Add a wetting agent to the manure solution, and optionally if desired, also add a foaming agent which is preferably coconut diethanolamide. 5. If desired, add an additional nitrogen containing component, which is preferably urea. 6. Add the anti-bacterial and odour control agents, which most preferably are a mixture of eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil. 7. Test the pH of the mixture and if necessary adjust the pH such that it is within the range of 7.5 to 10.5, by the addition of acid or base as required. Although any common acids or basis can be utilised, the most preferable acid is citric acid and the most preferred base is caustic soda. 8. If required add a colouring agent to the composition, such that the resultant composition will more appropriately blend in colour with is natural surroundings. An example of suitable dying or colouring agent is green food grade dye. 9. Further dilution with water may be necessary in order to obtain a liquid which is of a suitable viscosity for spraying, and of a suitable concentration for the particular application to which the fertiliser is to be applied. It is to be recognised that the present invention has been described by way of example only and that modifications and amendments may be made thereto, in accordance with methods which are known to those skilled in the art. For instance, the ingredients of steps 4-6 can be pre-mixed before addition to the manure solution. The present invention will now be further described by reference to the following examples."
8215054,Floor for a cultivation area,2005-03-10,0,1,"1) Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a floor for a cultivation area, such as a greenhouse floor, having a holder located beneath it with a part facing said floor, which holder can be filled with a fluid. 2) Description of Related Art Storage of water, both for storing heat and for irrigation, can be implemented both inside and outside a cultivation area, such as a greenhouse. For storage outside a cultivation area use will be made of large tanks if it is heat that is concerned, whilst basins are used for storing water for irrigation purposes. It is known to store water for irrigation purposes beneath the floor in a greenhouse. As is generally known in the case of stalls and the like, trough-like depressions, preferably made of concrete, are produced and a floor, generally consisting of concrete, is poured over these, on which cultivation can be carried out in some way or other known in the art. As a result the separate basins located outside described above are superfluous, which leaves more space for nature or further cultivation area. Moreover, there is no risk of pollution of the stored water from external sources, which is the case with open basins. Problems with regard to freezing are also prevented. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The aim of the present invention is to increase the possibilities for application of underground storage further. This aim is realised with a floor as described above and more particularly the holder, in that said holder is filled with said fluid, the part directly adjoining the part of said holder facing said floor comprises a part that rests on said fluid, and wherein said part of the holder facing said floor comprises a protective support. This part can be rigid or flexible. The fluid described above is preferably a fluid containing water. The fluid can also comprise a fluid with high heat storage capacity, such as by use of materials where a phase transition takes place in the relative temperature range. According to the invention the floor of the cultivation area, which can be either inside or outside, such as a greenhouse, is formed by the top of the holder. Because the part directly adjoining the top of the holder is made flexible, and preferably the entire holder has a flexible wall, if there are no lateral limits close to the floor of the cultivation area this will behave like a “water droplet”. That is to say, within the volume of the holder this will choose a shape that is as flattened as possible. The height of the floor level can be controlled by introducing more or less liquid, such as water, into the holder. Such a floor can support installations and the like. The top of the holder can be made flexible or rigid. For protection and distribution of the load, according to the invention a protective, optionally plate-shaped support, strip or the like can be fitted. Of course, this plate-shaped support or the like can be the only seal for the fluid at that location, that is to say the terminal wall of the holder is formed exclusively by the support or floor at the location of the floor. As a result there can be direct contact between floor and water. As a result of this concept, numerous further possibilities arise for the underground storage of water. Examples are varying the level of the floor by introducing more or less water into the holder. For this purpose the holder will preferably be provided with feed/discharge openings for the liquid stored. Another example is operation as floor heating/cooling. After all, if the water contains heat/cold a very efficient floor heating/cooling system can be provided by the direct contact with the floor. It is also possible to influence the climate in the cultivation area or on the cultivation floor in another way. It is possible to provide the support with openings, through which a cooling gas is fed. Such channels do not have to be closed off in the downward direction because in a preferred embodiment of the invention liquid that provides closure is already present. It is also possible to choose a gas or a mixture of gas and liquid as fluid. As a result it becomes possible not only to provide an underground liquid store that can be implemented in an inexpensive manner, but likewise underground storage of gases, such as CO 2 . Introduction of the gas can take place when removing the liquid and the removal of the gas can be achieved by introducing more liquid. The protective support can also support parts of a building construction. It has been found that with such a floating construction a particularly robust assembly is produced when a suitable supporting plate is used. Although in theory it is sufficient to form the top of the holder using flexible material, by use of a suitable support it is possible to drive over a floor produced in this way with heavy loads, such as fork-lift trucks, without fluctuations and the like being produced. It must be understood that the construction described above can be implemented by making a hole in the ground and placing the holder therein. Apart from the advantages described above, what is achieved by this means is that the base and side walls of the hole are stabilised by the presence of the flexible holder. It is also possible to separate the holder from the ground via a floating body. That is to say an upward pressure is exerted on the holder by the groundwater. However, it is also possible to make no or only a shallow hole, the holder protruding above that level. As a result the floor level in the greenhouse will be higher, but this is not a problem for the majority of types of cultivation because the height of the greenhouse is such that production is not hampered. It can be important that close to the top boundary of the holder, that is to say at the location of the flexible part, the holder is able to move freely without hitting against boundary (walls). This is except for a stop that is used as a safety feature. In particular, if the supporting plate described above is used, it can be advantageous to provide a minimum level. At such minimum level the forces are transmitted from the supporting plate via a separate supporting construction and no longer via the flexible holder or the fluid contained therein. According to a variant of the present invention, in addition to the holder a further holder is arranged above it or below it (or even alongside it). Such a construction is used mainly if the liquid level in the holder first described has to vary regularly because of feeding/removal of water, for example for watering or heating purposes via conventional heating in the cultivation area or elsewhere. In such a case the floor level would be able to rise or fall in an undesirable manner. By providing a further holder and filling this with water originating from another source, it is possible to compensate for the change in volume of the first-mentioned holder. As a result the aggregate liquid level can remain the same or in any event be varied as desired. For varying the height it is necessary that the side walls of the bags are made flexible. Instead of the two holders described above it is also possible to build up the holder from a number of hoses that are laid in layers on top of one another. Such hoses can be procured at low cost and are easy to install. The level can be controlled by varying the amount of water in the hoses. It is preferable that the part of the holder that is filled with liquid, that is flexible and is located immediately adjacent to the bottom of the greenhouse floor is above a possible liquid level in the accommodating hole in which such a holder is placed. When two or more holders or, alternatively, hoses are stacked on top of one another the holders in one of the lower layers can optionally be filled with a gas or provided with floating bodies. Such a construction where at least holders located on top of one another are used is particularly suitable for the water/gas combination. A changing amount of water is put into, preferably, the lowermost holder, whilst a changing amount of gas, such as CO 2 , is present in the uppermost holder. With this arrangement a partition between liquid and gas is not always necessary. However, it is also possible to put a changing amount of gas into the lowermost holder. Apart from the storage of heat, the holder can also be used for cooling purposes. Especially in the summer months the temperature in, for example, a greenhouse often rises to an unacceptable extent and, in particular, if the aim is for a closed greenhouse, cooling can be important. This can be achieved both via the ground and via other constructions, the use of cooling water being important. Preferably, the holders are made completely of flexible material in the form of bags. Holders are generally available, for example as sheets of film or bags for storing manure. According to a further variant of the invention, such holders are supported by partition walls that delimit the entire area in which the holder is located, apart from the top surface, which, as described above, serves as floor. It is possible to arrange a number of such holders located one after the other. If the holders are identical and bear on the same level, it is possible to vary the degree of “bulging” of the holder, and thus to provide different liquid levels, by means of the difference in pressure between the various holders, that is to say the amount of liquid introduced. That is to say, starting from a purely level position, a gradient can be produced and in this way an ebb-and-flow system. Subsequent possible subsidence in the construction has no effect whatsoever because the liquid introduced into the holder will always be level at the floor surface. If a number of such holders are used alongside one another, there will preferably be a common underground “pipe alley” that is to say a trench-shaped space in which the various pipes for supplying/removing liquid can be positioned. Such a space can also be used for installing ventilation ducts therein, which may or may not be supplemented by air conditioning equipment, such as cooling and humidifying/dehumidifying equipment for cooling and humidifying/dehumidifying air/gases and pipes entering the greenhouse. The holders described above can have large dimensions. A value of 10×60 metres and a depth for the hole of 3 m are mentioned as an example. The invention also relates to a method for the cultivation of a crop on a floor of a cultivation area, such as a greenhouse floor, comprising a holder installed beneath the floor surface of said greenhouse, wherein liquid is fed to said holder or removed therefrom in order to vary the level of said floor. As indicated above, it is particularly easy to implement an ebb-and-flow system by means of the present invention, it being possible to work with a very small difference in height. This is advantageous in the case of relatively large greenhouses, which can be tens to hundreds of metres long."
9034793,Use of ribose to enhance plant growth,2013-07-16,0,1,"The present invention relates to methods and compositions for treating plants in order to enhance the growth and yield of plants, hardiness, as well as aiding in a plants recovery during and following a transplant shock incidence. The methods and compositions of the invention are suitable for topical application and are useful in increasing the rate of growth of plants, increasing the yield, hardening of the plants, and aiding in the recovery of plants during and following transplantation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION/RELATED ART Plants depend on light and carbon dioxide to produce the simple sugar, glucose. The produced glucose is then used as the energy source to build the leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds of the plant. Plant growth and product yield are important factors in the horticulture business. In order to maximize the potential of each plant the “ideal” growing environment must be created. Creating the “ideal” environment is often a process that is not feasible to many growers. Therefore, fertilization with natural and artificial substances plays an important role. In the area of plant fertilization many compounds have been used, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium as well as others. Effective fertilization can play a critical role in the growth of plants and is frequently the determining factor in the quality and quantity of the outcome. Past research has investigated which fertilizers or combinations thereof promote the optimal growth of the plant. For example, it has been shown that fertilization with nitrogen increased plant growth and yield, in addition to improving seed quality and nutritional value 1 . Further, another study demonstrated that phosphorus fertilization can significantly increase plant weight, seed yield, seed mucilage content, and seed protein content 2 . In the same study, fertilization with a combination of phosphorus and potassium resulted in the highest seed yield, seed mucilage content, and seed protein content 2 . Fertilization of plants with a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is so widely recognized that the concentration of each is printed on the label of many (if not all) plant fertilization products. New findings in the area of fertilization are of great interest. For example, it is unknown to what extent various additives may be substituted for, replace, show synergistic effects or interfere with the benefit derived from a fertilizer given alone. This is the main motivator for pursuing the investigations leading to this invention. All commercially grown plants (potted plants, annuals, shrubs, trees, etc) are exposed to transplant shock during their existence, as well as hardening during re-implantation of a plant. The term transplant shock is usually reserved for replanted annual plants; however, it is not exclusive to this state, and can cover anything from severe wilting to healthy-looking plants with a mysterious reluctance to resume growth after transplantation. The suspected cause of transplant shock is the failure of the plant to root well or a diminished root system (due to removal from its original site) and consequently the plant becomes poorly established in the new landscape soil. The plant can incur additional stress/shock following transplantation from lack of sufficient nutrients and/or water requirements following re-implantation into the soil. The period of slow growth following transplantation will vary from species to species of the variety of plants. For example, it is not uncommon for a large tree to experience a period of stagnant growth for several years following transplantation due to inadequate initial conditions or continual absence of key nutrients. During transplantation of plants, much of the plant's root system is often left behind during the harvestation of the desired plant. Once re-implanted, the reduced root system is unable to supply an adequate amount of nutrients, as well as a necessary root arrangement, and water for adequate normal growth. The increase and decrease of root growth potential paralleled the rise and fall of carbohydrate concentrations in the roots, not reflecting the subsequent stem evolution. Hardening of a plant is also important during and following transplantation. Hardening relates to the acclimation to cold temperatures and/or inclement weather patterns. Tinus et al. (2000) reported a close correspondence between the level of cold hardiness and absolute concentration of sugars. 3 Cold does not merely mean sub-thermal temperatures, but does reflect the change in state that a plant experiences when it is plucked from its normal inhabitant into a climate of different conditions. The increase and decrease of root growth potential paralleled the rise and fall of carbohydrate concentration in the roots, not reflecting the subsequent stem evolution. As temperatures drop, sugars tend to concentrate and then decrease in concentration. Upon this decrease in sugar availability, the plant turns to a dormancy state. Enzyme activity of the plant is also maintained when sugars are available, providing that the environmental conditions are acceptable. As temperature decreased, enzyme activity also decreased. However, enzyme patterns may be maintained with adequate substrate base. The combination of optimal enzyme patterns and substrate bases would ensure an ideal condition for the plant to accept and subsequently maintain or enhance its root/stem growth, leading to a more prolific plant. 4 Further, not only does the addition of ribose, other pentose sugars, their derivatives, or a combination of pentose sugars with other nutrients aid in the above, but has additional factors in providing aided features in hardening of essential fundamental parts of the plant, necessary in its initial and continual growth, such as roots, stem, and shoot characteristics. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to methods and compositions for supplementing the soil/diet of plants in order to enhance plant growth, yield, hardening, as well as the recovery of plants which undergo transplantation. The present invention provides ribose and other pentose sugars and their derivatives, alone or in combination with other carbohydrates, electrolytes, minerals, enzymes, micronutrients, macronutrients, or other ingredients to enhance plant growth, yield, hardening, and aid in the recovery during and following transplantation."
8260465,Data communication in a multi-wire irrigation control system,2009-07-17,1,0,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation devices, and more particularly to the communication of data using an alternating power signal to be supplied to irrigation devices. 2. Discussion of the Related Art Typical irrigation control systems cooperate with water valves and pumps to control the flow of irrigation water through a variety of water dispensing devices, including sprinklers, rotors, drip-lines, and other water delivery devices. These control systems are used in a wide variety of irrigation applications, from residential and commercial landscapes to golf course and agricultural irrigation. Many irrigation systems and electronics are powered by 50/60 Hz AC voltage signals. Some systems further modulate this power source to provide data communication, for example, by selectively clipping the positive half of the AC voltage signal. Data and power sent in this manner are often over a two-wire transmission line and are often referred to as a two-wire interface. Irrigation devices variously located in the field couple to the two-wire interface and derive their operational power therefrom. The irrigation devices demodulate the data monitoring the received power signal for a missing negative half of a cycle, then taking eight voltage samples at a predetermined time thereafter during the positive half to detect whether the signal is clipped or unclipped. Such systems are well known in the art and described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,395 to Evelyn-Veere. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for providing power and data to an irrigation device. The method includes modulating data onto an alternating power signal by distorting an amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, permitting effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and applying the alternating power signal to a multi-wire interface configured to couple with a plurality of irrigation devices. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system. The method includes receiving an alternating power signal comprising cycles each having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and demodulating data represented by the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device having a modulator configured to modulate data onto an alternating power signal by distorting amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, and permit effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal. The irrigation controller further includes an interface configured to couple the modulator to a multi-wire interface coupled to a plurality of irrigation devices to permit the alternating power signal to be applied to the multi-wire interface. In still yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation device having an input configured to receive an alternating power signal comprising cycles having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and a demodulator configured to provide data by demodulating the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In a further embodiment, the invention may be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system, the method comprising: receiving, at an irrigation device, an alternating power signal comprising cycles, where an amplitude of a portion of each cycle is selectively distorted to modulate data on the alternating power signal; determining a slope of the portion of each cycle; and demodulating the data based upon the determining the slope"
9850179,Granular humate for spray application and process of making same,2015-09-04,0,1,"The present invention, in general, relates to soluble humates and fulvates and a process for making same, and in particular to a granular product that has limited dusting and is amenable to delivery via a spray applicator or liquid application, such as drip irrigation. The humic and fulvic acids in a dry soluble powder act as natural chelating agents binding to nutrients in the soil. Plant roots absorb these humic acid nutrient compounds effectively increasing the efficiency of plants' uptake of nutrients and decreasing nutrient losses caused by leaching. In combination with fertilization, humic and fulvic acids foster efficient use of a fertilization program and may even reduce the amount of nutrients applied. Humic and fulvic acids also contribute to improving soil quality, texture, water holding capacity (retention) and sustainability, while breaking down clay lattices and reducing sodium build up in soils. By using a dry soluble product, a user can make small liquid batches when and where needed, transportation, storage and handling are simpler and cost efficient. Sulfonated potassium humate powder is inherently highly soluble in most aqueous liquids over a range of pH ranges, and this humate is also dusty to handle as a powder—which are key factors for humic acid agronomic performance, but also lead to other physical and handling restrictions that have limited the marketplace use and acceptance of this product. This high solubility has also been a detriment in the ability to make sulfonated potassium humate into a granular form. In addition, existing granular potassium humates have limitations with respect to solubility in fertilizer solutions, especially acidic solutions. Furthermore, existing liquid humate solutions and formulations are limited in humate concentration levels, resulting in the inefficient transport of such products. Thus, there exists a need for a sulfonated humate that allow for ease of handling, storage as a low dust granule; and application of the granular form either in particle or liquid form. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A granularized sulfonated humate powder material is provided that includes a sulfonated cationic humate composed of at least one of humic acid, fulvic acid, or a combination thereof in the form of granules of from 0.1 to 6 millimeters in size. The humate powder material is water soluble with limited dusting and the ability to form a concentrated solution for application. A process of formulating the sulfonated potassium humate powder in granular form includes a lignin or lignosulfonate being metered into a powder of sulfonated potassium humate to allow for granulation without a solubilizing the powder by matching a lignin particle size to a particle sizing of said powder. The lignin or lignosulfonate and the powder are mixed into the granular form with a granule size of 0.1 to 6 millimeters. A crop can be fertilized with the powder by dissolving or suspending the material in water or an aqueous fertilizer to form a lyophilic dispersion or solution. The Resulting dispersion or solution is then applied through a tape emitter for drip irrigation applications, tank mixes, and fertigation equipment to fertilize the crop without the clogging that has been common with conventional humates."
4306682,Machine for agricultural irrigation,1979-10-10,0,1,"I. Field of the Invention The invention relates to a machine for agricultural irrigation and is particularly concerned with an irrigation machine of the hose-drum type. II. Description of the Prior Art In previously known irrigation machines of the hose type, a hose-drum is mounted on a chassis or supporting vehicle, the hose-drum has a flexible hose wound thereon and supplied at the inner end of the hose from a source of water, the outer end of the hose being attached to an irrigation nozzle or gun mounted on a trolley or sledge. By winding-in the hose on the drum while water is being supplied through the hose, the irrigation nozzle or gun discharges water while the trolley or sledge with the nozzle or gun thereon is pulled by the hose towards the chassis or supporting vehicle on which the drum is mounted. In conventional hose-drum machines of the foregoing type it is conventional to mount the drum for rotation about a central horizontal shaft supported at its end on brackets or stanchions, which are either mounted directly on the chassis or supporting vehicle, or are mounted on a turret or platform supported on the chassis or vehicle for turning about a vertical axis. Such machines have a number of disadvantages. The first disadvantage is that as the drum is of large diameter and axial length in order to accommodate a long length of hose, the drum and hose, particularly when the latter is running full of water, are extremely heavy. Therefore the supporting brackets and turret, where the drum is mounted on a turret, are of heavy construction and extend above the chassis. The combined centre of gravity of the hose-drum and supporting structure is therefore at a substantial height above the chassis. There is therefore a risk that the machine could topple over, particularly where it is being transported over rough ground. In addition, this risk of toppling over is present during operation, that is during watering, since the tension of the hose is pulling the trolley or sledge is applied at the height of the shaft of the drum. This tensile force is considerable, taking into account the length and diameter of the hose, the weight of the water therein and the frictional forces between the hose and the ground. Therefore the moment of this tensile force applied by the hose to the drum at the height of the axis of the shaft also tends to topple the chassis. Another disadvantage of known hose-drum machines is that the hose, although it is wound-up from the bottom of the drum, still has to be raised during winding due to the drum being mounted above the chassis, particularly where the drum is mounted on a turret. This also results in a tendency for the machine to be unstable. Yet another disadvantage is that the drum and its supporting shaft are usually formed as an assembly which cannot readily be removed from the chassis or turret, for example, to facilitate transport of the machine. The invention has as its object the avoidance of these and other disadvantages. According to the invention, a hose-drum irrigation machine of the kind carrying a hose-drum mounted for rotation about a horizontal axis and mounted either directly on a chassis or supporting vehicle or on a turret or platform rotatable about a vertical axis with respect to the chassis or supporting vehicle, includes two sets of drum-supporting rollers or wheels mounted for rotation on the turret or platform or chassis or supporting vehicle to provide a cradle on which the drum is mounted and is rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the drum without the provision of a central supporting shaft co-axial with the drum. The drum includes a pair of laterally-spaced peripheral rolling tracks arranged to engage the supporting rollers or wheels. Two sets of drum-locating wheels are mounted for rotation about axes spaced from the axes of rotation of the drum-supporting rollers or wheels to engage radially inner surfaces of the peripheral rolling tracks to maintain the drum in engagement with the drum-supporting rollers or wheels and to restrain the drum from end-wise movement on the drum-supporting rollers or wheels. At least one of the drum-supporting rollers or wheels is arranged to be driven to effect rotation of the drum in the hose re-winding sense. The drum-supporting rollers or wheels may be arranged very close to the turret or chassis or supporting vehicle on which they are mounted. Consequently, the axis of rotation of the drum and the height of the center of gravity of the drum, and hence of the combined drum and chassis, and turret where provided, are situated much lower than in conventional hose-drum machines as the central shaft of the drum and it supporting brackets or stanchions have been eliminated. In addition, the supporting rollers or wheels can be made of relatively small diameter and be so positioned with respect to the chassis that the hose can be wound onto the drum substantially tangentially, thereby making it unnecessary for the hose to be lifted through a substantial height from the ground during rolling-up of the hose. As a result, the stability of the machine according to the present invention is greatly improved and consequently the risk of toppling is substantially eliminated. At least one drum-supporting wheel may be associated with a toothed sprocket wheel engaging a chain enveloping or co-axial with one of the peripheral rolling tracks on the drum and fixed with respect to the drum, the sprocket wheel being connected to be driven by a turbine or hydraulic piston motor arranged to be driven by water supplied to the hose. By using a driving chain fixed around the drum and engaged by the sprocket wheel, a positive driving movement is applied to the drum while water is flowing through the hose to the irrigation nozzle or gun. The teeth of the sprocket wheel engaging in the chain tend to limit the drum from moving in the axial direction. Additionally a sideways locating wheel or wheels may be provided in engagement with the drum. Preferably, the peripheral rolling track adjacent the sprocket wheel may be formed with a peripheral channel open radially outwardly of the drum containing a ring of rubber or other elastomeric material in which the chain is embedded, whereby the chain will be fixed with respect to the drum. By embedding the chain in rubber or other elastomeric material, the adhesion of the chain to the drum is ensured and furthermore, it is not necessary to use a chain of precise axial length. The rubber or other elastomeric material enables any increase in length of the chain during use to be accommodated. The peripheral rolling track on the drum adjacent the channel in which the chain is located, is preferably engaged by a drum-supporting roller or wheel mounted adjacent the sprocket, a similar supporting wheel or roller being provided to engage the same peripheral rolling track at a fixed peripheral distance from the first-mentioned supporting wheel or roller. Each said supporting wheel or roller may be mounted on a supporting plinth which also carries a second wheel or roller engaging a radially-inner surface on the peripheral rolling track. The said second wheel or roller may also be inclined to engage a side wall of the peripheral rolling track, thereby to locate the drum to restrain axial movement of the latter. Preferably the drum is provided with a pair of axially-spaced peripheral rolling tracks each supported by a pair of circumferentially-spaced wheels or rollers and also located by associated said second wheel or roller, whereby the drum is supported and located at four positions, in addition preferably at least one of said wheels or rollers is associated with a driving sprocket, as aforesaid. Another important feature which may be provided is to construct the drum in a plurality of arcuate portions which are assembled circumferentially and may be dismounted and re-assembled to facilitate transport of the machine. As aforesaid, the machine may include a turret rotatable about an upright axis and in that case the drum-supporting rollers and wheels and associated rollers or wheels are mounted on the turret, which in turn is mounted on the chassis. The chassis may have a main portion supporting the turret and/or the hose-drum and this portion may be supported by ground-engaging wheels and/or legs and may be provided with a draw-bar. The draw-bar, ground-engaging wheels and legs may be mounted on detachable frame portions which are removable from the main portion and are interchangeable depending on whether the chassis is to be free-standing, wheeled or to be towed by a tractor or the like."
6575393,Apparatus for applying and retrieving protective ground coverings,2001-10-08,0,1,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to machines for laying down and taking up ground covers using reels and particularly to a machine that rapidly lays down a ground cover on a road, secures the cover to the road, and takes up the cover for reuse. 2. Technical Background Numerous machines have been described which use reel mechanisms to lay down covers on the ground and take them up. Some of these have been for covering baseball fields, football fields, new-laid concrete, winter recreation surfaces, and land fills. Some machines have been described for laying down or taking up plastic piping or grass turf. In those machines, the cover reels cannot raise or lower the cover reel, do not operate with the cover reel on the ground, or do not have a means of pressing the cover reel on the ground. In addition, they may have no means to secure the cover on the ground. Some of these machines may have a high degree of mechanical complexity or require a built-in prime mover. There exists a need for a practical cover reel assembly that can rapidly apply and fasten a cover to the surface of a road under construction to protect it from rain and other weather conditions, and rapidly retrieve the cover for reuse, or storage. The cover needs to be aligned accurately on the road by uniformly pressing the cover onto the road as the cover is unwound from a reel. The present invention provides a novel, practical means for meeting these needs, particularly to allow construction work to commence immediately after the rain stops rather than having to wait a period of time for an uncovered road bed to dry out. SUMMARY OF INVENTION The present invention is an apparatus for laying down or retrieving a ground cover. The apparatus is useful for rapidly laying a cover over a road or highway to protect the road or highway from rain and precipitation and other weather exposure to reduce the amount of work necessary to repair a road bed from erosion caused by rain. It is also useful for protecting road construction sites, road preparation sites, and excavation sites, and road beds from rain and other weather conditions prior to laying asphalt or concrete. The cover can then be rapidly retrieved by the apparatus when there is no longer a need to cover the road or highway. In one embodiment, the invention has a first frame which can be attached to a prime mover such as a forklift or tractor. The first frame has pivotal support arms which are attached to a second frame and a cover reel. Hydraulic means are also connected between the first frame and pivot support arms to raise and lower the cover reel and second frame. Alternatively, the hydraulic means are positioned between the prime mover and first frame and the cover reel is lowered to the ground by simply rotating the first frame forward. Cable reels with cables or chains, having a motor/transmission assembly, are located on the first frame. The frame holding the cover reel may have arms to provide a tension bar or rollers in front of and in back of the cover reel. The tension bar or roller in front of the cover reel may include a brush mechanism to clean the underside of the cover. The cover on the reel can be lowered to the ground and laid onto the road by the action of the prime mover pushing the cover reel forward, freely unwinding the cover over the tension or roller bar. The cables or chains will unwind freely from behind the cover reel and serve to hold the cover in a fixed position on the ground by laying on the cover 6'' to 18'' from each edge of the cover to prevent wind from blowing the cover off the ground. A downward pressing force can be applied to the cover reel by the action of the hydraulic means to facilitate unwinding and alignment of the cover on the ground. The ground cover can be rewound and taken up onto the cover reel by a reverse process. The cover is passed over the tension bar and attached to the cover reel. The cover reel is then pushed forward by the prime mover, winding up the cover as the cover reel rotates. Simultaneously, the cables or chains are rewound on the cable reels by action of the cable reel motor/transmission assembly. In both procedures of laying down or taking up the cover, downward pressing force can be applied to the cover reel by the hydraulic means to facilitate winding, unwinding, and alignment of the cover on the ground or on the cover reel. However, the weight of the cover reel itself may be sufficient to do this. In an alternative embodiment, the invention has a first frame which can be attached to a prime mover. A second frame is attached rotatably to the first frame and a third frame is attached rotatably to the second frame. Hydraulic means are connected between the first and second frames to raise and lower the second frame. The second frame contains a cover reel with a ground cover which is wound or unwound by a motor/transmission assembly connected to the first frame. The second frame also contains a brush/guide mechanism. The third frame contains a motor/transmission assembly which winds or unwinds cables from cable reels connected to the third frame. There is a hydraulic means between the first and third frames to raise and lower the third frame. In this embodiment, the cover is laid down by pulling the unit on the ground behind the prime mover. The cover and cables or chains are attached at one end to the ground and unwind freely as the unit is pulled away. The cover is taken up by pulling the unit behind the prime mover. The cables or chains are taken up by activating the motor/transmission assembly. The prime mover is driven at a speed to facilitate taking up or laying down a cover without a backlash. The cover can also be taken up by activating the cover reel motor/transmission assembly after raising the cover reel off the ground. In both procedures of laying down or taking up the cover, downward pressing force can be applied to the cover reel by the hydraulic means to facilitate winding, unwinding, and alignment of the cover on the ground or on the cover reel. The downward pressing force of the present invention makes it possible to lay the cover rapidly and accurately. One advantage of the present invention is to provide a cover reel assembly that can apply a ground cover to the ground at a rate not less than 200 feet per minute and simultaneously lay down cables or chains on top of the ground cover at the desired location on the ground cover. Another advantage of the present invention is to provide a cover reel assembly that can take up a ground cover and the cables or chains from the ground at a rate not less than 200 feet per minute. A further advantage of the present invention is to provide a cover reel assembly that employs a cover reel on the ground and that can apply a downward pressing force on the reel to facilitate winding, unwinding and alignment of the cover on the ground or on the cover reel. A yet further advantage of the present invention is to provide a cover reel assembly that can rapidly lay down and take up the ground cover, and the cables or chains that lay on the cover, by pushing the cover reel. Still a further advantage of the present invention is to provide a cover reel assembly that can lay down and take up the ground cover, and the cables or chains that lay on the cover, by pulling the cover reel."
3958615,Tree cutting apparatus with improved cutting blade construction,1974-09-12,0,1,"This invention relates to apparatus for felling standing trees and more particularly to an improved tree cutting and gripping head assembly for use in such apparatus. Devices for felling standing trees embodying tree cutting and gripping head assemblies of the type in which the cutting means is moved through the tree trunk in a single operative stroke have come into widespread use. The cutting mechanism most commonly employed includes cooperating cutting blades movable through an operative stroke by a vertical pivotal action about a vertically extending axis or parallel vertical axes. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,461,929 there is disclosed a cutting mechanism which includes a pair of severing blades that are arcuate in transverse cross-section and are mounted for movement about parallel horizontal axes. The disclosure of this patent indicates that a cutting mechanism of this type is particularly advantageous over the more common type indicated above in that the tree can be severed closer to the ground, particularly under conditions where snow is covering the ground. A further advantage is asserted in the non-splitting cutting action because of the arcuate travel of the cutting blades. Moreover, the relatively narrow horizontal width of the blades when in an open position permits operation in close quarters. U.S. Pat. No. 3,540,501 discloses a cutting mechanism in which a pair of cutting blades are mounted for arcuate movement about an axis which forms an angle of at most 70.degree.with respect to the horizontal. The blade or blades of the cutting mechanism are generally domed shape in configuration so as to form a cut in the tree trunk which leaves the upper surface of the stump in a concave dome-like configuration. This arrangement is disclosed as having the advantage of retaining water in the upper surface of the stump, which materially aids in stump deterioration. In both of the mechanisms noted above, the overall apparatus includes a gripping mechanism for holding the tree at a position above the cutting position so that the severed tree can be controlled by the apparatus after the cutting action has been completed. The gripping mechanisms provided are separately actuated as is characteristic of all of the cutting and gripping head assemblies of the prior art. An object of the present invention is to greatly simplify the structure and operation of a tree cutting and gripping head assembly of the type described thus enabling the head to perform the intended functions more effectively in a more economical manner. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, this objective is obtained by providing a single movement effecting unit, of the power operated linear movement type, which is operatively connected both with respect to a tree cutting part of the tree cutting and gripping head assembly and to a tree gripping part thereof for effecting movement of both of these parts through their respective operative strokes in response to a single actuating movement of the unit. Preferably, the cutting and gripping parts are mounted for pivotal movement about a common horizontally extending axis, thus enabling the assembly to obtain the advantages attributed to movements of this type, particularly as set forth above with respect to U.S. Pat. No. 3,461,929. Specifically, this arrangement not only provides a favorable cutting pattern and position in the tree trunk, but a favorable cutting force application and cutting action as well. Another object of the present invention is the provision of a tree cutting and gripping head assembly which is simple in construction, effective in operation, and economical to manufacture and maintain. Another object of the present invention is the provision of a cutting mechanism of the type described having an improved blade configuration for cutting the upper surface of the tree stump during the cutting action so as to materially aid in stump deterioration. These and other objects of the present invention will become more apparent during the course of the following detailed description and appended claims."

6449897,Landscape edging system having adjustable blocks with recesses,1998-09-30,0,1,"FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to landscape edging systems and methods, and more particularly to landscape edging systems and methods for forming borders or walkways between adjoining garden, landscape, driveway, walkway, patio or sidewalk areas. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Gardeners, landscapers and homeowners frequently use border or edging material such as fences, logs, railroad ties, bricks, concrete blocks and the like to provide a decorative edge for a landscape or garden. Such border or edging material is also frequently employed to physically separate landscape, garden and other areas from one another. Plastic landscape edging is now commonly used to divide and separate different landscape areas to preclude material in one area from spilling over into an adjacent area, and to prevent grass, flowers or the like contained in one area from growing in an adjoining area. For example, plastic edging is typically used to divide grass landscape areas from adjoining garden areas, and helps prevent grass from taking root in adjoining garden areas. Plastic edging also helps prevent garden bedding material from spilling onto the adjoining landscape area. The most prevalent materials used to fabricate landscape edging today are inert, synthetic flexible plastics such as polyethylene and ethylene vinyl acetate. In the past, landscape edging has been formed from lengths of wood, corrugated metal strips, plastic, cement blocks and poured concrete. Wood is subject to rot and insect attack and decays over time. Wood landscape timbers must therefore be replaced rather frequently. Ungalvanized metal bands oxidize and rust, and tend to become bent and misshapen over time. Even galvanized metal bands eventually corrode once the protective zinc coating has been oxidized. Concrete blocks are inflexible, difficult to install and generally heavy. Poured concrete is expensive, difficult or impossible to modify once poured and set, and difficult and time-consuming to install. Plastic landscape edging, on the other hand, is inexpensive, readily manufactured, flexible and has a long service life. As a result of the disadvantages inhering in wood, metal and concrete landscaping materials and the unique advantages of plastic, plastic landscape edging has become the landscape edging material of choice of many consumers. While landscape edging formed from inert synthetic plastic has many advantages such as being flexible and resisting deterioration well, problems nevertheless occur in their use. Conventional landscape edging usually consists of a longitudinally extending strip of material having a lower edge that is inserted into the ground to a predetermined depth and an upper edge or rail that generally projects above the ground. The edging is typically installed by digging a narrow trench, inserting the lower edge to a predetermined depth, refilling the trench and compacting the earth around the edging. Such installation normally maintains the edging in its intended position for a period of time. As time progresses, however, the environment and other factors actively work against the edging remaining in its original position. The edging may be walked on, bumped, kicked, shoved aside or otherwise engaged in such a manner that it is displaced in respect of its original position. Landscape mowers or tractors may repeatedly drive over the edging and displace or damage the edging. The winter effects of frost heave, or the freezing and thawing action of the earth surrounding the edging, are often more severe than the foregoing effects in respect of edging displacement or damage. The ground retains moisture in the fall that freezes with dropping temperatures. Water is one of the few materials having a coefficient of volume expansion that increases as temperature decreases, and the ground accordingly expands with frozen moisture in the winter. This has the effect of compressing and heaving the landscape edging, and as a result the edging breaks or is laterally or vertically displaced. When spring arrives in colder climates, plastic landscape edging is often found to have buckled upwards and protruded from the ground during the winter in response to frost heave, especially where adjacent strips of edging are connected to one another. As temperatures rise in spring, the moisture beneath the ground surface melts, again changing the volume of the subsurface ground adjoining the edging. As the seasons alternate, the landscape edging is repeatedly exposed to a variety of forces arising from changing soil volumes that, over the long term, cause the edging to become dislodged or damaged. Landscape edging systems, components and methods are well known in the art, some examples of which may be found in the issued U.S. Patents listed in Table 1 below.

9655311,Absorbent rain sensor with retention basin,2013-12-10,0,1,"The present disclosure relates to irrigation of turf and/or landscaping, and more particularly, to sensors that detect rainfall and send signals to irrigation controllers. BACKGROUND Electronic irrigation controllers typically include a microprocessor or micro-controller that executes a stored watering program to turn a plurality of solenoid actuated valves ON and OFF. The valves deliver water to sprinklers that supply water to turf and/or other landscaping. Electro-mechanical rain sensors are often connected to irrigation controllers to suspend watering during periods of rainfall. In a first type of conventional rain sensor, a bucket collects a certain amount of rain water, and then automatically tips so that the bucket is emptied. The process of filling and emptying the bucket continues as long as it is raining. The bucket is typically calibrated to empty after a predetermined amount of rain, for instance, one-tenth of an inch. A set of switch contacts close every time the bucket tips, generating one pulse for every one-tenth of an inch of rainfall. By way of example, one and one-half inches of rain would be indicated by fifteen pulses supplied by the rain bucket switch. In a second type of conventional rain sensor, rain drops are directed to a common location where they are individually counted. This is often done by directing water droplets over closely spaced apart electrodes and detecting a conductive path through the individual water droplets. In this type of rain sensor one droplet is represented by one pulse. The size of the receptacle that catches the rain drops results in a certain number of droplets equating to a predetermined amount of rainfall. In a third type of sensor a plurality of discs made of a hygroscopic material are mounted in a housing that collects rainfall and deposits it on the hygroscopic material through slots or other apertures formed in the housing. The discs expand as they absorb moisture, causing a two-state electro-mechanical switch to change states once the discs have generated a predetermined amount of movement via physical expansion of the same. The third type of rain sensor is highly reliable and its simplicity and lower cost has resulted in its successful commercialization over many years. According to some embodiments, an irrigation control system can include a control unit and a rain sensor in communication with the control unit.

The second moisture-absorbent element can have an element height extending between the base of the moisture basin and an upper retaining structure. In some embodiments the sidewall height is greater than ten percent the element height and less than sixty percent the element height when the second moisture-absorbent element is dry. In some cases, the one or more liquid-impervious sidewalls include one or more notches, the one or more notches in an outer surface of the one or more liquid-impervious sidewalls to facilitate drainage of overflow liquid from the moisture basin. In some embodiments, the one or more notches are in an outer surface of the one or more liquid-impervious sidewalls to facilitate drainage of overflow liquid from the moisture basin. The moisture basin can include a central post extending upward from the liquid-impervious base, the second moisture-absorbent element mounted on the central post.

5642765,Rotor for land clearing device,1996-05-16,0,1,"The present invention relates to a rotor for cutting and, in particular, to a rotor for cutting and clearing such things as brush, debris and small-diameter trees. Land clearing devices, also referred to as forestry shredders, are used to clear such things as utility and pipe line right-of-ways, fire lanes, construction and development sites, and recreational sites. Many prior art forestry shredders have a plurality of knives, teeth or other cutting elements hingeably mounted near the periphery of a horizontal rotor. In response to the rotation of the rotor, the cutting elements engage and cut through the tree or other woody debris. The shredded material is then discharged and left to mulch to retard erosion and decompose. Typically, the rotor is mounted on and driven by a heavy-duty full-time four-wheel drive tractor. When the forestry shredder is cutting through light brush, it is not essential that the cutting elements be aligned such that there are no gaps between their effective cutting areas. But when larger objects such as large diameter trees and stumps are shredded, even small gaps between the cutting areas of the cutting elements can create problems. For example, if the cutting elements are mounted between circular disks, the disks will rub against the uncut areas of the tree. Thus, there is a need in the art for a rotor assembly that has no gaps between the cutting areas of the cutting elements. Several prior art shredders have attempted to remove such gaps in their cut by mounting several cutting elements on a single pin and then overlapping the cutting elements on different pins such that there are no gaps as the rotor spins about its axis (see FIG. 2). Mounting several cutting elements on one pin, however, presents several problems. If, for example, a cutting element is broken or damaged toward the middle of the rotor, several other cutting elements must be removed before the cutting element can be replaced. This is a time consuming and expensive process. Further, when several cutting elements rotate about a single pin, there are several worn out or rough spots on the pin, making it difficult to remove and insert the pin. In addition, when all the cutting elements in a single row strike at once, this produces an impulse to the drive line. Because each of the pins spans substantially the entire length of the rotor, the cutting elements cannot be offset such that at least one cutting element is in the cutting area at all times (see FIG. 3). Instead, all the cutting elements of a single row strike at once and then there is a gap before the cutting elements of the next row strike. Therefore, there is also a need in the art for a rotor that allows for easy removal and replacement of the cutting elements and solves the impulse problem. It is therefore the principal objective of the present invention to provide a rotor for cutting and clearing land which improves upon or solves the problems and deficiencies existing in the art. Another objective of the invention is to provide a rotor that has no gaps between the cutting areas across the face of the rotor. A further objective of the present invention is to provide a rotor having at least one cutting element at or near the cutting area. A still further objective of the present invention is to provide a rotor for clearing land that allows for the easy removal and replacement of cutting elements. A further object of the present invention is to provide a rotor for clearing land that is efficient in operation, economical to manufacture, and durable in use. These and other features, objects, and advantages should become apparent to those skilled in the art with reference to the accompanying specification. The foregoing objectives are achieved, in the preferred embodiment of the invention, by a rotor assembly comprising a cylinder, a plurality of anchors mounted to and extending from the cylinder, and a plurality of cutting elements each mounted between the sides of adjacent anchors. The anchors are spaced apart and offset on the cylinder such that no gaps exist between the effective cutting areas of the cutting elements. This preferred embodiment eliminates any gaps in the cutting area across the face of the rotor. Further, because several cutting elements are not mounted on a single pin spanning the length of the rotor, the operator can easily remove the pins and independently change the cutting elements."

These objects are achieved thereby that the suspension device according to the invention has been given the characterizing features defined in the claims."
9615657,Corner joint for modular portable stand,2015-06-25,0,2,"TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the field of stands, and specifically to stands used for indoor gardening or aquatics that require no tools or additional hardware when assembling or disassembling. The present invention relates to knock-down portable stands, such as used to support heavy items at level elevations, and the invention aims to provide a portable stand of modular construction that easily assembles and disassembles without the need for tools and without requiring fasteners or hardware of any type. Indoor gardeners utilize trays for starting, propagating, and growing plants. Ebb & flow or drip system gardeners often load a tray with plants, growing media, and water, which in aggregate can become too heavy for the common card table or plastic fold out table to support. Leaving the tray on the ground is not a good option as the standard placement of the water reservoir is directly below the tray. Having the tray elevated for easier plant tending is further desired to make the growing process more enjoyable for the user, and accessible for the disabled grower. A stand used for growing plants that supports a propagation tray must maintain the tray at a level elevation to facilitate complete draining of water and nutrient solutions from the growing media and tray. As the bottom of the tray must be level to the ground in order to optimize ebb and flow gardening practice, the stand that holds the tray must be sturdy enough to prevent the tray from flexing or tilting, keeping the tray level and undistorted. Like a stand used in propagation of plants, a stand used for fish tank support must also maintain a level elevation, and be strong enough to hold the weight of an aquarium, full of water, fish, and rock, with over head lights, pumps, and other components necessary for indoor aquatic practice located either above, below, or on the stand. As the nature of aquatics and growing plants includes the presence of water, the stand must not only be strong and rigid when assembled, but also resistant to water damage, and will not fail if occasionally soaked or saturated, which makes stands constructed of wood or wood composite materials undesirable. A stand that is easy to assemble and disassemble, with the benefit of breaking it down simply to fit into a compact storage area is greatly desired. With the disabled user in mind, the assembly and disassembly process should be easy to understand with no small fasteners or hardware that would be difficult to secure with arthritis or joint pain. Ideally, no tools or hardware would be required. A recent answer to the ‘stand’ problem presented has been products similar to the “Gorilla Tray Stand” that require fixating a plurality of small threaded fasteners to assemble or disassemble. The structure of the stand itself holds the tray level to the ground, is rigid, and allows for easy moving. However, the short comings of this tray stand is the complicated assembly instructions, difficult to fasten bolts and screws, difficult disassembly, all requiring the use of specialized tools. Hence, it can be seen in the indoor gardening and indoor aquatics industry, especially for ebb and flow or drip gardening practices, that there is a need for an improved modular stand, capable of securing a propagation tray or fish tank such that it remains level and elevated to the ground, provides space under the tray or tank for a reservoir or the like, allows accessibility from all sides, is mobile, and easily assembled and disassembled. Further, other fields of art also benefit from a stand that is versatile in application and robust in design as described herein. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The stand assembles easily without tools, additional hardware, or complicated instructions. In the preferred modular embodiment, the stand has four frame rails with each opposing frame rail having identical construction. At each corner there is a leg that facilitates the interlocking of the frame rails without fasteners, each able to receive a wheel or caster on the ground end. The entire stand disassembles by pulling up on each side rail and removing the legs, allowing the stand to quickly break down. The components are long and flat allowing for compact storage or easy packing for travel or transport. The stand can support great weights, and with the addition of cross supports, the loading capacities can be significantly increased. The cross supports fixate either on the top of the frame when used as a table top, or on the bottom of the frame when used to support a fish tank or propagation tray. When used as a propagation tray stand the device provides 360 degree access to items supported on or within the stand and items located below the stand. In the disclosed embodiment described herein, the stand is of just one specific application as a mobile plant tray stand for growing plants, whereby the plant tray fittingly inserts from the top and rests on the frame and within the stand, while a reservoir is located below to facilitate ebb and flow type gardening practice. One skilled in the art will quickly realize that many other uses and applications are readily available for the stand, including but not in any way limited to a quick to assemble table, fish tank stand, marketing display, or moving dolly. OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES These and other advantages and features of the present invention are described herein so as to make the present invention understandable to one of ordinary skill in the art: 1. Versatile in application 2. Robust in construction 3. Only eight components: four frame rails and four legs 4. Only three unique components: base frame, side frame, and leg 5. Optional cross bars easily attach sides for increasing loading capacity 6. Interlocking at the corners provides a rigid and sturdy stand 7. Rigidity and strength increase with added load 8. Movable with inclusion of wheels at the bottom of each of the four legs 9. No tools or special equipment needed to assemble/disassemble 10. Simple to understand assemble/disassemble instructions 11. Fast assembly/disassembly 12. Stores in compact spaces when disassembled 13. Easily transportable when disassembled 14. No hardware"
6536361,Combinable planting plate,2001-10-10,0,1,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a combinable planting plate, particularly to one easy to fabricate, combinable to different areas a person wants, possible to plant different sorts of plants, adjustable in water volume contained in a planting layer placed in the planting plate. As population and cities incessantly grow, and spare land for green area is harder and harder to find. Ordinary people living in a jungle of concrete buildings can only make use of a small space for planting some trees, flowers or green lawn for enjoying and observation, cultivating some lawn on a rooftop or arranging some pot flowers and evergreens, etc. in a house. However, those pot flowers or lawns on rooftops have the following disadvantages and inconveniences. 1. In planting lawns a layer of non-woven cloth is laid on the ground, or a layer of hollow bricks is laid under the layer of non-woven cloth additionally. Then soil is placed on the non-woven cloth for cultivating lawn or flowers in the soil, but this kind of planting is rather suitable for a large area, not suitable for a small room in a house or a small space of outer empty land around a house. 2. As soil is to be brought into a house and laid on a non-woven cloth, it may smear some places in a house during carrying the soil, involving cleaning work of scattered soil. 3. Common lawn is in advance already cultivated and then transplanted to where it is needed, so after the lawn is finished planting, it is not easy to change or supplement other flowers 4. Soil for lawn or green grass cannot hold water always enough, so it has to be watered regularly, resulting in psychological and bodily burden to a person. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A main objective of the invention is to offer a combinable planting plate consisting of a base, a support plate and a planting layer. The base has a plurality of cup-shaped chambers for storing water, or cone-shaped projections to store water in the spaces among the cone-shaped projections. The base has a plurality of projecting square rings and projecting combining studs formed on a circumferential edge for combining more than two bases to increase a planting area. Further, a support plate or a flat net plate is combined on the base, having a plurality of cone-shaped cups with water-absorbing material contained therein for adjusting water volume. The support plate has a circumferential short wall for placing a planting layer in the space surrounded by the wall. Then lawn, green grass or flowers may be planted in the planting layer according to a person' liking, Another objective of the invention is to offer a combinable planting plate provided with a support plate, which has a plurality of cone-shaped projections and water-absorbing material contained in each cone-shaped projection for planting moisture-enduring plants. Or the theory of siphon can be used to suck water in the projections to the planting layer to plant dry-enduring plants to prevent water from flowing excessively. Thus, water in the planting layer can be adjustable, facilitating care of the plants in conjunction with water storing function of the cup-shaped chambers of the base. One more objective of the invention is to offer a combinable planting plate, having the base and the supporting plate placed on the base to permit rain or water sprayed to flow through the drain holes of the supporting plate or through the net plate into the cone-shaped cups of the base to store therein. Further, the base has drain holes in a proper height to adjust the water level of the base, which then has a function of storing water. If the flat net plate is used, roots of lawn or flowers can extend down through the net holes to suck up water stored in the base, without possibility of withering caused by insufficiency of water."

4229202,Wastewater treatment with ultraviolet disinfection and increased capacity,1979-01-29,0,2,"The invention relates to wastewater treatment, and more particularly to an efficient on-site wastewater treatment and disposal method and apparatus utilizing filtration and ultraviolet disinfection. Various systems have been used for treatment of residential and other wastes. In cities there have typically been central sewage treatment facilities for water-borne solid and liquid wastes conducted thereto from residences and other sources. Generally these systems have included separation of the solids from the liquids, sometimes by settlement and sometimes by filtration. However, separation at this stage is only partially effective, since the solids and liquids have become nearly homogenized in transit. Such """"separated"""" solids have often been subsequently subjected to a drying operation. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,736,434 and 3,559,807. The liquids from such sewage treatment, which at this point carry many substances from the solids, have usually been chemically treated to the point that they can be returned to the soil or to flowing water. The solids have generally been either buried or composted. Composting of sewage solids at this stage is nearly always anaerobic, since anaerobic decomposition has already begun as the wastes have travelled through sewage lines to the treatment facility. This precludes aerobic composting, which often is desirable and feasible, for producing a useful compost without contaminating the surrounding air. One type of on-site sewage filtration apparatus has been suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 3,747,766. That apparatus was intended to separate solid wastes from liquid wastes soon after their exit from households or other sources. However, the system of the patent was completely closed, with no provision for aerobic composting of solids. The final treatment of the solids was to be dehydration and/or burning. This type treatment is not only costly but also wasteful of the soil conditioning product that can be derived from aerobic composting. The aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 3,559,807 discloses a conveyor-type filtering device which is in some respects similar to a filtering apparatus of the present invention. However, the filtering device of that patent does not include several particularly advantageous features of the present invention, and it is shown for use with solid material drying and burning apparatus. In connection with filtration sewage treatment, there has been a need for an efficient and inexpensive means of disinfecting the liquid filtrate, without destruction of nutrients, so that with minimal treatment it can be dispersed to soil as a beneficial supplement. There has been a need for an efficient, compact, and reliable wastewater separation and treatment apparatus in several areas of application in addition to sewage treatment. For example, in the food processing industry large quantities of water bearing organic materials must be separated from such materials at least to the point that the water can be safely returned to the soil. Similar problems exist with other industrial water-borne wastes. In industrial air pollution reduction equipment, solid pollutants are often ultimately carried by water. This water should be separated from the solids and purified before it is introduced to the soil or flowing water. The invention described herein is an on-site wastewater treatment and disposal system adaptable for many liquid separation applications, and particularly suited for sewage treatment for private dwellings or groups of dwellings. The basic principles of the invention are as follows: While the wastewater or sewage is still fresh, solids are immediately separated from the wastewater input by a paper filter which is dispensed by a sequentially advanced continuous roll, formed into an input trough and exhausted of its filtrate by a suction applied from below. The trapped solids and paper filter are conveyed to a composting area where they are allowed to decompose by natural biological processes. The filtrate is exposed to ultraviolet radiation to kill organisms directly and also preferably to produce ozone in the filtrate, for reaction with organisms to produce harmless, stable compounds. The disinfected filtrate is applied to unsaturated ground, beneficially adding nitrogen to the soil. By the means disclosed, a number of unique and highly beneficial results are obtained over previous wastewater processing systems: Solids are removed soon after their entry into the wastewater flow, before significant pathogen growth and while the solids still have a high degree of structural integrity and have not become """"homogenized"""" with the liquids, which ordinarily happens in prolonged wastewater transit. This immediate filtration with a very efficient disposable filter allows for a highly filtered filtrate virtually free of suspended solids, low in bacteria, easily pumped, and readily disinfected. The almost total extraction of wastewater contaminants with the filter limits the need for process decontamination to a fraction of the original wastewater volume. Thus, unlike conventional sewage treatment processes, no large tanks are needed for biological digestion of contaminants in solution. Composting of the paper with dewatered solids by either aerobic or anaerobic means provides an energy-efficient, non-polluting and reliable method for decontaminating the solids for return to the ecosphere. Where aerobic means are used, sewage solids can be integrated with other organic solid wastes for optimized composting of both. The system lends itself extremely well to the use of ultraviolet radiation to disinfect the liquid filtrate, destroying pathogens and controlling regrowth. The ultraviolet treatment is energy-efficient, since the energy emitted is only used to destroy organisms, and not to enter into energy-absorbing chemical reactions. Conversely, disinfectants which work purely by oxidation, such as chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, and iodine are inefficient in disinfecting effluents with high nutrient content since their chemical energy is largely wasted in reactions with the nutrients. Ultraviolet radiation, unlike chlorine, is highly efficient in killing viruses, even more so than in killing bacteria. The ultraviolet utilized for the invention includes a wavelength effective to directly kill pathogens by destroying the DNA of the organism, known as """"germicidal"""" wavelength ultraviolet. It also preferably includes an ozone-producing wavelength, which acts on the pathogens by a different means: production of ozone from entrained air in the filtrate liquid, resulting in the formation of stable compounds from pathogens, and the addition of residual hydrogen peroxide to the filtrate to deter pathogen regrowth. The two types of ultraviolet treatment act in concert to disinfect the filtrate more thoroughly and efficiently than the sum of their effects taken separately. The nutrients of the filtrate liquid are left in a form useful as a beneficial soil supplement. Ultraviolet treatment is particularly advantageous with this system because the filtration employed removes nearly all suspended solids, unlike settling processes, making the filtrate clearer and permitting more thorough penetration of the ultraviolet light, resulting in more efficient treatment of the filtrate. Also, the apparatus and method of the invention provide for the ultraviolet treatment immediately after filtration, before growth of organisms and turbidity can occur, and while there is significant entrained air in the filtrate for the production of ozone. This also provides for treatment at a location where the liquid flow rate is slow, for better irradiation. Suction applied to the filtration further increases entrained air in the filtrate, enhancing ozone production. The dissolved solids present in the disinfected filtrate, in the case of sewage, are primarily phosphates, alkyl benzyl sulfonates and organic nitrogen compounds, all of which are readily and productively absorbed by vegetation through the assistance of microorganisms. Nitrogen present in urine, which constitutes over 80% of the nitrogen in human waste, is preserved by this process in a liquid fertilizer; other aerobic and composting systems dissipate most of this nitrogen to the atmosphere as ammonia gas. The disinfected filtrate, being virtually free of suspended solids and thoroughly disinfected, can be readily transported by narrow diameter pressurized pipe and dispersed to unsaturated ground through trickle irrigation, spray irrigation, or furrow irrigation with little danger of soil clogging or orifice clogging. This system, unlike many proposed on-site processing systems, can be installed into existing homes without changing any of the existing plumbing fixtures. Both sanitary and washing wastewaters are processed with no need for separate handling of the two. The system may also be easily installed at existing industrial sites for separating and treating non-sewage wastewaters bearing solids. In fact, it is highly adaptable to the food processing industry, where organic materials are carried in wastewater, and also to the reclamation of water from polluted-air cleansing """"scrubbers"""" which pick up solids from the air they cleanse. For new homes, the installation of the on-site system can save considerably in piping costs. Thus, in one embodiment the process of the invention comprises separating the solids from the liquids while the sewage is fresh, and producing a liquid component low in suspended solid material; exposing the liquid component to ultraviolet radiation including germicidal wavelength, to destroy pathogens but not beneficial nutrients present in the liquid component; introducing ozone in the liquid component to react with pathogens to form stable compounds and to produce residual hydrogen peroxide for deterring subsequent pathogen growth; and dispersing the nutrient-rich treated liquid component to unsaturated ground. In another embodiment, the invention has certain modifications to a wastewater delivery subsystem, whereby filtration and pump operation are made continuous and the capacity of the system is approximately doubled. The modification involves duplication of a few tank and valve components, increasing cost and space requirements less than 20 percent. In addition, the system is readily adaptable to a modular arrangement whereby the capacity may be doubled simply by adding a few modular components and adjusting the control sequence. Thus, according to the second embodiment, the process of the invention comprises a continuous filtration process involving duplicate filtrate or power reservoirs, including pumping stored filtrate from the first reservoir to create a suction; connecting that reservoir with the holding or buffer tank to draw a charge of wastewater into the holding tank; releasing the charge to the filter medium; disconnecting the first reservoir from the holding tank and connecting it to the filtrate side of the filter medium to apply suction thereto and draw filtrate into the first reservoir; while filtration proceeds, pumping stored filtrate from the second reservoir to create a suction therein; connecting the second reservoir to the holding tank and drawing a second charge of wastewater thereto; releasing the second charge to the filter medium; while filtration continues, disconnecting the second reservoir from the holding tank and switching the filtrate side of the medium from the first to the second tank as a source of suction; and thence repeating the cycle. Accordingly, some of the objects of the invention are as follows: (1) To provide a means for conveying wastewater to a filtration station and filtering through a paper filter; (2) To provide a hydraulic/pneumatic subsystem consisting of one pump, several reservoirs, and several inexpensive valves to supply storage of incoming wastewater, pneumatic lift of wastewater to the paper filter, suction to the filtrate side of the filter, and hydraulic pressure for the treated liquid; (3) To provide efficient ultraviolet treatment of the liquid filtrate, soon after filtration, for complete disinfection of the filtrate with minimal energy requirements; and (4) To provide for continuous filtration and approximate doubling of the system's capacity where desired, through addition of modular, interchangeable components. These and other objects, advantages, and features of the invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment, taken in conjunction with the drawings."
9415229,DBS and heart electrical stimulation and measurements with multiple electrodes,2013-08-19,0,1,"1. Field of Invention This invention relates to cellular electrical stimulation in general, for animals and other life forms, as fish and plants, including humans, and neuron, heart muscle, other muscles and organs electrical stimulation in particular, including in particular brain, spine and heart. It also relates to electrical measurements of cells in general, and of neurons in particular. 2. Discussion of Prior Art It is well established in the field of neurological science that neurons work by propagating electrical signals. This is know to be true whether the neurons are transmitting an order from the brain or other initiating point to another body part, as an order to move the leg forward, which is a complex set of commands, or for a heart beat, that is simpler than a leg movement, delivered to the sinus, or on the other direction, transmitting a sensation from some body part to the central nervous system, as temperature or pain somewhere, or simply thinking, as pondering about the meaning of this very patent disclosure, which is an electrical activity that is completely inside the brain. It turns out that the brain is divided in parts dedicated to special tasks that are in relative position to each other in the same way in all animals of a particular species and even approximately the same across species. These parts are three dimensional but are called areas by the neurologists. In reality neurologists call area what is really a volume in standard parlance, the place that contains all the neurons involved in apart or in the totality of some particular neurological activity occurs. So, Broca area, as the neurologists call it, is really the Broca volume, as a lay person would, because it is a 3-dimensional arrangement, etc. In the disclosure we most often use the word “volume” because it is a better descriptor, but in established uses, as named regions of the brain, as the Broca area, we use “area”. Accordingly, the areas that are used to detect and process vision are located very much the same way in all H. sapiens , with little difference to chimpanzees and more differences to cats, which is a consequence of biological speciation and relatedness. The internal parts of an animal are variable in size from individual to individual as much as the external parts are, as size of nose, mouth or hand, but as much as in humans the nose is always above the mouth, each specialized part of the brain has a slightly different absolute size in each individual, but is relatively positioned to each other in the same way in all humans. These brain parts are known by neurologists as areas, as Broca area, Wernicke area, etc. It is also known that constant use can enlarge areas that are requested constantly, as shown by the work with London cab drivers. The brain of Homo sapiens is now all mapped, that is, the function of all areas is known to the neurologists. Accordingly, the Broca area is responsible for speech and its position is known, the Wernicke area is responsible for hearing, also at a known location, and so forth, and their position in the brain is well known to the neurologists. Yet, though their relative position is the same, their absolute position with respect to some external mark is not the same in all humans, among other reasons because humans come in different sizes, but also because even two humans of the same height have noses, hands, hearts, livers and Broca and Wernicke areas of not exactly the same size, and even the same exact shape. Eric R. Kandel (Kandel (2000)) gives a good overview of the current state of the art from the academic point-of-view. Accordingly, two fields have been developing: neurological research and correction of neurological disorders. These have advanced to the point that it is now common, ordinary, daily practice, to measure electrical signals in neurons, and also to add electrical stimulation to them to change their actions. The former, neuron measurements, are only rarely done in humans, and done in experimental animals under close monitored conditions, after receiving approval of some internal reviewing board that oversees animal research. Naturally that in mammals, experiments are under closer control than in fish, and more loosely control on insects and the like, because few humans care much about the Drosophila melanogaster , a feeling that is reciprocated, the inventors believe. The latter, electrical stimulation, is a common surgery practiced today, mostly to control Parkinson's disease, but in smaller numbers for other neurological malfunctions too, as epilepsy, and other disorders. Electrical stimulation is also done for pain control and for organ stimulation (including increasing and decreasing organ activity), as for appetite control, bladder control and the like. Given that many of the readers here may be from the biological sciences or medical fields, we define a common term used in electronics. In the context of this text here, “electrode” is the ending portion of the stimulating device, from which electrical current is injected into the cells, as neurons, muscle, etc. Also known as pad. Associated with it is the term “measuring tip”, “measuring pad”, “stimulating tip” and “stimulating pad”, These are the very tip of the measuring/stimulating wire, sometimes referred as electrode in current art, made of metal or some other electrically conducting material. In current art devices the measuring tip is generally at the end of a thin, stiff wire, typically 100 micrometers diameter, separated by 100 micrometers, or more, while in our invention the measuring tip is a metallic area as small as a few micrometers, typically 5 micrometers but can be less or more according to the need, separated by as little as 5 micrometers, at the surface of the device of our invention. Current art is capable of manufacturing measuring tips for our invention that are less than one micrometer in diameter, and the shape is not necessarily circular. Another term in use in this field, this one self-explanatory but which we explicitly define, is “neural sensor”. As used here, the term “neural sensor” means an implantable device for sensing neural signals. Examples of neural sensors include microwire electrode arrays, optical sensors, microwires, magnetic field detectors, chemical sensors, and other suitable neural sensors which are known to those of skill in the art upon consideration of the present disclosure. Accordingly, electrodes for both neuron measurements and stimulation have been developed and are commercially manufactured by a number of companies. Electrical neuron measurements are not widely known to be done in the lab, though they are, but electrical stimulation is widely known in its incarnation as heart pacemakers, that are designed to stimulate the heart muscle by adding an electrical pulse to the one delivered at the sinus node. A pacemaker is used when the electrical pulses to the sinus node becomes defective. Therefore for both neuron measurements and for neuron stimulation, there exists a need to reach a number of neurons, the position of which is difficult to determine with respect to some external feature, as the top of the head or the mammary gland, from which to go to the hypothalamus in the brain from a 1 cm. hole on top of the head, or the sinus node in the heart, from a vein in the clavicle. This is so because, though the relative position of the neurons and cells responsible for each task is generally the same in animals of the same species, the absolute distances is not the same from animal to animal. It follows that it is very difficult for a neurologist to know exactly where the inserted electrode is, whether he/she is interested in making an electric measurement in the brain of a laboratory animal, or in implanting an electrode on a Homo sapiens to control Parkinson's disease. To counter this difficulty, electrode arrays have been introduced both for measurements and stimulation. For measurements there exists arrays composed of several dozen electrodes separated by 50, 100, 250 micrometers, and for neuron excitation, generally larger distances, but details depend on the particular situation. Neither of these have been able to make use of a very large number of electrodes because of the difficulty in passing a large number of wires to connect them to the outside world. Our inventions U.S. patent applications Ser. No. 12/586,763, filing date Sep. 28, 2009, published 2010 Apr. 1, under no. US-2010-0082076 A1 now U.S. Pat.

No. 8,335,551, issued on 2012 Dec. 18, which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, as well as the PPA associated with each of these, disclosed methods and means to connect a much larger number of electrodes, in one case to measure, on the other case to stimulate. With the addressing method disclosed in these patents, instead of having n wires to activate each electrode separately, the same n wires used as an address bus can generate 2 power n (2-super-n) addresses, which in turn can select that many electrodes. For example, one commonly used brain stimulator marketed by Meditronic uses 4 connecting wires to stimulate any one of a set of 4 electrodes at the end of the lead. Using the same 4 wires as an address bus, there is the possibility of selecting 2-super-4=16 separate electrodes, which allows for a much larger selection of points to start electrical stimulation. Yet if these inventions substantially decreased the number of wires to make the necessary connections to a large number of electrodes, it is possible to decrease the number of wires even further, which is very important in an implanted device which must be as little intrusive as possible to make. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION—OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES Former devices for electrical stimulation, whether used for brain (as DBS), heart (as in pacemakers), chronic pain control, muscle, organs and others, used a very limited number of electrodes as initiation points of the electrical stimulation. Similar observation applies to electrodes used to measure electrical cell activity. This was a consequence of the limited space available to pass wires between the battery and control electronics and the actual stimulating devices (of measuring devices). Our inventions disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/586,763, filing date Sep. 28, 2009, published 2010 Apr. 1 under no. US-2010-0082076 A1 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,565,868 issued on 2013 Dec. 22 and U.S. application Ser. No. 12/586,562, filing date Sep. 24, 2009, published on 2010 Apr. 1, under no. US 2010-0079156 A1, currently U.S. Pat. No. 8,335,551, issued on 2010 Dec. 18, disclose methods to increase the number of available stimulating electrodes for both electrical stimulation and for electrical activity measurements as well, while still keeping the number of wires relatively small. These patents disclose the use of an addressing system to select one electrode or a set of electrodes to be the origin of electrical stimulation, or to be the origin of electrical measurements, from a large number of available electrodes, while the addressing wires are in smaller number than the electrodes themselves. Indeed, with n wires it is possible to generate 2-super-n addresses. For example, with 4 wires it is possible to create 2-super-4=16 different addresses that uniquely identify 16 different electrodes. The addressing system disclosed in our patents become more impressive as the number of bits in the address bus increases. Indeed, with 10 bits (that is, with 10 addressing wires), it is possible to generate 2-super-10=1024 different addresses, identifying 1,024 different electrodes. In other words, with 10 bit-wide address bus, not much many more wires than existing stimulators have, it is possible to have 1024 separately controllable electrodes, a number that, given the small size of the devices is virtually infinite. Yet the addressing system still suffered from the use of too many wires to create the necessary addresses for each individual or group of electrodes or pads, because of the extremely small available space available in devices implanted inside the body of animals. This invention discloses an improvement on the earlier method of addressing with a bus composed of a plurality of wires, using instead a serial method to exchange digital information from the microcontroller housed in 110 and the electrical stimulating electrodes 140 , thus reducing the number of wires to two (counting the return wire), or even one, if the power return is also used for serial return, or if the body of the animal is used as ground or return. Accordingly, with the system described in this patent disclosure, three wires (address/data digital transfer, electrical power and ground) or even two, if the body of the animal is used as ground or return wire, suffices for a working electrical stimulator with as many electrodes as one wishes to have—an unbounded number of electrodes. Extra wires are also possible, for example, to allow the possibility of measurements simultaneous with stimulation, or for stimulation at different voltage (or current) levels. Accordingly, several objects or advantages of our invention are obviating the difficulties of running multiple wires in the supporting structure to reach the electrode points at the distal end of the inserting/supporting structure for both cell measurement and stimulation (neurons, as in brain, spinal cord and elsewhere, muscles, as in heart and others, organs, as in stomach, bladder and others). Another object and advantage or our invention is to cut down on the number of address wires that run through the supporting structures to the cell stimulator or to the cell measurement pads, which are needed to select which electrodes are to be used in the particular case. Another object and advantage of our invention is to decrease the manufacturing difficulties and consequently manufacture costs of addressable electrodes for neuronal measurement and stimulation. Another object and advantage of our invention is to decrease the number of wires used to address the electrodes used for either measure or to stimulate, therefore decreasing the possibility of malfunction and the cost of the device as well. Further objects and advantages of our invention will become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and ensuing description. Our invention is a simplification of the addressing method to select which electrode tips are chosen to read electrical neuronal activity or to deliver a stimulating current to the neurons. It describes a single serial line, instead of a plurality of parallel addressing lines, which substantially decreases the number of wires necessary for the operation or stimulating and measuring electrodes implanted in living organisms, wires that have to be passed through a very small space which may not have enough space for many of them. We also disclose the possibility of a small number of wires to function as a parallel-serial mixture, in which data is transferred serially over more than one wire at a time, which decreases the depth of serialization by the same factor as the number of wires that carries the data."
8506670,Micronutrient fertilizers and methods of making and using the same,2010-02-03,0,1,"CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit, and priority, of Indian patent application number 184/KOL/2009, filed on Feb. 3, 2009, and Indian Patent Application Number 1266/KOL/2009, filed on Oct. 21, 2009, the contents of each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The present inventions generally relate to fertilizers, and in particular to a water insoluble slow-release micronutrient fertilizers, produced by incomplete polymerization of metal orthophosphate. Micronutrients are generally thought to be essential building blocks for plants and animals. Such micronutrients may include boron, chlorine, chromium, cobalt, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc. Micronutrient plant fertilization, alone or in combination with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash fertilization, generally results in better crop yields and more nutritious food. Prior micronutrient fertilizers include sulfate salts of the micronutrients, such as zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate and cuprous sulfate or chelates such as zinc EDTA, iron EDTA and copper EDTA. These water-soluble compounds, however, can be leached out of the soil and contaminate water bodies. Other water soluble micronutrient fertilizers have been impregnated with an organic polymer membrane. The nutrients may be released into a solution by diffusion. Still further micronutrient fertilizers have been produced having relatively low micronutrients. Iron and manganese fertilizers are widely used in many parts of the world particularly in soils of high pH, such as the black soils. They are also widely used in horticultural and cash crops to improve yields and quality of produce. The compounds most popularly used for correcting deficiencies of iron and manganese in crops are ferrous sulphate and manganous sulphate (J. J. Mortvedt, P. M. Giordano & W. L. Lindsay, 1972, Micronutrients in Agriculture, Soil Sci. Soc. Am., Madison). Chelated, forms of these micronutrients, e.g., iron-EDTA, and manganese—EDTA compounds are also in use as liquid sprays (V. Saucheli, 1967, Chemistry and technology of fertilizers, Reinhold, N.Y.; G. H. Collins, 1955, Commercial fertilizers, Mc-Graw Hill, N.Y.). There are, however, several drawbacks in the use of such soluble compounds as fertilizers of iron and manganese, e.g., leaching losses, chemical transformation losses, ground water contamination, etc. This results in excess dosages which are often several times the actual crop uptake, leading to poor fertilize-use efficiency. Moreover, such wastages also affect the economics of iron and manganese fertilizer, thereby discouraging their widespread usage. In an attempt to overcome these shortcomings, slow-release fertilizers incorporating iron and manganese have been prepared. One such type is the fertilizer based on phosphate glasses known as frits. Frits are prepared by fusing sodium, potassium or ammonium dihydrogen phosphates together with micronutrient salts at temperatures between 800° and 1400° C. and then rapidly quenching the melt to produce a glass (G. J. Roberts 1973, Am. Ceram. Soc. Bull. Vol 52, p 383; ibid, idem, Vol 54, p 1069; Austrian Patent No 326160 of 1975; U.S. Pat. No. 3,574,591 of 1971; U.S. Pat. No. 2,713,536 of 1974). The major disadvantage of the phosphate glass frits is that the availability of the nutrients is by slow hydrolysis of the glass and is highly dependent on the soil (pH, moisture content, temperature, etc.) and on the crop (rate of growth, physiological factors, variety, etc). Consequently, where nutrient release by hydrolysis does not match plant uptake, the fertilizer is not effective. Moreover, the high temperatures involved in the synthesis of frits together with the corrosive conditions make these materials fairly expensive and unsuitable for general use. Another type of phosphate based water insoluble fertilizer is the metaphosphate. Metaphosphates of calcium and potassium together with micronutrients have been proposed (S I Volfkovich, 1972, J. Appl. Chem. (USSR) Vol 45, p 2479). A Russian patent (SU 1270148 of 1986) describes the production of mixed metaphosphates based fertilizers produced at 500-880° C. Drawbacks in the use of metaphosphates as fertilizers are similar to those with the frits. Metaphosphates may be more insoluble and hydrolyse even slower, producing compounds with very poor nutrient availability. Metaphosphates of the heavy metals are extremely insoluble and of little use as fertilizers. An additional type of slow-release fertilizer has been produced in which the micronutrient ions are in a chemical form wherein they are insoluble but also plant available. These belong to the bio-release types of slow-release fertilizers. The processes for producing such phosphate based zinc and copper fertilizers are described in two Indian patents (Nos 172800 of 1990 and 177205 of 1991). The chemistry of zinc and copper phosphate polymerisation and the chemical nature of these fertilizers have also been described (S K Ray, C Varadachari & K Ghosh, 1993, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. Vol. 32, p. 1218; S K Ray, C Varadachari & K Ghosh, 1997, J. Agric. Food Chem., vol. 45, p. 1447). A patent (C. Varadachari, Indian Patent Application No. 10/CAL/99) describes the processes for production of slow-release fertilizers and describes methods for assessing limits of polymerisation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Among the various aspects of the present invention is the provision of fertilizer compounds having at least one primary micronutrient selected from the group consisting of chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc; and a polyphosphate; and optionally at least one secondary micronutrient selected from the group consisting of boron, chlorine, iodine, molybdenum or selenium.

Various processes and apparatuses for producing urea granules have been disclosed, for example, by Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 28-4763 (1953), Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 30-6263 (1955) and Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 34-5718 (1959). In these processes and apparatuses, a urea aqueous solution or a urea melt is dropped down through a nozzle located at the top of a vertical cylindrical or prismatic granulating column. While the drops of the urea solution or melt fall down through the granulating column, the drops are dried or solidified. This type of process is referred to as an atomize-granulating process. In this type of process, the granulating column is required to be very tall so as to ensure the completion of drying or solidifying of the urea solution or melt drops. Also, this type of process is disadvantageous in that the size of the resultant granules is limited to ranges of from 1 to 2 mm. That is, it is difficult to produce urea granules having a size larger than 2 mm by the above-mentioned atomize-granulating process. Other types of atomize-granulating processes and apparatuses were disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 34-5718 (1959), Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 39-24862 (1964) and U.S. Pat. No. 3,450,804. However, even with these types of processes and apparatuses it is still difficult to produce urea granules having a size larger than 2 mm. Recently, the bulk blending of different fertilizer granules, such as urea, ammonium phosphate and potassium chloride, has become an important operation in the fertilizer industry. The purpose of the bulk blending is to produce a mixed fertilizer of a diesired N-P-K formulation that can be stored, shipped and spread in available commercial equipment without excessive segregation of the various components. A number of studies have been made on the segregation experienced in the blending and handling of these fertilizers. When granules having different size ranges are blended, segregation is likely to occur, resulting in incorrect composition at the point of use. The greatest single factor in producing segregation is the size distribution of the different materials. Differences in shape or density have little effect. Accordingly, for the purpose of even distribution of the bulk blend fertilizer, it is desirable that the size of the urea granules be similar to those of the ammonium phosphate granules. However, the size of ordinary ammonia phosphate granules is in ranges of from 1.1 to 3.36 mm. That is, the size of the ammonium phosphate granules is larger than those of the urea granules produced by the conventional atomize-granulating process and apparatus. Sometimes, the urea granules are coated with a coating material, such as sulphur and a polyolefin, in order to prepare a slow releasing nitrogen fertilizer. It appears that granules, regardless of their size, must have coatings of about the same thickness to produce similar dissolution rates. If this is a valid observation, then the amount of sulphur a substrate urea requires per unit of weight varies directly with the surface area of the urea substrate or inversely with the square of the average diameter of the granules, provided all other variables are constant. Therefore as long as agronomic benefits and handling characteristics are equal, if the size of the urea particles to be coated increases, the coating needed will decrease, reducing the production costs per unit of nitrogen and increasing the nitrogen content in the final products. A process suitable for producing the urea granules having a size large enough for being blended with the conventional ammonium phosphate granules was disclosed in Chemical Engineering Progress, Vol. 69(2), pages 62 through 66, 1973. This type of process is referred to as """"a spherodizer granulation process"""". In this process, seed solid particles of urea are recycled through a rotating drum, and a urea melt is atomized into the drum so that the atomized urea melt particles adhere to the urea seed particles and the adhered melt is solidified. However, this process is disadvantageous in that since the urea melt is maintained in the melt state for a long period of time, not only does the content of biuret in the resultant urea granules become undesirably high, but also, a large amount of urea melt adheres to the inside surface of the rotating drum. Another granulating processes and apparatuses which are suitable for ammonium nitrate and potassium chloride were disclosed for example, by British Pat. No. 962,265, in which a spouted bed is used. In the process of this British patent, a vertical cylindrical vessel having a funnel-shaped bottom is employed. The lowest end of the funnel-shaped bottom is connected to a conduit for blowing a gas upward into the vessel and a thin pipe for spray-injecting a liquid containing a material to be granulated is inserted into the conduit. The top end of the liquid spray-injecting pipe is located in the lowest end of the funnel-shaped bottom of the vessel. When the liquid is spray-injected into the vessel and the gas is blown into the vessel, a spouted bed of the spray-injected liquid droplets and seed particles of the material to be granulated which have been fed thereinto is formed. However, this process is disadvantageous in that the circulation of the spray-injected liquid droplets and the seed particles in the vessel is uneven. Accordingly, the particles located close to the inside wall of the vessel and the bottom cannot be vigorously fluidized and merely form a moving bed. In this moving bed, it is impossible to produce granulates having a uniform size. Sometimes, the liquid droplets and seed particles in the moving bed adhere to each other to form large agglomerations. Also, this British patent contains no disclosure of particular conditions for producing urea granules. Still other granulating processes and apparatuses for urea and other chemical fertilizers were disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 46-6403 (1971), Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 47-7442 (1972), British Pat. No. 1,142,046 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,856,441, in each of which a fluidized bed is utilized. In these types of processes, a vertical cylindrical vessel, which is partitioned into an upper compartment and a lower compartment by a funnel-shaped partition converging downward to a bottom thereof, is used for forming a fluidized bed therein. The funnel-shaped partition has a number of holes formed therein. In order to form the fluidized bed, powdery solid urea is fed into the upper compartment, a number of streams of an inert gas are blown upward into the upper compartment through the holes of the funnel-shaped partitions and a stream of an inert gas is blown vertically upward into the upper compartment through a center of the bottom of the funnel-shaped partition. A liquid containing a material to be incorporated onto the powdery urea fine particles is spray-injected into a middle or upper portion of the fluidized bed. The spray-injected liquid droplets adhere to the powdery urea fine particles and the adhere liquid is dried in the fluidized bed. In the abovementioned process, the circulation, of the urea fine particles and the spray-injected liquid droplets in the fluidized bed can be made more uniform than in the above-mentioned spouted bed process. However, it was found that, in the above-mentioned fluidized bed processes, since the feed of the liquid containing the material to be incorporated onto the powdery urea fine particles is carried out by using a nozzle projected through a side wall of the upper compartment of the cylindrical vessel into the middle or upper portion of the upper compartment, the fed liquid adheres to the surface and top end of the nozzle and the adhered liquid layer is dried on the nozzle. Also, the powdery urea fine particles adhere to the liquid layer so as to form a thick layer or large lumps on the nozzle. This phenomenon promotes the formation of large agglomerations of the urea granules and causes the efficiency of producing the urea granules to be reduced. Also, in the above-mentioned fluidized bed processes, it was found that the powdery urea fine particles to be fed into the fluidized bed have too small of a size as seeds for producing the urea granules having a relatively large size. According, not only is the efficiency of producing the urea granules too low, but also the resultant small urea granules tend to adhere to each other so as to form large agglomerations. Furthermore, in the conventional fluidized bed processes, it was found that since the resultant urea granules are discharged through the bottom of the funnel-shaped partition into a collecting vessel located below the lower compartment of the cylindrical vessel, the fluctuations in flow rate, flow velocity and pressure of the inert gases blown into the upper compartment during the urea granule producing process, results in a change in the stability of the fluidized particles. Sometimes, a large amount of the fluidized particles having various sizes fall down directly into the collecting vessel. The particles received in the collecting vessel can not be recycled into the fluidized bed. Accordingly, it is difficult to selectively discharge the resultant urea granules having a desired size. This difficulty results in unevenness in size of the discharged urea granules. Under these circumstances, an improved process and apparatus for producing urea granules having a uniform size and quality without difficulty are desired. An object of the present invention is to provide a process and apparatus for producing urea granules having a desired size, especially, such a large size that conventional atomizing granulating processes never attain it. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process and apparatus for producing urea granules suitable for bulk-blend fertilizer without formation of agglomeration of the urea granules. A further object of the present invention is to provide a process and apparatus for producing urea granules by simultaneously carrying out the adhering of a liquid containing a material to be incorporated onto the urea seed particles and the drying or solidifying of the adhered liquid on the urea seed particles. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process and apparatus for producing urea granules while the production of undesirable biuret is prevented. The above-mentioned objects can be attained by the process of the present invention which is carried out in a fluidized bed formed in a vertical cylindrical region which is partitioned into an upper portion and a lower portion thereof by means of a funnel shaped partition converging toward a bottom thereof, the upper portion is connected to the lower portion through a number of holes formed in the partition, which process comprises the steps of: (A) feeding solid seed particles of urea into the upper portion of the cylindrical region; (B) atomizing and injecting upward a stream of a liquid containing a material to be incorporated onto the urea seed particles, into the upper portion of the cylindrical region through a nozzle having a top end thereof located just above the center of the bottom of the funnel-shaped partition, said liquid being forwarded to said nozzle through a path extending through the lower portion of the cylindrical region; (C) forming a fluidized bed of the urea seed particles and the atomized liquid droplets in the upper portion of the cylindrical region, (1) by blowing a number of streams of an inert gas, not reactive to urea and the liquid, and having a temperature of from 50.degree. to 98.degree. C., from the lower portion into the upper portion of the cylindrical region through the holes of the funnel-shaped partition, and (2) by blowing upward a stream of an inert gas, not reactive to urea and the liquid, and having a temperature of from 30.degree. to 120.degree. C. into the upper portion of the cylindrical region through an annular opening formed in the bottom of the funnel-shaped partition and surrounding the atomizing nozzle of the liquid, the inert gas being introduced to the annular opening through a path extending through the lower portion of the cylindrical region, whereby the atomized liquid droplets are allowed to adhere onto the urea seed particles and dried or solidified; (D) discharging the resultant urea granules from the upper portion of the cylindrical region through the annular opening and the inert gas path, and; (E) discharging exhaust gas from the upper portion of the cylindrical region. The process described above can be carried out by using the apparatus of the present invention, which comprises: (A) a vertical cylindrical vessel which is partitioned into an upper compartment and a lower compartment thereof by means of a funnel-shaped partition converging toward a bottom thereof, the partition having a number of holes formed therein through which the upper compartment is connected to the lower compartment, said lower compartment being connected to a supply source of an inert gas; (B) means for feeding seed particles of urea connected to the upper compartment of the cylindrical vessel; (C) a vertical conduit connected to the bottom of the funnel-shaped partition, said conduit extending through the lower compartment of the cylindrical vessel and being connected to a supply source of an inert gas; (D) a vertical nozzle inserted into the vertical conduit along the longitudinal axis of the vertical conduit and having a top end thereof located just above the top end of the vertical conduit, the vertical nozzle being composed of a core pipe which is connected to a supply source of a liquid containing a material to be incorporated onto the urea seed particles, and a sheath pipe which surrounds the core pipe and is connected to a supply source of an inert gas, and an annular path for the inert gas being formed between the core pipe and the sheath pipe; (E) means for discharging the resultant urea granules, connected to the vertical conduit, and; (F) means for discharging exhaust gas from the upper compartment of the cylindrical vessel. The above-described process and apparatus of the present invention are suitable for producing urea granules having a relatively large uniform size and, therefore, suitable for the bulk blend fertilizer, without formation of large agglomerations of the urea granules."
4079544,Oil recovery process employing thickened aqueous driving fluid,1976-04-28,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to the production of petroleum from a petroleum-containing subterranean formation employing an aqueous driving fluid containing, as a thickening agent, a biopolymer synthesized by an alga and to the synthesis of the biopolymer by an alga such as Porphyridium aerugineum. 2. Description of the Prior Art Processes for the production of petroleum from a petroleum-containing subterranean formation employing an aqueous driving fluid containing a thickening agent is well known. U.S. Pat. No. 3,020,207 discloses such a process where the thickening agent is a heteropolysaccharide that has been reacted with an aldehyde, the heteropolysaccharide being a fermentation product produced by the action of bacteria of the genus Xanthomonas upon a carbohydrate. U.S. Pat. No. 3,352,358 discloses a process employing thickened aqueous driving fluid where the thickening agent is polyvinyl alcohol sulfate. U.S. Pat. No. 3,372,749 also discloses a process employing thickened aqueous driving fluid where the thickening agent is a poly(glucosylglucan). In the process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,373,810, the thickening agent for the aqueous driving fluid is sulfoalkylated poly(glucosylglucan), a sulfoalkylated polysaccharide or a mixture of both, the polysaccharide being the heteropolysaccharide produced by the action of the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris on glucose. Procedures for the growth of algae are also well known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,195,271 discloses a process for the growth of the alga Porphyridium cruentum. This patent also discloses the synthesis of the alga constituent, carrageenin, and discloses that the liquid phase of the culture in which the alga is grown is viscous or mucilaginous. Procedures for the growth of alga are also disclosed in """"Algal Culture: From Laboratory to Pilot Plant"""", J. S. Burlew, Ed., Carnegie Inst. of Washington, Publication No. 600, Washington, D. C. (1964), and """"Properties and Products of Algae"""", J. S. Zajic, Ed., Plenum Press, N. Y. (1970). It is also well known that many marine and fresh water species of alga liberate synthesis products into their surroundings that have drag reducing properties, Hoyt, J. W., and Soli, G., Science, 149, 1509 (1965). The influence of light quality on the production of algal biomass production is disclosed in """"Spectral Light Requirements of Algae"""", Brown, T. E., Tech. Report No. 69-45-FL, U.S. Army Natick Labs., October, 1968. The invention is directed to the production of petroleum from a petroleum-containing subterranean formation. An aqueous driving fluid is injected into the formation through an input well and passed through the formation in the direction of an output well to drive the petroleum in the formation to the output well. The aqueous driving fluid contains a thickening agent and the thickening agent is a biopolymer, a heteropolysaccharide synthesized by an alga. The invention is also directed to the synthesis of the biopolymer by an alga such as Porphyridium aerugineum. The culture for the synthesis of the biopolymer contains in addition to the usual microelements required for growth of the alga sodium nitrate in the amount of about 60 to 250 weight parts per million (wppm) and sodium glycerophosphate in the amount of about 100 to 300 weight parts per million. The synthesis of the biopolymer may also be carried out under such conditions of illumination of the culture that three radiant energy-related parameters are controlled, namely: (a) the intrinsic slope of the initial segment of the cumulative absorbed radiant energy versus time curve, denoted .psi..sub.a ; (b) the cumulative moles of light quanta absorbed, denoted (E.sub.a).sub.c ; and (c) the group formed by the ratio of (a) to (b), denoted .DELTA.. In a specific embodiment of the synthesis of biopolymer by Porphyridium aerugineum, .psi..sub.a is about 0.33 Einstein (0.0165 kw-hr) per liter of culture per day, (E.sub.a).sub.c is between about 1.2 to 2.0 Einsteins (0.06 to 0.10 kw-hr) per liter of culture and the value of .DELTA. is about 0.18 per day. The synthesis of the biopolymer may also be carried out by a two-stage process. In this process, the three aforementioned radiant energy-related parameters are manipulated. In the first stage, the culture is subjected to artificial illumination and is continued for a period of time that growth of the alga and synthesis of the biopolymer begin. In the second stage, the culture is subjected to diurnal natural illumination to continue alga growth and synthesis of the biopolymer. The growth of the alga and synthesis of the biopolymer may also be carried out employing an illumination regime wherein the energy content of the illumination is enriched with respect to particular wavelengths. In the synthesis of biopolymer by Porphyridium aerugineum, the energy content of the illumination is predominantly in the region of 600 to 700 nanometers. The biopolymer may also be upgraded with respect to its thickening characteristics by complexing with a heavy metal or transitional metal ion such as trivalent chromium ion. Biopolymer may also be synthesized by an alga at the site where the aqueous driving fluid containing the biopolymer as thickening agent is injected into the subterranean reservoir."
8924032,Irrigation system with ET based seasonal watering adjustment and soil moisture sensor shutoff,2013-11-27,0,2,"INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE TO ANY PRIORITY APPLICATIONS Any and all applications for which a foreign or domestic priority claim is identified in the Application Data Sheet as filed with the present application are hereby incorporated by reference under 37 CFR 1.57. BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to residential and commercial irrigation systems, and more particularly to irrigation controllers that use evapotranspiration (ET) data in calculating and executing watering schedules. 2. Description of the Related Art Electronic irrigation controllers have long been used on residential and commercial sites to water turf and landscaping. They typically comprise a plastic housing that encloses circuitry including a processor that executes a watering program. Watering schedules are typically manually entered or selected by a user with pushbutton and/or rotary controls while observing an LCD display. The processor turns a plurality of solenoid actuated valves ON and OFF with solid state switches in accordance with the watering schedules that are carried out by the watering program. The valves deliver water to sprinklers connected by subterranean pipes. There is presently a large demand for conventional irrigation controllers that are easy for users to set up in terms of entering and modifying the watering schedules. One example is the Pro C® irrigation controller commercially available from Hunter Industries, Inc., the assignee of the subject application. The user simply enters the start times for a selected watering schedule, assigns a station to one or more schedules, and sets each station to run a predetermined number of minutes to meet the irrigation needs of the site. The problem with conventional irrigation controllers is that they are often set up to provide the maximum amount of irrigation required for the hottest and driest season, and then either left that way for the whole year, or in some cases the watering schedules are modified once or twice per year by the user. The result is that large amounts of water are wasted. Water is a precious natural resource and there is an increasing need to conserve the same. In one type of prior art irrigation controller the run cycles times for individual stations can be increased or decreased by pushing “more” and “less” watering buttons. Another conventional irrigation controller of the type that is used in the commercial market typically includes a seasonal adjustment feature. This feature is typically a simple global adjustment implemented by the user that adjusts the overall watering as a percentage of the originally scheduled cycle times. It is common for the seasonal adjustment to vary between a range of about ten percent to about one hundred and fifty percent of the scheduled watering. This is the simplest and most common overall watering adjustment that users of irrigation controllers can effectuate. Users can move the amount of adjustment down to ten to thirty percent in the winter, depending on their local requirements. They may run the system at fifty percent during the spring or fall seasons, and then at one hundred percent for the summer. The ability to seasonally adjust up to one hundred and fifty percent of the scheduled watering accommodates the occasional heat wave when turf and landscaping require significantly increased watering. The seasonal adjustment feature does not produce the optimum watering schedules because it does not take into consideration all of the ET factors such as soil type, plant type, slope, temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, etc. Instead, the seasonal adjustment feature simply adjusts the watering schedules globally to run a longer or shorter period of time based on the existing watering program. When the seasonal adjustment feature is re-set on a regular basis a substantial amount of water is conserved and while still providing adequate irrigation in a variety of weather conditions. The problem is that most users forget about the seasonal adjustment feature and do not re-set it on a regular basis, so a considerable amount of water is still wasted, or turf and landscaping die. In the past, irrigation controllers used with turf and landscaping have used ET data to calculate watering schedules based on actual weather conditions. Irrigation controllers that utilize ET data are quite cumbersome to set up and use, and require knowledge of horticulture that is lacking with most end users. The typical ET based irrigation controller requires the user to enter the following types of information: soil type, soil infiltration rates, sprinkler precipitation rate, plant type, slope percentage, root zone depth, and plant maturity. The controller then receives information, either directly or indirectly, from a weather station that monitors weather conditions such as: amount of rainfall, humidity, hours of available sunlight, amount of solar radiation, temperature, and wind speed. The typical ET based irrigation controller then automatically calculates an appropriate watering schedule that may change daily based on the weather conditions and individual plant requirements. These changes typically include the number of minutes each irrigation station operates, the number of times it operates per day (cycles), and the number of days between watering. All of these factors are important in achieving the optimum watering schedules for maximum water conservation while maintaining the health of turf and landscaping. Another device that can be occasionally found connected to an irrigation controller is a soil moisture sensor. There are many methods used, but most involve sensors containing spaced apart electrodes placed at root zone depth in the soil to sense the moisture levels in the soil and help control irrigation amounts. There is typically a threshold set manually by the user to determine the “wet” and “dry” levels for the soil and plant conditions. However, systems with a standalone soil moisture sensor typically are used as a shutoff type device, and the sensor does nothing to tell the controller how much or when to irrigate. Typically the homeowner or irrigation professionals must initially set up and then adjust the irrigation periodically during the year to optimize the amount being applied. While conventional ET based irrigation controllers help to conserve water and maintain plant health over a wide range of weather conditions they are complex and their set up is intimidating to many users. They typically require a locally mounted weather station having a complement of environmental sensors. Such locally mounted weather stations are complex, expensive and require frequent maintenance. Instead of receiving data from a locally mounted weather station, home owners and property owners can arrange for their ET based irrigation controllers to receive weather data collected by a private company on a daily basis and transmitted to the end user wirelessly, via phone lines or over an Internet connection. This reduces the user's up-front costs, and maintenance challenges, but requires an ongoing subscription expense for the life of the ET based irrigation controller. In addition, the user must still have a substantial understanding of horticulture to set up the ET based irrigation controller. For these reasons, most ET based irrigation controllers are set up by irrigation professionals for a fee. These same irrigation professionals must be called back to the property when changes need to be made, because the set up procedures are complex and not intuitive to most users. These challenges are limiting the sale and use of ET based irrigation controllers to a very small minority of irrigation sites. This impairs water conservation efforts that would otherwise occur if ET based irrigation controllers were easier to set up and adjust. An irrigation system includes at least one environmental sensor, such as a solar radiation sensor, that is installed on an irrigation site, and a soil moisture sensor that is also installed on the irrigation site. Programming allows an estimated ET value to be calculated based at least in part on the output signal of the environmental sensor. A pre-programmed watering schedule is automatically modified based on the estimated ET value to thereby conserve water while maintaining the health of plants on the irrigation site. The system automatically inhibits irrigation when an output signal of the soil moisture sensor indicates an amount of moisture in the soil is above a predetermined threshold."

6615539,Water-retaining support for plants and plant body-growing water-retaining material,2001-08-13,0,1,"TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a water-retaining support (or carrier) for plants and a plant body-growing water-retaining material which can support or hold a plant at the time of the growth of the plant and can also function as a source for supplying water to the plant. More specifically, the present invention relates to a water-retaining support for plant and plant body-growing water-retaining material which can supply water to a plant without inhibiting the growth of the plant, when the support is used as a water-retaining support for fluid seeding (or seeding using a fluid), farm cultivation, field (or bare ground) cultivation, virescence (or greening) engineering, etc. BACKGROUND ART Polycarboxylic acid-type highly water-absorbing resins, especially polyacrylic acid-type polymers, which have been used in a large quantity for diapers, menstrual goods, etc., are also used in the field of agriculture due to their inexpensiveness and excellent water-retaining ability. For example, hydrogels of the polyacrylic acid-type polymers have been used as a support for fluid seeding; or a water-retaining support for virescence engineering, water-saving cultivation, or cultivation on sandy soil, by utilizing their water-retaining ability. However, it has been recognized that the conventional polyacrylic acid-type hydrogels affect the growth of a plant, and particularly, they cause a marked inhibition of the root origination and root elongation when the hydrogels are used in an amount exceeding their appropriate amount (Kazuo Kawashima, et al., """"Influences on The Early Growth of Vegetables by a Super Absorbent With Cross-linked Forms of Polyacrylate,"""" Sand Dune Research Institute, 31(1), 1-8, 1984). Particularly, when the conventional polyacrylic acid-type hydrogel is used as a support for tissue culture, a support for fluid seeding, and a support for virescence engineering, a plantlet, seed, etc., of a plant is caused to directly contact the high-concentration polyacrylic acid-type hydrogel, and therefore its root origination and root elongation are markedly inhibited, whereby the use of the polyacrylic acid-type hydrogel is severely restricted. It has also been recognized that, in a case where the conventional polyacrylic acid-type hydrogen is used as a water-retaining support for farm or field cultivation, the elongation of the root is inhibited when the concentration of the polymer in the vicinity of the root is increased so as to enhance the effect of the water-retaining support. As an example of the phenomenon such that the above-mentioned hydrogel comprising a polyacrylic acid-type resin markedly inhibits the growth of a plant, there has been reported an experiment wherein distilled water was absorbed into a crosslinked sodium polyacrylate so as to form a hydrogel, and the thus obtained hydrogel was caused to contact seeds of cucumbers and kidney beans for respective periods of time (3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 48 hours), and then the states of the germination and root origination of the seeds were observed (Kazuo Kawashima, et al., """"Influences on The Early Growth of Vegetables by a Super Absorbent With Cross-linked Forms of Polyacrylate,"""" Sand Dune Research Institute, 31(1), 1-8, 1984). As a result of such experiments, it has been reported that the growth of roots was markedly suppressed in the case of cucumber seeds, when they are caused to contact the hydrogel for 36 to 48 hours, and that the inhibition of root growth was also observed in the case of kidney beans. Further, it has been reported that the &agr;-naphthylamine-oxidizing ability of the root was markedly reduced when the root is caused to contact the above-mentioned hydrogel for 5 hours or more. In this report, such growth inhibition and functional hindrance are presumably attributable to a fact that the plant cannot effectively use the water contained in the hydrogel. On the other hand, it has been reported that, when rice seeds were sown on a hydrogel which had been prepared by causing crosslinked sodium polyacrylate to absorb water, and then the process of the root origination was observed, serious hindrance in the root origination was recognized (Yorio Sugimura, et al., """"Utilization of High Water-Absorptive Polymers as Greening Engineering Material,"""" Techniques of Virescence Engineering, 9(2), 11-15, 1983). In this report, however, no hindrance in the root origination was observed when the hydrogel was dialyzed with tap water, but the recovery of the root growth was not observed even when the hydrogel was dialyzed with distilled water. With respect to this phenomenon, in this report, it is presumed that, when the hydrogel is washed or dialyzed with a weak electrolytic solution such as tap water, the water-absorbing force toward the hydrogel was weakened, and the migration of water from the gel to the root hair is facilitated, to thereby solve the hindrance in the root origination. There has also been reported an example wherein the degree of the elongation of soybean root was markedly inhibited in a soil which had been mixed with a crosslinked sodium polyacrylate hydrogel, as compared with that in the case of a polyvinyl alcohol-type hydrogel (Tomoko Nakanishi, Bioscience & Industry, 52(8), 623-624, 1994). In this reference, this phenomenon is presumably attributable to a fact that the water in the sodium polyacrylate hydrogel is less liable to be utilized by a plant. As described above, it has heretofore been considered that the inhibition of the growth of a plant in a hydrogel comprising an alkali metal salt of crosslinked polyacrylic acid is attributable to the fact that the water in the hydrogel is not effectively utilized by the plant. An object of the present invention is to provide a water-retaining support for plants which has solved the above-mentioned problems of the hydrogel water-retaining Another object of the present invention is to provide a water-retaining support for plants which has a water-retaining ability comparable to that of the conventional polyacrylic acid-type hydrogel, and does not substantially cause an inhibition of root origination or of root elongation. A further object of the present invention is to provide a plant body-growing water-retaining material which has a good water-retaining ability and does not substantially cause inhibition of root origination or of germination of a plant. As a result of earnest study, the present inventors have found that the effect of a hydrogel is so strong that the inhibition of the root elongation cannot be simply attributable to the effectiveness in the utilization of water in the hydrogel. As a result of further study based on the above discovery, the present inventors have also found not only that the calcium ion-adsorbing ability in the hydrogel has an important effect on the inhibition of root origination or the inhibition of root elongation of a plant which is in contact with the hydrogel; but also that, in combination with the above-mentioned calcium ion-adsorbing ability, chlorine ions present in the hydrogel also have an important effect on the inhibition of root origination or on the inhibition of root elongation of a plant which is in contact with the hydrogel. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION The present invention relates to a water-retaining support for plants comprising a hydrogel-forming polymer (A) having a calcium ion absorption of 0-100 mg per 1 g of the dry weight thereof, having a chlorine ion content of 0.07-7 mmol per 1 g of the dry weight thereof, and having a water absorption magnification in ion-exchange water at 25deg C. of 1.0x101 to 1.0x103; and to a plant body-growing water-retaining material comprising a mixture of such a hydrogel-forming polymer (A) and a plant body-growing support (B). Herein, the """"water-retaining support"""" refers to one in a """"dry state"""" unless otherwise noted specifically. When such a support is distributed or circulated on the market, etc., the support may also be in a """"hydrogel"""" state wherein a part or the entirety of the support retains water therein. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The reason that the water-retaining carrier for plant according to the present invention has a water-retaining ability comparable to that of the conventional polyacrylic acid-type hydrogel but causes substantially no inhibition of root origination nor inhibition of root elongation of a plant, is not completely clear, but according to the present inventors' knowledge, it is presumed to be as follows. As a result of experiments, described hereinafter, the present inventors have found a fact that the conventional hydrogel comprising an """"alkali metal salt of crosslinked polyacrylic acid"""" selectively adsorbs heavy metal ions, mainly calcium ions. In other words, according to the present inventors' experiments, it was presumed that the conventional crosslinked polyacrylic acid-type hydrogel adsorbs ions (mainly comprising calcium ions) in agricultural water (such as well water, tap water, river water, and lake water) and the plant suffers from deficiency of calcium ions; or the hydrogel directly adsorbs ions (mainly comprising calcium ions) from the plant body through its roots, whereby the plant suffers from a deficiency of calcium ions. As a result of further experiments, the present inventors have also found a fact that when the water-retaining support (or carrier) for plant according to the present invention comprising a hydrogel-forming polymer (A) (having a specific calcium ion absorption amount) is in contact with a plant root, etc., the direct absorption of calcium ions by the water-retaining support from the root based on such contact is effectively suppressed by the chlorine ions present in the water-retaining support. It is presumed that plant water-retaining support according to the present invention which not only has a specific calcium ion absorption amount, but also has a specific chlorine ion content does not substantially cause the inhibition of the root origination nor the inhibition of root elongation on the basis of the combination of the above-mentioned effects. Hereinbelow, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings as desired. In the following description, """"%"""" and """"part(s)"""" representing a quantitative proportion or ratio are those based on weight, unless otherwise noted specifically. (Water-retaining support) The water-retaining support according to the present invention comprises a hydrogel-forming polymer (A) having a calcium ion absorption (amount) of 0-100 mg per 1 g of the dry weights thereof, having a chlorine ion content of 0.07-7 mmol per 1 g of the dry weight thereof, and having a water absorption magnification in ion-exchange water of 1.0x101 to 1.0x103 (times) or more. In the present invention, the above-mentioned """"calcium ion absorption"""", """"chlorine ion content"""" and """"water absorption magnification in ion-exchange water"""" may suitably be measured, e.g., by the following method. (Measurement of Calcium Ion Absorbing Amount) 1 g of a dried water-retaining support is added to 1 L (liter) of aqueous calcium chloride solution having a calcium ion concentration of 200 mg/L. Then, the resultant mixture is left standing for 48 hours in a constant-temperature bath (or thermostatic chamber) at 25deg C., while the mixture is stirred occasionally, to thereby cause the water-retaining support to absorb calcium ion while being swollen. The thus swollen water-retaining support is separated from the supernatant, and the calcium ions concentration in the remaining supernatant (excess amount thereof in the above-mentioned aqueous calcium chloride solution) is quantitatively determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (A mg/L). At this time, in the measurement of the calcium ion analysis by the above atomic absorption spectrometry, the following conditions are preferably usable. Atomic absorption spectrometer: trade name: AA-6500 Auto-System, mfd. by Shimazu Corporation Lighting condition: Ca #8 Electric current: 10 mA/0 mA Wavelength: 422.7 nm Slit width: 0.5 &mgr;m On the basis of the thus determined value (A) of the calcium ion concentration, the calcium ion absorption amount per 1 g of the water-retaining support is obtained by the following formula. At the time of the separation of the supernatant from the water-retaining support, there is a possibility that the non-crosslinked water-soluble polymer is dissolved in the supernatant, and therefore it is preferred to effect separation by ultrafiltration using an ultrafilter membrane having a fractionation molecular weight of about 1,000 to 3,000. Calcium ion absorption amount per 1 g of water-retaining support (mg/g)=200-A When the calcium ion absorption amount measured by the above-mentioned method exceeds 100 mg per 1 g of the dry weight of the water-retaining support, calcium ion deficiency is liable to occur in a plant which is in contact with the water-retaining support, as shown in Examples appearing hereinafter. In the present invention, the calcium ion absorption is 100 mg or less, per 1 g of the dry weight of the water-retaining support. (Action of chlorine ions) In the water-retaining support according to the present invention, the content of chlorine ions in the hydrogel-forming polymer (A) is 0.07-7 mmol per 1 g of the dry weight thereof. According to the present inventors' knowledge, it is presumed that the phenomenon that the chlorine ions present in the hydrogel according to the present invention suppresses the adsorption of calcium ions from the internal plant body due to the hydrogel by the following mechanism, on the basis of the various experimental data obtained by the present inventors. Thus, it is considered that the absorption and desorption process of calcium ions by a plant is mainly effected physico-chemically, and is governed by the concentration gradient of calcium ions between the inside and outside of the plant body (for example, """"An Outline of Plant Dietetics"""" (Shokubutu Eiyogaku Taiyo) edited by Kikuo Kumazawa, p 118, Yokendo Co., Ltd., 1974 may be referred to). The calcium ions in the plant body are present in association with chlorine ions, nitrate ions, phosphate ions, hydroxide ions, etc., as counter ions. It is considered that calcium ions in association with the phosphate and hydroxide ions are hardly water-soluble, and therefore do not participate in the absorption and desorption process by the plant. On the other hand, it is presumed that the calcium ions in association with the nitrate ions are water-soluble, but the nitrate ions which have been absorbed into the plant body are promptly reduced into nitrite ions by nitrate reductase, and are further reduced into ammonium ions by nitrite reductase, and therefore they are not utilized as contour ions for calcium ions (for example, """"Introduction to Life Science of Plants"""" (Shokubutu no Seimei Kagaku Nyuumon) written by Seiichiro Kamisaka, p 138, Baifukan, Co., Ltd., 1991 may be referred to). Accordingly, there can be made a presumption that the ions closely related to the absorption and desorption process of calcium ions are chlorine ions, and under an electrically neutral condition, the entrance and exit of calcium ions are accompanied with the entrance and exit of chlorine ions. Herein, when the chlorine ion concentration in the external liquid is higher than the chlorine ion concentration in the plant body, the transport of calcium ions from the internal plant body to the outside of the plant body must be conducted against the gradient of the chlorine ion concentration, whereby the desorption of the calcium ion from the plant body may be suppressed. On the other hand, when the chlorine ion concentration in the external liquid is lower than the chlorine ion concentration in the plant body, the desorption process of the calcium ions from the plant body may be promoted. Further, the absorption of calcium by the plant body (reversely to the case of the desorption thereof) is promoted when the chlorine concentration of the external liquid is higher than the concentration of the internal body, and such absorption is suppressed when the chlorine concentration of the external liquid is lower than the concentration of the internal body. That is, according to the knowledge of the present inventors, it is presumed that calcium ions are liable to be accumulated in the internal plant body when the chlorine ion concentration in the external liquid is higher than the chlorine ion concentration in the internal body liquid, and reversely, the calcium ions are liable to be desorbed to the outside of the plant body when the chlorine ion concentration in the external liquid is lower than the chlorine ion concentration in the internal body liquid. The above-mentioned """"presumptive mechanism"""" according to the present inventors is supported by a fact that the chlorine ion concentration in the internal plant body is considered to be about 7 mM (for example, Higinbotham, N. B., et al., Plant Physiol. 42, 37,1967 may be referred to). In other words, it is considered that according to the """"presumptive mechanism"""" based on the experimental data obtained by the present inventors, and on the description of the literature that """"the chlorine ion concentration in the internal plant body is about 7 mM"""", the chlorine ion concentration in the exterior liquid body may preferably be at least about 7 mM or more in order to suppress the desorption of calcium from the internal plant body. Usually, the chlorine ion concentration in agricultural water such as well water, tap water, river water, and lake water to be used for the growth of plants is 1 mM is or less, which is much lower than the chlorine ion concentration in the plant body. When such agricultural water is absorbed into the hydrogel according to the present invention to thereby swell the hydrogel with the water, the chlorine ion content per 1 g of the dry weight of the hydrogel (""""a"""", mmol/g) required to cause the value of the chlorine concentration in the hydrogel to be a value which is at least not lower than the chlorine concentration in the plant body (usually, about 7 mM) is expressed by the following formula: a=7xb/1,000 (wherein """"b"""" denotes the water absorption magnification of the hydrogel). Herein, the water absorption magnification (B) of the hydrogel support with agricultural water is a numerical value which is dependent on the chemical composition of the hydrogel and the salt concentration in the agricultural water. When the above value """"a"""" is calculated by using the above formula provided that the above value """"b"""" is about 10 times to about 1,000 times, the value """"a"""" is about 0.07 mM/g to about 7 mmol/g. In other words, the """"preferred chlorine ion content"""" (0.07-7 mmol) based on the experimental data of the present inventors is also supported by such calculated values. As described in Table 1 of [Examples] appearing hereinafter, in the case of a hydrogel having a calcium ion absorption of 100 mg/g or more per 1 g of dry weight thereof and containing no chlorine ion in the hydrogel (commercially available polyacrylic acid salt-type hydrogel described in Comparative Example 6), remarkable growth inhibition in the root and stem were observed. Further, in a case where the chlorine ion content in the polymer (A) is even in the range of 0.07-7 mmol per 1 g of dry weight thereof, when the calcium ion absorption exceeds 100 mg/g (Comparative Example 7), marked growth inhibition in the roots and stems were observed. Further, even in a case where the calcium ion absorption is 100 mg/g or less, when no chlorine ion is contained in the gel (Comparative Examples 1-5), marked growth inhibition in the roots and stems were observed. On the other hand, even in the case of a hydrogel showing a low calcium absorption (63 mg/g), when the chlorine ion concentration in the hydrogel exceeds 7 mmol/g (Comparative Example 8), not only the absorption magnification was markedly lowered and the performance as a water-retaining support is lowered, but also marked growth inhibition in the roots and stems were observed due to salt damage based on a large difference in the chlorine ion concentration between the inside and outside of the plant body. As shown in Table 1 appearing hereinafter, in the case of the water-retaining support for plant according to the present invention comprising a hydrogel-forming polymer which has a calcium absorption of less than 100 mg/g, and has a chlorine ion content of 0.07-7 mmol/g (Examples 1-4), they suitably function as a water-retaining support for plant without inhibiting the growth of the roots and stems at all. As described above, in the case of the calcium ion deficiency caused by hydrogels having a calcium absorption and a chlorine ion content both outside of the range according to the present invention (hydrogels based on commercially available polyacrylic acid sodium salt have a high calcium absorption and contain no chlorine ion, as described in Comparative Example 6), the cell membrane structure is destroyed, and many important functions (such as cell division) depending on the membrane structure are stopped or retarded, whereby the root elongation is markedly inhibited in view of the appearance thereof (with respect to the details of such calcium ion deficiency, """"Outline of Plant Nutrition science"""" edited by Kikuo Kumazawa, p 118, Yokendo Co., Ltd., 1974 may be referred to). (Measurement of chlorine ion content) 0.2 g of a hydrogel-forming polymer in a dry state is immersed in 200 ml of ion exchange water, and left standing for two days. The resultant supernatant is filtrated by a filter, and the chlorine ion concentration in the filtrate is analyzed by an ion analyzer (Ion Analyzer IA-100, mfd. by TOA Electric Wave Industries (TOA Denpa Kogyo)). Based on the thus obtained chlorine ion concentration, the quantity of the chlorine ions contained in 200 ml of the above ion exchange water is determined by calculation, the resultant calculated value is treated as the quantity of chlorine ions in """"0.2 g of dry hydrogel-forming polymer"""". At this time, in the above chlorine ion analysis by an ion analyzer, the following conditions may suitably be used. Column: PCI-201S for anion (mfd. by TOA Electric Wave Industries) and Card Column PCI-201SG (mfd. by TOA Electric Wave Industries) Solvent: Eluent Liquid for anion (mfd. by TOA Electric Wave Industries) Column oven temperature: 40+-4deg C. If the """"chlorine ion content"""" measured by the above method is in the range of 0.07-7 mmol per 1 g of dry weight of water-retaining support, it is possible to suppress the """"calcium ion deficiency"""" as shown in Examples appearing hereinafter. (Measurement of water absorption magnification in ion-exchange water) A predetermined amount (W1 g) of a dried water-retaining support is weighed, then is immersed in an excess amount (e.g., a weight which is at least 1.5 times the expected water-absorption amount of the above-mentioned water-retaining support) of ion-exchange water (having an electric conductivity of 5 &mgr;S/cm or less), and is then left standing in a constant-temperature bath at room temperature (25deg C.) for 2 days (48 hours) whereby the water-retaining support is swollen. An excess amount of water is removed by filtration, and thereafter the weight (W2 g) of the water-retaining support which has absorbed water to be swollen therewith is measured. Then, the water absorption magnification is determined by the following formula: Water absorption magnification=(W2-W1)/W1 At the time of the measurement of this water absorption magnification, it is preferred to measure the weights W1 and W2 by using a precise electronic balance (for example, LIBROR AEG-220, LIBROR EB-3200-D, mfd. by Shimazu Corporation etc.). If the water absorption magnification measured by the above-mentioned method is less than 10 (times), it becomes difficult to sufficiently supply water to a plant when a predetermined amount of the water-retaining support is used. In the present invention, the water absorption magnification is 10-100, but the water absorption magnification may preferably be 30-900, more preferably 50-800. When the water-retaining support according to the present invention is used in combination with water having a relatively low salt concentration such as agricultural water, for example, the water absorption magnification of a hydrogel constituting the support may be improved most effectively by introducing a dissociative ion group into the gel so as to expand the molecular chains in the gel and to simultaneously enhance the internal osmotic pressure in the gel. (Hydrogel-forming polymer (A)) The hydrogel-forming polymer (A) constituting the water-retaining support according to the present invention refers to a polymer which has a crosslinked or network structure, and has a property such that it can form a hydrogel by retaining water (in the inside thereof) on the basis of such a structure. Further, the """"hydrogel"""" refers to a gel which at least comprises a crosslinked or network structure comprising a polymer, and water (as a dispersion liquid) supported or retained by such a structure. The """"dispersion liquid"""" retained in the crosslinked or network structure is not particularly limited, as long as it is a liquid comprising water as a main or major component. More specifically, the dispersion liquid may for example be either of water per se, an aqueous solution and/or water-containing liquid (e.g., a mixture liquid of water and a monohydric or polyhydric alcohol). In the present invention, it is preferred to use a product obtained by crosslinking a water-soluble or hydrophilic polymer compound, as the above-mentioned polymer (A). Such a crosslinked polymer has a property such that it absorbs water in an aqueous solution to be swollen, but is not dissolved therein. The water absorption rate may be changed by changing the kind of the above-mentioned water-soluble or hydrophilic polymer and/or the density (or degree) of crosslinking thereof. (Water-soluble or hydrophilic polymer compound) Specific examples of the water-soluble or hydrophilic polymer for providing a hydrogel constituting the water-retaining support according to the present invention may include: methyl cellulose, dextran, polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide, polyvinyl alcohol, poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(N-vinyl acetamide), polyvinyl pyridine, polyacrylamide, polymethacrylamide, poly(N-methyl acrylamide), polyhydroxymethyl acrylate, polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, polyvinylsulfonic acid, polystyrenesulfonic acid and their salts, poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate), poly(N,N-diethylamnioethyl methacrylate), poly(N,N-dimethylaminopropyl acrylamide), and their salts, etc. (Crosslinking) As the method of imparting or introducing a crosslinked structure to the above-mentioned polymer compound, there are a method wherein a crosslinked structure is introduced into the polymer at the time of the polymerization of the monomer for providing the polymer; and a method wherein a crosslinked structure is introduced to a polymer after the completion of the polymerization of the monomer. Each of these methods may be used in the present invention. The former method (i.e., introduction of crosslinking at the time of monomer polymerization) may generally be conducted by utilizing the copolymerization with a bifunctional monomer (or a monomer having three or more functional groups). For example, such a method may be conducted by using a bifunctional monomer including: bis-(meth)acrylamides such as N,N-methylene bis-(meth)acrylates of polyhydric alcohols such as (poly)alkylene glycol, trimethylol propane, glycerin, pentaerythritol, and sorbitol; divinyl compounds such as divinylbenzene; allyloxyalkanes such as tetraallyloxy ethane, and pentaerythritol triallyl ether; etc., singly or as two or more species thereof. The latter method (i.e., introduction of crosslinking after the monomer polymerization) may generally be conducted by forming a crosslink between molecules by utilizing light, an electron beam, &ggr;-ray irradiation, etc. Further, the latter method may also be conducted by crosslinking a polymer, e.g., by using, as a crosslinking agent, a multi-functional molecule having a plurality of functional groups (such as isocyanate group, and glycidyl group) which are capable of being bonded to a functional group (such as carboxyl group, and amino group) in the polymer. In this case, it is possible to use a crosslinking agent which is similar to those to be used for surface crosslinking of particles as described hereinafter. In the present invention, the above-mentioned water absorption rate of the (A) is dependent on the above-mentioned crosslinked structure, particularly the density of crosslinking of the polymer. In general, as the crosslinking density becomes lower, the water absorption rate tends to increase. In the former method, the crosslinking density may arbitrarily be controlled, e.g., by changing the copolymerization ratio of the bifunctional monomer. In the latter method, the crosslinking density may arbitrarily be controlled, e.g., by changing the quantity of irradiation such as light, an electron beam, and &ggr;-ray irradiation. In the present invention, the crosslinking density may preferably be in the range of about 0.01 mole % to about 10 mol %, more preferably about 0.05 mol % to about 5 mol %, in terms of the ratio of the moles of the branching point to the moles of all the monomer. Alternatively, when the crosslinked structure is introduced by the former method (introduction of crosslinking at the time of polymerization), the crosslinking density may preferably be in the range of about 0.005 wt. % to about 3 wt. %, more preferably about 0.01 wt. % to about 2 wt. %, in terms of the copolymerization weight ratio of the bifunctional monomer to all the monomers (inclusive of the bifunctional monomer per se). When the crosslinking density exceeds about 10 mol %, the water absorption magnification of the polymer (A) according to the present invention is decreased, whereby the effect of the polymer (A) as the water-retaining support is decreased. On the other hand, when the crosslinking density is below about 0.01 mol %, the polymer (A) becomes mechanically weak, and the handling thereof becomes difficult. The crosslinking density (molar ratio of the branching points with respect to all the monomer) may be determined quantitatively, e.g., by 13C-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance absorption) measurement, IR (infrared absorption spectrum) measurement, or elemental analysis. Further, in the polymer (A) constituting the water-retaining support according to the present invention, it is also possible to obtain a better balance between a high water absorption magnification and a high mechanical strength in the polymer (A) by making the crosslinking density higher in the vicinity of the surface than that in the inside thereof (i.e., by introducing so-called """"surface crosslinking""""). In such an embodiment, the portion having a relatively high crosslinking density in the vicinity of the surface may mainly contribute to the high mechanical strength (and to an improvement in the non-stickiness between support particles), while the portion having a relatively low crosslinking density in the inside may mainly contribute to the high water absorption magnification. Thus, it becomes easy to realize a preferred mechanical strength and a preferred non-stickiness between the particles substantially without decreasing the water absorption magnification. In view of the balance between the water absorption magnification and mechanical strength, the ratio (Ds/Di) of the highest crosslinking density Ds in the vicinity of the surface to the lowest crosslinking density Di in the inside of the particle in the above-mentioned embodiment may usually be about 2 to 100, more preferably about 5 to 100 (particularly, about 10 to 100). The crosslinking density in the vicinity of the surface and that in the inside of the particle may be measured by determining the ratio of the presence of the crosslinking agent in the vicinity of the surface and that in the inside of the particle, e.g., according to a local analysis technique such as electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis ESCA (XPS), electron probe microanalysis EPMA, attenuated total reflection (ATR), or secondary ion mass spectrometry SIMS (time-of-flight SIMS (TOF-SIMS), etc.). In the water-retaining support for plants according to the present invention, when the polymer (A) constituting the support has a high mechanical strength, it becomes easy to keep appropriate voids (or cavities) between the individual support particles, and the presence of the voids may further improve the capability of the support to supply oxygen to the root of a plant. In the present invention, the method of introducing the surface crosslinking to the polymer (A) is not particularly restricted, and it is possible to use, e.g., various kinds of known methods (or a combination of two or more of such methods). Particularly, when the polymer (A) in the present invention has a carboxyl group bonded to the polymer chain thereof, it is preferred to use a method wherein a crosslinking agent having at least two functional groups capable of reacting with the carboxyl group is used to crosslink a portion in the vicinity of the surfaces of fine polymer particles. Examples of such a crosslinking agent may include: polyglycidyl compounds having 2-10 epoxy groups per one molecule thereof such as ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, glycerol diglycidyl ether, and polyglycerol polyglycidyl ether; polyhydric alcohols containing 2-10 carbon atoms such as glycerin and ethylene glycol, alkylene carbonates containing 2-10 carbon atoms in the alkylene group thereof, polyamine resins such as polyamide polyamine epichlorohydrin resin, and polyamine epichlorohydrin resin (molecular weight: about 2x102-5x105), polyvalent isocyanate compounds (as described in JP-A Sho. 59-189103), polyvalent azetidinium compounds (as described in JP-A Hei. 6-287220), etc. These crosslinking agents may used singly or in combination of two or more kinds thereof as desired. Among these, in view of the possibility of a crosslinking reaction at a relatively low temperature, polyglycidyl compounds and polyamine resins may preferably be used. In the present invention, the shape, size, etc., of the polymer (A) and aggregates of particles are not particularly limited. For example, it is possible to use those in the form powder, granules, lumps (blocks), etc., and it is possible to use those in the sizes of 1 &mgr;m to several centimeters. Depending on the purpose of using these materials, it is possible to appropriately select the shape, size, etc. For example, when the polymer of polymer (A) is used singly, the particle size thereof may preferably be relative large, and the polymer may preferably be in the form of powder of 300-5,000 &mgr;m. When it is used in combination with another carrier material, the polymer may preferably be those in the form of powder of 5-1,000 &mgr;m. As the technique for crosslinking the surface of a polymer (A) with the above crosslinking agent, it is possible to use a method wherein a polymer (A) to be surface-crosslinked is dispersed in a large amount of a low-boiling point organic solvent such as alcohol, ketone and ether containing water, and then a crosslinking agent is added to the resultant mixture, to thereby effect crosslinking (JP-A Sho. 57-44627); a method wherein a crosslinking agent is added to a polymer (A) containing water wherein the water content is adjusted to 10 to 40 wt. % to thereby effect crosslinking (JP-A Sho. 59-62665); a method wherein a crosslinking agent and water are absorbed into a polymer (A) in the presence of an inorganic powder, and the resultant mixture is heated with stirring, so as to simultaneously effect crosslinking and removal of water (JP-A Sho. 60-163956); a method wherein 1 wt. part of a polymer (A) is dispersed into a large amount of a hydrophilic inactive solvent having a boiling point of 100deg C. or higher, in the presence of inactive inorganic powder and 1.5 to 5.0 wt. parts of water, to thereby effect crosslinking (JP-A Sho. 60-14745); a method wherein a polymer (A) is treated with a crosslinking agent and an aqueous solution containing any of an alkylene oxide adduct of monohydric alcohol, a monovalent salt of organic acid, and a lactam, to thereby effect reaction (JP-A Hei 7-33818); etc. (Polymer having carboxyl group) Examples of an embodiment of the polymer (A) having calcium ion absorption suitable for retaining water for a plant and also having a preferred water absorption magnification in ion-exchange water may include, e.g., a polymer (A) having a carboxyl group bonded to the polymer chain thereof wherein the polymer chain is crosslinked, and the content of an alkali metal salt of ammonium salt of the carboxyl group is 0.3 to 7 mmol per 1 g of the polymer. In the polymer (A), this carboxyl group may be non-neutralized, but may preferably be the former (i.e., one containing alkali metal salt or ammonium salt in an amount of 0.3-7 mmol per 1 g). This """"content of alkali metal salt or ammonium salt of carboxyl group"""" may preferably be 0.5-6.5 mmol (particularly, 1.0-6.0 mmol). The content of the alkali metal salt of the carboxyl group may preferably be measured, e.g., by the following method. (Method of measuring content of carboxyl group salt) A water-retaining support is sufficiently washed with ion exchange water, and then dried. 0.2 g of the dried water-retaining support is weighed in a platinum crucible, is subjected to ashing in an electric furnace, and thereafter the support is dissolved in 5 ml of 1N-hydrochloric acid. Then, distilled water is added to the resultant mixture so as to provide a total volume of 50 ml (constant volume), and the positive ion concentration (D mM) therein is determined according to atomic absorption spectrometry. Since the concentration of the dry water-retaining support in the solution used herein for the atomic absorption analysis is 0.2 g/50 ml=4g/1 L (liter) as described above, the content of carboxyl group salt in 1 g of the dried water-retaining support is calculated as D/4 (mmol). At this time, in the case of the above positive ion measurement by the atomic absorption spectrometry, conditions similar to those in the case of """"calcium ion analysis"""" as described above can suitably be used. The conventional hydrogel comprising a crosslinked product of an alkali metal salt of polyacrylic acid has a water absorption magnification which is markedly higher than that of a hydrogel comprising a crosslinked product of a nonionic hydrophilic polymer, and has been used as a water-retaining support in the agricultural field because of such a high water absorption magnification. However, according to the present inventor's experiments, in the hydrogel comprising the crosslinked product of the alkali metal salt of polyacrylic acid which has conventionally been developed as one to be used for agriculture, the content of the introduced dissociative ion groups is very high (e.g., the amount of the introduced alkali metal salt of acrylic acid is about 8 mmol or more per 1 g of the dry resin), whereby the hydrogel has a tendency to adsorb heavy metal ions such as calcium ions which are essential for the growth of a plant, and it markedly inhibits the growth of the plant, as described hereinabove. In contrast thereto, according to the present inventors' experiments, it has been found that when 0.3 to 7 mmol of a dissociative ion group )e.g., alkali metal salt or ammonium salt of carboxyl group) is introduced into a water-retaining support per 1 g of the dry support, the support shows a water-retaining effect (water absorption magnification in ion-exchange water of 10 to 1,000) which is sufficient for growing a plant without causing deficiency of calcium ions in the plant. Here, as the alkali metal salt, a sodium salt or a potassium salt is preferred. When the content of the alkali metal salt of carboxyl group is less than 0.3 mmol per 1 g of the dry water-retaining support, it is difficult for the water-retaining support to have a water absorption magnification of 10 or more. On the other hand, when the content of alkali metal salt of carboxyl group exceeds 7 mmol, the calcium ion absorption is liable to exceed 100 mg or more per 1 g of the dry water-retaining support. (Monomer) The above polymer (A) may be obtained, e.g., by the ternary polymerization of a monomer (I) having an alkali metal salt or ammonium salt of carboxyl group, a hydrophilic monomer (II), and a crosslinking monomer (III). Herein, specific examples of the monomer (I) may include alkali metal salts or ammonium salts of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, etc. These monomers may be either polymerized as a salt of monomer, or polymerized as a carboxylic acid monomer and then converted into a salt thereof by neutralization after the polymerization. However, the content thereof may preferably be set to 0.3 to 7 mmol per 1 g of the water-retaining support. Specific examples of the hydrophilic monomer (II) may include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-vinylacetamide, etc. When a monomer containing a carboxylic acid is used as the hydrophilic monomer (II), the resultant hydrogel has a tendency to have a low pH value. Accordingly, in this case, the alkali metal salt or ammonium salt content of the carboxyl group may preferably be set to 1.0 to 6.0 mmol per 1 g. In such a case, it is also possible to convert a portion of the monomer containing the carboxylic acid into calcium salt so as to be copolymerized. According to the present inventors' investigation it has been found that such a calcium salt-type monomer shows an effect of decreasing the calcium ion absorption of the water-retaining support, an effect of avoiding a decrease in pH, and further an effect of accelerating the polymerization. Specific examples of the crosslinking monomer (III) may include N,N'-methylene bis(meth)acrylamide, N,N'-ethylene bis(meth)acrylamide, ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, and diethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, etc. The amount of the crosslinking monomer (III) to be used may generally preferably in the range of 0.01 to 5 mol %, more preferably in the range of 0.1 to 1 mol % with respect to all the monomers (while somewhat depending on the concentration for the polymerization). When the amount of the monomer to be used is less than 0.01 mol %, the strength of the water-retaining support tends to become insufficient. On the other hand, when the amount of the monomer to be used exceeds 5 mol %, it becomes difficult for the water-retaining support to have a water absorption magnification of 100 or more. It is also possible to obtain the polymer (A) by the saponification of a copolymer comprising vinyl acetate and maleic anhydride, a copolymer comprising vinyl acetate and acrylic acid (or salt thereof), etc. The thus obtained polymer compound is a polyvinyl alcohol-type polymer. When such a polymer is prepared so as to provide a content of alkali metal salt or ammonium salt of the carboxyl group bonded to the polymer of 0.3 to 7 mmol per 1 g of the dry weight, it is possible to obtain a water-retaining support according to the present invention having a calcium ion absorption of 0-100 mg per 1 g of the water-retaining support and having a water absorption magnification in ion-exchange water of 10 to 1,000. (Treatment with calcium ions) The polymer (A) may also be obtained by treating a commercially available polyacrylate-type highly water-absorbing resin with a strong acid or calcium ions. In general, in the commercially available polyacrylate-type highly water-absorbing resin, at least 70% of the carboxyl groups bonded to the polymer chain are in the state of alkali metal salts, and the content thereof is at least about 8 mmol per 1 g of the resin. Therefore, the calcium ion absorption per 1 g of the resin becomes 120 mg or more, and therefore it is inappropriate as the water-retaining support for a plant. In the present invention, a preferred embodiment is a polymer (A) containing a """"polyvalent metal salt of carboxyl group"""". As the ions of the polyvalent metal salt, there are exemplified, e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Ba2+, Sr2+, B3+, Be2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, etc. Among these, Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Ba2+, Sr2+, B3+, and Be2+ are preferred. The polyvalent metal salt content may be 0.1-7 mmol, preferably 0.5-6.5 mmol, more preferably 1.0-6.0 mmol, per 1 g of the dry weight of the polymer (A). Such a content of the polyvalent metal salt of carboxyl group may preferably be measured, e.g., by the following method. (Method of measuring content of carboxyl group polyvalent metal salt) A water-retaining support is sufficiently washed with ion exchange water, and then dried. 0.2 g of the dried water-retaining support is weighed in a platinum crucible, is subjected to ashing in an electric furnace, and thereafter the support is dissolved in 5 ml of 1 N-hydrochloric acid. Then, distilled water is added to the resultant mixture so as to provide a total volume of 50 ml (constant volume), and the calcium concentration (E mM) there is determined according to atomic absorption spectrometry. The content of carboxyl group polyvalent metal salt in 1 g of the dried water-retaining support is calculated as Ex(valence number)/4 (mmol). When polyvalent metal ions are mixed, the valence number obtained by subjecting the respective valence numbers of the polyvalent metal ions to """"weighed-mean"""" treatment is used as the valence number of the polyvalent metal ions (e.g., valence number=2 in the case of Mg ions). When a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid and sulfuric acid, or an aqueous calcium ion solution such as calcium chloride solution and calcium nitrate solution is added to such a commercially available polyacrylate-type highly water-absorbing resin, the alkali metal salt of carboxyl group in the highly water-absorbing resin is substituted by the carboxylic acid or calcium salt of carboxyl group. Therefore, when the amount of the strong acid or calcium ions to be added is appropriately set, the content of alkali metal salt of the carboxyl group bonded to the polymer may be adjusted to 0.3 to 7 mmol per 1 g of the dry water-retaining support, to thereby provide a water-retaining support for plants, according to the present invention, having a calcium ion absorption of 0-100 mg per 1 g of the dry weight and having a water absorption magnification in ion-exchange water of 10 to 1,000. Here, when the carboxyl group is substituted by the carboxylic acid, the resultant hydrogel has a strong tendency to become acidic. Accordingly, particularly in this case, the content of alkali metal salt of carboxyl group may preferably be adjusted to be 1.0 to 6.0 mmol per 1 g of the dry water-retaining support. (Method of introducing chlorine ions) As a method of causing the water-retaining support for plant according to the present invention to contain chlorine ions, it is possible to effect the introduction by causing a polymer (A) to absorb an aqueous solution containing chlorine ions. Further, in the case of synthesizing the polymer (A) in water, it is more preferred to adopt a method of incorporating chlorine ions in this aqueous solution. At this time, the amount of the addition of the chlorine ions is set to a value so that the amount thereof is 0.07-7 mmol per 1 g of dry weight of the water-retaining support for plants to be provided. The kinds of the counter positive ions with respect to the chlorine ions are not particularly limited, but they may preferably be Na, K, Ca, and NH4 ions. Among these, Na ions may particularly preferably be used. Further, in a case where the polymer (A) already contains chlorine ions in an amount of 7 mmol or more per 1 g of the dry weight thereof, it is also possible to reduce the content of chlorine ions to a desired set value by washing the polymer (A) with water which contains no chlorine ions (or, water having a low chlorine ion concentration). Particularly, when a polyacrylic acid salt-type polymer (A) is used as the water-retaining support for plant according to the present invention, it is preferred to utilize a method of forming a crosslinked polymer comprising acrylic acid and an acrylic acid alkali metal salt, and then adding thereto a polyvalent metal salt. Particularly, when calcium chloride, or magnesium chloride, is used as the polyvalent metal salt, it is possible to suppress the Ca absorption amount of the hydrogel, and to introduce chlorine ions into the hydrogel by substituting the alkali metal salt with Ca or Mg. (Seed germination and germination activity test) In order to evaluate the effect of a water-retaining support upon a plant, it is preferred to conduct a germination activity test for a seed by using, as a culture medium, the water-retaining support (hydrogel) which has absorbed agricultural water therein. For example, seeds of white radish sprouts (e.g., those sold by Takii Shubyo K. K.) which may easily be subjected to a short-term germination activity test may be used as a seed material, and synthetic water having a typical underground water composition (Table 1) may be used as the agricultural water in the above-mentioned test. TABLE 1 Composition Of Synthetic Water Component Concentration (mg/L) Ca(No3)2 * 4H2O 272 MgSO4 * 7H2O 111 KCl 22 NaHCO3 126 (Respective components were dissolved in ion-exchange water at its predetermined concentration, and the pH of the resultant mixture were adjusted to 7 by using hydrochloric acid). For example, the seed germination activity test may be performed in the following manner. 16 ml of the above-mentioned synthetic water and 160 mg (1 wt. %) of each kind of water-retaining support are introduced into a test tube (having a diameter of 2.5 cm and a height of 15 cm), and the resultant mixture is fully stirred, and then the mixture is left standing for 30 minutes at 25deg C., to thereby prepare a gel-like culture medium comprising the water-retaining support which has absorbed the agricultural water therein. 5 grains of the above-mentioned seed of white radish sprouts are uniformly put on the surface of the gel-like culture medium in each of test tubes, and the test tube is capped with a silicone plug having a 6 mm-diameter hole filled with cotton. The thus capped test tube is cultured for 4 days in a culture room (25deg C. illumination intensity of 2000 Lux, 16h-daytime), and the resultant germination activity is investigated. In the above-mentioned germination activity test, for example, the length of the above-ground portion measured as the average stem and leaf length from the base portion (branching point between the roots and stems) of the germinated individual to its leaf tip, while the length of the underground portion may be measured as the average root length from the base portion of the germinated individual to the tip of its main root. In order to compare the respective germination activity test results more precisely, it is preferred to use a standard hydrogel (the amount of calcium absorption thereof is less than 10 mg/g) as a control sample for the respective germination activity tests, and to express the length of the above-ground portion and the length of the underground portion for the respective hydrogels as relative values (%) with respect to those for the standard hydrogel, as shown in Table 1. (Method of using water-retaining support) As the water-retaining support according to the present invention, the polymer (A) may be used either singly or in combination with another plant-growing support (B) as desired. In the present invention, the plant-growing support (B) is not particularly restricted, but it is possible to use substances which have generally been used as those suitable for plant body-growing support.

When a hard resin is used, it is preferred to impart a flexibility to such a resin by using a suitable plasticizer. Examples of the urethane-type resins may include, e.g., those produced by a method wherein a straight chain-type polyurethane obtained by bulk-polymerizing or solution-polymerizing a polyol, a diisocyanate, and a chain extender is formed into pellets, and then is extrusion molded or injection molded; those produced by a method where a polyurethane solution obtained from solution polymerization is shaped and the solution is removed by evaporation; or those produced by a method wherein such a solution is caused to contact a solidifying medium so that it is solidified.

Examples of the urethane resin-type may include those obtained by a method wherein a straight chain-type polyester, polyether or a polyester amide as a base material is reacted with a polyisocyanate so as to form an NCO-terminated prepolymer (NCO percentage: 1-10%), and a chain extender is reacted with the prepolymer so as to form a polymer, and hardening the polymer by using heat or an appropriate crosslinking agent (prepolymer method); and those obtained by a method wherein a polyol, a diisocyanate, a chain extender, and a crosslinking agent are mixed simultaneously, and are reacted so as to form a polyurethane (one-shot process) (isocyanate/(active hydrogen of polyol, etc.)&ap;0.8/1 to 10/1). Such a urethane resin may be molded or shaped by, e.g., a casting method, a kneading method. (Molecular weight) The number-average molecular weight of the above rubber and thermoplastic resin may usually be 1x104 or more, preferably 2x104 to 100x104. In addition, the number-average molecular weight of the thermosetting resin (before hardening) may usually be 10x104 or less, preferably 5x104 or less. The number-average molecular weight may be measured, e.g., by gel permeation chromatography (GPC method). In addition, the size of the form of the support (B) is not particularly limited, but the particle size (major axis) of the powder may usually be 1-800 &mgr;m, preferably 5-200 &mgr;m, and the size of the porous material, fiber and foamed material may usually be 0.001-20 mm, preferably 0.01-10 mm.

(Binder) The plant body-growing water-retaining material according to the present invention comprises at least the above-mentioned polymer (A) and the support (B), but it may also comprises a binder (C) as desired. Examples of the binder (C) may include those which have generally been used, and may be either water-soluble or water-insoluble. When the polymer (A) contains water, it usually has an adhesive property per se. However, it is possible to use the binder (C) as desired, in order to enhance the shaping effect of the polymer (A) and the support (B) depending on the state of water content, shape, specific gravity, etc., of the polymer (A).

7484329,Technology for cultivation of Porphyra and other seaweeds in land-based sea water ponds,2006-07-21,0,1,"This invention provides unique technology, systems and methods of cultivating Porphyra species and other types of seaweeds in land-based seawater ponds having a climatically suitable and nutrient controlled environment. These land-based ponds may be built in any part of the world with structural engineering and architectural modifications. The systems include the design and development of suitable seawater ponds that may be installed in climatically and geographically appropriate locations on land, any where in the world. The invention provides methods of designing different stages of growth, and defining the special conditions to optimize each of the different stages in controlled environments, and enabling the cultivation of seaweeds through the year. The technology includes techniques of enriching the Prophyra and other seaweeds with desired nutrients and ingredients for the production of high quality products that are free of marine pollutants, in addition to generating maximum yields under optimum, clean, temperature controlled and stable environmental conditions. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Currently, the maricultured Porphyra , commonly known as Nori, and other types of seaweeds, are cultivated in the open sea, in a habitat that is suitable to changing climatic conditions in an uncontrolled manner and gathered manually along the coasts of Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China. The algae are grown on nets covering approximately 70,000 hectares of the sea. Approximately 300,000 workers participate in the cultivation and gathering of Porphyra . This labor-intensive traditional cultivation system has several drawbacks and yet it has been the only system available for commercial cultivation of Nori. Moreover, the Nori crop grown by this cultivation system is exposed to seawater pollution, to climatic fluctuations and environmental conditions that control its quality and quantity of yield. Because of its high protein and vitamin content, Nori is considered to be a valuable nutritional product and its consumption has been increasing progressively in recent years. For example, the market for Nori is large with total sales of seaweed products exceeding six billion dollars, and the market for Nori sheets in the US alone is estimated to be worth fifty million dollars annually. Once manually gathered, the Nori is dried into sheets and world-wide production of Porphyra totals about fourteen billion Nori sheets. Yet, currently, large-scale seaweed mariculture is carried out Mainly in Asia because the demand for seaweed products was traditionally high in Asia. Eleven countries produce seaweed products, for example, Japan, Korea, China, Phillipines, Indonesia, Chile, Taiwan, Vietnam, Russia, United States and Italy. Of these countries, only Japan, Korea and China produce Porphyra , and therefore, these countries are the exclusive suppliers for the US and European markets. Other types of seaweeds produced in the ten countries listed above include Laminaria, Undaria, Eucheuma , and Gracilaria . The US and European markets are supplied with unsophisticated Nori products with minimal differentiation, that is, US and Europe receive the low grade and cheap Nori. The high-end, premium Nori products are mainly reserved for the consumption in Japan. In 1997, about 350,000 wet tons of Nori were produced in Japan with a retail value of one billion dollars. There are approximately seventy species of Porphyra and about thirty-three species occur in Japan. Nori cultivation is a well developed industry in Japan, where improvements have been made in techniques for controlled culturing of the conchocelis stage in shells and for artificial seeding of spores produced by the conchocelis onto cultivation nets which can be stored until placed in the open sea environment. Genetic improvement of cultured species to maximize the yield of Nori and to develop cost-effective cultivation programs was restricted to classical breeding methods such as strain selection. Mitsua, O. et al., JP 11113529, Apr. 27, 1999. Prior art describes methods for producing wall-less cells or protoplasts from Nori and protoplast fusion techniques used to produce new hybrid, polyploid and aneuploid genomes possessing combinations of genetic material found in the respective parental species. The new strains produced have altered chromosomal composition and are grown in the open sea. They show modifications in growth, pigment or metabolite composition. Cheney D. et. A., WO/99/29160, published Jun. 17, 1999. The main disadvantage of this approach is that new strains have to be developed, and even then there is a geographical constraint because, an open sea environment is required to cultivate the various seaweeds. The technology of the present invention overcomes the above disadvantages and takes a unique approach to improving the quality and quantity of Nori and other seaweed products by providing specialized technology, systems and methods for cultivation of the various seaweeds, not in the natural ocean habitat, but inside land-based ponds that provide a stable, fully controlled habit having optimal cultivation conditions. These land-based seawater ponds may be installed in any part of the world, and preferably near a coastal region having an abundance of marine algae and suitable climatic and water temperatures, and at a site close to the processing and manufacturing plant location. The economic benefit of this cultivation technology is the reduced cost, as well as controlling the quality and yield of Nori and other seaweed products produced by changing the nutrient supply to the growing algae by altering the ingredient present in the seawater in the ponds rather than altering the genetic traits of the original species, although the technology can be applied to genetically altered or genetically engineered species as well. Prior art describes a variety of pharmaceutical or medicinal compositions that were extracted from or derived by chemical process from marine algae, and showing useful effects. For example, Yvin J. C. et al., describe compositions that have effects in modulating apoptosis dysfunction, WO/99/39718, Aug. 12, 1999. Winget, R. R., describes compositions that have anti-inflammatory actions, WO/94/24984, Nov. 10, 1994. Soma, G. et al., describe compositions that exhibit anti-herpes activity, EP 0462 020 A2, Dec. 18, 1991. Boratyn, D. C., describes sunscreen compositions derived from naturally occurring plants and marine algae, U.S. Pat. No. 6,136,329, Oct. 24, 2000 and Huner N. et al., WO/0024369, May 4, 2000. Kiriyama S described compositions derived from marine algae that are useful for treatment of hyperglyceridemia, U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,481, Feb. 18, 1992. Prior art describes methods for producing wall-less cells or protoplasts from Nori and protoplast fusion techniques used to produce new hybrid, polyploid and aneuploid genomes possessing combinations of genetic material found in the respective parental species. The new strains produced have altered chromosomal composition and are grown in the open sea. They show modifications in growth, pigment or metabolite composition. Cheney D. et. A., WO/99/29160, published Jun. 17, 1999. The main disadvantage of this approach is that new strains have to be developed, and even then there is a geographical constraint because, an open sea environment is required to cultivate the various seaweeds. The present invention overcomes the above disadvantages. It takes a unique approach to improving the quality and quantity of Nori and other seaweed products produced by providing specialized technology comprising of land-based seawater ponds that can be installed in any part of the world. The invention provides systems and methods for cultivation of the various seaweed species, not in the natural ocean habit, but inside land-based ponds that provide a stable, fully controlled habitat having optimal cultivation conditions. These land-based seawater ponds may be installed in any part of the world and preferably a coastal region having an abundance of marine algae species and suitable climatic and water temperatures. The ambient environmental conditions inside the land-based seawater ponds can be controlled so that the cultivation period may be all year round instead of relying on climatic conditions. The nutrient content of the seawater bonds can be formulated to design the composition and nutrient content of the seaweed cultivated in the land-based seawater ponds of the invention. The economic benefit of this cultivation technology is the reduced cost, as well as controlling the quality and yield of Nori and other seaweed products. The invention allows for growing seaweeds all year round by dividing the growth cycle into different stages of growth, by changing the environmental conditions for each stage to achieve maximum growth, and by changing the nutrient supply to the growing algae by altering the seawater in the ponds rather than altering the genetic traits of the original species. The technology is also applicable to genetically altered or genetically engineered species as well. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to novel, unique and useful technology, systems and methods for carrying out large-scale mariculture, suitable for the production of a variety of seaweed genera and species, including, but not limited to, Porphyra (Nori), Laminaria, Undaria, Eucheuma, Gracilaria, Ulva, Sargassum, Codium, Cladophora, Ascophyllum, Palmaria, Furcellaria, Fucus , or Enteromorpha. The technology for the invention features the use of land-based seawater ponds that provide a stable, fully controlled and environmentally safe cultivation system to enable the growth of Porphyra and/or other seaweeds, out of their natural open sea habitat. The systems and methods comprise preplanned and preprogrammed environmental conditions including enriched seawater with essential and desired elements that may be incorporated into the growing seaweeds, to provide consistent quality, quantity and pollution free crop yields. The object of the invention is to provide cost effective technology for the cultivation of edible seaweeds, for example, Porphyra (Nori), in land-based ponds by designing and constructing the ponds that are suitable for aquaculture of seaweeds; establishing cultivation procedures, e.g., seeding, growing and harvesting, and drying and preparing the product for the market. Such technology could not be applied successfully in open sea environments controlled by climactic conditions. Another object of the invention is to develop methods for producing Porphyra and other seaweeds in land-based seawater ponds under controlled conditions to produce products that may be used as food components, neutraceuticals, cosmetics or pharmaceutics. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the technology provides designer or tailor-made seaweeds having compositions that have unique properties, including, but not limited to, antiviral activity, antibacterial activity, antimycobacterial activity, antihelminthic activity, antiulcer properties, endocrine effects, anti-inflammatory effects, metal chelating properties, protection from radiation and as sunscreens, immunomodulatory properties, wound and burn healing properties, ant aging properties, antioxidant properties or anti-atherosclerotic properties."
10292343,Irrigation controller wireless network adapter and networked remote service,2016-09-20,0,1,"BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation, and more specifically to irrigation control. 2. Discussion of the Related Art Generally, irrigation controllers are used to control the delivery of water to irrigation devices connected to switchable irrigation valves. To control the delivery of water to groups of irrigation devices that define irrigation stations or zones, conventional program-based irrigation controllers typically provide programs that can define different watering days and start times. Once a program is created, the irrigation controllers can implement the irrigation schedule for activating irrigation valves. The irrigation programming can become more complex, for example, as the area to be irrigated increases, the variations in types of plant life to be irrigated increases and/or the differences in slope and/or soil type increase. Further, it can be complicated to design and implement irrigation systems for such complex areas. Several embodiments of the invention advantageously address the needs above as well as other needs by providing systems and method of implementing and/or controlling irrigation.

9907236,Method for controlling and directing climate in a space,2010-02-02,0,1,"Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a control system for the control of the climate in spaces for the housing of organisms such as men, animal and plant. Description of the Related Art Control systems for such buildings are generally known, in particular in the form of climate control systems for crop growth in greenhouses. The application of these known control systems in greenhouses has often a focus which can be retraced to knowledge from the dissertation “Greenhouse climate: from physical processes to a dynamic model”, G.P.A. Bot, Wageningen 1983. The control systems known from the glasshouse crop growth are hence focused to the controlling of the climate in a building in which the organism is formed by a plant. At such it is the intention to realize a for the growth and development of the concerned organisms optimally suited inner climate or glasshouse climate. Normally these greenhouse control systems depart from interaction between plant and environment, with in a control loop to control climate factors, mostly temperature, degree of humidity, content, i.e. fraction of carbon dioxide, amount incident light, and air movement in the greenhouse. Often these growth factors are controlled, at least mutually attuned with the aid of a plurality of mutually interconnected balances, which in physical manner describe the in- and outgoing streams for the greenhouse. At this, the to be controlled values are attuned to known requirements of the physiology of the organism, here the plant, whether or not completed with theoretical and/or empirically developed models. The known controls have as a disadvantage that it is departed from an empirically determined relation between organism and environmental factors, in particular in their application for greenhouse buildings, where this kind of controls have realized their development in particular. For the control it is departed from a average value for a climate factor such as temperature. This average value can in practice however, virtually not be maintained, for as far it can be realized at all. This is in the case of a greenhouse not in last instance caused by mutual interaction between climate factors. If for instance the irradiation increases, the plant temperature raises and with that the greenhouse temperature. If at more irradiation evaporation increases, relative humidity of greenhouse air increase; should however the increase of the greenhouse temperature surpass the increase of the air humidity, then rather the relative air humidity decreases. This interaction is once more re-enforced by the change of climate factors, in particular therein the irradiation influx. The latter can, at unfavourable days, change with considerable jumps from 200 to 300 Watt per square meter (W/m2) within a large range of capacities from 100 to 1100 W/m2. Aside from this there are desired and undesired interactions between climate factors at the start-up and controlling of equipment. In this manner for instance, in case of a heat surplus, the greenhouse temperature is often decreased by opening the glasshouse windows. The opening or closing of the aeration, i.e. ventilation windows or the lowering or raising of the tube temperature, that is to say of the heating, at the controlling of the greenhouse temperature however, also renders a disturbance of the relative air humidity. The mutual interactions between climate factors, crop and equipment or apparatuses (aeration, heating, screening, lighting, etc) thus often hinders the known climate controls. These complications apply in conformance with insight underlying the invention analogously in other spaces to be conditioned, in particular for the housing of living organisms. Such spaces can be as well be buildings as transport means, such as domestic houses, offices, barns, land vehicles, ships and air planes, therein included whether or not physically separated parts thereof. Conform further insight underlying the invention such complications also present themselves, and the here to be presented invention can also favourably be applied there, in transport units, such including vehicles for men, such as cars, busses and air planes. Although at least in greenhouse buildings use has been made of climate controls for inner climate already for various decennia, the models in practice mean a highly nervous controlling, at least characterize itself by continuously active directing of climate influencing factors that are part of the equipment of the building. Apart from ventilation windows, these include heating elements, moistening an de-moistening apparatuses, and screening arrangements for the shadowing of the organism in the building, and CO 2 -installatations. Ventilators can furthermore be present for the internal distribution and/or mixing of air. In the glasshouse horticulture, the known control systems nevertheless operate in the before described manner with a view to maintaining the inner climate stable as possible, with a massive plurality of set points for each of the growth factors in a greenhouse. Per sub-section in a greenhouse it is not uncommon that between 250 and 400 so-called set points are present. The known controls is hence not only complex in realization of the controls itself, but also sensitive as to maintenance and relatively expensive in development. An attempt to improve the known climate controls at least for the glasshouse horticulture is known by the international patent publication WO2007053011. This attempt is focused to controlling of crop growth by departing from a so-called microclimate, localized around the organism to which the climate control for the building is normally directed. Herewith is meant a directly around the plant created and to be controlled climate with the support of various support means that are now included in the greenhouse in the immediate vicinity of the plant. These means at least comprise moisturizers and, separate from that, de-moisturizers which can each simultaneously take care for heating or else cooling in the thus to create, so-called micro-climate. This system can be provided with as well in the immediate vicinity of the organism, in casu plants, included hygroscopic valves, intended for the intake and discharge of a surplus of heat and/or moisture, relative to optimal values for an as ideal defined, at least intended local climate for the organism. In fact this publicities herewith defines an in size adapted climate space relative to the greenhouse, which is provided with intervention means adapted thereto. The publication is silent as to any possible controls required for the sketched, so-called microclimate. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention on the contrary has as a goal to arrive at an essential innovation in the model for the controls of a climate created in spaces for the housing of organisms such as plants of horticultural crops, animals and men, as well as to the concipiation of support means adapted thereto. The invention hence relates to a control including, at least thereto facilitating, that a method or else a system for the control of a climate, comprises one or more condition parameters of the organism as part of the so-called control loop, and wherein the supply of unsaturated conditioned air is applied for the realisation of the climate, in a embodiment from a height level under the upper part of the concerned organism. With a such controls primarily a climate is created directly around the organism, that at least apparently is experienced as comfortable, for instance as growth stimulating in case of plants, in dependence of the registered temperature of the organism, and that yet leads to a considerable reduction in use of energy. The present invention is thereby in particular aimed at the well feeling of an in a space included organism by periodical variation in the condition of the air surrounding the organism surrounding air, in particular by directing towards a deceleration or else acceleration of a amongst others with the controls to be induced vertical, further unforced stream of air along the organism, while using known per se, thereto physical principles. At this latter, use is made of a further insight underlying the invention, according to which the air along the organism moves at least quasi unforced, preferably with an at least predominantly unitary acceleration. With a such like controls, in analogy either the comfort for plants, or for animals or men in a space may be directed. To such, unforced administered air other than a required amount of energy for exiting the openings in a supply element, no of hardly any energy is added, such that the air moves only for replacement of at that place elevating air. The temperature and/or humidity of this air, which according to the invention is administered in the immediate vicinity of the organism, at least supplied, is controlled in reaction to a determined value of one or more condition parameters of one or more organism of a population in a building, at least unit or compartment thereof. The invention further makes use of the insight and within physics known per se phenomenon that moist air is lighter then dry air, and hence will raise. Now by supplying unsaturated air in the vicinity, for instance at chest height of sitting or else standing organism, the speed of the air increases with adding of moisture by the organism in the elevating air. If no air raises along the organism, the feeling of discomfort at the organism or the organism increases as a consequence of not or too limited being able to discharge moisture. It is hence better to have a stream of air along the organism to discharge moisture. Such moisture discharge at men largely takes place via mouth, nose and skin of the head, and at the plant at all levels where leaves are present. The raised air is preferably actively discharged via an air discharge, for the invention included at the upper side of the organism, mostly against or else in the upper side of the controlled space. The invention further makes use of the as well known per se given that at least warm blooded organism such as men and animals are not sensible to temperature in absolute sense. This means that with the presently proposed controls with which the useable refreshment for at least largely enclosed spaces is arranged such that the circulation, that is to say upraise thereof is induced by the organism c.q. the organism itself, as a consequence of, or while using natural discharge of moisture by the organism. Prerequisite hereto is that the air brought in is unsaturated and is administered at least under the nominal level of moisture discharge by the organism. In a particular embodiment the controls direct the aimed natural streaming of air by performing a measurement of the temperature and humidity at, at least two height levels of the air at the one hand, and the temperature of the organism at the other hand. With the aid of such measurements a relation is made at a first level between the condition of the organism and its environment and, with the aid of this relation and the actual measurements at the second level, a possible difference is determined between an actual temperature of the organism and a to be expected, c.q. aimed or desired temperature, and the relative air humidity and/or temperature of the administered air is influenced in dependence of this determination or establishment. In the particular case at which the organism is formed by plants, the invention is directed to influencing the boundary layer of humid, saturated air around the leave of the organism, in a manner at which the thickness of this boundary layer is influenced and directed, i.e. controlled. This also includes that this layer is reduced by the creation of a stream of air with unsaturated air, for the promotion of vaporisation. To this end the invention hence comprises that a condition parameter of the organism, in particular the temperature thereof is influenced by the administering of air of a conditioned humidity. At this, the invention makes use of an underlying, in itself known insight that skin pores or else so-called stoma or skin mouths, in more of lesser amount are opened in dependence of circumstances such as a need or else mechanism towards cooling down in the organism by vaporisation of moisture or else, preventing of cooling down by the far as possible closing of stoma. Preferably the conditioned air is administered near the lower part of the organism and in case of a plant under the lower leaves thereof. At such it is in conformance with underlying insight already taken into account that the eventual vaporisation, near the opening of the stoma depends on the thickness of the boundary layer and the internal resistance against release of moisture in the organism. A particular aspect at the present invention is that it departs from the fact that a direct environment of the organism is included in the model for a climate control such as in a building, at least is direct measured and influenced. The model and the controls according to the invention take into account that the climate in the vicinity of the organism in fact so closely connected with the organism itself, at least is so closely situated thereto, that it at least with respect to the condition factor temperature is indicative for a related value in said condition factor of the organism and vice versa. In a follow up step of the idea underlying the present invention it is recognised that influencing of the condition of an organism can hence can take place via the direct environment thereof. According to again further development of the idea of the invention, it is recognised that the direct environment of the organism is to be influenced by exchange processes that are based on principles of physics, preferably while using the influencing of the thickness of the boundary layer of saturated air around the leave of a plant. The steering and influencing of this boundary layer should according to the invention take place via natural, unforced streaming, i.e. movement of air. Also here it counts that the given known in itself, that cooling of the organism can take place via vaporisation, by transport of water vapour in unsaturated air. According to further with the invention applied physical insight, the surrounding air attains a lower specific mass, i.e. density with the humidification thereof, which leads to the raise, i.e. ascending of this surrounding air. The moisturised air is preferably at least largely catched, i.e. intercepted, but can in an alternative embodiment also be discharged via windows opened to a limited extend, for instance greenhouse windows, whether or not in combination with limited circulation of the air. It is a merit of the present invention to depart from the insight that the self cooling capacity of a plant or other kind of organism, of animal or horticultural nature, is to be applied, and at least at plants should even be a point of departure for the control of a climate in a building, for instance greenhouse. Use is herein made of the in itself in physics, but in practice of the climate controls not known, at least not applied insight that moisturised air is lighter and therefore ascends, or forms a thriving force for an otherwise unforced, at least not artificially forced upwards stream of air along the organism. In the supply channels or ducts there is no other pressure then that which required for the overcoming of an exit resistance for the air carried by the channels or ducts. Departing from the insight and fact that relatively moist air is lighter in specific mass, at vaporisation of the organism a natural stream of air elevating along the organism is caused, with the prerequisite that the administered air is unsaturated, that is to say a stream that is based on exchange with the boundary layer of an organism from a population, for instance a plant of a crop. A such naturally ascending stream influences, differently than air administered with force such as in known controls, the thickness of the saturated layer of air directly around the leave. With the maintenance of a such unforced stream, according to underlying hypothesis a optimal exchange of water vapour is realised. The until now commonly used term “climate controls” could on the basis of the present invention, in conformance with an essential and at the invention also underlying insight, hence be denoted as “a to an organism adapting climate controls”. With the present invention and the therewith applied underlying insights the organism is for the first time in history included in the control loop for the control of and directing of a inner climate. In again a further development of the idea according to the invention air ascends as a consequence of either temperature or humidity, with as detail that a higher air humidity goes along with a stream of air increasing in speed. The present invention hence comprises the controlling of as well the temperature as the air humidity in the air administered at the organism, c.q. crop. In this manner exchange with an organism and with that the organism itself is influenced and a relatively quick physiological reaction of the organism can be attained. At such, a for the well being of the organism itself, in case of plants, a for crop growth and development favourable condition can be maintained. This includes, in accordance with further insight underlying the invention, that the environment is subjected to a lightly varying change in moisture content or temperature or both, in a pulsating or periodical manner. According to a hypothesis underlying this insight, such leads to at men virtually unnoticed, however as pleasantly experienced activation of the physiological process in the organism. Hence also a stress reaction of the organism can be generated, which at plants results in for instance flowering or ripening of fruits. In addition to raise of the well being of organism in a space with an according to the present invention controlled climate, and the therewith mostly occurring significant amount in savings in energy, the present invention hence has as a side effect that it can in case of crops be applied for controlled generation of certain physiological reactions such as ripening. This latter has for an advantage that a greenhouse space with controls according to the present invention can be utilised with even improved amount of efficiency. In a practical elaboration of the invention the controls is directed at a conditioned stream of air, utilising a temperature- and/or air humidity gradient between the air supplied and that of the boundary layer of the organism. To this end measuring equipment is placed in the concerned space of the building, directed to detections at the population, with in itself known sensors included at least at two places differing in height level, which with respect to at least the factor temperature determine the condition of the organism. At corresponding levels are included in the stream of air near the organism at least a temperature- and an air humidity sensor. With the aid of these values and the general gas law an unforced ascending stream of air is calculated, and the values for air humidity and/or temperature of the supplied air are adapted by means of the measured temperature of the organism. Such adaptations in practice result very fast, at plants for instance lead to a reaction of the organism within several minutes. With the such measuring of and reacting on the condition of the organism, the latter has become part of the model of a climate controls according to the present invention. It is remarked that the use of an air speed sensor, that is to say a direct detection of the air speed rather than indirect or derived such as presently proposed, using in itself known measuring equipment for temperature and humidity, is also included in the invention. The present invention provides with its new concept and elaboration, at least practical realisation thereof, not only a revolutionary changed model for climate control in buildings, but also a revolutionary change in resulting yield and control of growth of plants, or else considerable energy savings in the heating of spaces, by the realisation of a comfortable heat sensation at lower temperature. From tests with the new model it has proven that application thereof at plants can bring about, increases in yield of 10% in a conventional and up to 30% in a closed greenhouse, relative to the controls known up to now. Moreover, the new model can be employed for causing earlier or else later ripening of flowers and fruits of the crop. With the new controls hence not only an increased yield can be realised, but in fact also a predetermined, i.e. desired instance and/or yield level can be entered. Even more then for increase of yield in itself, the new system is hence of utterly great importance for the improvement of production efficiency and decrease of use energy. A general increase in efficiency is with the present possibilities of control made possible in horticulture."
8770893,"Apparatus, system and method for recovery of artifacts and eradication of invasive species in aquatic environments",2011-03-07,0,1,"The present invention relates generally to preservation of our natural resources, and more particularly, to an apparatus, system and method for recovery of artifacts and eradication of invasive species in aquatic environments. It has been found that some naturally occurring bodies of water such as lakes, reservoirs, rivers and streams have become contaminated with chemicals, such as, for example, with polychlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”) or chlorinated dioxins. These same bodies of water may house buried artifacts having historical value, because of which, recovery of the artifacts is desirable. Alternatively, there have been reports of proliferation of invasive plant species in bodies of water. Zebra mussels, Eurasian watermilfoil, ruffe, and other invasive species pose a severe threat to waters and native aquatic plants and animals. Hydrilla is one example of a very invasive plant found “hitchhiking” on rootstocks of ornamental aquatic plants. There is a need for an apparatus, system and method for recovery of artifacts and eradication of invasive species in aquatic environments. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A first aspect of the present invention provides an apparatus for recovering historical artifacts, eradicating invasive species, or restoring plant life, comprising: an elongate flexible bladder blanket divider having first and second ends, wherein each end rests on at least one apron bladder of an apron bladder bundle, and wherein each apron bladder is between the respective end of the elongate flexible bladder blanket divider and the bottom of a body of water. A second aspect of the present invention provides a method of recovering historical artifacts, eradicating invasive species, or revegetating plant life in contaminated bottoms of a body of water, comprising: providing an apparatus comprising: an elongate flexible bladder blanket divider having first and second ends, wherein each end rests on at least one apron bladder of an apron bladder bundle, and wherein each apron bladder is between the respective end of the elongate flexible bladder blanket divider and the bottom of a body of water; and releasably sealing the at least one apron bladder to the bottom of the body of water. A third aspect of the present invention provides a system for recovering historical artifacts, eradicating invasive species, or restoring plant life in contaminated bottoms of a body of water, comprising: a water craft; an apparatus comprising: an elongate flexible bladder blanket divider having first and second ends, wherein each end rests on at least one apron bladder of an apron bladder bundle, and wherein each apron bladder is between the respective end of the elongate flexible bladder blanket divider and the bottom of a body of water."
4921024,Method and apparatus to fell a tree,1989-10-16,1,0,"This invention relates to a method and apparatus to sever a standing tree from its base, specifically the invention relates to a circular saw and a saw guard mounted on a vehicle to sever a tree by advancing the saw toward the tree. Many devices have been developed for felling trees. Some of these devices have been incorporated into self propelled mechanisms by mounting the felling head on a vehicle. The one thing all of the machines have in common is that a mechanism is provided to sever the tree from its base. Large shears, reciprocating saw blades, various configurations of chain saw blades and circular saws all have been used with some success. Generally the devices which use circular saws have a guard or housing about the circular saw blade to protect the operator and other personnel from the saw blade. An opening is usually provided in the front portion of the guard to expose a portion of the saw blade for cutting the tree. This arrangement, however, limits the diameter of the tree which can be cut. One method to cut oversize trees was to partially cut the front side of a tree, drive the felling apparatus to the back of the tree and complete the severing from the backside of the tree. This method is time consuming and often is not practical because of the density of most woodlots. Kurelek, U.S. Pat. No. 4,446,897, recognized the mobility problem and mounted the circular saw and felling head on a boom which is attached to a vehicle. Kurelek also placed a second opening in the saw guard to allow the saw blade to cut on either side. The Kurelek apparatus was thus able to cut in a straight ahead mode or in a side-swing or scything mode. Although an improvement over the prior art the Kurelek patent has the disadvantage of leaving the second portion of the saw blade exposed and unprotected. Kurelek also does not address the problem of felling an oversize tree. The present invention thus overcomes the limitations and problems in the prior art. The present invention includes a felling head mounted on a vehicle. The felling head includes a frame having an upper portion and a lower portion. A bunching arm is attached to the upper portion of the frame and a circular saw is supported by the lower portion of the frame. A guard overlays the circular saw. The guard has a first or fixed portion attached to the frame and a second or movable portion hinged to the first portion. A means to move the second portion of the guard has its first end attached to the frame and its second end attached to the second portion of the guard. An opening is provided in the fixed portion of the guard to expose a first arcuate portion of the circular saw. The second portion of the guard, when raised, exposes a second arcuate portion of the circular saw. To sever a large tree, the guard is raised and the second arcuate portion of the circular saw is advanced in a first direction to cut a first side of the tree. The vehicle is reversed, bringing the circular saw out of engagement with the tree. The vehicle is then advanced in a second direction which is at an angle to the first direction bringing the first arcuate portion of the saw into cutting engagement with the second side of the tree to completely sever the tree. It is an object of the invention to provide a mobile apparatus to fell a tree, the apparatus having a circular saw mounted thereon which can fell a tree larger in diameter than the radius of the saw. It is a further object of the invention to provide a guard about the circular saw, the guard having a movable portion which can selectively either expose or overlay a portion of the circular saw. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof and from the attached drawings."
7934523,Tree counter for a saw head in a tree feller,2007-10-15,0,1,"The present invention relates to forestry machinery, and, more particularly, to an indicator for indicating a number of trees cut using a felling saw in a tree feller. Forestry machines in the form of disk saw felling heads (DSFH, which includes wheeled feller bunchers and tracked feller bunchers) have a saw head at the front end of the machine with a spinning disk at the bottom of the saw head. A plurality of cutting teeth are mounted to the periphery of the spinning disk at spaced apart intervals. The disk is massive and acts as a flywheel which is spun up to operating speed by a hydraulic pump and motor circuit. The saw cuts trees by kinetic energy, not hydraulic power. Thus, rotational speed of the disk is needed and recovery of rotational speed is important to the ability to cut the next tree. Cutting pulls down the speed of the saw by using energy. Users of DSFH desire a reliable and automatic way to count trees that are cut. Existing methods of counting trees require manual input or are not highly accurate. Typical automatic methods include either monitoring clamp cycles or saw speed pulldown, or a combination of both. The current estimated accuracy of such tree counting systems is approximately 80%. Monitoring clamp cycles produces inaccuracy because operators sometimes cycle the clamps for reasons other than tree harvesting (such as repositioning of trees on the ground, adjusting the grip on existing trees in the head, etc.). Monitoring saw speed pulldown produces inaccuracy because trees below a certain diameter do not decelerate the saw enough for the system to reliably register a cut. What is needed in the art is a feller buncher with an accurate and reliable indicator of how many trees have been cut. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention in one form is directed to a forestry machine including a frame, and a felling saw carried by the frame. The felling saw includes a saw head. A tree counter associated with the saw head includes an audio sensor providing an output signal representing an audio parameter associated with a cutting action of the saw head. An electrical processing circuit is coupled with and receives the output signal from the audio sensor. The electrical processing circuit determines a tree count associated with the saw head, dependent upon the output signal from the audio sensor. The invention in another form is directed to a method of counting trees cut with a felling saw in a forestry machine, including the steps of: sensing an audio parameter associated with a cutting action of a saw head in the felling saw; and determining a tree count associated with the saw head, dependent upon the sensed audio parameter."

The invention has particular utility in the deterrence or prevention of agricultural grade fertilizers and industrial grade ammonium nitrate being used to create weapons of terror. 2. Description of the Prior Art Some common agricultural grade fertilizers generally comprise compounds which serve as excellent oxidizing agents, ammonium nitrate being one such compound. Generally, the fertilizer particles contain pores into which a number of other chemical agents can infiltrate, including hydrocarbon materials. The combined ammonium nitrate/fuel infiltrated particle is commonly referred to as ANFO (ammonium nitrate fuel oil). The article “Blasting Products” of the ANFO Manual distributed by El Dorado Chemical Company (St. Louis, Mo.), a copy of which is submitted herewith, is hereby incorporated by reference. When supplied with an ignition source, the hydrocarbon material acts as a fuel that is oxidized by the fertilizer particles. The resulting chemical reaction can release considerable amounts of energy, especially when the reactants are present in substantial quantities. To be most effective as an explosive, the ANFO will comprise about 5.7% by weight fuel oil. It is understood that when alternative sources of hydrocarbon fuel are used the fuel:ammonium nitrate ratio may need to be altered to achieve a stoichiometrically balanced mixture. Both hydrocarbon fuels and fertilizers are readily available and relatively inexpensive products thereby making them excellent raw materials for producing renegade incendiary devices. The Oklahoma City bombing incident is one tragic example of how such materials may be used to perpetrate large-scale, terrorist atrocities. During the manufacturing process, fertilizer particles are coated with an anti-dusting agent in order to reduce the amount of fertilizer dust produced during handling of the particles. A commonly used anti-dusting agent is Galoryl (Lobeco Products Inc., Lobeco, S.C.) which is hydrocarbon based and is sprayed on during the manufacturing process. Being hydrocarbon based, this coating does not inhibit the infiltration of other hydrocarbon materials that may be used in constructing an incendiary device. Additionally, the anti-dusting agent does not form a protective barrier film encapsulating the entire fertilizer particle thereby leaving numerous pores exposed. In order to prevent the misuse of ammonium nitrate in improvised explosives, it is necessary physically separate the fuel from the ammonium nitrate and also prevent the penetration of the liquid fuel into the fertilizer particles. If the fuel does not enter the interior of a sufficient number of particles in an optimal amount, the utility of ammonium nitrate particles as an oxidizer is substantially reduced or completely eliminated. There is a real need in the art for a fertilizer particle coating which forms a barrier that inhibits hydrocarbon infiltration of the fertilizer pores, and which will not alter the effectiveness of the fertilizer for its intended agricultural applications. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention overcomes the problems outlined above and provides a coating for use with agricultural grade fertilizers and industrial grade ammonium nitrate. The coating should comprise a solution including at least one material which exhibits one or more of the following properties: substantially water soluble, substantially hydrocarbon insoluble, and capable of forming a film. As used herein the term “substantially water soluble” means that the material may be contacted with water or a water-containing solvent mixture for a period of time up to approximately 24 hours and be transformed into a solution that contains at least 1% w/w of the material. The solution should be relatively stable meaning that the solute will not precipitate out of solution for at least about 3-4 hours. Various procedures may need to be employed to achieve this dissolution, such as heating and agitation. As used herein, the term “substantially hydrocarbon insoluble” means that the material will not dissolve in hydrocarbons to an extent greater than about 10% w/w upon exposure for a period of time up to approximately 48 hours at temperature and conditions of use. With respect to simple conventional coating techniques, the pH of the solution may also play a role due to its effect on ammonia volatilization. Other coating techniques may reduce or eliminate the effect that pH has on ammonia volatilization. In preferred embodiments using the coating techniques which would have an effect on ammonia volatilization, the coating should have a pH of about 7.0 or less, preferably about 6.5 or less and more preferably about 5.5 or less. Those of ordinary skill in the art of coating will be able to use and develop coating methods which eliminate or reduce the volatilization of ammonia regardless of the pH of the coating. For example, spray drying or using a fluidized bed allow use of coatings with pH's above 7.0. There is a wide range of materials which may be suitable for use in accordance with the present invention. Such materials include various natural and synthetic gums, starches and starch derivatives, polyethers, polysaccharides, polycarboxylates, poly-sulfonates, a wide range of monomers, polymers and copolymers, and combinations thereof. Among those materials for use with the invention are compositions that contain various mineral salts in addition to or instead of polymeric materials. Useful materials also include those that are known in the art of product formulation as flame and/or fire retardants. These include but are not limited to various boron-containing compositions such as borates, various metal salts including polymeric metal salts, oxides, carbides, nitrides, borides, silicates including polysilicates, silicides, aluminum-containing compositions, sulfates, phosphates, polyphosphates, chlorides, bromides, polymolybdates, molybdate salts, halogenated (particularly brominated) water-dispersible compounds with molecular weights above about 200 AMU. Ammonium phosphates are particularly preferred fire or flame retardant materials. As used herein, ammonium phosphate refers to any ammonium salt of any phosphate, including but not limited to any one chemical or combination of chemicals from the following list: ammonium phosphate, NH 4 H 2 PO 4 ; diammonium phosphate, (NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 ; ammonium polyphosphate, (NH 4 ) salt of  ammonium pyrophosphate, (NH 4 ) 2 H 2 P 2 O 7 ; ammonium metaphosphate, NH 4 PO 3 ; and ammonium orthophosphate. It is understood that such flame and/or fire retardant materials can be used alone in some instances, that is to say as the coating itself, or in combination with other materials suitable for use in the present invention. For example, ammonium phosphate may be used in combination with a polymer, and especially with those polymers disclosed herein. It has even been found that ordinary water when applied to the fertilizer particles reduces the level of fuel oil infiltration by decreasing the total number of pores through dissolving and “re-drying” a portion of the fertilizer particle. In one preferred embodiment, the coating material comprises a polymer, and more preferably a carboxylate polymer, especially one or more of those set forth in U.S. patent applications Ser. Nos. 09/562,579 and 09/799,210 which are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Even more preferably the carboxylate polymer comprises a polymer of acrylic acid or it comprises at least two different moieties individually and respectively taken from the group consisting of A, B, and C moieties, recurring B moieties, and C moieties wherein moiety A is of the general formula  moiety B is of the general formula or  and moiety C is of the general formula  1 , R 2 and R 7 are individually and respectively selected from the group consisting of H, OH, C 1 -C 30 straight, branched chain and cyclic alkyl or aryl groups, C 1 -C 30 straight, branched chain and cyclic alkyl or aryl C 1 -C 30 , based ester groups (formate (C 0 ), acetate (C 1 ), propionate (C 2 ), butyrate (C 3 ), etc. up to C 30 ), R′CO 2 groups, and OR′ groups, wherein R′ is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 30 straight, branched chain and cyclic alkyl or aryl groups; R 3 and R 4 are individually and respectively selected from the group consisting of H, C 1 -C 30 straight, branched chain and cyclic alkyl or aryl groups; R 5 , R 6 , R 10 and R 11 are individually and respectively selected from the group consisting of H, the alkali metals, NH 4 and the C 1 -C 4 alkyl ammonium groups, Y is selected from the group consisting of Fe, Mn, Mg, Zn, Cu, Ni, V, Cr, Si, B, Co, Mo, and Ca; R 8 and R 9 are individually and respectively selected from the group consisting of nothing (i.e., the groups are non-existent), CH 2 , C 2 H 4 , and C 3 H 6 , at least one of said R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 is OH where said polymeric subunits are made up of A and B moieties, at least one of said R 1 , R 2 and R 7 is OH where said polymeric subunits are made up of A and C moieties, and at least one of said R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and R 7 is OH where said polymeric subunits are made up of A, B and C moieties. In the case of the polymer coatings comprising A and B moieties, R 1 -R 4 are respectively and individually selected from the group consisting of H, OH and C 1 -C 4 straight and branched chain alkyl groups, R 5 and R 6 are individually and respectively selected from the group consisting of the alkali metals. One preferred polymer useful with the present invention comprises recurring polymeric subunits formed of A and B moieties, wherein R 5 and R 6 are individually and respectively selected from the group consisting of H, Na. K, and NH 4 and specifically wherein R 1 , R 3 and R 4 are each H, R 2 is OH, and R 5 and R 6 are individually and respectively selected from the group consisting of H, Na, K, and NH 4 depending upon the specific application desired for the polymer. These preferred polymers have the generalized formula  wherein R 5 and R 6 are individually and respectively selected from the group consisting of H, the alkali metals, NH 4 and C 1 -C 4 alkyl ammonium groups (and most preferably, H, Na, K and NH 4 depending upon the application), and n ranges from about 1-10000 and more preferably from about 1-5000. As can be appreciated, polymers useful in accordance with the present invention can have different sequences of recurring polymeric subunits as defined above. For example, a polymer comprising B and C subunits may include all three forms of B subunit and all three forms of C subunit. In the case of the polymer made up of B and C moieties, R 5 , R 6 , R 10 , and R 11 are individually and respectively selected from the group consisting of H, the alkali metals, NH 4 , and the C 1 -C 4 alkyl ammonium groups. This particular polymer is sometimes referred to as a butanedioic methylenesuccinic acid copolymer and can include various salts and derivatives thereof. Another preferred polymer useful with the present invention is composed of recurring polymeric subunits formed of B and C moieties and have the generalized formula  Preferred forms of this polymer have R 5 , R 6 , R 10 , and R 11 individually and respectively selected from the group consisting of H, the alkali metals, NH 4 , and the C 1 -C 4 alkyl ammonium groups. Other preferred forms of this polymer are capable of having a wide range of repeat unit concentrations in the polymer. For example, polymers having varying ratios of B:C (e.g., 10:90, 60:40, 50:50 and even 0:100) are contemplated and embraced by the present invention. Such polymers would be produced by varying monomer amounts in the reaction mixture from which the final product is eventually produced and the B and C type repeating units may be arranged in the polymer backbone in random order or in an alternating pattern. As noted above, it is possible to use polymers of the present invention in combination with other materials, such as fire and/or flame retardant materials. For example, one such combination would comprise a mixture of a polymer comprising B and C type repeating units and ammonium phosphate. When such a polymer comprising B and C type repeating units is used in combination with ammonium phosphate, the ammonium phosphate may comprise a substantial portion of the mixture. However, extremely high levels of ammonium phosphate do not impart appreciably better flame retardant properties in comparison to lower levels. Therefore, for purposes of the present invention, it is preferable that the mixture comprise between about 90-99% by weight polymer and 1-10% by weight ammonium phosphate, more preferably between about 93-97% by weight polymer and 3-7% by weight ammonium phosphate, and most preferably between about 94-96% by weight polymer and 4-6% by weight ammonium phosphate. Most preferably, ammonium phosphate comprises approximately 5% of the total weight of the polymer/ammonium phosphate mixture. The polymers useful in accordance with the present invention may have a wide variety of molecular weights, ranging for example from 500-5,000,000, more preferably from about 1,500-20,000, depending chiefly upon the desired end use. In many applications, and especially for agricultural uses, polymers used with the invention may be mixed with or complexed with a metal or non-metal ion, and especially ions selected from the group consisting of Fe, Mn, Mg, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Mo, V, Cr, Si, B, and Ca. Boron is especially preferred because it may reduce the explosivity or energy released during combustion of ANFO as demonstrated by its use in various fire retardant materials. The coating may comprise an additional material dissolved or dispersed in the same solution as the first polymer described above. Such additional materials should be selected based on their ability to increase the hydrocarbon resistance of the coating. Examples of suitable materials include natural and synthetic gums, starches and starch derivatives, polyethers, polysaccharides, polycarboxylates, poly-sulfonates, and a wide range of polymers and copolymers. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is one of the preferred materials in this respect. PVA is a material highly resistant to hydrocarbon diffusion to the point where protective gloves and fuel hoses are products made from PVA. PVA is available in a variety of grades with different hydrolysis levels and molecular weights. Higher molecular weights generally give rise to higher viscosity polymer solutions. Therefore lower molecular weights in the range of about 10,000 to 30,000 are preferred due to their ability to form thin films which coat the particle surface easily. High hydrolysis level PVA is also preferred because of its increased resistance to hydrocarbon diffusion compared to that of PVA with a lower degree of hydrolysis. Solid PVA is not rapidly water soluble at room temperature and below, therefore it is preferable that PVA be used in companion with another material of the type previously described. The weight ratio of PVA to the other polymer should be between about 1:100 to 100:1, and more preferably between about 1:10 to 10:1 and most preferably about 1:3. It is also within the scope of the present invention to provide a fertilizer coating comprising only PVA. As previously discussed, some agricultural applications will require fertilizer coatings which are more water soluble, in addition PVA is expected to be more expensive than other materials described above, therefore preferred embodiments of the invention contain PVA used in combination with other materials. Coatings according to the invention should have a solids content of between about 5-70% by weight and more preferably between about 20-60% with the balance comprising water. The solids content largely depends upon the compatibility of the coating viscosity with the method of application to the fertilizer particles. It is most preferable that the fertilizer coating have a solids content of between about 10-30% by weight. The coating is applied as a film to a fertilizer particle to form a coated fertilizer particle. Preferably the fertilizer particle used will be porous and will have a bulk density of about 40 to 60, more preferably about 40 to 50 and most preferably about 44 lbs/ft 3 . However, less porous fertilizer particles with higher bulk densities are also suitable for use in accordance with this invention. Preferred fertilizer particles for use with the current invention are monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate (DAP), any one of a number of well known N—P—K fertilizer products, and/or fertilizers containing nitrogen materials such as ammonia (anhydrous or aqueous), ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, urea, ammonium phosphates, sodium nitrate, calcium nitrate, potassium nitrate, nitrate of soda, urea formaldehyde, metal (e.g. zinc, iron) ammonium phosphates; phosphorous materials such as calcium phosphates (normal phosphate and super phosphate), ammonium phosphate, ammoniated super phosphate, phosphoric acid, superphosphoric acid, basic slag, rock phosphate, colloidal phosphate, bone phosphate; potassium materials such as potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium nitrate, potassium phosphate, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate; calcium materials, Such as calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, calcium nitrate; magnesium materials, such as magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide, magnesium sulfate, magnesium hydroxide; sulfur materials such as ammonium sulfate, sulfates of other fertilizers discussed herein, ammonium thiosulfate, elemental sulfur (either alone or included with or coated on other fertilizers); micronutrients such as Zn, Mn, Cu, Fe, and other micronutrients discussed herein; oxides, sulfates, chlorides, and chelates of such micronutrients (e.g., zinc oxide, zinc sulfate and zinc chloride); such chelates sequestered onto other carriers such as EDTA; boron materials such as boric acid, sodium borate or calcium borate; and molybdenum materials such as sodium molybdate. Of course, due to its explosive tendencies, ammonium nitrate is the most preferred fertilizer for purposes of the invention. The coating is typically applied to the fertilizer particles at a level of from about 0.0001-4% by weight, and more preferably from about 0.01-1.0% by weight, and most preferably 0.25-0.5% by weight based upon the weight of the fertilizer taken as 100%. Additionally, when a coating material comprising carbon is employed, the quantity of carbon comprises about 0.2% by weight or less of the total weight of the coated particle. The film or coating should limit hydrocarbon infiltration of the fertilizer particle pores in comparison to an uncoated fertilizer particle, and preferably should reduce hydrocarbon infiltration by at least 10% in comparison to an uncoated fertilizer particle. Even more preferably, the film should reduce hydrocarbon infiltration by at least 50% and most preferably by at least 80%. Such hydrocarbon materials include fuel oil, diesel fuel, grease, wax, and other materials containing a preponderance of hydrocarbons. By preventing or inhibiting the infiltration of hydrocarbon materials into the fertilizer particle, the fertilizer particles have reduced explosivity tendencies, thereby reducing their usefulness as incendiary devices. Another method of reducing the explosivity of agricultural grade fertilizer particles and industrial grade ammonium nitrate embraced by this invention is to selectively supply a quantity of water to the fertilizer particles. In so doing, a portion of the fertilizer particles dissolves thereby reducing the number of pores available for hydrocarbon infiltration. Finally, it is necessary to dry the fertilizer particles in order to avoid imparting to the quantity of particles undesirable characteristics such as clumping and caking. Thus far, the description above has focused on the coatings and coated fertilizer particles on an individual particle level. When dealing with large quantities of coated fertilizer particles, especially coated ammonium nitrate particles, it is important to note that complete coating coverage of each individual particle is not always essential. It is possible for the coatings of the invention to reduce or completely eliminate the explosivity of the quantity of particles as a whole so long as a plurality of the particles are at least partially coated. It is even possible to mix quantities of coated and uncoated particles together and still produce a fertilizer mixture that has reduced explosivity characteristics. For even when fuel oil is added to this mixture of particles, the coated particles will absorb little or no fuel and some of the uncoated particles will become super-saturated with fuel oil. Both types of particles reduce the explosivity of the entire quantity of fertilizer particles. It may seem surprising that a super-saturated particle will reduce explosivity of the entire batch, however, if too much oil is added, the ability of the ammonium nitrate to oxidize the fuel oil is reduced. As noted in the El Dorado Chemical article referenced and incorporated above, there is an optimal percentage of fuel oil (about 5.7%) which maximizes the theoretical energy released in the detonation of ANFO. Adding more or less fuel oil tends to decrease the amount of energy released upon detonation. Therefore, such super-saturated fertilizer particles act to reduce the explosivity of the entire quantity of fertilizer particles. Advantageously, coatings of the current invention also inhibit the formation of fertilizer dust normally associated with fertilizer handling. Therefore, coatings according to the invention are suitable for use as anti-dusting agents, and may be employed in place of current hydrocarbon based anti-dusting agents. Generally, methods of forming coated fertilizer particles in accordance with the invention comprise the steps of providing a fertilizer particle and coating the particle with a film comprising at least one material selected from the group consisting of natural and synthetic gums, starches and starch derivatives, monomers and polymers and copolymers selected from the group consisting of polyethers, polysaccharides, polycarboxylates, polysulfonates, and mixtures thereof. Polymer and copolymer coatings are preferred. The coating may be applied to the fertilizer particle in any manner commonly known or used in the art, such as spraying. The precise coating procedure employed will be based an a number of factors including but not limited to the viscosity of the coating, particle surface morphology, particle size, density, and application equipment available. Regardless of the coating method used, it is preferred that the coating be applied in such a manner as to form an evenly distributed film which will provide an effective barrier against hydrocarbon infiltration of the fertilizer particle. Generally preferred embodiments of the fertilizer coating comprise a solution including at least one of a substantially water soluble material, a material substantially insoluble in hydrocarbon materials, a material capable of forming a film including a quantity of polyvinyl alcohol dissolved or dispersed therein, and combinations thereof. Preferred embodiments of the coated fertilizer particle of the invention comprise a fertilizer particle coated with a film comprising at least one material. It is more preferable for the material to be substantially water soluble, or substantially insoluble in hydrocarbon materials or still more preferably substantially water soluble and substantially insoluble in hydrocarbon materials. Preferred methods of forming the coated fertilizer particle of the invention comprise the steps of providing a fertilizer particle and coating the particle with a film comprising at least one material. Again, it is preferable for the material to be substantially water soluble, or substantially insoluble in hydrocarbon materials or still more preferably substantially water soluble and substantially insoluble in hydrocarbon materials. The coating of the invention may also be used in combination with a fertilizer particle. It is generally preferable for the coating to comprise at least one material. It is preferable that the material be substantially water soluble, substantially insoluble in hydrocarbon materials, or capable of forming a film, or a combination thereof. Ammonium nitrate is the most preferred fertilizer particle for use with the invention because, when combined with a fuel source such as hydrocarbon materials, it acts as a powerful oxidizer. When brought into contact with an ignition source, the ammonium nitrate has the potential to violently react with the fuel source releasing considerable amounts of energy. The most preferred polymer coating of the invention comprises a quantity of PVA dissolved or dispersed in a solution comprising a BC type polymer as described above in a weight ratio of about 1:3 (PVA:BC). The most preferred coating will comprise about 10-30% polymer solids and will be water soluble, insoluble in hydrocarbon materials, capable of forming a film and will have a pH of about 7.0 or less. Most preferably the polymer coating will be applied to an ammonium nitrate fertilizer particle in Such as manner so as to form an evenly distributed film providing an effective barrier to hydrocarbon infiltration of the fertilizer particle pores."

8349204,Hydroseed substrate and method of making such,2012-03-16,0,2,"This invention relates to the field of agriculture and more particularly to a hydroseed substrate and a method of making such. BACKGROUND Hydroseeding is well known and consists of mixing seeds, water, and a substrate into a slurry and spreading the slurry over an exposed area of soil. The substrate provides a cover mat to the soil, holding moisture in while reducing sunlight on the soil, thereby preventing weed seeds in the soil from sprouting. Often, fertilizer, minerals, dyes and/or tacking agents, etc., are added to the slurry to improve germination, moisture retention and growth. Hydroseeding is an improvement over traditional soil preparation and broadcast seeding since it promotes quick germination and provides mulch to reduce soil erosion. Hydroseeding is a lower cost alternative to sod, requiring less preparation, less transportation costs, lower material costs, less labor and faster deployment. Hydroseeding is also referred to as hydraulic mulch seeding, hydro-mulching or hydra-seeding, and includes a tank of slurry. The slurry is sprayed evenly over exposed soil. Hydroseeding is usually performed using a truck specifically designed for Hydroseeding and the truck usually has a tank, air compressor for pressurizing the tank or other means for distributing the slurry, a hose to transport the slurry from the truck and a nozzle that forms a spray of slurry under an operator control. Given such a device, a single operator is capable of seeding a very large area in a matter of minutes. Hydroseeding has also been performed from low-flying aircraft in areas that are without any road infrastructure such as forests, in particular, after a forest fire. In such, it is anticipated that Hydroseeding is performed without seed (e.g., a slurry of a substrate, minerals, fertilizer and water) to re-grow an area of the forest without introducing non-native plant species. Hydroseeding is also used to seed areas with other plant seeds such as wildflower seeds or combinations of grass seed and other plant seeds. When introduced in the early 1950s, shredded and ground newspaper was often used as the substrate. Later, more advanced substrate formulas were deployed including components such as paper, wood fibers and polymers. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,158,167 to Spittle describes mulch flakes made from finely divided paper and/or wood with added surfactants. This patent claims that, once sprayed on the ground, these flakes reduce water run-off and soil erosion. Current substrates typically are made from grinding wood fiber (100%) or a mixture of wood fiber and newspaper (e.g., 70% wood fiber and 30% newspaper) and adding dye and surfactants. What is needed is a substrate that will improve water absorbency while maintaining a homogenous viscosity of the slurry. The present invention includes a substrate for mixing with other ingredients such as water, seeds, fertilizer, wetting agents, dye, to produce Hydroseeding slurry. The substrate includes any cellulose material such as paper, cardboard and wood along with a material known as diaper fluff (tampon fluff, adult diaper fluff) and/or linear polyacrylamide. The diaper fluff improves moisture retention, improves viscosity, reduces friction and improves coverage. In one embodiment, the cellulose material is cardboard (e.g. double-line, Kraft fibers) and/or paper (e.g. recycled newspaper). In other embodiments, the cellulose material is wood (e.g. wood shavings, mulch, wood fibers). In other embodiments, the cellulose material is any combination of cardboard, paper and wood. In another embodiment, a Hydroseeding substrate is disclosed including up to 99 percent by weight ground cardboard, up to 99 percent by weight ground paper, up to 99 percent by weight ground wood fiber, and at least 1 percent and less than 10 percent of ground diaper fluff or linear polyacrylamide. In another embodiment, a method of making a Hydroseed slurry is disclosed including providing diaper fluff and cellulose and then grinding the cellulose into a substrate then adding the diaper fluff or linear polyacrylamide to the substrate. The substrate is then mixed with water and seed to form a slurry. In another embodiment, method of Hydroseeding is disclosed including providing diaper fluff and cellulose then grinding the cellulose into a substrate. Next, the diaper fluff or linear polyacrylamide is added to the substrate. Next, the substrate is mixed in a Hydroseed mixer with, water and seed into a slurry. The slurry is pumped through a nozzle and sprayed on soil where the seed is to grow."
4505040,Coupling for interconnecting two handle portions of a power driven implement,1983-11-09,0,1,"This invention relates to power driven implements such as, for example, trimmers of the flailing line type, air blowers, cultivators, snow blowers, mowers and the like, and more particularly, to a coupling means for easily and quickly joining and separating two separable parts of a handle shaft of an implement at a point which may be substantially midway of its length. One conventional implement of this type has an engine or motor mounted on the outboard end of a handle shaft and a drive head, implement or tool at the other end of the shaft. A number of reasons exist for manufacturing the handle shaft of the implement in two separable parts, one of which is to reduce the overall length of the implement for shipping purposes. Another reason is to conveniently adjust the position of the actuated tool head of the implement relative to its power driving engine or motor source. A further reason for providing a power driven implement with a handle shaft separable someplace along its length is to be able to use a given engine or motor of one implement with a number of different implement heads or tools such as, for example, with a flailing line trimmer, air blower, snow blower, cultivator, mower and the like. Accordingly, this invention is directed to a handle shaft joint which enables the power driven tool of an implement to be conveniently separate from its power driving end, to be angularly positioned relative thereto in some instances and/or to be replaced by a like or different implement or tool head. Shipping elongated implements are not only inconvenient to handle, but are more costly to package than smaller structures. Further, a common power driving end of an implement that can be used with a number of implement heads or tools makes the device saleable to a larger number of prospective buyers and for a larger variety of uses without substantially increasing the costs involved. With regard to weed and grass trimmers using a flailing line for cutting purposes now widely used for many different kinds of trimming purposes, such as around obstacles and edging, the plane occupied by the rotating flail is differently oriented. Sometimes it is adjusted for horizontal trimming and at other times for vertical trimming or at an angle in between these two positions. One conventional flailing line trimmer comprising an engine or motor mounted on the outboard end of a handle shaft employs a flexible cable that passes through the handle shaft from the motor to the drive head of the flailing line. A grip on the handle shaft permits the operator to maneuver the plane of the rotating cutting line by tilting the drive head at whatever angle is necessary. In other conventional devices, both the motor and the drive head are located at the distal end of the handle shaft. A difficulty in the use of such trimmers is that the weight of the engine makes maneuvering and tilting at various angles tiring, particularly when the engine and the drive head are at opposite ends of the device. The engine is usually mounted and balanced for use in one position relative to the handle, and a positive torque must be applied to tilt the assembly. Also, when an internal combustion engine is used, it may not operate properly if tilted at excessively steep angles. The tilting can affect the flow of fuel which will disturb engine operation or even cause it to stop. It is advantageous for the internal combustion engine to remain in one suitable orientation when the drive head is tilted at various angles relative to the engine to tilt the cutting line. This also reduces operator fatigue. When the motor is carried on the head (then it is usually an electric motor), it is still useful to be able to change the head orientation relative to the handle so the user can have the most effort-free grip on the assembly. British Pat. No. 1,578,906 discloses an apparatus for cutting vegetation which employs a coupling means comprising a first tubular member telescopically inserted in a second tubular member whereby rotational alignment of the first member may be fixed in relation to the second member in any of a plurality of alignments. This coupling means may be disengageable upon telescopic movement of the first member with respect to the second member. Resilient means biased against the telescopic movement are used for maintaining interengagement of the members in any one of a plurality of alignments. In accordance with the invention claimed, an implement head or tool is mountable on a hollow shaft by means of a new and improved coupling which detachably joins two parts of the shaft together. One of the parts comprises a handle having a grip and might also carry an engine thereon while the other part supports a drive head for accomplishing many different functions such as, for example, spinning a cutting line on a flailing line trimmer and, in some devices, also supporting a motor to turn the drive head. A coupling joins and secures the two parts of the device together and allows in some instances one part to be rotatably adjusted relative to the other part. The coupling comprises a split clamp fitting around and securely clamping the abutting ends of the two parts of the handle shaft of the implement. In one embodiment, one part of the handle shaft has a circumferential groove which is engaged by a lip on the inside surface of one of the clamp halves. The clamp can be loosened to allow for rotation without axial removal. The other part of the handle shaft has a recess or a hole engaged by a pin on one of the clamp halves that prevents any rotation. The lip and the pin prevent separation of their respective part. In another embodiment, the end of the other part of the handle shaft has a slotted configuration for telescopically engaging with one end of the clamp. In a further embodiment, the clamp or coupling connects two parts of the handle shaft including an inner drive system for the drive head. A sight port optionally can be provided in the coupling so that the user can be certain that the clamp is properly located. Therefore, it is one object of this invention to provide a new and improved coupling for an implement employing a handle shaft which can be readily separated into two parts so that different power driven tools may be interchangably added for actuation by a common power driving source. Another object of this invention is to provide a new and improved coupling for an elongated implement the handle shaft of which may be separated and readily reassembled so that the overall length of the device may be reduced for packaging and shipping purposes. A further object of this invention is to provide a new and improved implement employing a coupling which permits a drive head to be tiltably adjustable relative to an engine or motor on the handle end thereof. A still further object of this invention is to provide an implement having a two-part handle shaft, with one part being rotatable relative to the other, and the other part fixed relative to a handle of the implement. A still further object of this invention is to provide a handle joint or coupling that enables the cutting angle of a flailing line trimmer to be conveniently adjusted by telescopically interconnecting with the implement and rotatably interconnecting with the handle of the implement in any one of a plurality of alignments. A still further object of this invention is to interconnect two parts of a handle shaft of an implement employing a split flexible drive cable extending therethrough interchangably to different power heads such as a trimmer, air blower, cultivator, snow blower, mower and the like.

8851447,Integrated control circuitry and coil assembly for irrigation control,2009-07-27,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation control devices and more specifically to multi-wire irrigation control systems including remote devices coupled to a multi-wire path and for coupling to actuator coil-controlled irrigation equipment. 2. Discussion of the Related Art In decoder-based irrigation control systems, an irrigation controller sends signaling along a wire path to which one or more decoder devices are attached. Each decoder device monitors transmissions on the wire path and decodes this signaling to determine when to cause irrigation devices coupled thereto to be activated and deactivated. The decoder module typically includes circuitry formed on a printed circuit board located within a housing. Wiring from the decoder module housing must be coupled to the wiring of the wire path as well as coupled to one or more actuator devices each controlling the opening and closing of an irrigation rotor or valve. In one form, the rotor or valve is operated by a solenoid coil as is well known in the art. Likewise, during installation, the operator must provide and electrically connect two separate devices, a decoder module and an actuator coil module, to each other and to the control wire path. FIG. 1 illustrates a separate decoder module 102 and a coil unit 104 that are conventionally coupled together. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 2 , for a solenoid activated rotor assembly 200 , the coil module 104 is coupled (in part by a bracket 212 and retainer 214 ) to the parts of a selector valve assembly 202 (including a pressure regulator) attached to a casing assembly 204 . The electrical wire inputs to the coil module 104 are then connected to the electrical wire outputs from the decoder module 102 , while the electrical wire inputs to the decoder module 102 are coupled to the control wire path from the irrigation controller. Thus, a typical installation requires the connection of six wires to install the decoder module 102 and a coil module 104 . As is well known, in operation, a portion of a plunger (not shown) of the selector valve assembly 202 is disposed within the coil unit 104 while another portion is seated against a solenoid plunge port (not shown) within the selector valve assembly 202 in a normally closed position. In this position, high pressure water flow from a main water control valve (not shown) located within a main control valve portion 206 of the device is flowed up high pressure water line 208 into the selector valve assembly 202 and its regulator and is prevented from further movement by the normally closed position of the plunger against the solenoid port in the selector valve assembly 202 . This results in a back pressure that causes the main water control valve to close. In response to signals from the decoder module 102 , the coil module 104 causes the actuation of the plunger to move it off of (or unseat from) the solenoid plunge port allowing the high pressure flow in the high pressure line 208 to flow through the selector valve assembly 202 (and its pressure regulator), which relieves the back pressure and allows water to flow through the main control valve and to a pop-up sprinkler device, i.e., the main water control valve is opened. The pop-up sprinkler device is located within the casing assembly 204 and extends upwardly due to the water pressure through a top portion of the casing assembly 204 . The high pressure flow exits the selector valve assembly 202 down through a discharge flow line 210 which terminates within the casing assembly 204 at a location downstream of the main water control valve. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Several embodiments of the invention provide an integrated valve actuator coil and control module for use in irrigation control systems. In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device comprising: a coil adapted to develop an electromagnetic flux sufficient to cause actuation of irrigation equipment; control circuitry to receive a control signals from an irrigation control unit and electrically coupled to the coil to control the flux at the coil; and a housing covering at least a portion of the coil and at least a portion of the control circuitry. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method of making an irrigation control device comprising: holding a solenoid assembly with a coil near to control circuitry having circuitry for controlling an electromagnetic flux at the coil; electrically connecting the coil to the control circuitry; placing the solenoid assembly and control circuitry into a housing; securing the solenoid assembly to the housing so that the solenoid assembly is actuated to reciprocate a valve member through an aperture in the housing to selectively engage a valve seat external to the housing; and fixing the control circuitry and coil within the housing."
5433766,Slow-release fertilizer,1994-05-02,0,1,"The present invention relates to a slow-release fertilizer composition having agronomic nutrient elements dispersed in a synthetic apatite. Agronomists and botanists have recognized the vital function of sixteen nutrients needed by growing plants including the trace elements or micronutrients--zinc, chlorine, iron, manganese, copper, molybdynum and boron. It is also known that the optimal spectrum and concentration of micronutrients in a particular soil can vary depending on the plants being grown, soil properties, climate, and the stage of the plant growth cycle. While most soils contain micronutrients at least to some extent and the overall need is small, depletion can occur with intensive agricultural activity. Even when the soil concentration is putatively adequate, other factors can prevent micronutrient uptake by the plant. Since micronutrients must be available as soluble ions, such ions can be immobilized in low solubility alkaline soils and/or can be tapped in clays or other organic materials as insoluble complexes. It has been common practice to supplement phosphorus-impoverished soil by using a mineral fertilizer such as rock phosphate or apatite. Such minerals, however, do not supply the required micronutrients and can contain toxic elements such as fluorine and cadmium. Other minerals can be used to supply micronutrients, however, micronutrient content can not usually be adjusted. Required micronutrients can also be supplied directly in bulk. One disadvantage of multiple mineral and/or inorganic phases is the varying rates at which the materials dissolve and diffuse in the soil. Also, such additions give little control over micronutrient soil concentration with respect to plant needs from day to day. Another disadvantage is the relatively large quantities needed to overcome solubility and soil impediments. Bulk fertilizer can be carried off by rain or irrigation water or leached from the soil as a ground water pollutant. Thus, bulk use is inefficient and costly. In space travel, agronomical species such as wheat, potatoes, soybeans, and the like in hydroponic tanks can fixate carbon dioxide into edible biomass. Hydroponic systems, however, require soluble nutrients to be continuously supplied and closely monitored. Hence, solid-support substrates may provide a low maintenance, high reliability substrate for plant growth. It is, therefore, very desirable that the fertilizer is strictly tailored to the requirements of the on-board cultures. In addition, the fertilizer should be compact, long-lasting and contain all required micronutrients, which are released as needed over a long period time, encompassing several growing seasons, without replenishment. It is consequently desirable to tailor a synthetic phosphate fertilizer composition to specific agronomic needs in both terrestrial and space environments. It is also desirable that the composition have only the desired spectrum of micronutrient elements which can be released in a controlled manner and be free of toxic elements which are normally present in natural phosphate fertilizers. U.S. Pat. No. 3,958,973 to Roberts describes a micronutrient metal containing phosphate glass for fertilizer use. The glass is based on P.sub.2 O.sub.5 and the micronutrients are based on the metal oxide. A solubility control agent is said to be present to control the amount and rate of release. U.S. Pat. No. 4,299,613 to Carderelli describes a polymeric composition incorporating essential plant growth compounds in ionic form. These compounds are said to be gradually, continuously and uniformly released over a long period of time in response to the presence of moisture. U.S. Pat. No. 4,334,906 to Young describes a combination soil amendment and micronutrient source. The composition comprises highly porous sulfur particles having substantial internal surface area with the micronutrient source dispersed either throughout the particle matrix or over the interior surfaces. U.S. Pat. No. 4,670,039 to Sjogren describes a controlled slow release fertilizer composition comprising an encapsulated fertilizer, carbon particles and plaster. U.S. Pat. No. 4,994,100 to Sutton et al. describes a granular nitrogen fertilizer made up of urea, dicyandiamide, ammonium thiosulfate, and optionally a phosphate compound. This composition can contain various micronutrients. U.S. Patent 4,557,749 to Berthet et al. describes a sealed container for a hydrosoluble fertilizer or agricultural product. The container has a wall made of a hydrophobic polymer diaphragm with hydrophilic inclusions which absorb water. Water passing into the container dissolves the fertilizer which is then desorbed into the medium being treated. Other U.S. Patents of interest include U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,507,139 to Sullivan et al.; 4,175,943 to Jordaan et al.; and 4,995,897 to Schramm et al. The present invention is a synthetic apatite phosphate fertilizer composition containing essential micronutrients as well as other essential nutrients such as magnesium, potassium and sulfur, and a method for making the composition. In addition, the synthetic apatite is essentially free of toxic elements. Furthermore, a solubility control agent can be added to enhance control of the nutrient release rate. In one embodiment, the present invention provides for a synthetic apatite useful as a slow-release fertilizer. The apatite has a matrix of calcium phosphate and one or more agronutrients dispersed in the matrix. The apatite is preferably essentially free of agrotoxins, such as, for example, fluorine, cadmium and sodium, in amounts detrimental to the growth of most plants. Agronutrients include, for example, potassium, magnesium, sulfur, zinc, chlorine, iron, manganese, copper, molybdenum and/or boron. The synthetic apatite can further include a carbonate and/or silicon solubility control agent. The matrix preferably comprises a synthetic apatite. In another embodiment, the synthetic apatite is prepared by combining in an aqueous medium, a water soluble ionic calcium compound, a water soluble ionic phosphate compound and one or more water soluble compounds of agronutrients selected from potassium, magnesium, sulfur, zinc, chlorine, iron, manganese, copper, molybdenum, boron and combinations thereof. The synthetic apatite can also include one or more silicon or carbonate compounds as a solubility control agent. A calcium phosphate is precipitated which has agronutrients dispersed in a matrix. In other steps the precipitate is recovered and dried.

6916426,Method of waste treatment,2002-04-11,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of waste treatment and, more particularly, to the treatment of animal waste in the form of a slurry produced, for example, by hogs and dairy cattle. 2. Description of the Related Art In modern agricultural production, it has become usual to employ an agricultural establishment as an intensive feeding operation for raising hundreds or even thousands of animals, e.g. hogs, dairy, poultry and beef animals, at a single location. Consequently, large amounts of animal waste matter are produced at such locations, and the disposal of this waste matter in a hygienic and inoffensive manner is problematic. More particularly, it has been suggested that hogs produce more than four times as much waste as humans. It has, for example, been planned to initiate a hog farm containing 2,000,000 hogs, which will produce an amount of waste equivalent to that produced by the city of Los Angeles. The current pig population of North Carolina is four times that number. Recent accidents in North Carolina, in which millions of gallons of pig excreta were released into the countryside, have drawn attention to the problems involved in the disposal of such waste. Applications for permits to construct large piggeries have been denied because of concerns about odours and waste disposal. Animal waste, including hog manure, has traditionally been disposed of by spreading it over agricultural land as a liquid fertilizer and, for sufficiently large cropped land bases, this method of disposal can be performed safely. However, in areas of high population density or where multiple farms are closely clustered, and the land base is therefore relatively small, problems arise. For example, excess nutrients cannot be absorbed by crops and leach into ground water and surface water. When land application is prevented, e.g. because the ground is frozen or saturated with water and/or nutrients, the waste must be stored, usually in large pits, with consequential costs and environmental risk. As an alternative to land disposal, it is also common practice to compost the waste. For this purpose, the waste is separated into solid and liquid by the use of inclined screens, sometimes followed by the use of belt or filter presses. These methods produce an output containing about 45% solid material at best, and this is then mixed with a bulking material to facilitate aeration and an appropriate C:N ratio, and deposited in windrows for stabilization, over a period of about 45 to 60 days, by composting. This process does not ensure that pathogens in the waste are killed and the windrows are often odorous and may attract birds, rodents and vermin. The liquid still has to be dealt with through land application. The challenges involved in the treatment of animal waste include the destruction of pathogens, the controlled extraction of ammonium and plant nutrients, and the disposal of organic matter. It is known, from U.S. Pat. No. 4,093,544, issued Jun. 6, 1978, to David S. Ross, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, to remove ammonium from wastewater by firstly increasing the pH value of the wastewater, then desorbing ammonium by vacuum and subsequently absorbing the desorbed ammonium in liquid having a pH value and temperature substantially less than that of the original wastewater. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,914,040, issued Jun. 22, 1999, to Yvette Pescher et al., there is disclosed a process for the purification of a medium containing organic waste, for example pig manure, by subjecting the medium to treatment with an oxidizing agent, treatment with a flocculating agent and treatment with at least one polyelectrolyte. The effluent thus obtained is filtered to provide a filtration cake and a filtrate. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on an appreciation, by the present inventors, of the fact that the extraction of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus from animal waste material is substantially enhanced if the treatment is performed promptly after the production of the waste material by animals. More particularly, potassium is present in animal waste material in the form of an insoluble potassium urate. The present inventors have found that a substantial amount of the potassium in animal waste material can be extracted in a solid form, as potassium urate, before microbial action breaks down the potassium urate to leave potassium and ammonium in solution. Extracted urates are then available for inclusion in a fertilizer. When the fertilizer is used on land, the microbes in the soil break down these urates, releasing the potassium and ammonia, but at a rate less than that at which these nutrients would be released in the soil if dissolved in water. Consequently, by extracting ammonium-nitrogen and potassium in the form of urates and/or other compounds from the waste material while they remain in solid, e.g. crystalline form, i.e. before they break down to release these substances, a substantially improved extraction of these substances can be achieved The inventors have also found that phosphorous can, to a large extent, be removed from the slurry by separation of the slurry into solid material and liquid. According to the present invention, therefore, there is provided a method of treating animal waste material which comprises the steps of: a) flocculating the waste material; b) processing the flocculated slurry to separate the slurry into liquid and solid material and thereby to extract a major portion of ammonium-nitrogen and potassium from the slurry, within a sufficiently short period of time, preferably 12 hours, following the production of the waste material by animals, that the extracted potassium and ammonium-nitrogen remain bound in solid compounds; c) processing the liquid to extract further potassium and ammonium therefrom; and d) drying the solid material. A major portion, or even all, of the phosphorous in the slurry can be extracted with the solid material in step b) in solid form, and any remainder can be subsequently extracted by adding lime to the liquid. Urates in the liquid subsequently break down to leave potassium and ammonium in solution, which can be extracted by adsorption in zeolite, and the zeolite can then be dried and employed as fertilizer. Since urea in urine and faeces takes a few hours to break down and allow the release of ammonium-nitrogen under the action of urease enzymes produced by microbes, the processing of the liquid in step c) is effected promptly, and preferably within 24 hours of the production of the waste material by animals, while at least most of the ammonium-nitrogen remains trapped in solution, and consequently a major portion, or even all, of the total amount of ammonium-nitrogen in the slurry can be extracted and may be utilized, for example, as a valuable fertilizer component. Further ammonium remaining in the liquid can be adsorbed e.g. in the zeolite with the potassium and subsequently incorporated in the fertilizer. The prompt treatment of the slurry according to the present invention avoids any necessity for chemicals to be added to the slurry to inhibit the creation of ammonium or other noxious gases. The present invention may be employed to convert the slurry into a dry, high-value natural fertilizer without exhausting polluting gases, e.g. ammonium, methane and hydrogen sulfide, to the atmosphere, and by returning all of the water extracted from the waste material for use, for example, as flush water or drinking water. The present invention eliminates the need for long-term storage lagoons and land disposal requirements, and can be arranged to extract a higher proportion of ammonium-nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium from the waste material than has been possible hitherto and without the use of noxious chemicals employed in some prior art processes. In one embodiment of the invention, incoming waste material is pre-treated with either ferrous sulphate, polymer or lime before transfer to a vacuum and heat-assisted plate filter press, where it is filtered to produce a filter cake and a filtrate. Approximately 99.9% of suspended solids, 99.5% of the phosphorus content of the waste material and up to 69% of the potassium content are retained in the filter cake. The filtrate is passed to an ammonia stripper and scrubber to produce ammonium sulphate, which in turn is added to the filter cake before subsequent drying of the filter cake. In this way, more than 98% of the nitrogen present in the original waste material is recovered. The liquid is then passed through a zeolite column to capture some of the remaining ammonium-nitrogen and potassium from the liquid. When the zeolite becomes saturated, it is preferably dried and sold as a nutrient enhanced soil conditioner. The liquid is then exposed to an ultraviolet system for sterilization before transfer, for example, to a drinking water and/or flush water system in a barn or for use in irrigation. Lime used for pH control in the ammonium stripping is returned to the drying stage for incorporation into the filter cake. The present method of waste material has the advantage that it eliminates biological treatment and the use of lagoons, and also subsequent disposal of liquid waste on land, which have been employed in prior art systems. The present method is independent of weather at all times of the year and eliminates any threat of lagoon spillage and lagoon leakage, and possible overloading of the water table by disposal errors. The present method may be performed so as to produce a dry, storable fertilizer product containing the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, originally contained in the waste material, in a form acceptable to EPA Rule 503 for pathogen reduction in bio-solids. The present method does not require the disposal of any waste material and can therefore be described as a zero-discharge method which allows solids and nutrients to be shipped off immediately as high-value fertilizer. The present method does not discharge polluting gases into the atmosphere and is preferably carried out in a closed building to enable odour from spills and accidents to be controlled. By avoiding biological treatment, which requires considerable time, the present chemical/mechanical method expedites the treatment process and returns all liquid pathogen-free to the operation immediately, thus allowing for mingling of waste streams from various operations by pipeline to a central facility, and thereby getting economies of scale while retaining water conservation benefits. The extraction of a large percentage of potassium from the waste material at an early stage allows the use of zeolite to adsorb the remaining ammonium and potassium to complete a closed-loop system. The zeolite can be dried and sold separately, as can the ammonium salts."

7708037,Tree pusher,2005-11-12,0,1,"The present invention relates to felling trees. More particularly, the present invention relates to felling trees in a safe and efficient manner by controlling the direction in which the tree falls. When felling trees, it is a constant problem to determine the direction in which the tree will fall. The problem is especially severe when the tree is leaning in an undesirable direction; e.g., in the direction of a nearby house. When the tree is not leaning in any direction, there is still the problem of preventing the tree from falling on the person or persons who is/are felling the tree. The present invention provides a device and a method for causing the tree to fall in a desired direction. Attempts have been made to solve these problems, but they have not been successful. U.S. Pat. No. 4,184,462 to Jessup discloses a tree-felling device adapted to engage a tree being cut down, and to exert a force thereagainst in a particular direction, in order to cause the tree to fall in a selected area. The tree-felling device includes a jacking device of the basic bumper type which is adapted to support an elongated pusher having a tree-engaging head secured at one end thereof, and which is preferably tied to the tree to be cut. As a part of the jacking device, there is provided a ratchet mechanism having an anchoring stud secured thereto for generally receiving and stabilizing one end of said pusher, while the jacking assembly is provided with a support clip about the top portion thereof for holding the pusher. U.S. Pat. No. 4,564,173 to Atherton et al. discloses an apparatus for pushing a tree over when the tree is being cut down. When a base connected to a bumper jack is placed on a ground surface, the apparatus is tipped at an angle between the ground surface and the tree. A jack handle operates a mechanism to rise along a jack post, causing a support member to push a shaft through an aperture in a guide member until points on a tip member contact the tree, pushing the tree over when the tree is being cut down. The principal defects of these prior-art inventions are the following: A bumper jack is not capable of handling the weight of a large tree. A bumper jack cannot extend its length to a jack post if a longer jack is needed to push the tree over. The bumper-jack post would bear the entire weight of the tree. If the post should break, the tree could very possibly fall on the person or persons felling the tree, or fall in some other undesirable direction. If the jack should fail or break under the load, the jack could not be repaired or changed out during the tree-felling operation. In the case of the Jessup patent, the head plate ( 36 ) which engages the tree is not embedded in the wood of the tree. If the tree turns or twists, the head plate will move, slip, or become disconnected from the tree. Neither device could be used to fell dead or rotten trees, because neither head is designed to engage dead or rotten wood. In the case of the Jessup patent, there is nothing to hold the head plate ( 36 ) up while the tree-felling device is placed in position to fell the tree. In the case of the Jessup patent, once the tree is lying on the ground, it would be difficult to disconnect and remove the chain ( 38 ) from the tree trunk. In the case of the Jessup patent, there is nothing to prevent the pusher ( 34 ) from sliding off the head plate ( 36 ) when pressure is applied by the jack. In the case of the Jessup patent, in the event that the tree twists or turns, there is nothing to hold the pusher ( 34 ) against the head plate ( 36 ). The bumper jack lifts the load with a ratcheting action that allows for a rocking motion of the tree. This can cause the wood in the hinge point to break. Bumper jacks have a large number of moving parts, and have springs which may weaken and break. Under load, the support plate for the jack would flip or rise up in front, causing the plate to skid or to be pushed backwards. There is nothing to prevent the jack support plate from being pushed into the ground or away from the tree. Neither tree-felling device is usable on hard surfaces. The tree-felling devices could not be used on banks or inclines. There is no effective way of transporting the tree-felling devices to the job site. There is no mechanism to hold the base of the tree pusher in place as the tree pusher is pushed against the tree. The present invention provides an effective solution to these and other problems described along with a detailed description of the invention.

8859716,Degradable thiol-ene polymers,2013-07-25,0,1,"The invention is directed to the production of degradable thiol-ene based polymers via photopolymerization. Recent approaches in the field of tissue engineering involve the use of polymeric biomaterials as cell scaffolds, which provide cells with a three-dimensional support material on which to grow. Despite a recent expansion in the design and development of suitable scaffold materials, there is still a lack of suitable scaffold materials with systematically variable properties. Without suitable materials available with a wide range of properties to serve as scaffolds for tissue engineering, it is unlikely that the field will achieve its full potential. Advances in polymer chemistry and materials science have spawned the development of numerous biomaterials and scaffolding methods that have potential uses in a wide range of tissue engineering applications. Several criteria must be achieved in the design of a biomaterial. First, the material must be biocompatible. That is, it must not promote an immune, allergenic, or inflammatory response in the body. Also, a method must exist to reproducibly process the material into a three-dimensional structure. Adhesive properties of the surface of the biomaterial must permit cell adhesion and promote growth. In addition, the biomaterial should have a high porosity to facilitate cell-polymer interactions, improve transport properties, and provide sufficient space for extracellular matrix generation. Finally, depending upon the particular application, the biomaterial should be biodegradable with an adjustable degradation rate so that the rate of tissue regeneration and the rate of scaffold degradation can be matched. Natural materials, such as collagen and many polysaccharides, generally exhibit a limited range of physical properties, are difficult to isolate, and cannot be manufactured with a high degree of reproducibility. However, natural materials often are more biocompatible and may even have specific biologic activity. Synthetic materials, on the other hand, can be cheaply and reproducibly processed into a variety of structures and the mechanical strength, hydrophilicity, and degradation rates of synthetic scaffolds are more readily tailored. However, synthetic polymers can cause inflammatory responses when implanted in the host. Recent tissue engineering endeavors have attempted to combine properties of both natural and synthetic polymers in the design of a suitable scaffold. Polylactide (PLA), polyglycolide (PGA) and their copolymers (PLGA) are polyesters based on naturally occurring lactic and glycolic acids (α-hydroxy acids). They have been used as biodegradable sutures and implantable materials for more than two decades. They are biocompatible and biodegradable, and these polymers have a history of use as polymer scaffolds in tissue engineering. However, their highly crystalline and hydrophobic nature makes it difficult to control their biodegradation process and mechanical properties. Moreover, because of the lack of pendant functional groups, it is extremely difficult to modify the surface chemistry of PLA and PGA. For example, proteins and other molecules that may facilitate cell adhesion and growth cannot be easily attached to the backbone of these polymers because there is no chemical “handle” with which to derivatize these substrates. Attempts to introduce functional groups into these types of polymers include copolymerization of the lactide and glycolide cyclic monomers with more easily derivatizable monomers such as cyclic lysine monomers modified by peptide attachments. Recently, alternating copolymers of α-hydroxy acids and α-amino acids (polydepsipeptides) have been obtained with functional side groups. Additionally, poly(L-lactides) containing β-alkyl α-malate units have been prepared by ring opening copolymerization of L-lactide with a cyclic diester. Major drawbacks remain with these lactide based copolymers including the difficulty in synthesis of cyclic monomers that are used in the copolymerization with lactide and the generally low reaction yields. Thus, the difficult synthesis and the low reaction yields make the commercialization of the modified polylactide biomaterials improbable and make it nearly impossible to tailor chemical, physical, and degradation properties of the final polymer. Photopolymerization systems have numerous advantages for matrix production. First, photoinitiation allows facile control over the polymerization process with both spatial and temporal control. For example, a liquid macromer solution can be injected into an area of the body, formed into a particular shape, and photopolymerized on demand using a light source. The final polymer hydrogel maintains the shape of that specific area of the body, allowing intimate control over the final shape of the hydrogel and improved adhesion and integration. In addition, the photocrosslinking chemistry creates covalently crosslinked networks that are dimensionally stable. Known photopolymerization processes, however, suffer from a number of drawbacks, including: the use of a separate initiator specie that is cytotoxic at relatively low concentrations, the difficulty in polymerizing thick samples because of light attenuation by the initiator, the inhibition of the radical polymerization by oxygen present in the air (which slows the polymerization), and the ability to fabricate gels with a diverse range of properties, especially gels with a high water content while maintaining high mechanical strength. Thus, there exists a need for biocompatible hydrogels which can polymerize in the absence of cytotoxic initiators and which can be tailored to have specific chemical, physical, and degradation properties under physiological conditions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One embodiment of the present invention is a polymeric material having repeating units of the formula: —[—S—R 1 —S—C—C—R 2 —C—C—]—, wherein R 1 and R 2 are independent linkers, and at least one of R 1 and R 2 are degradable. R 1 and R 2 can be independently selected from poly(lactic acid), poly(ethylene glycol), poly(vinyl alcohol), and mixtures thereof, and one or both of R 1 and R 2 can have a degree of branching of greater than two. The polymeric material is preferably biocompatible, and can have a minimum dimension of at least about 4 cm. The polymeric materials of the present invention can be produced by a process that includes combining a first reactant of the formula R 1 B(C═C) n with a second reactant of the formula R 2 B(SH) m , wherein n and m are independently integers greater than one and R 1 and R 2 are as described above. The combined reactants are then irradiated with light to cause reaction between the first and second reactants and eventually between the formed products to obtain the polymeric material. This process can include irradiating the reactants in the absence of a chemical initiator. In a further embodiment, the polymeric material can include at least one biologically active component encapsulated within it. The biologically active component can be selected from the group consisting of cells, tissues, and tissue aggregates, such as chondrocytes, immortalized cell lines, stem cells, hormone-producing cells, or fibroblasts. Additionally, the biologically active component can include pharmacologically active agents or agricultural chemicals. Pharmacologically active agent functional molecules can include analgesics, antipyretics, nonsteriodal antiinflammatory drugs, antiallergics, antibacterial drugs, antianaemia drugs, cytotoxic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, dermatological drugs, psychotherapeutic drugs, vitamins, minerals, anorexiants, dietetics, antiadiposity drugs, carbohydrate metabolism drugs, protein metabolism drugs, thyroid drugs, antithyroid drugs, or coenzymes. Agricultural chemical functional molecules can include fungicides, herbicides, fertilizers, pesticides, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, organic molecules, or inorganic biologically active molecules. In another embodiment, the polymeric material can be derivatized with a functional molecule, for example, by forming the polymeric material with excess thiol groups and reacting the functional molecule with such excess thiol groups. The functional molecules can be, for example, proteins, agricultural chemicals, or pharmacologically active agents. Protein functional molecules can include adhesion peptides, growth factors, hormones, antihormones, signaling compounds, serum proteins, albumins, macroglobulins, globulins, agglutinins, lectins, antibodies, antigens, enzymes, or extracellular matrix proteins. The polymeric material of the present invention can also be configured to form a degradable commodity plastic. A further embodiment of the present invention includes a thiol-ene hydrogel having poly(lactic acid), poly(ethylene glycol), and poly(vinyl alcohol) polymeric segments, wherein at least one of the segments has a degree of branching of greater than two. In this embodiment, the thiol-ene hydrogel has a modification selected from encapsulation of at least one biologically active component within the thiol-ene hydrogel and derivatization of the thiol-ene hydrogel with a functional molecule."

9872445,Turf management,2010-09-30,0,1,"The present disclosure relates to turf management, and more particularly to evaluation and control of a turf irrigation system to improve the irrigation system's performance. BACKGROUND Turf is commonly used as a ground covering for a variety of recreational and non-recreational purposes. Because turf often needs more water than is naturally available, irrigation systems can be installed in or around the turf to provide additional water to the turf as needed. However, it can be difficult to determine when water is needed, how much water is needed, and how best to apply that water. Moreover, a variety of factors can influence the needs of the turf grass at any given location. For example, the turf grass may be growing over several different types of soil; some types, such as clay, tending to hold moisture, while other types, such as sand, tending to allow the moisture to quickly soak through. To account for such variances, it is often necessary to over-water some portions of the turf in order to provide adequate amounts of water to other portions of the turf. Over-watering, however, can be detrimental to the turf, resulting in poor turf conditions at those locations. The operation of an irrigation system in this way is inefficient and leads to unnecessary cost of operation. In general terms, this disclosure is directed to turf management. In one possible configuration and by non-limiting example, the disclosure relates to evaluation and control of a turf irrigation system to improve the irrigation system's performance. One aspect is a method of evaluating an irrigation system at a turf site, the turf site including turf. The method includes segmenting the turf site into a plurality of irrigation management units, wherein each irrigation management unit of the turf site includes at least one sprinkler head; and for each irrigation management unit, computing with a computing device a value representing a characteristic of the turf within the irrigation management unit. Another aspect is an irrigation system for providing water to turf at a turf site. The irrigation system includes sprinkler heads, water lines, and a control system. The water lines are connected to a source of water and to valves that control the flow of water through the sprinkler heads. The control system includes a computing device. The computing device is operably connected to the valves to selectively open the valves to allow water to flow through the sprinkler heads and onto the turf. The computing device is programmed to commonly control a first plurality of the sprinkler heads within a first irrigation management zone according to a first set of control parameters, and is programmed to commonly control a second plurality of sprinkler heads within a second irrigation management zone according to a second set of control parameters. The first plurality of sprinkler heads are all positioned in turf having a first common characteristic, and the second plurality of sprinkler heads are all positioned in turf having a second common characteristic. A further aspect is a method of evaluating and controlling an irrigation system at a turf site including turf. The method including transporting a data collection vehicle to a turf site, the data collection vehicle including at least a location identification device and at least one instrument adapted to measure a quality of the turf; collecting data points using the data collection vehicle, by moving the data collection vehicle across the turf while operating the instrument, the data points including a value indicative of the measured quality of the turf and a location where the data point was obtained; identifying areas of the turf site having similar qualities using the data points; and defining irrigation management zones, wherein each irrigation management zone includes areas of the turf site having similar qualities."

9179608,Plant container assembly and method,2013-04-24,0,1,"The present invention relates generally to containers for growing woody perennial plants. More particularly, the present invention relates to a container base designed to encourage air root pruning on the outside of the container sidewall in order to develop a fibrous root system, prevent stem girdling, and prevent circling and/or root defects from developing at the container sidewall and/or bottom. Currently, the majority of the nursery grown landscape plants, such as trees and shrubs, are initially grown in conventional smooth-wall, non-porous containers made of plastic, steel or other materials. The smooth-wall containers, however, tend to deflect root growth, causing it to then follow along the interior surface of the container, or deflect the root around the sidewall creating a root defect. This often results in root circling and a stem girdling root system. Such containers cause the primary roots to revolve around the container, which can cause significant stability problems when the tree matures. Such poor root development and anchorage problems are especially detrimental to trees of the larger variety. Generally, the roots of a plant grow and extend in a radial fashion from the main stem or trunk. Thus, a root will extend in a naturally promoted direction (i.e., outwardly and downwardly) until it contacts something that it cannot move or penetrate. At that point, the root is deflected in a new direction and extends until it encounters something else that would change its direction of growth or travel. Many seedling woody perennials, in particular, will first develop a tap root that plunges downward. The tap root on some woody perennials will develop a foot of primary root for every inch of top growth. Once the taproot is cut or pruned, the apical dominance of its root tip is lost and the development of some secondary lateral rooting commences. These secondary roots tend to grow a little more horizontally, although generally downwardly, in direction. When these roots run out of room to grow, they begin to circle around the inside of the container. Hence, unless air root pruning is permitted, a phenomenon in which the growth of a root ceases when the root extends into the vicinity of an aperture that is exposed to the atmosphere, these roots will grow to the bottom of the container where they continue to grow in a circular pattern. Air pruning, hence, is highly desirable, and naturally occurs when roots are exposed to air in the absence of high humidity. The roots are effectively “burned” off, causing the plant to continually produce new and healthy branching roots. If roots are not exposed to air, they continue to grow around the container in a constricted pattern. The roots may spiral, twist, kink or become stem girdling. When such a plant is later installed into the landscape, it will likely fail to establish a normal root structure, and instead will have reduced uptake of water and nutrients. Eventually abnormal growth should be obvious and could cause the plant to fail. Damaged root systems also cause leaves to turn yellow or brown, shrivel or drop. Healthy, highly branched root structures allow a plant to more efficiently uptake water and nutrients while increasing growth and overall plant health. A strong, fibrous radially extending root system will make a plant better able to establish itself when installed in a planting project. Many plant containers have been developed that attempt to encourage side root growth, via air root pruning, and reduce circling of the roots. For instance, many cylindrical plant containers exist that incorporate small size side apertures in an attempt to inhibit such concentrated spiral and circular root growth. In all these designs, however, the side apertures are relatively small, and are not sufficiently abundant. This is due to the fact that too large and too many apertures will not retain the soil properly, allows the water to pass through the sides too quickly, not allowing the soil to absorb moisture, and accelerates evaporation. Although the mere presence of a side aperture or apertures do function to encourage side root growth, air-pruning of the roots, and initially reduce the incidence of spiraled or circled roots, eventually the small sidewall apertures become filled with roots or the secondary roots the encounter sidewall and deflect, causing spiraling and circling to ensue. The large amounts of obstructive material greatly increase the opportunity for the development of circling and stem girdling roots. Once the apertures have become filled with roots, the opportunity for air pruning is diminished and root circling begins. Typical of such designs are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,442,628; 4,497,132; 4,510,712; 4,753,037; 4,939,865; 5,099,607; 5,131,185; 5,241,784; 5,557,886; and 5,937,577. Accordingly, it is therefore highly desirable to provide a transplantable plant container that encourages regenerative root growth though the container sidewall, even after air pruning has commenced, until the plant is transplanted or planted into the landscape. It is further desirable to provide an improved plant container for growing transplantable plants, whereby spiral and circular root growth is reduced or substantially prevented, and the development of lateral root tips at the bottom and around the sides of the container is maximized by air root pruning. It is still further desirable to provide a plant container that is formed to improved plant growth wherein the production of lateral root tips is promoted at all levels in a plant growth medium and the root tips quickly grow in all natural directions radially from the plants main stem, whereby the plant is quickly laterally anchored when transplanted and maximum water and nutrients are absorbed. Despite the abundance of container designs available that improve the health of a transplantable plant, there remains a need for a container that enhances root development by air pruning of the roots and significantly prevents circling and stems girding roots. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a bounding system for a transplantable plant for bounding a growing medium in which the transplantable plant is grown. Therefore, root regeneration is vastly improved. The bounding system includes a bounding apparatus having a sheet-like lattice framework, which is comprised of a plurality of elongated rib members, spaced apart from one another. Each elongated rib member defines an interior facing surface that is convex-shaped in a transverse cross-sectional dimension thereof. Further, each adjacent elongated rib member defines an elongated, spaced sidewall apertures therebetween, and hence a plurality of sidewall aperture that collectively define a sidewall aperture area. This sidewall aperture area comprises at least about 50% of the sidewall surface area. The bounding apparatus further includes s bottom support having a support surface area. The bottom support and the sidewall framework cooperate to define a cavity formed for receipt of the growing medium therein. The bottom support further include a sheet-like bottom framework having a plurality of spaced bottom wall apertures which promote and encourage air root pruning of the transplantable plant proximate the bottom support when vertically oriented at a location above the ground by a sufficient distance. Accordingly, the convex interior profile of the interior facing surface of each elongated rib members (regardless of their orientation) facilitates any root growth contacting these surfaces to be deflected into and through the respective adjacent sidewall apertures. Unlike the current designs were the interior wall are relatively flat, any such root growth directly contacting such a surface will not be directed back inward toward into the container. In one specific embodiment, the rib members and the sidewall apertures are generally vertically oriented. The rib members are relatively uniformly spaced about a longitudinal axis of the sidewall framework. In another specific configuration, the sidewall aperture area comprises at least about 60% to about 95% of the sidewall surface area. The bottom wall apertures are relatively uniformly spaced about the longitudinal axis, and collectively define a bottom wall aperture area that comprises at least about 60% to about 95% of the support surface area. In still another embodiment, the sufficient distance is in the generally in the range of about one inch to about six inches, and could be as little as ⅛ inch for smaller containers. In another aspect of the present invention, a bounding system for a transplantable plant is provided for bounding a growing medium in which the transplantable plant is grown. The bounding system includes a bounding apparatus having a sheet-like sidewall framework and a bottom support, which cooperates to define a cavity, formed for receipt of the growing medium therein. The sidewall framework, having a sidewall surface area, defines a plurality of elongated, spaced sidewall apertures therebetween that collectively define a sidewall aperture area. The sidewall aperture area comprises at least about 50% of the sidewall surface area. The bottom support includes a sheet-like bottom framework having a support surface area, and defines a plurality of spaced bottom wall apertures. The bottom and bottom wall apertures are adapted to promote and encourage air root pruning of the transplantable plant proximate the bottom support when vertically oriented at a location above the ground by a sufficient distance. In accordance with the present invention, the bounding system further includes a support tray, which is comprised of a relatively solid sheet material. The support tray includes a tray top portion and a surrounding sidewall. The tray top portion su

7584542,Trimmer,2003-11-03,0,1,"This invention relates to a grass trimming device which is capable of being switched between at least two alternative configurations which are suitable for grass trimming and edge trimming respectively. A known grass trimming device (trimmer) comprises a cutting head mounted at one end of a shaft, an operator handle being positioned at the other end of the shaft. The cutting head includes a cutter constituted by a rotatable blade or a rotatable flexible cutting line. The cutting head can be moved relative to the shaft, to position the cutter generally horizontal for grass trimming and generally vertical for edge trimming. DE-A-3 010 092 describes a known trimmer of this type, the trimmer having a handle that can be moved from a first socket on the cutting head to a second socket on the same head, in order to shift the cutting head from a configuration in which the cutter plane is horizontal for grass trimming to a configuration in which the cutter is vertical for edge trimming. In both configurations of the device, a shaft fitted to the handle is directed upwardly towards the operator. This device suffers from the drawback that changing from one function to the other is difficult, because it is necessary to release and then remove the handle from one socket, and then replace it and lock it into position in the second socket. EP-A-0 005 540 shows a similar device where the handle is pivotally adjustable in a plane which is perpendicular to the cutting plane. Changing the configuration of this device requires releasing a handle catch, turning the handle through 180°, releasing the cutting head, and then adjusting it to the required angle. Moreover, a relatively complex arrangement of parts is necessary to achieve the changeover. This results in considerable expense, and a risk that the components, which are not totally covered may be damaged by the ingress of dirt and debris. EP-A-0 296 789 describes a trimmer in which the shaft includes a coupling section to which the cutting head is pivotally attached. The cutting head includes a surface defining a parting plane at which plane the coupling section is coupled to the cutting head. The parting plane, extends laterally with respect to the shaft, so that relative movement at the parting plane between the coupling section and the cutting head is about an axis which is perpendicular to the parting plane and obliquely to the shaft, so that relative movement between the coupling section and the cutting head about the parting plane positions the cutter in grass trimming and edge trimming configurations. Each of the trimmers described above is relatively easy to operate when in the trimming configuration. However, when in the edging configuration, the user must stand at right-angles to the edge of a lawn being trimmed, and move sideways along that edge as trimming progresses. This is disadvantageous, in that it is difficult to align the cutter accurately with the edge of the lawn (owing to the eye of the user not being in alignment with the lawn edge), and this can lead to a poor edging performance. Moreover, each of the known trimmers requires a relatively complex series of operations to convert between trimming and edging configurations. The aim of the invention is to provide a trimmer having improved edging capabilities. The present invention provides a trimmer comprising a cutting head housing a cutter means, and an elongate shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being connected to the shaft by connection means permitting the cutting head to be positioned with its cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical without disconnecting the cutting head and the shaft, the shaft having a hand-grippable portion at a position remote from the cutting head, the arrangement being such that the line joining a point within the hand-grippable portion and the connection means is substantially parallel to plane of rotation of the cutter means when the cutter means is substantially vertical. Preferably, the connection means is such that the cutting head is movable between positions in which its cutter means is substantially horizontal and substantially vertical in a single movement. Advantageously, the connection means is such that the cutter means is movable between the substantially horizontal position and the substantially vertical position by an effective rotation of the cutting head relative to the handle of 120° in one direction or 240° in the other direction. Preferably, the connection means is constituted by a rotatable joint. In this case, the rotatable joint is such that the cutting head is movable between positions in which its cutter means is substantially horizontal and substantially vertical about a single axis. In a preferred embodiment, the axis of rotation of the rotatable joint lies substantially at 35.5° to the plane of rotation of the cutter means, and lies substantially at 35.5° to the horizontal when the cutting head is positioned with the cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical. Connection means of this nature enables the cutting head to be moved between a trimming mode (in which the cutter means is substantially horizontal) and an edging mode (in which the cutter means is substantially vertical) by a simple rotation of the cutting head relative to the shaft. A particular advantage of this connection means is that the elongate shaft is generally aligned with a lawn edge in the edging mode, so that the user can carry out an edging operation when positioned behind the cutting head and moving forwards (or backwards) along the edge portion of the lawn. Advantageously, the rotatable joint is constituted by a ball-and-socket joint. Preferably, the ball is fixed to the cutting head, and the socket is defined by a generally spherical socket portion formed at the end of the shaft remote from the hand-grippable portion. The trimmer may further comprise a motor for driving the cutter means. Conveniently, the cutter means is rotatable, and the drive engagement between the motor and the cutter means is a rotatable drive engagement. Preferably, the motor is housed within the ball, and is an electric motor. Preferably, a rotatable cutter line constitutes the cutter means, In a preferred embodiment, the trimmer further comprises a wheel rotatably mounted on the cutting head. The axis of rotation of the wheel may be substantially coincident with the axis of rotation of the cutter means. Advantageously, the radius of the wheel is of the order of, but slightly less than, the effective radius of the cutter means. The invention also provides a cutting head housing a cutter means, and a shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being adjustably mounted with respect to the shaft by connection means enabling the cutter means to be moved between substantially vertical and substantially horizontal positions by adjusting the position of the cutting head relative to the shaft by an effective rotation of 120° in one direction or 240° in the other direction. The invention further provides a cutting head housing a cutter means, and a shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being rotatably mounted with respect to the shaft by means of a rotatable joint whose axis of rotation lies substantially at 45° to the plane rotation of the cutter means, and lies substantially at 45° to the horizontal when the cutting head is positioned with its cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical."

The top plate is circular in shape and is made of ALMAG 35, an aluminum and magnesium alloy. This plate has a flat top side and a centerhole extending from the top side through to a bottom side. Its bottom side is characterized by the presence of a slightly elevated circular rim circumscribing its outer perimeter. Moreover, its bottom side is characterized by a cylindrically shaped downwardly directed well therefrom co-extensive with a conically inclined recession downward which is in turn co-extensive with the flooring of the bottom side, the greatest diameter of which downwardly directed well is significantly less than that of the plate. The vertical axis of symmetry of the centerhole, the downwardly directed well and the plate itself is one and the same. Extending from and co-extensive with the outer walls of the recession and the well are each of three solid rectangularly shaped abutments that are likewise co-extensive. with the flooring of the bottom side the recession and the above-mentioned circular rim. Each abutment, the vertical axes of symmetry of each of which are 120.degree. removed from the vertical axes of symmetry of the two adjacent abutments, contains one of the abovementioned top plate through holes into which, one each respectively of the cylindrical pins have been press-fitted. A first rounded concave depression in the wall of the well is found just adjacent the left side of one abutment and a second rounded concave depression in the wall of the well is found just adjacent the right side of an adjacent abutment such that the depressions are 180.degree. removed from one another. At the base of the inner wall of the well there is also flooring of the bottom side within the center of which there is the centerhole. An arrow pointing in a clockwise direction is etched into this portion of the bottom side flooring. Finally, there is also a bottom plate. This bottom plate is made of ALMAG 35 alloy material as well. It is likewise circular in shape with an outer diameter equal to that of the top plate. The bottom side of the bottom plate has a flat external surface that is slightly recessed closer to the center of the bottom plate. Closer still to the center of the bottom plate there is to be found a hollow cylindrical elevation extending from bottom to top within the center of which there is a center hole extending from the floor of the hollow cylindrical elevation through to the top side of the bottom plate and about and co-extensive with the lower portion of which hollow cylindrical elevation there is a conically shaped elevation surfacewise co-extensive with the base surface of the top side. The top side of the bottom plate is characterized by the presence of a slightly elevated circular rim that circumscribes its outer perimeter. On the top outer surface of the cylindrical elevation in the bottom plate there is etched an arrow pointed in a counterclockwise direction. The top outer surface of the previously described conically shaped elevation of the bottom plate which is co-extensive with the outer wall of the bottom plate hollow cylindrical elevation is also co-extensive with each of three solid rectangularly shaped abutments jutting therefrom and reaching to the outer rim of the top side of the bottom plate. The long vertical central axis of symmetry of each abutment is 120.degree. removed from the long vertical central axes of the two adjacent abutments. In each of these abutments near the outer rim of the top plate is a closed hole just large enough to receive the bottom portions of each one of the abovementioned pins each holding a beveled blade when the top plate and bottom plate are assembled to one another. Extending from and co-extensive with the outer surface of the hollow cylindrically shaped elevation on the top side of the bottom plate and co-extensive with the top outer surface of the concave shaped elevation of the bottom plate are each of two rounded convex ridges 180.degree. removed from one another that each fit respectively snug into one of the abovementioned concave depressions in the bottom side of the top plate when the two plates are assembled together. When the two plates with pins and blades are assembled together, they are then fitted to the rotatory head of a motorized brush cutter stem, top side of top plate first and affixed thereto by way of an appropriate nut and bolt combination depending on the type of head to be fitted to. The instant invention so affixed to a rotatory head is then ready to serve as a heavy duty vegetation cutting tool. There is a virtually never ending need for the expeditious commercial forging of ski trails, snowmobile trails, cross-country trails, horse trails and commercial clearing of power line rights-of-way and golf courses throughout the country. Such undertakings often prove to be laborious, time-consuming and relatively expensive. The instant invention however serves to greatly minimize such labor, time and cost. To begin with, one of the major problems with respect to the utilization of any currently used brushcutting device is the one wherein invariably it proves virtually impossible to cut level to ground. Consequently, after cutting, there are nevertheless vestiges of stumps still left standing that can prove to be problematic with respect to vehicular tires or to ski units after cutting. The instant invention unlike all of the prior art however permits cutting right level to ground rather than only to a level of two inches or so above ground such that therefore such problems associated with stump vestiges are totally eliminated. Additionally, the plates of the instant invention being made of ALMAG 35, an alloy of aluminum and magnesium make for a much lighter cutting tool to be fitted to the head of a brush cutting stem unit. Ease of use by a workman is thus greatly facilitated. The instant invention consisting of two plates, one with three press fitted pins and three freely rotatable beveled blades is extremely easy to assemble. This feature together with its relatively light weight as well as its facility for absorbing the shock of cutting and thereby greatly reducing any flow of cutting shock up the stem of a brush cutter renders the instant invention inherently much more user friendly than any of the various currently in vogue cutting tools utilized for such clearing. Also, the instant invention is amenable to being fitted to a counterclockwise turning rotatory head or to one that turns clockwise simply by fitting its three blade components to its pin components during assembly such that blade beveled ends face in the direction of rotation of the head. If a user cuts right to left when utilizing a cutter with a counterclockwise turning head, he or she will avoid kickback when hitting a tree, once again due to the swivel capability of each of the invention's blade components held by its press fitted pins. This feature of swivelability about pins permits a simple collapsing inward of blades upon impact with rocks thereby alleviating problems associated with rock impact shock. Also, the plate components are rust proof and shatterproof under all conditions of cutting thereby rendering the instant invention eminently more durable and inherently much safer than any of the cutting tools currently in use for such heavy brush and stump cutting purposes in areas where lots of rocks are located. Finally, unlike any other cutting tool available for clearing heavy, thick brush and small tree stumps during the course of a significant commercial undertaking, deformation with use and wear to the extent it might ever occur at all occurs only uniformly throughout the whole tool by virtue of the manner in which the two plates fit together when assembled. Also, blades of varying length and hardness can be utilized in conjunction with the plates and pins. Short, relatively thick blades are particularly useful to cut small tree stumps flush to the level of ground. Longer not quite so thick blades serve to cut heavy clumps of grass and weeks flush to the level of ground. Respectfully submitted, the instant invention in view of its above-described user and rock friendly features that enable heavy vegetation cutting and clearing to be undertaken on the average 27 percent faster on the basis of studies conducted by your inventor comparing its capabilities to other cutting heads currently in use render it indeed not only new, useful and unique but indeed virtually revolutionary in the art of brush cutting tools."
6506243,Environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends,1999-05-05,0,1,"FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the selection and use of environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends which exhibit low or reduced reactivity with respect to ozone formation. These environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends are useful in a number of applications, particularly as industrial solvents, and allow formulators an effective means to improve the environmental performance of their formulations or products. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fluid applications are broad, varied, and complex, and each application has its own set of characteristics and requirements. Proper fluid selection and fluid blend development have a large impact on the success of the operation in which the fluid is used. For instance, in a typical industrial coatings operation, a blend of several fluids is used in order to get an appropriate evaporation profile. Such a blend must also provide the appropriate solvency properties, including formulation stability, viscosity, flow/leveling, and the like. The fluid blend choice also affects the properties of the dry film, such as gloss, adhesion, and the like. Moreover, these and other properties may further vary according to the application method (e.g., spray-on), whether the substrate is original equipment (OEM), refinished, etc., and the nature of the substrate coated. Other operations involving the use of fluids and fluid blends include cleaning, printing, delivery of agricultural insecticides and pesticides, extraction processes, use in adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, and drilling muds, and countless others. The term """"fluid"""" encompasses the traditional notion of a solvent, but the latter term no longer adequately describes the possible function of a fluid or blend in the countless possible operations. As used herein the term """"fluid"""" includes material that may function as one or more of a carrier, a diluent, a surface tension modifier, dispersant, and the like, as well as a material functioning as a solvent, in the traditional sense of a liquid which solvates a substance (e.g., a solute). The term """"industrial solvent"""" applies to a class of liquid organic compounds used on a large scale to perform one or more of the numerous functions of a fluid in a variety of industries. Relatively few of the large number of known organic compounds that could be used as fluids find use as industrial solvents. Fluids that are used in large quantities have heretofore been selected because they can be produced economically and have attractive safety and use characteristics in manufacturing, consumer and commercial environments. Examples of commercial solvents and their uses as industrial solvents are described in an article entitled """"Solvents, Industrial"""", by Don A. Sullivan, Shell Chemical, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th. ed., V. 22, pp.529-571(III) (1997). In addition to the problems with fluid and fluid blend selection mentioned at the outset, there is also the problem that, in most applications, at least some of the fluid evaporates and can escape into the environment. Although many industrial coating operations, such as in original equipment manufacturing (OEM), utilize control equipment to capture or incinerate >95% of the solvent emissions, nevertheless in a majority of applications some of the solvents inevitably enters the atmosphere. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six pollutants: ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and particulates. Of all the NAAQS standards, ozone non-attainment has the greatest impact on solvent operations. Solvents typically are volatile organic compounds (VOC), which are involved in complex photochemical atmospheric reactions, along with oxygen and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere under the influence of sunlight, to produce ozone. Ozone formation is a problem in the troposphere (low atmospheric or """"ground-based""""), particularly in an urban environment, since it leads to the phenomenon of smog. Since VOC emissions are a source of ozone formation, industrial operations and plants using solvents are heavily regulated to attain ozone compliance. As different regulations have been adopted, the various approaches to controlling pollution have evolved. Certain early regulations controlled solvent composition, while later regulations primarily concerned overall VOC reduction. According to current VOC emission regulations in the U.S.A., solvents generally belong to one of two groups depending on their reactivity toward atmospheric photochemical ozone formation: (a) Negligible reactivity organic compounds which generate about the same or less quantity of ozone as would be produced by the same weight % as ethane. These organic compounds are exempt from the definition of a VOC and are not considered to be a VOC in any solvent (fluid) composition. There are numerous such compounds exempted by the EPA from the definition of VOC. However, a majority of such exempted compounds are halogenated derivatives which can possess one or more of the following deficiencies: toxicity, ozone depletion, or waste disposal or incineration problems. Other non-halogenated, oxygenated organic compounds, such as acetone and methyl acetate, have been exempted by the EPA, but such compounds have extremely high evaporation rates and high flammability so as to reduce their applicability in numerous applications. Other such organic compounds, such as tertiary butyl acetate which is under exemption consideration by the EPA, while having a significantly improved flammability level and evaporation rate, may be too chemically and thermally unstable for many applications. (b) All other oxygenated and hydrocarbon solvents are considered to be VOC's and treated by the EPA as equally (on a weight basis) polluting. A more recent U.S. regulation has combined VOC reduction with composition constraints. While the traditional source of emission reduction is large stationary industrial facilities, the EPA and other governmental entities have turned increasingly to consumer and commercial products for reduction in their solvent usage as an additional means to lower VOC emission and therefore ozone formation. Numerous government and trade publications discuss VOC's, and information is readily available on the Internet. See, for instance, http://www.paintcoatings.net/VOCW97.html. Various measurements of reactivity with respect to ozone formation are known. For instance, reactivity can be measured in environmental smog chambers, or they may be calculated using computer airshed models. See, for instance, Dr. William P. L. Carter, """"Uncertainties and Research Needs in Quantifying VOC Reactivity for Stationary Source Emission Controls"""", presented at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Consumer Products Reactivity Subgroup Meeting, Sacramento, Calif. (Oct. 17, 1995). There has also been developed a """"KOH scale"""", which provides a relative scale of the reactivity of VOC with the OH radicals involved in the complex reactions that produce ozone. See, for instance, Picquet et al., Int. J. Chem. Kinet. 30, 839-847 (1998); Bilde et al., J. Phys. Chem. A 101, 3514-3525 (1997). Numerous other reactivity scales are known and new reactivity scales are constantly being developed. Since this is a rapidly changing area of research, the most up-to-date information is often obtained via the Internet. One example is Airsite, the Atmospheric Chemistry International Research Site for Information and Technology Exchange, sponsored by the University of North Carolina and the University of Leeds, at http://airsite.unc.edu. Another way to measure the reactivity of a chemical in ozone formation is by using a technique developed by Dr. Carter (supra) at the Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CERT), University of California at Riverside. The CERT technique measures """"incremental reactivities"""", the incremental amount of ozone that is produced when the chemical is added to an already polluted atmosphere. Two experiments are conducted to measure the incremental reactivity. A base case experiment measures the ozone produced in an environmental smog chamber under atmospheric conditions designed to represent a polluted atmosphere. The second experiment called """"the test case"""" adds the chemical to the """"polluted"""" smog chamber to determine how much more ozone is produced by the newly added chemical. The results of these tests under certain conditions of VOC and nitrogen oxide ratios are then used in mechanistic models to determine the Maximum Incremental Reactivities (MIR), which is a measure of ozone formation by the chemical compound in question. The State of California has adopted a reactivity program for alternative fuels based on this technique and the EPA has exempted several compounds due to studies conducted by CERT. See, for instance, Federal Register 31,633 (Jun. 16, 1995) (acetone); 59 Federal Register 50,693 (Oct. 5, 1994) (methyl siloxanes), Federal Register 17,331 (Apr. 9, 1998) (methyl acetate). CARB and EPA have uses a weight average MIR for regulatory purposes, wherein the weight average MIR of a solvent blend is calculated by summing the product of the weight percent of each solvent and its respective MIR value. A list of compounds and their MIR values is available in the Preliminary Report to California Air Resources Board, Contract No. 95-308, William P. L. Carter, Aug. 6, 1998. A table of known MIR values may be found on the internet at http://helium.ucr.edu/~carter/index.html. CERT obtains other incremental reactivities by varying the ratios of VOC and nitrogen oxides. A detailed explanation of the methods employed and the determination of incremental reactivities and MIR scale may be found in the literature. See, for instance, International Journal of Chemical Kinetics, 28, 497-530 (1996); Atmospheric Environment, 29, 2513-2527 (1995), and 29, 2499-2511 (1995); and Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 44, 881-899 (1994); Environ. Sci. Technol. 23, 864 (1989). Moreover, various computer programs to assist in calculating MIR values are available, such as the SAPRC97 model, at http://helium.ucr.edu/~carter/saprc97.htm. Any of these aforementioned scales could be used for regulatory purposes, however the MIR scale has been found to correlate best to peak ozone formation in certain urban areas having high pollution, such as the Los Angeles basin. MIR values can be reported as the absolute MIR determined by the CERT method or as a relative MIR. One common relative MIR scale uses the Reactive Organic Gas (ROG) in the base case as a benchmark. The Absolute Reactivity ROG is 3.93 g O3 per gram ROG. This value is then the divisor for the absolute MIR of other VOCs, if MIR is cited relative to ROG. Absolute reactivities related to the ROG with the above mentioned absolute reactivity 3.93 are provided in """"Updated Maximum Incremental Reactivity Scale for Regulatory Applications"""", Preliminary Report to California Air Resources Board, Contract No. 95-308, William P. Carter, Aug. 6, 1998. For the purposes of this invention and specification, unless otherwise specifically stated, all MIR values provided herein are Absolute MIR values. It is understood, however, that the Absolute MIR values can be converted to Relative MIR and back to Absolute MIR by division or multiplication of MIR by ROG. Current regulations based on VOC emissions do not take into consideration the wide difference in ozone formation among non-exempt VOC compounds. For example, two non-exempt VOC compounds can have dramatically different ozone formation characteristics. Accordingly, current regulations do not encourage end users to minimize ozone formation by using low reactivity solvent compositions. Although there are federal and state regulatory trends toward requiring the reduction of the reactivity of solvents, the number of exempt solvents is small and in no way satisfies all the other properties required for an effective solvent such as good solvency, appropriate flash point, evaporation rate, boiling temperature, chemical and thermal stability. Solvents currently viewed as essentially non-ozone producing are those which have reactivity rates in the range of ethane. Ethane has a measured reactivity based on the MIR method of 0.35. In fact, the EPA has granted a VOC exemption to certain solvents with reactivity values in this range including acetone (MIR=0.48) and methyl acetate (MIR=0.12). However, the number of known materials having reactivities of 0.50 or less based on the MIR scale is relatively small. Moreover, it is a discovery of the present inventors that many if not most of the known fluids having acceptable reactivities with respect to ozone formation have other unfavorable performance characteristics, e.g., poor solvent properties, low flash point, inappropriate evaporation rate or volatility characteristics, unacceptable toxicity, unacceptable particulate matter formation, thermal or chemical instability and as such have limited, if any, applicability in industry. For example, ethane is a gas under ambient conditions and hence is a poor choice as an industrial solvent. Methyl acetate has an excellent MIR=0.12, but a low flash point of about -12deg C.; acetone has an acceptable MIR=0.48, but is extremely flammable. As a further example, tertiary butyl acetate (t-butyl acetate) has an excellent MIR=0.21, but has limited thermal stability and is unstable to acid catalysts which may be present in an industrial operation. Regarding particulate matter, the EPA has recently proposed standards for particulate matter under 2.5 &mgr;m (microns) in diameter (""""PM2.5""""). See 61 Federal Register 65638-65713 (Dec. 13, 1996). The proposal sets an annual limit, spatially averaged across designated air quality monitors, of 15 &mgr;g/m3, and a 24-hour standard of 65 &mgr;g/m3. Numerous discussions of this proposed standard are available on the internet, such as at http://www.cnie.org/nle/air~html, which cites numerous references (such as Wolf, """"The Scientific Basis for a Particulate Matter Standard"""", Environmental Management (Oct. 26-31, 1996)). As far as the present inventors are aware, the prior art has not addressed ways of meeting these proposed requirements, much less in meeting these requirements in conjunction with ozone reduction requirements. Moreover, the present inventors have also discovered that in many applications, VOC exempt solvents cannot be used as a one-for-one replacement for conventional solvents. Rather the formulator must balance a number of performance factors to develop an acceptable solvent or solvent blend for a particular application. Some factors are more relevant than others for specific applications. Nevertheless, many performance factors are similar for a number of applications. Numerous attempts have been made to utilize the concept of """"environmentally friendly"""" fluids in practical applications. For instance, there are a number of cleaning and/or stripping formulations available that are said to overcome certain prior art environmental problems. Examples include a binary azeotrope of octamethyltrisiloxane with n-propoxypropanol (U.S. Pat. No. 5,516,450), hexamethyidisiloxane and azeotropes and other mixtures thereof (U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,403), a nonazeotropic mixture including a halocarbon and an oxygenated organic solvent component having at least 3 carbons, which may be, for instance, dimethylcarbonate (U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,080), and a composition comprising an amide and a dialkyl carbonate (U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,133). In addition, there have been a number of patents and literature references to materials intended to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as, for instance, blowing agents. These efforts address stratospheric ozone depletion, which is the opposite phenomenon addressed by the present invention. Examples include the use of dimethoxymethane and cyclopentane (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,631,305; 5,665,788; and 5,723,509), cyclopentane (U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,652) and polyglycols (U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,144). Still further, a """"non-ozone depleting"""" solvent comprising halogenated compounds and an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon compound having 6-20 carbon atoms is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,749,956. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,480 describes a method for reducing the levels of air pollution resulting from the combustion of diesel fuel in engines comprising blending dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with diesel fuel and combusting the blended fuel in engines. U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,144 also discusses the addition of oxygenates, including methyl pivalate (methyl 1,1,1-trimethyl acetate) to gasoline (as octane boosters). The problems addressed by these patents do not relate to the problem of industrial solvent evaporation. WO 98/42774 discloses solvent-resin compositions which """"do not contribute appreciably to the formation of ground based ozone"""". Organic solvents are selected based upon having """"reaction rates with hydroxyl ion slower than ethane"""", and generally selected from halogenated solvents such as chlorobromomethane, methyl chloride, and the like. The only non-halogenated solvents that are suggested are n-alkanes (C12 -C18), methyl and t-butyl acetate, acetone, dimethoxymethane, and mineral oils. However, heretofore there has been no general solution to the problem of ground-based ozone formation that also provides for a fluid with appropriate performance attributes for an industrial solvent. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends, their use as industrial solvents, and to a method of reducing ozone formation in a process wherein at least a portion of a fluid eventually evaporates. The fluids and fluid blends of this invention have been selected by the present inventors for their actual or potential low reactivity in the complex photochemical atmospheric reaction with molecular oxygen (O2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to create ozone. The present invention provides a means to reduce ozone formation by photochemical atmospheric reactions from a fluid solvent composition which is intended at application conditions to at least partially evaporate into the atmosphere. By properly selecting low reactive components for a fluid solvent composition, ozone formation can be reduced. For the purposes of the present invention three groups of reduced ozone reactivity fluids and their uses are described and claimed: (a) Low Polluting Potential Fluid (LPPF), (b) Very Low Polluting Potential Fluid (VLPPF), and (c) Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid (NPPF), according to the Absolute MIR numbers as follows: Fluid Solvent Designation Absolute MIR Low Polluting Potential Fluid >1.0-<=1.5 gm ozone produced/ gm fluid Very Low Polluting Potential Fluid >0.5-<=1.0 gm ozone produced/ gm fluid Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid <=0.5 gm ozone produced/gm fluid Where a composition is a blend of fluids, a weight average MIR (WAMIR) can be calculated as WAMIR=&Sgr;Wi*MIRi Where Wi is a weight fraction of solvent fluid component i and MIRi is the absolute MIR value of solvent fluid component i. For the purposes of the present invention, WAMIR will be the preferred method of measuring """"ozone formation potential"""" or OFP. It is preferred that the fluids and fluid blends also provide at least one other desirable performance property such as high flash point, low particulate formation, suitable evaporation rates, suitable solvency, low toxicity, high thermal stability, and chemical inertness with respect to non-ozone producing reactions, particularly with respect to acids which may be present in coating formulations. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the fluids are used in a blend with known industrial solvents or other fluids which present an environmental problem with respect to MIR or lack one or more of the aforementioned desirable performance properties, so that the new fluid blends will have lower MIR than they would without the substituted low ozone formation reactivity fluid or have at least one of the aforementioned other desirable performance properties. The present invention is also directed to a method of reducing ozone formation from atmospheric photochemical reactions in an application wherein a fluid eventually evaporates, at least partially, into the atmosphere, comprising replacing at least a portion of a fluid having a relatively higher MIR with a fluid having a relatively lower MIR. In the case where a blend results, it is preferred that the weighted average MIR of the blend be similar to or less than the MIR of a Low Polluting Potential Fluid, and most preferably similar to the MIR of a Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid. A fluid or fluid blend according to the present invention may be used in any process, e.g., any process using a fluid as a carrier, diluent, dispersant, solvent, and the like, on any scale, e.g., pilot plant scale, or industrial scale. It is preferred that the process be a stationary industrial process and it is preferred that the process is a non-combustion process. The present invention offers its greatest benefit from the standpoint of safety and health in large-scale industrial or commercial processes, particularly industrial coating processes or in formulations used in large quantities overall, albeit on a small scale for each individual use, e.g., by a consumer, such as in household paints, cosmetics, and the like. The ordinary artisan can readily differentiate between what is an industrial scale, pilot plant scale, and laboratory scale processes. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to identify liquid organic compounds not heretofore identified as low reactivity solvent fluids and have not been used on a large scale commercial basis to reduce ozone formation. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of selecting fluids and/or fluid blends for applications which release fluids into the air and wherein there is a need to reduce ozone formation due to low atmospheric or ground-based (tropospheric) photochemical reactivity, in order to replace conventional solvents and/or solvent blends currently used in various compositions or processes. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of optimizing compositions comprising an evaporative fluid by selecting a fluid and/or fluid blend providing a reduced MIR as well as at least one additional performance attribute selected from high flash point, low particulate formation, suitable evaporation rates, suitable solvency, low toxicity, high thermal and chemical stability. Still another object of the present invention includes the selection of fluids and/or fluid blends providing low reactivity in ozone formation having compatibility with a wide range of organic compounds of different polarity and molecular weights to make the fluids and/or fluid blends suitable for a wide range of compositions. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of reducing ozone formation caused by the release into the troposphere of a fluid or fluid blend in a process utilizing the fluid or fluid blend, comprising replacing at least a portion of the fluid with another fluid having a lower MIR. A further object is to provide a method of reducing ground-based ozone formation due to fluid evaporation without resorting to expensive control equipment to capture all fluid emission into the environment. Another object is to provide solvents that reduce ground base ozone formation without the use of halogenated solvents and their associated toxicity, incineration, and waste disposal issues. These and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent as reference is made below to a detailed description, preferred embodiments, and specific examples of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The fluids used in accordance with this invention have been selected for their low or reduced ozone formation potential (as reflected in their low or reduced MIR). The ozone formation potential of a composition or fluid solvent may be determined by any scientifically recognized or peer reviewed method including but not limited to, the MIR scale, the KOH scale, smog chamber studies, and modeling studies such as those performed by Dr. William P. L. Carter. Most references in the description of the present invention will be to the Absolute MIR scale measured in grams ozone produced/gram of fluid solvent. By """"low MIR"""" is meant that the fluids have an MIR similar to or less than 1.5 gram of ozone per gram of the solvent fluid. By """"reduced MIR"""" is meant that, in a process according to the present invention, a first fluid is replaced, in whole or in part, by a second fluid, the second fluid having an MIR lower than the first fluid. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine ozone reactivity of a material according to methods in numerous literature sources and tabulated data published in the open literature. It is mentioned that the terms """"replace"""", """"replacement"""", """"replacing"""" and the like used herein are not to be taken as implying only the act of substituting a second fluid (having acceptable MIR as described herein) in a formulation for a first fluid that may have been previously used in that and similar formulation(s), with such first fluid has undesirable MIR as described herein. Rather, the terms are intended to include the formulations themselves comprising a mixture of the first and second fluids, or one or more such second fluid(s) without any of said first fluid(s), as the fluid system of the formulation. In the case where no such first fluid(s) are present, the concept of """"replacement"""" is intended to refer to corresponding formulations that have only such first fluid(s) present instead of such second fluid(s) and therefore have a lower OFP. The MIR is preferably determined by smog chamber studies, modeling studies, or a combination thereof, but is more preferably determined by """"incremental reactivity"""", and still more preferably by the Absolute MIR, as discussed above. The MIR of a fluid used in this invention is preferably less than or equal to 1.5 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid, more preferably less than or equal to 1.0 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid, and most preferably less than or equal to 0.5 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid, but the benefits of the present invention are realized if ozone formation is reduced by replacing a first fluid with a second fluid, in whole or in part, wherein the MIR of the second fluid is reduced from that of the first fluid, even if the second fluid has an MIR greater than 1.5 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid. Therefore, it is preferred that the fluid according to the present invention have an MIR less than or equal to 1.50 and more preferably less than or equal to 1.00, still more preferably less than or equal to 0.50. In an even more preferred embodiment, the reactivity in ozone formation is preferably equal to or less than that of acetone and even more preferably equal to or less than that of ethane, by whatever scale or method is used, but most preferably by the MIR scale. Thus, in a more preferred embodiment, the fluid used in a composition according to the present invention will have an MIR less than or equal to 0.50, even more preferably less than or equal to 0.35. Specifically preferred fluids according to the present invention include: dialkyl carbonates, such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl ethyl carbonate, methyl isopropyl carbonate, methyl sec-butyl carbonate, methyl t-butyl carbonate, methyl neopentyl carbonate, and diisopropyl carbonate; alkyl acetates, such as neopentyl acetate, ethylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-butylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-butylene glycol diacetate, 2,3-butylene glycol diacetate, neopentyl glycol diacetate; dioxolanes such as 2,2-dimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4-trimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4,5-tetra methyl dioxolane; pivalates such as methyl pivalate (methyl 1,1,1-trimethyl acetate), ethyl pivalate, isopropyl pivalate, t-butyl pivalate (TBP), neopentyl pivalate (NPP), 1,2-propylene glycol bis-pivalate (PGBP), ethylene glycol bis-pivalate, ethylene glycol monopivalate, 1,2-butylene glycol mono-pivalate (1,2-BGMP), 2,3-butylene glycol monopivalate (2,3-BGMP), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 2,3-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (2,3-BGPA), ethylene glycol pivalate acetate, 1,2 propylene glycol monopivalate, neopentyl glycol mono pivalate, and 1,2-propylene glycol pivalate acetate; isobutyrate compounds such as isopropyl isobutyrate, neopentyl isobutyrate, and neopentyl glycol mono isobutyrate; and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanonitrile (TMPN); isopropyl neononanoate; pivalonitrile; methyl 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanoate (methyl neononanoate) and methyl 3,5,5 trimethyl hexanoate. Other preferred fluids are oxygenated (oxygen containing) organic compounds substantially free of moieties containing unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds or aromatic groups. In the case of a blend, the weighted average MIR of the fluids in a composition according to the present invention will also have the perferred, more preferred, and most preferred MIR levels as discussed above. In another preferred embodiment, wherein the blend results from replacing part of a first fluid with a second fluid and thereby reducing the weight average MIR, it is preferred that the weight average MIR be reduced 10%, more preferably 25%, still more preferably 50%, from the MIR calculated prior to the fluid replacement. In yet another preferred embodiment, the Low Polluting Potential Fluids (LPPF), Very Low Polluting Potential Fluids (VLPPF), and Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluids (NPPF), as described herein will provide at least one other desirable performance property such as high flash point low particulate formation, suitable evaporation rates, suitable solvency, low toxicity, high thermal stability, and chemical inertness. Of course, it is more preferable that the fluid or blends have two or more of these performance attributes, and so on, so that the most preferred fluid or fluid blend has all of these performance attributes. In the case of a process of reducing ozone formation, wherein a fluid according to the present invention replaces a fluid, at least in part, having a higher MIR, described in more detail below, it is preferred that this fluid replacement process, in addition to reducing ozone formation does not negatively impact any other desirable performance attributes of the composition as described above. The flash point of a fluid according to the present invention is preferably at least -6.1deg C. or higher, more preferably greater than +6.0deg C., even more preferably greater than 15deg C., still more preferably greater than 25deg C., yet even more preferably greater than 37.8deg C., and most preferably greater than 60deg C. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine the flash point of a fluid or blend (e.g., ASTM D92-78). In the case of a blend, the flash point of the blend may be the flash point of the more volatile component, in the instance where the flash points of the individual components differ markedly or where the more volatile component is the predominant component. The flash point of the blend may be in between the flash points of the individual components. As used herein, the term """"flash point"""" will refer to the flash point experimentally determined for a single fluid or a blend, as applicable. The fluid or blend thereof, according to the present invention, should preferably not contribute measurably to particulate formation of particulates having a size diameter below 2.5 &mgr;m--referred to as 2.5PM herein--in the atmosphere. In a preferred embodiment of a process of reducing ozone formation, the fluid selected to replace a previously-used solvent will be one that also reduces particulate matter to less than or equal to 65 &mgr;g/m3, and more preferably less than or equal to 50 &mgr;g/m3, when measured over a 24-hour period, preferably spatially averaged over all monitors in a given geographic area. The evaporation rate should be suitable for the intended purpose. In many if not most applications, the fluid according to the present invention will be used to replace, at least in part, a fluid which is environmentally disadvantaged, meaning it has a reactivity in ozone formation greater than 1.5 in Absolute MIR units. The fluid selected preferably will have a similar evaporation rate to the disadvantaged fluid being replaced, particularly in the case where a fluid blend is used and an acceptable evaporation profile is desired. It is convenient for the fluid selected to have an evaporation rate less than 12 times the evaporation rate of n-butyl acetate. Evaporation rates may also be given relative to n-butyl acetate at 1.0 (ASTM D3539-87). Ranges of evaporation rates important for different applications are 5-3, 3-2, 2-1, 1.0-0.3, 0.3-0.1, and 25% of the fluid is evaporated, more preferably when >50% of the fluid is evaporated, more preferably when >80% of the fluid is evaporated, more preferably when >95% of the fluid is evaporated, and most preferably when >99% of the fluid is evaporated. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention wherein, in a method of reducing ozone formation, a fluid according to the present invention replaces, at least in part, another fluid not according to the present invention, the fluid replaced has an evaporative rate ranging from that of MEK (methyl ethyl ketone) to less than that of n-butyl acetate. The fluid or fluid blend according to the present invention may act in the traditional manner of a solvent by dissolving completely the intended solute or it may act to disperse the solute, or it may act otherwise as a fluid defined above. It is important that the solvency of the fluid be adequate for the intended purpose. In addition to the required solvency, the formulated product must be of a viscosity to enable facile application. Thus, the fluid or fluid blend must have the appropriate viscosities along with other performance attributes. One of ordinary skill in the art, in possession of the present disclosure, can determine appropriate solvent properties, including viscosity. Toxicity relates to the adverse effect that chemicals have on living organisms. One way to measure the toxic effects of a chemical is to measure the dose-effect relationship; the dose is usually measured in mg of chemical per kg of body mass. This is typically done experimentally by administering the chemical to mice or rats at several doses in the lethal range and plotting the logarithm of the dose versus the percentage of the population killed by the chemical. The dose lethal to 50% of the test population is called the median lethal dose (LD50) and is typically used as a guide for the toxicity of a chemical. See, for instance, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth Edition, Vol. 24, pp. 456-490. Currently an LD50 of >500 mg/kg qualifies as """"not classified"""" for oral toxicity under OSHA rules. EU (European Union) uses a cutoff of >2,000 mg/kg. It is preferred that the fluid or fluid blend according to the present invention have an oral rat LD50 of >500 mg/kg, more preferably >1000 mg/kg, still more preferably >2,000 mg/kg, even more preferably >3,000 mg/kg, and most preferably >5,000 mg/kg. Likewise, the fluid or blend should also cause no toxicity problems by dermal or inhalation routes and should also not be an eye or skin irritant, as measured by OSHA or European Union (EU) standards. As described above, the present invention is related to fluid solvents and fluid solvent blends which produce reduced ozone formation due to atmospheric photochemical reactions and which avoid the deficiencies associated with halogenated organic compounds, particularly toxicity, ozone depletion, incineration by-products and waste disposal problems. In this aspect, the volatile components of the preferred fluid solvents and fluid solvent blends preferably do not have more than 2.0 wt. % of halogen and more preferably less than 0.5 wt. %, and most preferably less than 0.1 wt. %. The fluid according to the present invention should be thermally stable so that it does not break down. For instance, the material should not break down into reactive species. In a preferred embodiment, the fluid is more thermally stable than t-butyl acetate. Inertness, as used herein, refers to the lack of a tendency to undergo decomposition with other materials in the fluid system. It may include, for example, inertness towards acids or bases, but particularly to acid catalysts, which are typically present in coating compositions. It is preferred that the fluid being replaced have an MIR greater than that of acetone. In another embodiment, the incremental reactivity, based on the MIR scale, of the fluid being replaced is preferably >0.50, still more preferably >0.1.00, and most preferably >1.50. In another embodiment, it is critical that in a process of reducing tropospheric ozone formation according to the present invention, the fluid replaced have a greater MIR than the fluid added, that is, the fluid according to the present invention. Of course it is to be recognized that only a portion of the higher MIR fluid need be replaced, thus obtaining a blend, in order to achieve the ozone formation reduction. However, in another embodiment of the present invention, the fluid being replaced may have an acceptable MIR, but be unacceptable with respect to one or more of the aforementioned performance attributes of flash point or flammability, particulate formation, evaporation rate, solvency, toxicity, thermal stability, or inertness. Examples of a given blend of DMC and MEK will be provided wherein the appropriate addition of DMC (or """"replacement"""" of acetone) provided for an improvement in at least one of these attributes. Examples of fluids which are replaced by fluids according to the present invention include aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon fluids such as: branched C6-C9 alkanes, straight chain alkanes, cycloaliphatic C6-C10 hydrocarbons, natural hydrocarbons (alpha or beta pinenes, or turpentines, etc.), ethanol, propanol and higher nontertiary alcohols, C3 and higher ethers, ether alcohols, ether alcohol acetates, ethyl ethoxy propionate, C5 and higher ketones, cyclic ketones, etc., C7+aromatic hydrocarbons; halocarbons, particularly chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons; and ethers such as cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF),. Examples of other common industrial solvents which may be replaced by fluids according to the present invention are those listed in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth Edition, Vol. 22, p. 536-548. Some particularly preferred replacements, i.e., a fluid according to the present invention for a currently used industrial solvent, include: in any application, but particularly coatings applications, DMC or methyl pivalate for toluene, xylene, or t-butyl acetate; methyl isopropyl carbonate (MIPC) for xylene or methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK); and diisopropyl carbonate (DIPC) for methyl amyl ketone (MAK), propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMAc), or ethyl ethoxy propionate (EEP); in any application, but particularly consumer product applications DMC, MIPC, or DIPC for hydrocarbons; in any application but particularly agricultural applications, DIPC for aromatic fluids; in any application but particularly cleaning applications, DIPC or methyl sec-butyl carbonate (MSBC) for chlorinated solvents; in any application, but particularly inks, substitute DMC or methyl pivalate for MEK and light acetates. The fluids and blends according to the present invention may be used in any process using a fluid, and particularly those process wherein at least a portion of the fluid evaporates and even more particularly wherein at least a portion evaporates into the atmosphere. Preferred processes are those utilizing the fluid as one or more of a carrier, diluent, dispersant, solvent, and the like, include processes wherein the fluid functions as an inert reaction medium in which other compounds react; as a heat-transfer fluid removing heat of reaction; to improve workability of a manufacturing process; as a viscosity reducer to thin coatings to application viscosity; as an extraction fluid to separate one material from another by selective dissolution; as a tackifier or to improve adhesion to a substrate for better bonding; as a dissolving medium to prepare solutions of polymers, resins, and other substances; to suspend or disperse pigments and other particulates; and the like. It is preferred that the process be a stationary process and also preferred that the process be a non-combustion process. It is particularly beneficial if the fluid according to the present invention be used to replace at least a portion of a traditional industrial solvent in a process using a large amount of fluid, e.g., a process using 1000 lb/year (500 kg/year), even more preferably 5 tons/year (5000 kg/yr), still more preferably 50 tons/year (50,000 kg/yr), and most preferably one million lbs/year (500,000 kg/yr). In a preferred embodiment, the process wherein the aforementioned fluid replacement occurs is on the scale of at least pilot plant-scale or greater. It is also preferred that the process in which a fluid or blend according to the present invention is used or in which at least one fluid according to the present invention replaces, at least partially, a fluid having a higher MIR, be a process in which the fluid is intended to evaporate, such as in a coating process. In such a process were the fluid is intended to evaporate, it is preferred that at least 10% of the fluid or fluids evaporate, more preferably 20% of the fluids, and so on, so that it is most preferable if >99% of the fluid or fluids present in the coating evaporate. Furthermore, one of the greatest environmental benefits of replacing a currently-used industrial solvent with a solvent according to the present invention will be realized if performed in a geographic area where monitoring for ozone and particulate matter formation occurs, and more particularly in geographic areas defined by a city and its contiguous area populated by at least 500,000 persons, and wherein the replacement of at least a portion of the currently-used industrial solvent with a fluid according to the present invention causes at least one of: (i) a reduction in the ozone formation, as measured by either monitoring devices or by a calculation of the reduction using the MIR of the industrial solvent replaced and the fluid added according to the present formation; or (ii) a reduction in particulate formation of particles having a diameter less than 2.5 &mgr;m (2.5 PM), preferably measured as a 24 hour standard, more preferably wherein that reduction is from greater than 65 &mgr;g/m3 to less than that amount in a 24 hour period, still more preferably from greater than 65 &mgr;g/m3 to less than or equal to 50 &mgr;g/m3 in a 24 hour period; and more preferably both (i) and (ii). In another embodiment, there is a method of selecting a fluid for use in a process wherein at least a portion of the fluid eventually evaporates into the atmosphere, comprising selecting as the fluid a blend of: (a) at least one fluid A having a low MIR, preferably similar to or less than or equal to 1.50, more preferably less than or equal to 1.00, yet still more preferably wherein the MIR is less than or equal to 0.50 and still even more preferably less than or equal to 0.35; and (b) at least one fluid B characterized by having at least one unsuitable attribute selected from: (i) high MIR, preferably measured by the MIR scale, e.g., having an MIR>0.50, more preferably >1.00, and yet even more preferably >1.50; (ii) low flash point, preferably less than or equal to 37.8deg C., more preferably less than or equal to 25deg C., even more preferably less than or equal to 15deg C., yet even more preferably less than or equal to 6.0deg C., and most preferably less than -6.1deg C.; (iii) formation of 2.5 PM particulates (e.g., wherein said process, using fluid B, produces 2.5 PM greater than 65 micrograms per cubic meter or greater, as measured in a 24-hour period); (iv) toxicity, preferably those having an oral rat LD50 less than or equal to 1,000 mg/kg, and most preferably less than or equal to 500 mg/kg; (vi) thermal stability, preferably having a thermal stability equal to or less than (more unstable) than t-butyl acetate; and (vii) inertness in the fluid or fluid blend, particularly with respect to any acids or bases present in the fluid or blend. Preferred examples of fluid A include: dialkyl carbonates, such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl ethyl carbonate, methyl isopropyl carbonate, methyl sec-butyl carbonate, methyl t-butyl carbonate, methyl neopentyl carbonate, and diisopropyl carbonate; alkyl acetates, such as neopentyl acetate, ethylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-butylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-butylene glycol diacetate, 2,3-butylene glycol diacetate, neopentyl glycol diacetate; dioxolanes such as 2,2-dimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4-trimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4,5-tetra methyl dioxolane; pivalates (trimethyl acetates) such as methyl pivalate (MP), isopropyl pivalate, t-butyl pivalate (TBP), neopentyl pivalate (NPP), 1,2-propylene glycol bis-pivalate (PGBP), ethylene glycol bis-pivalate, ethylene glycol monopivalate, 1,2-butylene glycol mono-pivalate (1,2-BGMP), 2,3-butylene glycol monopivalate (2,3-BGMP), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 2,3-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (2,3-BGPA), ethylene glycol pivalate acetate, 1,2 propylene glycol monopivalate, neopentyl glycol mono pivalate, and 1,2-propylene glycol pivalate acetate; isobutyrate compounds such as isopropyl isobutyrate, neopentyl isobutyrate, and neopentyl glycol mono isobutyrate; and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanonitrile (TMPN); isopropyl neononanoate; pivalonitrile; methyl 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanoate (methyl neononanoate); and methyl 3,5,5 trimethyl hexanoate. Preferred examples of fluid B include aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon fluids such as toluene and xylenes; alcohols such as ethanol, n-butyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, and sec-butanol; esters such as ethyl ethoxy propionate propylene glycol methyl ether acetate; ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), C5-C10 linear ketones, cyclic ketones; halocarbons, particularly chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons; cyclic ethers such as THF, and non-cyclic ethers such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The present invention also concerns mixtures or blends of at least one fluid according to the present invention and fluids which are known to have acceptable low OFP, e.g., acetone (MIR=0.48), methyl acetate (MIR=0.12), tert-butyl acetate (MIR=0.21), tertiary butanol (MIR=0.40), dimethyl succinate (MIR=0.20), dimethyl glutarate (MIR=0.40), and propylene carbonate (MIR=0.43). Such blends can have some important advantages, for example, blends of DMC and MEK, or DMC and methyl acetate, as previously mentioned. These blends are also considered to be part of the present invention. In combination with fluids having an MIR higher than 0.50, the fluids still can provide significant reduction in ozone formation for blended fluid compositions with other important properties for the particular application. Therefore, fluid compositions with low or reduced OFP comprising solvents selected from the list above are important goals of the present invention, even if their weighted OFP is above 0.50 in the MIR scale. The fluids listed above are recommended to be used in solvent compositions intended for release into air and are required to provide low reactivity in ozone formation. The solvents selected according to the present invention can be used in blends with each other as well as in blends with other solvents (e.g., solvents B, above), different from the solvents of the present invention. When all solvents included in the blend have MIR reactivity~0.50 or less, the solvent blends also will have low atmospheric photochemical reactivity with MIR of about 0.50 and less. The present inventors have found that many solvent blends can have an MIR in the range of ethane or acetone, even though one component may exceed that range, and therefore in terms of reactivity toward ozone formation behave as exempt solvents. The range of reactivities in exempt solvents allows a selection of fluids with extremely low reactivity, with MIR number in range of &lE;0.35 and more suitably &lE;0.24. These fluids can be blended not only with fluids with reactivity based on MIR of ~0.50 or less but, with appropriately selected fluids with MIR numbers >0.50 and at certain ratios still form fluid compositions with weighted reactivity about 0.50 or less. These blends can significantly expand the range of properties of solvent compositions and provide formulators with necessary flexibility for different applications. The selection of fluids with MIRs >0.50 can be relatively wide, however, to achieve significant reduction in weighted reactivity to ~0.50 or less, it is recommended to choose solvent with MIR <1.5, suitably <1.2, and more suitably <1.0. The conception of blends demonstrating MIR of about 0.50 or less can be applied to other solvents with known extremely low reactivities. For example, methyl acetate has an MIR 0.12 but flash point ~-12deg C. Thus, methyl acetate can be blended with butyl acetate (MIR=1.00 and flash point 27deg C.) in weight ratio of 57:43 forming a blend with MIR=0.50, providing reactivity similar to exempt solvents. This blend would have a better flash point and lower evaporation rate, making it useful for many applications which methyl acetate could not satisfy due to very low flash point. Butyl acetate which is not an exempt solvent, would become part of a mixture which by its weighted reactivity would behave similar to exempt solvent and, therefore, constitute preferred solvent composition. This special case of blends comprising at least one solvent with MIR reactivity 0.50 which have their weighted reactivity about 0.50 or less is one very important part of the present invention. Among known solvents with extremely low MIR, suitable components for the preferred blended solvents are methyl acetate (MIR=0.12), t-butyl acetate (MIR=0.21), dimethyl succinate (MIR=0.20) and methyl siloxanes including cyclomethylsiloxanes. Blends of these solvents with other solvents with MIR >0.50 resulting in weighted MIR of about 0.50 or less for the blend are preferred solvents according to the present invention. However, some of the most interesting blends are the blends of at least one solvent with MIR reactivity 0.50, which can be generated with the solvents from the list of the present invention. The present invention offers fluids and fluid blends for use in a variety of industrial applications such as paints and other coatings, adhesives, sealants, agricultural chemicals, cleaning solution, consumer products such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, drilling muds, extraction, reaction diluents, inks, metalworking fluids, etc. Among the most preferred fluids according to the present invention are dimethyl carbonate and methyl pivalate. Table 1 demonstrates the extremely low relative reactivities--significantly lower than both acetone and ethane--of dimethyl carbonate and methyl pivalate. This data shows that these two compounds satisfy the EPA requirements for exempt solvents in accordance with current VOC regulations and demonstrating extremely low reactivity for the possible future reactivity based rules. Additionally, DMC is shown to be one of the lowest reactivity compounds among all currently known oxygenated compounds. TABLE 1 Summary of calculated incremental reactivites (gram basis) for ethane, acetone, dimethyl carbonate, and methyl pivalate, relative to the average of all VOC emissions.

As seen from Table 2, Absolute Ozone Formation for different levels of NOx in ROG is highest for highest level of NOx scenario (MIR) and lowest for lowest level of NOx scenario (EBIR). As a result, Absolute Reactivity in atmospheric photochemical ozone formation for tested compounds is highest for MIR scenario and lowest for EBIR scenario. This data demonstrates the outstanding value as Low Polluting Potential Fluids (LPPF), Very Low Polluting Potential Fluid (VLPPF), and Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid (NPPF). Additionally Table 2b shows both compounds as having acceptable flash points, boiling temperatures, evaporation rates, low toxicity, good solvency and overall outstanding performance as versatile environmentally preferred exempt, extremely low ozone formation fluids (solvents) for a very wide range of applications.

DMC blended with another organic solvent would also exhibit other desirable environmental properties because DMC has a relatively high flash point and low toxicity. Again, heretofore unrecognized as a low OFP fluid, the Relative MIR of DMC is calculated to be 0.02, using the SAPRC97 model. The compounds presented in Tables 3-5 show calculated Absolute MIR reactivities for compounds useful as Low Polluting Potential Fluids (LPPF), Very Low Polluting Potential Fluids (VLPPF), and Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluids (NPPF) or as part of a fluid solvent blend. These fluids provide favorable MIR reactivities, a very wide range of evaporation rates, and a wide range of solvency and compatability with other solvents, polymers, pigments, catalysts, additives, etc., necessary for actual applications. All the compounds listed in the present invention, especially in Tables 2a-5, are very useful as substitute conventional solvents having an Absolute MIR between 1.5 and 3.0 and especially in solvents having high reactivity Absolute MIR greater than 3.0 in atmospheric photochemical ozone formation.

The most preferred use of the fluids according to the present invention is with any process wherein the reduction of ozone formation is desired, and more particularly in consumer products, and coatings such as auto refinishing, architectural and industrial coatings and paints. Paints and coatings comprise the largest single category of traditional solvent consumption, accounting for nearly half the solvents used. Fluids serve multiple functions in paints and coatings, including solubility, wetting, viscosity reduction, adhesion promotion, and gloss enhancement. Fluids dissolve the resins, dyes and pigments used in the coating formulations. Also, prior to application, it is common practice to add solvent thinner to attain the desired viscosity for the particular application. Solvents begin to evaporate as soon as the coating materials are applied. As the solvent evaporates, film formation occurs and a continuous, compact film develops. Single solvents are sometimes used in coatings formulations, but most formulations are blends of several solvents. In many coatings applications, the solvent system includes a slow-evaporating active solvent that remains in the film for an extended period to enhance the film's gloss and smoothness. Because of evaporation and the large amounts of solvents used in coatings, there is a significant amount of VOC emissions into the atmosphere. Resins which may be incorporated into compositions comprising fluids according to the present invention include acrylic, alkyd, polyester, epoxy, silicone, cellulosic and derivatives thereof (e.g., nitrocellulosic and cellulosic esters), PVC, and isocyanate-based resins. Numerous pigments may also be incorporated into compositions according to the present invention, and it is within the skill of the ordinary artisan to determine proper selection of the resin and pigment, depending on the end use of the coating. One of the cleaning applications is cold solvent cleaning which is used to degrease metal parts and other objects in many operations. Mineral spirits have been popular in cold cleaning, but are being supplanted by higher flash point hydrocarbon solvents due to emissions and flammability concerns. Efforts to eliminate organic solvents entirely from cleaning compositions have not been successful because aqueous cleaners do not have the performance properties that make organic solvent based cleaners so desirable. This invention allows formulators the option to seek the use of solvents with very low reactivity as environmentally preferred products meeting environmental concerns and customer performance concerns. A cleaning solution application which uses evaporation to clean is called vapor degreasing. In vapor degreasing, the solvents vaporize and the cold part is suspended in the vapor stream. The solvent condenses on the part, and the liquid dissolves and flushes dirt, grease, and other contaminants off the surface. The part remains in the vapor until it is heated to the vapor temperature. Drying is almost immediate when the part is removed and solvent residues are not a problem. The most common solvent used in vapor degreasing operations has been 1,1,1-trichloroethane. However, since 1,1,1-trichloroethane is being phased out due to ozone depletion in the stratosphere, alternatives are needed. Moreover, chlorine-based solvents have toxicity concerns. Thus, some of the low reactivity, high flash point solvents in this invention can be used in place of 1,1,1-trichloroethane and other halogenated solvents. An application that is similar to coatings is printing inks. In printing inks, the resin is dissolved in the solvent to produce the ink. Most printing operations use fast evaporating solvents for best production speeds, but the currently used solvents are highly reactive. Some of the previously described fast evaporation, high flash point, low reactivity in ozone formation fluids according to the present invention are suitable for printing inks. An application that is suitable to the low toxicity, high flash point and low reactivity in ozone formation fluids according to the present invention is agricultural products. Pesticides are frequently applied as emulsifiable concentrates. The active insecticide or herbicide is dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent which also contains an emulsifier. Hydrocarbon solvent selection is critical for this application. It can seriously impact the efficiency of the formulation. The solvent should have adequate solvency for the pesticide, promote good dispersion when diluted with water, have low toxicity and a flash point high enough to minimize flammability hazards. Extraction processes, used for separating one substance from another, are commonly employed in the pharmaceutical and food processing industries. Oilseed extraction is a widely used extraction process. Extraction-grade hexane is a common solvent used to extract oil from soybeans, cottonseed, corn, peanuts, and other oil seeds to produce edible oils and meal used for animal feed supplements. Low toxicity, high flash point, low MIR fluids and fluid blends of the present invention can be useful in such industries. In addition to the above-mentioned applications, other applications that can use high flash point, low toxicity, low reactivity in ozone formation fluids are adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, drilling muds, reaction diluents, metal working fluids, and consumer products, such as pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. The invention is further described in the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting. One of skill in the art will recognize that numerous variations are possible within the scope of the appendaged claims. Examples of Fluid Blends Having Negligible Reactivity Tables A and B below demonstrate fluid solvent blends may be created using (a) negligibly low reactivity fluid solvents and (b) low to very low reactivity fluid solvent in ratios which provide Weight Average MIR reactivity for the total solvent blend of <0.45 and therefore providing ozone formation similar to individual fluid solvents with negligibly low reactivity in atmospheric ozone formation. However, the blends shown in Tables A and B possess characteristics such as better evaporation profiles, flash points, as compared to the individual fluids. Table A demonstrates negligibly reactive blends based on a known negligibly reactive solvent--methyl acetate and other very low reactivity fluids previously known and from the present invention. In Table A the column with methyl acetate shows the minimum methyl acetate content that will provide negligible reactivity to the blend. As shown, all blends with increased methyl acetate content will result in reduced reactivity in ozone formation. However, a main interest in blends with reduced methyl acetate content that maintain negligible reactivity is in an increased flash point of the blend. As seen from Table A, especially advantageous are the two blends with the very low reactivity fluid solvents from the present invention, diisopropyl carbonate and ethyl pivalate which require the lowest levels of methyl acetate. This concept of blending the negligible reactivity compounds with low and very low reactivity secondary fluids that can provide Weight Average MIR less than 0.5 is also subject of this invention. Although it is not necessary that every component of the blend be selected from the list of compounds of the present invention, it should be noted that components selected from the list of the present invention provide especially desireable attributes to a finished solvent blend with reduced or negligible reactivity in atmospheric photochemical ozone formation. Advantages of the blends created with at least one compound of the present invention is further demonstrated in Table B which utilizes blends"
5566500,Surfaces coated with fluorocarbon resins upon which insects cannot climb or alight and methods and means for their establishment,1994-11-08,0,1,"2. Field of the Invention This invention relates coated surfaces upon which insects can neither climb nor alight and methods and means for applying the coatings. More particularly, the invention relates to surfaces coated with non-toxic, non-debilitating fluorocarbon resin films which are effective to discourage crawling insects from infesting a site where they are not wanted, to cause crawling insects to abandon a site they have infested, to confine crawling insects within a given enclosure and to prevent insects from alighting, climbing or building nests or webs on selected surfaces. 3. Discussion of the Prior Art The crawling insects with which this invention is concerned are those which are pests or nuisances to man. These include, for example, gypsy moths that crawl from the ground up into trees and devour the leaves of the trees; cockroaches, spiders, scales and palm aphids which are often offensive in appearance and may carry and spread disease; and, perhaps the most widespread and annoying of the general group, the ubiquitous ant. The ant exists in many forms including the leaf eater, Argentine, carpenter and pharaoh ants, the termites and, of course, the militant and destructive fire ant. It is the primary concern of this invention to restrict the movement and colonization of these insects. Many pesticides and insecticides are available which will kill or disrupt the life cycle of crawling insects, but essentially all of them are environmentally objectionable because of their toxicity. The toxicity of pesticides can endanger the health of animals and humans and curtail their use when food is present as in dinning rooms, kitchens, picnic tables, pet food dishes and the like. It is also well recognized that insects develop strains which are resistent to the effect of a given insecticide over a period of time. As an alternative to insecticides, it has been proposed to control insects with traps. One common type of trap is built with downwardly and inwardly sloping side walls that are covered with a loosely adhering powdered material, such as talcum powder. The loosely adhering particles are dislodged when an insect attempts to crawl over them and the insect falls with the powder into a trap. This technique is relied on in U.S. Pat. No 4,263,740 which teaches the application of particulate organic and inorganic materials to a vertical or sloping surface. The particulate materials are applied by coating a surface with a liquid dispersion of polytetrafluoroethylene, sand, clay, ground pyrophyllite-aluminum silicate, cellulosics, talc, sand, and flour. When the liquid content of the dispersion is evaporated, a dry, loosely adherent layer of powder remains on the surface. The size of the particles is not critical since patentee teaches that the particulate material of the dispersions may vary from less than 1 micron to more that 1000 microns in diameter, although his preferred range is from 100 to 300 microns. In use, patentee relates, when an insect first crawls over a coated surface at the entrance to a trap, its sticky pads (pulvilli) are coated with the loosely adhered powders and the ability of the pulvilli to adhere to a smooth surface is rendered ineffective. If and when the insect reverses its direction in an attempt to crawl up a smooth slanting sidewall and escape from the trap, its pulvilli are no longer """"sticky"""" and the insect must grip the particulate material with its tarsal claws to gain a purchase. At this point, the weight of the insect grasping the particulate matter dislodges the powder and causes an """"avalanche"""" of the loosely held particles carrying the insect down with them into the trap. The powdery coatings taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,740 have a limited useful life. They are consumed in use when one or more """"avalanche"""" occurs and they will break loose and flake away if the coated surface is impacted as by bumping or shaking or is exposed to the elements such as wind and rain. A less obvious defect in the powdery coatings is that loose powder can suffocate the insects and destroy their value to a hobbyist or an entomologist. Entomologists have discovered that they can nondestructively confine crawling insects in tub shaped containers by painting circumferential, horizontal bands of a water dispersion of finely divided polytetrafluoroethylene, generally about 0.05 to 0.5 microns in diameter, on the inside walls of the container. Perhaps because of their extremely small size, the particles making up the dried coating, unlike the coatings of U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,740, adhere sufficiently well to the side walls of the container to prevent them from being pulled loose when traversed by an insect. It was discovered that the insects could not climb these dried films of sub micron resin polytetrafluoroethylene particles. Since the insects appear to slide down the coated surfaces when they try to climb them, it seemed reasonable to assume, even though it has now been proven false, that the phenomenum was due to the slippery surface characteristics (low coefficient of friction) of polytetrafluoroethylene. The dispersions that the entomologists have used are commercial formulations that typically contain about 60%, by total weight, of 0.05 to 0.5 micron sized polytetrafluoroethylene particles suspended in water along with from about 5% to 8%, by weight of polytetrafluoroethylene, of a wetting agent and stabilizer. At room temperatures (20.degree.-25.degree. C.) the dispersions have viscosities of from about 20 to 27 centipoise. An example of the method used by entomologists, can be found in a trap for flying insects disclosed in European patent application 0 160 712 A1 to Montedison S.p.A. Here flying insects are prevented from crawling out of a trap having a funnel shaped (30.degree.-60.degree. cone angle) entrance by coating the interior surface of the funnel with dispersions of polytetrafluoroethylene. The dispersions are the same as those described above as used by entomologists which are commercially available formulations of aqueous dispersions of polytetrafluoroethylene. They are described in the patent application as being comprised of a granulometric dispersion of between 0.2 and 0.4 microns of 50-61% by weight polytetrafluoroethylene and 2.5-4% by weight of a non-ionic dispersant, the rest being water. It is further taught that the coatings of these dispersions can be applied by spraying or brushing. The European patent application acknowledges that the prior art has made use of sticky substances to entrap insects and powdered substances, such as kaolin or talc, to reduce an insects ability to cling to a surface. The patent application states that the powdered substances of the prior art are not useful over prolonged periods since the powders are easily removed by the mechanical action of wind, rain and humidity. The coatings of the entomologists and those disclosed in the European patent application improved over the prior powdered coatings, but they too have their deficiencies both with respect to the methods by which they are applied and to the characteristics of the applied coatings. Considering the coatings themselves the following is a listing of some of their failings. 1. While the coatings adhere to their substrates somewhat better than do the powdered coatings, the polytetrafluoroethylene coatings are so loosely bound to their substrates that they can be removed by running tap water over the surface, by lightly brushing the surface, by flexing the substrate or by applying and removing ordinary transparent adhesive tape. 2. The coatings are effective only for relatively short periods of time. In discussions with entomologists who use these coatings, it has been uniformly reported that the effective life of the coatings range from as short as several weeks to a maximum of about two, or, at most, three months. The mechanisms of the failures are not understood as often there is no apparent or observable change in the appearance of the coating. 3. The effectiveness of the coating is adversely effected if more than a single layer is applied to a surface. Care is required to avoid overcoating when the dispersion is applied for, otherwise, multiple coating layers will crack or flake off rendering the coating ineffective to prevent insects from crawling on a surface. It follows that it is necessary to remove all of an old coating which has lost its effectiveness before a new coating is applied. The difficulty of thoroughly removing all of an old coating is enough of a chore to make it common practice among entomologists to discard used insect containers after they have lost their effectiveness rather than to clean and recoat the old containers. 4. The effectiveness of the coatings are temperature sensitive. When exposed to ambient temperatures over about 30.degree.-35.degree. C., insects begin climbing over surfaces that they could not climb at lower ambient temperatures. 5. Depending on the dispersing agent used in making up the polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions, most coatings loose their effectiveness when they become damp or wet. This limits the utility of the coatings to protected environments where they can be sheltered from the effects of rain, snow, dew and other surface moisture. 6. The relatively poor adhesion of the coatings makes it impractical to clean the coated surfaces. For example, if a coating is applied to a dog dish, the coating will not survive even one dish washer cycle. The method of application of coatings from polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions as taught by the prior art, also raises a number of problems. 1. The effectiveness of the coating is influenced by the thickness of the coating. It has now been discovered that better coatings are obtained if the thickness of the dried coating is preferably 1 mil or less. This desired thickness has not been obtained in the prior art for a number of reasons including the viscosity of the available polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions, the means by which the coatings are applied as by brushing or dipping, and the dependency of the thickness on the angle the substrate makes to the horizontal as it dries. In this latter regard it may be understood that if a freshly coated surface is allowed to dry while in a vertical position, the dispersion will flow by gravity down the plate, run-off will be maximized and the coating thickness will be minimized. If, on the other hand, the surface is oriented horizontally, the run-off will be minimized and the thickness of the coating maximized. 2. The viscosity of commercially available polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions increases rapidly at higher temperatures. As a result, the coating thickness is a function of the ambient temperatures at the time the coating is applied. 3. Polytetrafluoroethylene resins are soft and subject to fibrillation when exposed to shear forces. The effect is so pronounced that fibrillation occurs when polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions are forced through an orifice as in spraying. For this reason the dispersions are difficult to handle and, for practical reasons, cannot be sprayed unto a substrate. They can not be pumped through feed lines and care must be taken to avoid fibrillation if the dispersions are shaken, stirred or pumped. 4. The high viscosity (about 20 centipoise and over) of the polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions of the prior art make it difficult to form a smooth. coating because of the relatively high viscosity and poor flow-out. 5. The polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions of the prior art are unstable and coagulate during prolonged storage. Temperatures above 25.degree. C. accelerate the coagulation of the dispersions and temperatures below the freezing point of the liquids destroy the dispersion. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to apply surface coatings to substrates which coatings prevent crawling insects from climbing on the surfaces and discourage crawling insects from infesting defined certain areas. Another object of this invention is to protect areas from infestation from crawling insects without using insecticides or toxic substances that are harmful to the environment. Another object of this invention is selectively to control the type or size of crawling insects which enter or leave an area. Another object of this invention is to prevent flying or hopping insects from alighting on or clinging to surfaces such as walls or ceilings. Another object of this invention is to provide a device for trapping insects. Another object of this invention is to create an environment which is not hospitable to crawling insects and will cause them to leave and establish their nests elsewhere. Another object of this invention is to provide wearing apparel such as shoes and boots, ankle protectors, outer garments and the like which will prevent crawling insects from climbing onto the human body. Another object of this invention is to prevent insects from crawling up the legs of furniture. Another object of this invention is to provide methods and means for controlling the movement of crawling insects which methods are simple and effective, remain effective over prolonged periods of time, withstand moderate abuse, and remain effective at elevated temperatures and when wet. Another object of this invention is the provision of methods and means to control the movement of crawling insects that retain their effectiveness for long periods of time even when used in outdoor environments and exposed to all weather conditions. Another object of this invention is to provide coatings of polytetrafluoroethylene which can withstand washing under running tap water or in a dishwasher. Another object of this invention is to provide dispersions of a polytetrafluoroethylene resins having a particle size between about 0.05 and 0.5 microns which have improved storage life, less sensitivity to higher temperatures, mixing and forces of shear and reduced tendencies to fibrillation. These and other objects of this invention are achieved by coating a surface with an aqueous dispersion of polytetrafluoroethylene particles, preferably less than 0.5 microns in size as measured along their major axis, and drying the dispersion to form a coherent film free from bubbles and other visible surface imperfections, characterized in that the viscosity of the dispersion is less than 16 centipoise. Insects cannot climb on the surfaces in accordance with the foregoing if the surfaces are at an angle to the horizontal. The minimum angle required to impede the progress of an insect over a surface coated in accordance with this invention will vary with the characteristics of the insect such as its size, whether it has any sticky substances on its legs, whether its tarsi have claws, and in the case of crawling pests such as caterpillars, how many legs it has. Nonetheless, as a generality, it may reasonably be estimated that surfaces treated in accordance with this invention should be skewed at least about 20 degrees to a horizontal axis to be effective. In the case of flying insects such as flies, gnats, or mosquitoes, and hopping insects, such as fleas, surfaces treated in accordance with this invention will prevent these pests from alighting or resting on steeply slanting surfaces, such as walls or ceilings. It has been observed that the surface characteristics of the film forming materials of this invention may change when the film becomes wet with water when a surface which has been prepared in accordance with this invention is exposed to the outdoor elements like snow, rain or high humidity, it may re-wet and lose its effectiveness in preventing insects from crawling on its surface. It is believed that the tendency of the film to re-wet is largely a function of the surfactant. Used in preparing the dispersion and it has been established that the problem can be overcome either by utilizing a surfactant that does not re-wet, or by removing the surfactant after the film has been formed. In this latter instance, it noted that some surfactants are naturally destroyed by exposure to an outdoor environment and UV light and other surfactants can be leached from a film by washing the film with a solvent which, depending upon the surfactant, may include water, alcohols, acids, bases and the like. However, when surfactants are removed by leaching, it is a sine qua non that the coatings must adhere to the substrate well enough to prevent the coatings from being washed away during the leaching process. In the preferred practice of this invention, aqueous dispersions are stabilized from the harmful effects of freeze/thaw cycles to permit their transportation and storage during colder times of the year. Suitable stabilizers for use in the dispersions of this invention include monohydric alcohols of less than five carbon atoms that form clathrates with water, polyhydric compounds, and the amine analogs of the alcohols and polyhydric compounds. These stabilizers are disclosed PCT patent application filed Apr. 30, 1992 serial number PCT/US92/03630 in the name of Thomas H. Eberlein and PCT patent application filed Apr. 30, 1992 serial number PCT/US92/03647 in the names of Thomas H. Eberlein and Allan H. Olsen both entitled """"Aqueous Dispersions Stabilized from Freeze/Thaw Cycles"""" which are incorporated herein by reference. The solids which are used to form the dispersions of this invention average less than 0.5 microns when measured along their major axis. The small size of the particles is responsible for making a surface difficult for an insect to climb and it is suspected the small particle size contributes to the formation of a more adherent film. Here and elsewhere in the specification and claims, the dried residue that remains after a dispersion of the invention has been applied to a surface is referred to as a """"film"""" since it appears to the naked eye to be continuous and since it is known that it will be effective to control the movement of insects only if it is free from discontinuities and other anomalies that will enable an insect to grip the surface of a film, On the other hand, the """"film"""" has little or no tear strength and, unless applied to an adhesive substance as is discussed below, the dried coating cannot be peeled away from a surface without destroying the """"film"""". For this reason, and since a better term does not suggest itself, it should be understood that the term """"film"""" as used herein may not be entirely consistent with some definitions of the term. The fluorocarbon resins that are of utility in the practice of the present invention are fluorocarbon polymers prepared by dispersion polymerizations and include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP) and perfluoroalkoxy (PFA). The dispersion grades of these resins are commercially available in particle sizes ranging from about 0.05 to about 0.5 microns, at solids concentrations of about 60 wt % dispersing agents, balance water, and in viscosities of from about 20 to about 27 centipoise. Since polytetrafluoroethylene resins are the most widely available, known and used of the fluorocarbon resins, the specification and claims refer specifically to this member of the group although it is to be understood that the term """"polytetrafluoroethylene"""" as used in the specification and appended claims is meant to include other dispersion grade fluorocarbon resins."

7997826,Roller assembly,2009-05-01,0,1,"This invention relates to an improved roller assembly which may be used as a drive roller or idler roller in machines or vehicles incorporating rolling apparatus for rolling of turf or grass surfaces inclusive of golf greens and bowling greens. However this is not the only application of the roller assembly of the invention which could be employed in relation to rolling of snowfields, road surfaces during preparation of roads and rolling of other uneven surfaces such as sand. One conventional rolling apparatus is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 which has a mobile main frame and at least a pair of undercarriages attached to the main frame in side by side relationship wherein each undercarriage has one or more smoothing rollers and there is further provided a control arm or plate pivotally attached to the main frame about a horizontal axis wherein each undercarriage is pivotally attached to the control arm or plate. There was further provided a transmission interconnecting each undercarriage to an operating lever or joystick wherein actuation of the operating lever or joystick causes reciprocatable pivotal movement of each undercarriage such that in use the or each smoothing roller closely follows ground contours. It is important in rolling of golf greens or bowling greens that smoothing or idler rollers as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 closely follow ground contours. If such is not the case the smoothing rollers may leave indentation lines or unsightly marks on the greens and this was detrimental to achievement of a smooth and even grass surface. Another problem of using smoothing rollers that did not closely follow ground contours was that surface corrugations in the greens still remained after repeated roller operations. However while this objective was achieved in U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 by the use of pivotal movement of each undercarriage to closely follow surface undulations or corrugations it will be appreciated that U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 still incorporated a conventional drive roller shaft which was provided with a pair of stub axles at each end thereof which were attached to mounting plates rigidly attached to the chassis of the rolling apparatus. Each stub axle was also mounted in bearing carriers carrying bearings for each stub axle so as to enable the drive roller to rotate relative to the chassis. Another conventional arrangement was that the drive roller was rigidly mounted to a support shaft which extended through each end of the drive roller thereby providing the pair of stub axles. However these conventional drive roller mounting arrangements had disadvantages in that (i) on uneven ground there was created greater ground pressure resulting in an uneven surface finish due to lines, marks or impressions left on the ground surface after passage of the drive roller. Other disadvantages were (ii) that the drive roller had reduced width compared to each smoothing roller, (iii) that there was less driving friction on the ground than desired which created loss of traction in certain driving conditions and situations, especially on increased slopes or wet turf and (iv) the drive roller was rigidly mounted to a support shaft which meant that the style of roller to be employed was limited being relatively short which was not adapted to follow ground contours. It was also to be appreciated that in relation to each of the smoothing rollers in order to achieve an objective of each smoothing roller closely following ground contours it was necessary to mount a plurality of smoothing rollers in undercarriages as described above and this procedure was relatively complicated although it operated in a perfectly satisfactory manner. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It therefore is an object of the invention to provide a roller assembly that is adapted to follow ground contours during operation. The roller assembly of the invention includes in a first embodiment a pair of roller components having respective inner ends connected to each other by a flexible and movable primary coupling and having their respective outer ends connected to a support shaft which extends through a hollow interior of each driven roller component by a secondary coupling. In a second embodiment there may be one or more intermediate or floating roller components located between the pair of roller components, which may constitute end roller components. In this embodiment each of the end roller components are connected at their respective outer ends to the support shaft which extends through a hollow interior of each end roller component and each intermediate or floating roller component by the secondary coupling. However each of the inner ends of the end roller components are connected to an adjacent end of an adjoining intermediate or floating roller component by the flexible and movable primary coupling. In the case where there are more than one intermediate floating roller components, adjacent ends of each intermediate or floating roller components are connected to each other by additional flexible and movable primary couplings. The flexible and movable primary coupling may comprise a disc or sleeve made from natural rubber, synthetic rubber or other form of flexible or elastomeric material. In one arrangement the flexible disc may have a plurality of holes to enhance flexibility or in another arrangement may have a relatively large central aperture to enhance flexibility. Preferably the flexible disc has a peripheral flange defining a pair of adjacent shoulders for supporting an adjacent end of a roller component. In the case of the first or second embodiment the primary coupling may be provided with a plurality of spigots or sockets which engage with corresponding sockets or spigots of an adjacent end of an end or driven roller component.

There are many prior art large machines that are used in the logging industry to fell, delimb, cut, load and remove cut trees from wooded areas. However, for the professional arborists usually problems are encountered due to congested areas, like city homes, lawns, drives, walks, fences and narrow gates. Most of the jobs, perhaps about 80%, of tree pruning and/or removal occurs where the large pieces of machinery cannot have ready access for one or more of the problems listed above. These same problems are substantially eliminated in accord with this invention. In accord with this invention a machine be maneuvered from backyards of houses and narrow gates and is equipped with the necessary facilities to pick up large logs and branches, load them onto a narrow walled platform, and self-propelled and steered out of the congested area for eventual disposal of the logs and branches at the street curb. It is an object of this invention to provide a machine that can be operated by a single person to accomplish the above purposes. It is another object of this invention to provide a machine that makes full use of hydraulic apparatus for lifting loads and for moving the loads to a more convenient area for disposal of the waste tree portions without damage to lawns, or walks or drives. Other objects will become apparent in the more detailed descriptions which follow. This invention relates to a maneuverable, self-propelled apparatus for transporting tree debris from pruning and removal operations and fallen trees where the apparatus includes a long narrow body with high sidewalls and with the body mounted on an undercarriage having four pneumatic-tired wheels. An upright mast is mounted on the body and supports an articulated arm of several sections and ending in opposed grapple fingers powered by hydraulic cylinders so as to be capable of picking up logs and depositing them in the body. The apparatus is long and narrow so as to be maneuverable in locations where there are narrow gates of 36 inch widths. In one specific embodiment one of the sections of the articulated arm is telescopically extensible. In another specific embodiment the body is long and narrow enough to be maneuvered into narrow spaces, and the top and rear of the body are open so as to make easy loading of logs and branches. Other specific advantages and novel features will be described in the following description."

Additionally, by way of a non-limiting example, an acid function can form salts including those derived from alkali or alkaline earth metals and those derived from ammonia and amines. Examples of preferred cations include sodium, potassium, and magnesium. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be formulated into salt derivatives. By way of a non-limiting example, a salt derivative can be prepared by contacting a free base with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt. A free base may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium carbonate, ammonia, and sodium bicarbonate. As an example, in many cases, a pesticide, such as 2,4-D, is made more water-soluble by converting it to its dimethylamine salt. In further embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be formulated into stable complexes with a solvent, such that the complex remains intact after the non-complexed solvent is removed. These complexes are often referred to as “solvates.” However, it is particularly desirable to form stable hydrates with water as the solvent. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be made into ester derivatives. These ester derivatives can then be applied in the same manner as the invention disclosed in this document is applied. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be made as various crystal polymorphs. Polymorphism is important in the development of agrochemicals since different crystal polymorphs or structures of the same molecule can have vastly different physical properties and biological performances. In further embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be made with different isotopes. Of particular importance are molecules having 2 H (also known as deuterium) in place of 1 H. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be made with different radionuclides. Of particular importance are molecules having 13 C or 14 C. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may exist as one or more stereoisomers. Thus, certain molecules can be produced as racemic mixtures. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that one stereoisomer may be more active than the other stereoisomers. Individual stereoisomers may be obtained by known selective synthetic procedures, by conventional synthetic procedures using resolved starting materials, or by conventional resolution procedures. Certain molecules disclosed in this document can exist as two or more isomers. The various isomers include geometric isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers. Thus, the molecules disclosed in this document include geometric isomers, racemic mixtures, individual stereoisomers, and optically active mixtures. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that one isomer may be more active than the others. The structures disclosed in the present disclosure are drawn in only one geometric form for clarity, but are intended to represent all geometric forms of the molecule.

Biopesticides The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may also be used in combination (such as in a compositional mixture, or a simultaneous or sequential application) with one or more biopesticides. The term “biopesticide” is used for microbial biological pest control agents that are applied in a similar manner to chemical pesticides. Commonly these are bacterial, but there are also examples of fungal control agents, including Trichoderma spp. and Ampelomyces quisqualis (a control agent for grape powdery mildew). Bacillus subtilis are used to control plant pathogens. Weeds and rodents have also been controlled with microbial agents. One well-known insecticide example is Bacillus thuringiensis , a bacterial disease of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera , and Diptera . Because it has little effect on other organisms, it is considered more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides. Biological insecticides include products based on: 1. entomopathogenic fungi (e.g. Metarhizium anisopliae ); 2. entomopathogenic nematodes (e.g. Steinernema feltiae ); and 3. entomopathogenic viruses (e.g. Cydia pomonella granulovirus). Other examples of entomopathogenic organisms include, but are not limited to, baculoviruses, bacteria and other prokaryotic organisms, fungi, protozoa and Microsproridia. Biologically derived insecticides include, but not limited to, rotenone, veratridine, as well as microbial toxins; insect tolerant or resistant plant varieties; and organisms modified by recombinant DNA technology to either produce insecticides or to convey an insect resistant property to the genetically modified organism. In one embodiment, the molecules of Formula One may be used with one or more biopesticides in the area of seed treatments and soil amendments.

Formulations A pesticide is rarely suitable for application in its pure form. It is usually necessary to add other substances so that the pesticide can be used at the required concentration and in an appropriate form, permitting ease of application, handling, transportation, storage, and maximum pesticide activity. Thus, pesticides are formulated into, for example, baits, concentrated emulsions, dusts, emulsifiable concentrates, fumigants, gels, granules, microencapsulations, seed treatments, suspension concentrates, suspoemulsions, tablets, water soluble liquids, water dispersible granules or dry flowables, wettable powders, and ultra low volume solutions. For further information on formulation types see “Catalogue of Pesticide Formulation Types and International Coding System” Technical Monograph no. 2, 5th Edition by CropLife International (2002). Pesticides are applied most often as aqueous suspensions or emulsions prepared from concentrated formulations of such pesticides. Such water-soluble, water-suspendable, or emulsifiable formulations are either solids, usually known as wettable powders, or water dispersible granules, or liquids usually known as emulsifiable concentrates, or aqueous suspensions. Wettable powders, which may be compacted to form water dispersible granules, comprise an intimate mixture of the pesticide, a carrier, and surfactants. The concentration of the pesticide is usually from about 10% to about 90% by weight. The carrier is usually selected from among the attapulgite clays, the montmorillonite clays, the diatomaceous earths, or the purified silicates. Effective surfactants, comprising from about 0.5% to about 10% of the wettable powder, are found among sulfonated lignins, condensed naphthalenesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkyl sulfates, and non-ionic surfactants such as ethylene oxide adducts of alkyl phenols. Emulsifiable concentrates of pesticides comprise a convenient concentration of a pesticide, such as from about 50 to about 500 grams per liter of liquid dissolved in a carrier that is either a water miscible solvent or a mixture of water-immiscible organic solvent and emulsifiers. Useful organic solvents include aromatics, especially xylenes and petroleum fractions, especially the high-boiling naphthalenic and olefinic portions of petroleum such as heavy aromatic naphtha. Other organic solvents may also be used, such as the terpenic solvents including rosin derivatives, aliphatic ketones such as cyclohexanone, and complex alcohols such as 2-ethoxyethanol. Suitable emulsifiers for emulsifiable concentrates are selected from conventional anionic and non-ionic surfactants. Aqueous suspensions comprise suspensions of water-insoluble pesticides dispersed in an aqueous carrier at a concentration in the range from about 5% to about 50% by weight. Suspensions are prepared by finely grinding the pesticide and vigorously mixing it into a carrier comprised of water and surfactants. Ingredients, such as inorganic salts and synthetic or natural gums may also be added, to increase the density and viscosity of the aqueous carrier. It is often most effective to grind and mix the pesticide at the same time by preparing the aqueous mixture and homogenizing it in an implement such as a sand mill, ball mill, or piston-type homogenizer. Pesticides may also be applied as granular compositions that are particularly useful for applications to the soil. Granular compositions usually contain from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the pesticide, dispersed in a carrier that comprises clay or a similar substance. Such compositions are usually prepared by dissolving the pesticide in a suitable solvent and applying it to a granular carrier which has been pre-formed to the appropriate particle size, in the range of from about 0.5 to about 3 mm. Such compositions may also be formulated by making a dough or paste of the carrier and compound and crushing and drying to obtain the desired granular particle size. Dusts containing a pesticide are prepared by intimately mixing the pesticide in powdered form with a suitable dusty agricultural carrier, such as kaolin clay, ground volcanic rock, and the like. Dusts can suitably contain from about 1% to about 10% of the pesticide. They can be applied as a seed dressing or as a foliage application with a dust blower machine. It is equally practical to apply a pesticide in the form of a solution in an appropriate organic solvent, usually petroleum oil, such as the spray oils, which are widely used in agricultural chemistry. Pesticides can also be applied in the form of an aerosol composition. In such compositions the pesticide is dissolved or dispersed in a carrier, which is a pressure-generating propellant mixture. The aerosol composition is packaged in a container from which the mixture is dispensed through an atomizing valve. Pesticide baits are formed when the pesticide is mixed with food or an attractant or both. When the pests eat the bait they also consume the pesticide. Baits may take the form of granules, gels, flowable powders, liquids, or solids. They can be used in pest harborages. Fumigants are pesticides that have a relatively high vapor pressure and hence can exist as a gas in sufficient concentrations to kill pests in soil or enclosed spaces. The toxicity of the fumigant is proportional to its concentration and the exposure time. They are characterized by a good capacity for diffusion and act by penetrating the pest's respiratory system or being absorbed through the pest's cuticle. Fumigants are applied to control stored product pests under gas proof sheets, in gas sealed rooms or buildings or in special chambers. Pesticides can be microencapsulated by suspending the pesticide particles or droplets in plastic polymers of various types. By altering the chemistry of the polymer or by changing factors in the processing, microcapsules can be formed of various sizes, solubility, wall thicknesses, and degrees of penetrability. These factors govern the speed with which the active ingredient within is released, which in turn, affects the residual performance, speed of action, and odor of the product. Oil solution concentrates are made by dissolving pesticide in a solvent that will hold the pesticide in solution. Oil solutions of a pesticide usually provide faster knockdown and kill of pests than other formulations due to the solvents themselves having pesticidal action and the dissolution of the waxy covering of the integument increasing the speed of uptake of the pesticide. Other advantages of oil solutions include better storage stability, better penetration of crevices, and better adhesion to greasy surfaces. Another embodiment is an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the emulsion comprises oily globules which are each provided with a lamellar liquid crystal coating and are dispersed in an aqueous phase, wherein each oily globule comprises at least one compound which is agriculturally active, and is individually coated with a monolamellar or oligolamellar layer comprising: (1) at least one non-ionic lipophilic surface-active agent, (2) at least one non-ionic hydrophilic surface-active agent and (3) at least one ionic surface-active agent, wherein the globules having a mean particle diameter of less than 800 nanometers. Further information on the embodiment is disclosed in U.S. patent publication 20070027034 published Feb. 1, 2007, having patent application Ser. No. 11/495,228. For ease of use, this embodiment will be referred to as “OIWE.” For further information consult “Insect Pest Management” 2nd Edition by D. Dent, copyright CAB International (2000).

Other Formulation Components Generally, when the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III are used in a formulation, such formulation can also contain other components. These components include, but are not limited to, (this is a non-exhaustive and non-mutually exclusive list) wetters, spreaders, stickers, penetrants, buffers, sequestering agents, drift reduction agents, compatibility agents, anti-foam agents, cleaning agents, and emulsifiers. A few components are described forthwith. A wetting agent is a substance that when added to a liquid increases the spreading or penetration power of the liquid by reducing the interfacial tension between the liquid and the surface on which it is spreading. Wetting agents are used for two main functions in agrochemical formulations: during processing and manufacture to increase the rate of wetting of powders in water to make concentrates for soluble liquids or suspension concentrates; and during mixing of a product with water in a spray tank to reduce the wetting time of wettable powders and to improve the penetration of water into water-dispersible granules. Examples of wetting agents used in wettable powder, suspension concentrate, and water-dispersible granule formulations are: sodium lauryl sulfate; sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate; alkyl phenol ethoxylates; and aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates. A dispersing agent is a substance which adsorbs onto the surface of particles and helps to preserve the state of dispersion of the particles and prevents them from reaggregating. Dispersing agents are added to agrochemical formulations to facilitate dispersion and suspension during manufacture, and to ensure the particles redisperse into water in a spray tank. They are widely used in wettable powders, suspension concentrates and water-dispersible granules. Surfactants that are used as dispersing agents have the ability to adsorb strongly onto a particle surface and provide a charged or steric barrier to reaggregation of particles. The most commonly used surfactants are anionic, non-ionic, or mixtures of the two types. For wettable powder formulations, the most common dispersing agents are sodium lignosulfonates. For suspension concentrates, very good adsorption and stabilization are obtained using polyelectrolytes, such as sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates. Tristyrylphenol ethoxylate phosphate esters are also used. Non-ionics such as alkylarylethylene oxide condensates and EO-PO block copolymers are sometimes combined with anionics as dispersing agents for suspension concentrates. In recent years, new types of very high molecular weight polymeric surfactants have been developed as dispersing agents. These have very long hydrophobic “backbones” and a large number of ethylene oxide chains forming the “teeth” of a “comb” surfactant. These high molecular weight polymers can give very good long-term stability to suspension concentrates because the hydrophobic backbones have many anchoring points onto the particle surfaces. Examples of dispersing agents used in agrochemical formulations are: sodium lignosulfonates; sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates; tristyrylphenol ethoxylate phosphate esters; aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates; alkyl ethoxylates; EO-PO block copolymers; and graft copolymers. An emulsifying agent is a substance which stabilizes a suspension of droplets of one liquid phase in another liquid phase. Without the emulsifying agent the two liquids would separate into two immiscible liquid phases. The most commonly used emulsifier blends contain alkylphenol or aliphatic alcohol with twelve or more ethylene oxide units and the oil-soluble calcium salt of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid. A range of hydrophile-lipophile balance (“HLB”) values from 8 to 18 will normally provide good stable emulsions. Emulsion stability can sometimes be improved by the addition of a small amount of an EO-PO block copolymer surfactant. A solubilizing agent is a surfactant which will form micelles in water at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration. The micelles are then able to dissolve or solubilize water-insoluble materials inside the hydrophobic part of the micelle. The types of surfactants usually used for solubilization are non-ionics, sorbitan monooleates, sorbitan monooleate ethoxylates, and methyl oleate esters. Surfactants are sometimes used, either alone or with other additives such as mineral or vegetable oils as adjuvants to spray-tank mixes to improve the biological performance of the pesticide on the target. The types of surfactants used for bioenhancement depend generally on the nature and mode of action of the pesticide. However, they are often non-ionics such as: alkyl ethoxylates; linear aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates; aliphatic amine ethoxylates. A carrier or diluent in an agricultural formulation is a material added to the pesticide to give a product of the required strength. Carriers are usually materials with high absorptive capacities, while diluents are usually materials with low absorptive capacities. Carriers and diluents are used in the formulation of dusts, wettable powders, granules and water-dispersible granules. Organic solvents are used mainly in the formulation of emulsifiable concentrates, oil-in-water emulsions, suspoemulsions, and ultra low volume formulations, and to a lesser extent, granular formulations. Sometimes mixtures of solvents are used. The first main groups of solvents are aliphatic paraffinic oils such as kerosene or refined paraffins. The second main group (and the most common) comprises the aromatic solvents such as xylene and higher molecular weight fractions of C9 and C10 aromatic solvents. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are useful as cosolvents to prevent crystallization of pesticides when the formulation is emulsified into water. Alcohols are sometimes used as cosolvents to increase solvent power. Other solvents may include vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters of vegetable and seed oils. Thickeners or gelling agents are used mainly in the formulation of suspension concentrates, emulsions and suspoemulsions to modify the rheology or flow properties of the liquid and to prevent separation and settling of the dispersed particles or droplets. Thickening, gelling, and anti-settling agents generally fall into two categories, namely water-insoluble particulates and water-soluble polymers. It is possible to produce suspension concentrate formulations using clays and silicas. Examples of these types of materials, include, but are not limited to, montmorillonite, bentonite, magnesium aluminum silicate, and attapulgite. Water-soluble polysaccharides have been used as thickening-gelling agents for many years. The types of polysaccharides most commonly used are natural extracts of seeds and seaweeds or are synthetic derivatives of cellulose. Examples of these types of materials include, but are not limited to, guar gum; locust bean gum; carrageenam; alginates; methyl cellulose; sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC); hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). Other types of anti-settling agents are based on modified starches, polyacrylates, polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene oxide. Another good anti-settling agent is xanthan gum. Microorganisms can cause spoilage of formulated products. Therefore preservation agents are used to eliminate or reduce their effect. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to: propionic acid and its sodium salt; sorbic acid and its sodium or potassium salts; benzoic acid and its sodium salt; p-hydroxybenzoic acid sodium salt; methyl p-hydroxybenzoate; and 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT). The presence of surfactants often causes water-based formulations to foam during mixing operations in production and in application through a spray tank. In order to reduce the tendency to foam, anti-foam agents are often added either during the production stage or before filling into bottles. Generally, there are two types of anti-foam agents, namely silicones and non-silicones. Silicones are usually aqueous emulsions of dimethyl polysiloxane, while the non-silicone anti-foam agents are water-insoluble oils, such as octanol and nonanol, or silica. In both cases, the function of the anti-foam agent is to displace the surfactant from the air-water interface. “Green” agents (e.g., adjuvants, surfactants, solvents) can reduce the overall environmental footprint of crop protection formulations. Green agents are biodegradable and generally derived from natural and/or sustainable sources, e.g. plant and animal sources. Specific examples are: vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters thereof, also alkoxylated alkyl polyglucosides.

Pesticidal Activities The disclosed pesticidal compositions may be used, for example, as nematicides, acaricides, pesticides, insecticides, miticides, and/or molluscicides. In one particular embodiment, a method of controlling pests comprises applying a pesticidal composition comprising a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III near a population of pests. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III are generally used in amounts from about 0.01 grams per hectare to about 5000 grams per hectare to provide control. Amounts from about 0.1 grams per hectare to about 500 grams per hectare are generally preferred, and amounts from about 1 gram per hectare to about 50 grams per hectare are generally more preferred. The area to which a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III is applied can be any area inhabited (or maybe inhabited, or traversed by) a pest, for example: where crops, trees, fruits, cereals, fodder species, vines, turf and ornamental plants, are growing; where domesticated animals are residing; the interior or exterior surfaces of buildings (such as places where grains are stored), the materials of construction used in building (such as impregnated wood), and the soil around buildings. Particular crop areas to use a molecule of Formula One include areas where apples, corn, sunflowers, cotton, soybeans, canola, wheat, rice, sorghum, barley, oats, potatoes, oranges, alfalfa, lettuce, strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, crucifers, pears, tobacco, almonds, sugar beets, beans and other valuable crops are growing or the seeds thereof are going to be planted. It is also advantageous to use ammonium sulfate with a 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound when growing various plants. Controlling pests generally means that pest populations, pest activity, or both, are reduced in an area. This can come about when: pest populations are repulsed from an area; when pests are incapacitated in or around an area; or pests are exterminated, in whole, or in part, in or around an area. Of course, a combination of these results can occur. Generally, pest populations, activity, or both are desirably reduced more than fifty percent, preferably more than 90 percent. Generally, the area is not in or on a human; consequently, the locus is generally a non-human area. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used in mixtures, applied simultaneously or sequentially, alone or with other compounds to enhance plant vigor (e.g. to grow a better root system, to better withstand stressful growing conditions). Such other compounds are, for example, compounds that modulate plant ethylene receptors, most notably 1-methylcyclopropene (also known as 1-MCP). Furthermore, such molecules may be used during times when pest activity is low, such as before the plants that are growing begin to produce valuable agricultural commodities. Such times include the early planting season when pest pressure is usually low. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be applied to the foliar and fruiting portions of plants to control pests. The molecules will either come in direct contact with the pest, or the pest will consume the pesticide when eating leaf, fruit mass, or extracting sap, that contains the pesticide. The 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound can also be applied to the soil, and when applied in this manner, root and stem feeding pests can be controlled. The roots can absorb a molecule taking it up into the foliar portions of the plant to control above ground chewing and sap feeding pests. Generally, with baits, the baits are placed in the ground where, for example, termites can come into contact with, and/or be attracted to, the bait. Baits can also be applied to a surface of a building, (horizontal, vertical, or slant surface) where, for example, ants, termites, cockroaches, and flies, can come into contact with, and/or be attracted to, the bait. Baits can comprise a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be encapsulated inside, or placed on the surface of a capsule. The size of the capsules can range from nanometer size (about 100-900 nanometers in diameter) to micrometer size (about 10-900 microns in diameter). Because of the unique ability of the eggs of some pests to resist certain pesticides, repeated applications of the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be desirable to control newly emerged larvae. Systemic movement of pesticides in plants may be utilized to control pests on one portion of the plant by applying (for example by spraying an area) the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III to a different portion of the plant. For example, control of foliar-feeding insects can be achieved by drip irrigation or furrow application, by treating the soil with for example pre- or post-planting soil drench, or by treating the seeds of a plant before planting. Seed treatment can be applied to all types of seeds, including those from which plants genetically modified to express specialized traits will germinate. Representative examples include those expressing proteins toxic to invertebrate pests, such as Bacillus thuringiensis or other insecticidal toxins, those expressing herbicide resistance, such as “Roundup Ready” seed, or those with “stacked” foreign genes expressing insecticidal toxins, herbicide resistance, nutrition-enhancement, drought resistance, or any other beneficial traits. Furthermore, such seed treatments with the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may further enhance the ability of a plant to better withstand stressful growing conditions. This results in a healthier, more vigorous plant, which can lead to higher yields at harvest time. Generally, about 1 gram of the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III to about 500 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide good benefits, amounts from about 10 grams to about 100 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide better benefits, and amounts from about 25 grams to about 75 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide even better benefits. It should be readily apparent that the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used on, in, or around plants genetically modified to express specialized traits, such as Bacillus thuringiensis or other insecticidal toxins, or those expressing herbicide resistance, or those with “stacked” foreign genes expressing insecticidal toxins, herbicide resistance, nutrition-enhancement, or any other beneficial traits. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used for controlling endoparasites and ectoparasites in the veterinary medicine sector or in the field of non-human animal keeping. The 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound are applied, such as by oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, granules, by dermal application in the form of, for example, dipping, spraying, pouring on, spotting on, and dusting, and by parenteral administration in the form of, for example, an injection. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be employed advantageously in livestock keeping, for example, cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, and geese. They may also be employed advantageously in pets such as, horses, dogs, and cats. Particular pests to control would be fleas and ticks that are bothersome to such animals. Suitable formulations are administered orally to the animals with the drinking water or feed. The dosages and formulations that are suitable depend on the species. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used for controlling parasitic worms, especially of the intestine, in the animals listed above. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be employed in therapeutic methods for human health care. Such methods include, but are limited to, oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, granules, and by dermal application. Pests around the world have been migrating to new environments (for such pest) and thereafter becoming a new invasive species in such new environment. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used on such new invasive species to control them in such new environment. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used in an area where plants, such as crops, are growing (e.g. pre-planting, planting, pre-harvesting) and where there are low levels (even no actual presence) of pests that can commercially damage such plants. The use of such molecules in such area is to benefit the plants being grown in the area. Such benefits, may include, but are not limited to, improving the health of a plant, improving the yield of a plant (e.g. increased biomass and/or increased content of valuable ingredients), improving the vigor of a plant (e.g. improved plant growth and/or greener leaves), improving the quality of a plant (e.g. improved content or composition of certain ingredients), and improving the tolerance to abiotic and/or biotic stress of the plant. Before a pesticide can be used or sold commercially, such pesticide undergoes lengthy evaluation processes by various governmental authorities (local, regional, state, national, and international). Voluminous data requirements are specified by regulatory authorities and must be addressed through data generation and submission by the product registrant or by a third party on the product registrant's behalf, often using a computer with a connection to the World Wide Web. These governmental authorities then review such data and if a determination of safety is concluded, provide the potential user or seller with product registration approval. Thereafter, in that locality where the product registration is granted and supported, such user or seller may use or sell such pesticide. A 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be tested to determine its efficacy against pests. Furthermore, mode of action studies can be conducted to determine if said molecule has a different mode of action than other pesticides. Thereafter, such acquired data can be disseminated, such as by the internet, to third parties. The disclosed pesticidal composition comprising a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used to control a wide variety of pests.

7422682,"Compositions, devices, and methods for use in environmental remediation",2005-06-28,0,1,"FIELD OF THE ART The field of art disclosed herein pertains to compositions, devices, and methods suited for a variety of applications in environmental remediation. BACKGROUND The uses of structural barriers for a variety of applications in environmental remediation are generally well described. Several types of environmental remediation barriers (ERBs) are used in earth and hydraulic engineering, such exemplary structures including fiber rolls, mats, blankets, and berms. Originally, major applications of ERBs included erosion and sedimentation control, revegetation, and revetment. More recently, the potential for such structures to serve additionally in the capacity of removal of natural and manmade pollutants from residential, industrial, and agricultural sources, and remediation of eutrification has been described. As the name of one type of ERB, fiber roll, suggests, ERBs packed into a covering, such as a netted material, may be filled with fibers; typically a single natural fiber such as abaca, hemp, jute, flax, sisal, coir, or straw materials. For a major application of fiber-filled ERBs in erosion and sediment control, the purpose of the fiber filling is primarily structural. In that regard, though the natural fibers described are capable of absorbing water, one necessary attribute of the fiber filler has been to provide an effective porosity once packed that allows for the ready passage of water, while promoting the retention of mud, sediment, gravel, and the like. Other desirable attributes of natural fibers used in ERBs include ready availability in high volume and low cost, requirement to be germ, insect and weed free, free of chemical pollutants, ability to degrade after use; thereby obviating creation of harmful waste, and ease of processing into targeted devices. Materials in addition to natural fibers have been suggested as supplemental constituents in ERBs. Particularly, vegetative matter, as well as nutrients and fertilizers for revegetation and revetment have been described. Materials that have been suggested include saw dust, wood chips, bark, compost, flocculants, water absorbents, and pesticides. A major objective in the field has been to establish environmental remediation practices that are consistent with good practices for environmental protection in general. In that regard, the reuse of natural materials, such as saw dust, wood chips, bark, and compost, that would otherwise go to waste has been a motive for creating fillings for ERBs. Especially in consideration of the use of ERBs in functions where the filling has a requirement that is more than structural; moreover where the filling must perform additional multiple functions, such as clarification of runoff water and removal of pollutants, the targeted and judicious selection of materials tailored for such multifunctional use throughout the lifetime of the ERBs still remains a challenge. Accordingly, a need exists for more effective compositions of materials that are multifunctional for a variety of environmental remediation needs, and for a range of ERBs utilizing such compositions and their use."

4517006,Composite materials comprising water-soluble glass particles,1982-11-17,0,1,"This invention relates to arrangements and methods for the controlled release of active materials into solution. There is a broad range of applications wherein it is necessary to provide for the release of an active material at a controlled rate into an aqueous environment. In the biosciences, particularly, the potential for prolonging the action of numerous bioactive compounds is stimulating considerable interest. Since the early 1950's researchers have attempted to develop controlled release compounds able to store active materials and then release them at controlled rates into aqueous systems. This research has tended to concentrate on polymeric materials. Any polymers may be fabricated at relatively low temperatures to encapsulate effectively active materials thereby protecting them from unwanted interaction with the environment. Subsequent release of the active material is effected by one of four general mechanisms, i.e. diffusion, swelling, (bio) chemical action and magnetic processes. However, in most cases it has proved impractical to engineer the required degree of control, especially over long periods, and in many instances toxicity of the special polymer itself has limited exploitation. Controlled Release Glasses (CRG), such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,350,675, are inorganic glasses that may be formulated to be non-toxic. Their solution rates in aqueous media are chemically controlled and may be varied to give a high degree of precision, even over long periods. Unfortunately CRG may only be fabricated at temperatures that would, on contact, destroy or degrade many of the active materials of interest. For this reason the development of CRG has tended to be concentrated on applications requiring the release of inorganic materials. The object of this invention is to combine the most advantageous properties of both the polymer and CRG approaches, without risk of toxicity. Thus the benefits of low temperature fabrication and release control combine to provide a new means of releasing a wide range of active materials. According to the invention there is provided a coherent composite structure, comprising a composite material and an active material, said composite material comprising a matrix material and a particulate material soluble in an aqueous medium and dispersed in said matrix material, the composite material being such that, when contacted with the aqueous medium, said particulate material dissolves thereby increasing the aqueous permeability of said composite whereby in use to control the release of the active material from the structure. Typically the matrix material is a polymer. When the composite comes into contact with an aqueous medium the particulate material dissolves to provide a series of passageways through the host matrix thus permitting the ingress of water. Such a composite can be employed for the delayed and controlled release of an active material which, prior to the dissolution of the particulate material and the consequent significant increase in the water permeability of the composite, is protected by the composite itself. Advantageously the particulate material is a soluble glass composition or a mixture of such glass compositions. Water soluble glass compositions have the important property that their dissolution rate may be tailored to a desired value by composition adjustment thus providing for the manufacture of composite materials with a wide range of release characteristics. Moreover, many of these glasses are biologically inert."
8065834,Two piece plant container with water reservoir,2010-02-26,0,1,"This invention concerns plant containers and more particularly plant containers which have a built-in water reservoir to reduce the need for frequent watering. Municipalities commonly maintain large numbers container plantings hanging from light poles, etc., for decorative effect, and a need for frequent watering presents a substantial burden on city resources. There have heretofore been developed containers with a built-in water reservoir which is situated to allow the planting to draw water from the reservoir in addition to the moisture in the soil in which the plant is growing. In such large scale deployment of containers, it is common to frequently switch plantings for achieving seasonal displays or to rotate out plantings which are not doing well in favor of more healthy specimens. Such practice also entails considerable labor particularly when large plants and containers are involved. In the practice of including a water reservoir defined within the container, it is important to prevent excessive water from being wicked into the soil mass as this will cause waterlogging of the soil which will cause the roots to die from disease and lack of air. If the reservoir were overfilled, this will result may occur. It is an object of the present invention to provide a plant container which includes a water reservoir which is isolated from the soil to prevent saturation of the soil, but is spaced only a very short distance therefrom so as to allow growth of roots into the reservoir space. It is another object to provide a two part container which allows easy removal of the inner container holding the soil and planting, as well as convenient lifting and handling of the outer container part. It is yet another object to provide a two part container which is sturdy enough to hold heavy plantings and which has contours which are easily molded from plastic. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The above recited objects and other objects which will be understood by those with knowledge of this art are achieved by a two part container of molded plastic, an outer tub part having a bottom region defining a reservoir space and which receives an inner holder part nested within an upper region of the outer part and which holds the soil and planting. The side wall of the outer tub part has a plurality of inwardly projecting steps formed about the perimeter defining horizontal support surfaces arranged about its interior on which a bottom wall of the inner part rests, located just above the water reservoir. At least one of the support surfaces has a localized depressed space communicating with the reservoir space such that water can flow beneath an inner part bottom wall even while resting on the step surfaces to a drain hole in the bottom of the depressed space. The drain hole establishes a maximum level of water in the reservoir space. The bottom of the inner container has a pattern of openings in a major area of its bottom wall which is located just above the maximum water level in the reservoir to allow the planting roots to quickly grow into the water in the reservoir through the openings to allow water to be absorbed by the plant in addition to moisture in the soil being absorbed without danger of waterlogging the soil by a wicking action. The planting can be thoroughly watered by pouring water into the soil mass with any excess draining into the reservoir space until the water overflows but through the drain hole with such outflow indicating to the person watering the plant that the reservoir space is filled to the maximum so that watering can be stopped. Further drainage from the soil will also flow out through the drainage hole. In order to provide a sturdy bottom wall easily capable of supporting the weight of the soil and plantings in the inner part, a series of radial ribs converging into a center connection are molded therein to stiffen the bottom wall. These ribs may continue up the side wall for large containers such that the inner container is sturdy enough to support the soil and plant independently of the outer tub part. The perimeter wall of the inner part of the container is radially indented at locations on either side thereof and open at the top to create hand grip features enabling the fingers of each hand and to be inserted therein and to be wrapped around undersurfaces, providing convenient handholds allowing easy gripping and lifting out of the inner container part from the outer part. The steps formed into the perimeter of the outer tub part also provide handholds for lifting both parts. A removable plug in a drain hole in the bottom of the reservoir allows substantially complete draining when both parts of the container is to be removed."
5665822,Thermoplastic Elastomers,1993-04-14,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to thermoplastic elastomers. 2. Introduction to the Invention Thermoplastic elastomers, which are often referred to as TPE's, are well known. The TPE's in general use contain (i) polymeric blocks (usually referred to as """"hard"""" blocks or A blocks) which (a) are amorphous and have a second order transition point, T.sub.gh, which is well above room temperature, or (b) have a crystalline polymer backbone and have a crystalline melting point, T.sub.mh, which is well above room temperature, and (ii) amorphous polymeric blocks (usually referred to as """"soft"""" blocks or B blocks) which have a glass transition point, T.sub.gs, which is well below room temperature. Each soft block is linked to at least two hard blocks, so that at temperatures between T.sub.gs and T.sub.mh, or T.sub.gs and T.sub.gh, the amorphous B blocks are tied together, resulting in elastomeric behavior. Above T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh, melting or softening of the hard blocks permits viscous flow of the polymeric chains, resulting in thermoplastic behavior. Known TPE's are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,260,659 (Gobran), 4,361,526 (Allen), 4,483,978 (Manser), 4,551,388 (Schlademan), 4,554,324 (Husman), 4,656,213 (Schladman), 4,764,586 (Manser), 4,778,852 (Futamura), 4,806,613 (Wardle), 4,919,737 (Biddle et al.), 4,952,644 (Wardle et al.), and 4,976,794 (Biddle et al.) and in the articles in Polymer, 29 (7), 1233-1239 (1988) Kallitsis et al.; J. Appl. Poly. Sci 37 (1), 267-281 (1989) Murphy et al.; J. Poly. Sci, Part A, Poly Chem, 28 (9) 2393-2401 (1990) Talukder et al.; Makromol Chem, 190, 1069-1078 (1989) Khan et al., 191, 603-614, 615-624, and 2341-2354 (1990) Fakirov et al., and 191 2355-2365 (1990) Gogeva; and Macromolecules 18 (2), 123-127 (1985) Miyamoto et al., and 23,333-337 (1990) Chow. The disclosure of each of those patents and articles is incorporated herein by reference. It has also been proposed in the patent literature to use, as components in temperature-sensitive dispensers for pesticides, disinfectants, drugs and other active agents, block copolymers containing a side chain crystallizable (SCC) polymer and a second polymer which exhibits a glass transition or melting point higher than the SCC polymer, such that the entire mass exhibits mechanical stability above the melting point of the SCC polymer but below the transition of the second polymer. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,830,855 (Stewart), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The block copolymer undergoes a rapid change in permeability to the active agent in the region of the melting point of the SCC polymer, and the second polymer ensures that the SCC polymer remains immobilized even if its melting point is reached or exceeded. This invention relates to TPE's which comprise A blocks, or B blocks, is or both A blocks and B blocks, which are crystalline and in which at least a part of the crystallinity results from the presence of crystallizable side chains. Such crystalline blocks are referred to herein as SCC blocks. TPE's containing SCC A blocks are novel and as such form part of the present invention. The invention also includes processes, compositions, shaped articles and assemblies which make use of TPE's containing SCC A blocks. TPE's containing SCC B blocks and non-SCC A blocks are not novel as a class, but this invention includes a wide range of novel processes, compositions, shaped articles and assemblies which make use of such TPE's. TPE's Containing SCC A Blocks TPE's containing SCC A blocks have the advantage that they can exhibit a much more rapid change in viscosity in the region of the crystalline melting point of the side chains in the TPE (referred to herein as T.sub.q) than is exhibited by known TPE's in the region of T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh. This rapid change in viscosity results in a number of important advantages. One advantage is that the novel TPE's can be melt processed at temperatures not far above T.sub.q, e.g. below about (T.sub.q +10).degree. C., whereas known TPE's are typically melt processed at temperatures at least 40.degree. C. above T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh. Known TPE's are typically melt processed at temperatures above 100.degree. C., whereas the preferred TPE's of the invention can be melt processed at temperatures below 100.degree. C., for example below 75.degree. C. and even below 50.degree. C. This is particularly useful when the TPE is preferably or necessarily maintained at a temperature below a critical limit (referred to herein as T.sub.crit). Such conditions arise for example when the TPE is associated with (e.g. is contained within, surrounds, forms a layer on, or is mixed with) a thermally responsive substance which may undergo, at a temperature above T.sub.crit, a change which is undesirable during such processing. The substance may be for example in the form of (i) solid particles dispersed within the TPE, e.g. particles of an explosive solid, or a pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical, or (ii) a substrate which is contacted by the TPE, e.g. a vessel in a living animal into which the TPE has been injected or otherwise placed, or (iii) a solid or a liquid which is encapsulated by the TPE. Another advantage is that the novel TPE's can be used as carriers (including encapsulants) for substances which are at least partially protected by the TPE at temperatures substantially below and approaching T.sub.q. The protection may be against physical attack and/or against chemical attack. The hard blocks in the TPE will begin to melt at a temperature T.sub.o which is somewhat below T.sub.q, e.g. 3.degree.-12.degree. C. below T.sub.q. As the temperature is increased from T.sub.o to T.sub.q, there is a rapid change in the protection provided by the TPE, and above T.sub.q the substance may be released entirely from the TPE. For example, a mixture of the TPE and an agricultural chemical can be applied during a cold season of the year while the ambient temperature is below T.sub.q and the chemical will be released when the ambient temperature exceeds T.sub.q. Similarly a seed can be coated with a TPE and will not germinate until the ambient temperature approaches or exceeds T.sub.q. Another very important advantage of the novel TPE's containing SCC A blocks is that the value of T.sub.q can be closely controlled through selection of the crystallizable moieties in the side chains. Thus, for a given crystallizable moiety, T.sub.q is mainly dependent on the length of the crystallizable moiety, and changes by at most a few .degree. C., e.g. less than 5.degree. C., with changes in the molecular weight of the A block. In the known TPE's, by contrast, T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh changes substantially with changes in the molecular weight of the A block, because the melting point is dependent on folding of the main chain. In the TPE's containing SCC A blocks, it is possible to change the physical properties of the TPE, e.g. the elongation, modulus and tensile strength, without substantially changing T.sub.q, by changing the molecular weight of the TPE and/or the molecular weight of the A blocks and/or the relative mounts of the A and B blocks. The TPE's containing SCC A blocks also show a relatively small difference between T.sub.q (the endotherm melt peak on a DSC curve as the TPE is heated) and the crystallization peak on a DSC curve as the molten TPE is cooled. Another very important advantage of the novel TPE's containing SCC hard (A) blocks is that the presence of the SCC A blocks results in improved shear strength. Furthermore their shear strength can be yet further improved by incorporation therein of a relatively low molecular weight and low melting crystalline additive, particularly an SCC polymer. The crystalline additive must be intimately mixed with the TPE, preferably through a melt mixing process or a process which comprises mixing the TPE and the additive in a common solvent. Particularly good results are obtained when the SCC blocks in the TPE and in the additive are structurally similar, and it appears that the improved shear strength results from co-crystallization of the additive and the SCC blocks. Thus a preferred combination is a TPE containing SCC blocks comprising polyethylene or poly (substituted methylene) groups and an SCC additive comprising polymethylene or poly (substituted methylene) groups. Suitable crystalline additives include those disclosed in the Schmitt et al. Application No. 07/928,800, U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,035, incorporated by reference herein. The advantages noted above make the novel TPE's with SCC hard blocks, and mixtures thereof with crystalline additives, particularly suitable for us as pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA's) and as hot melt adhesives. The TPE, or mixture thereof with a crystalline additive, can be the sole polymeric ingredient(s) of the adhesive, or can be mixed with other polymeric ingredients. For example, a conventional PSA can be modified by addition of the TPE or mixture of TPE and additive. The adhesive preferably contains 25 to 100%, particularly 75 to 100% of the TPE, and 0 to 50%, preferably 1 to 40%, of the additive. PSA's for use in the medical field for attachment to human skin preferably contain 20 to 35% of the additive. PSA's for use in other fields preferably contain less than 15%, e.g. 1 to 5%, of the additive. The adhesive can also contain additives such as tackifiers, plasticizers, fillers, stabilizers and pigments. PSA's which contain the crystalline additive have the valuable property that they have reduced adhesive strength when heated to temperatures approaching or above the crystalline melting point of the additive, as discussed in Schmitt et al. Application No. 07/928,800, U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,035. The novel TPE's containing SCC hard blocks can also contain SCC soft blocks. We have found that such TPE's, in addition to the advantages noted above for TPE's containing SCC hard blocks, are particularly useful in the form of films and other shaped articles which are heat-sealed to other polymeric articles. The TPE will undergo a rapid change in its physical properties, including its permeability to at least some gases and vapors, e.g. O.sub.2, CO.sub.2 and water vapor, in the region of T.sub.ms, but will retain substantial strength until heated to a temperature in the region of T.sub.q, when it will again undergo a rapid change in its physical properties, including its heat sealability. The repeating units of the different SCC blocks can be selected to provide a change in permeability (or other property) over a desired temperature range, and to provide a hard block which, above T.sub.mh, will be compatible with the other polymeric material to which the TPE is to be heat sealed. In this way, it is possible to make a TPE which is sufficiently flexible at 0.degree. C., which undergoes a marked change in permeability in the range of 0.degree. C. to 40.degree. C., which retains adequate physical strength at temperatures up to T.sub.q (or close to it) and which can be melt extruded and heat sealed at temperatures not far above T.sub.q, e.g. 60.degree. to 100.degree. C. If desired, the physical strength of the TPE can be improved by crosslinking, but this is not generally necessary. Such a TPE can be particularly useful as a packaging material, e.g. for actively respiring biological material, as disclosed in the Stewart Application No. 885,915 incorporated by reference herein. TPE's Containing SCC B Blocks and Non-SCC A Blocks We have found that SCC soft (B) blocks can confer important and previously unrealized benefits on TPE's containing them, making it possible to use such TPE's in ways which are novel and surprisingly valuable, even when the A blocks are not SCC blocks and the TPE is in itself known for use in other ways. For example, such TPE's can be used to provide pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA's) with very valuable properties, to provide films and other shaped articles which can be heat-sealed to other articles, and to provide hot melt adhesives. Summary of Various Aspects of the Invention First Aspect--Novel TPE In a first aspect, this invention provides novel TPE's containing SCC hard (A) blocks. These novel TPE's preferably comprise polymeric molecules which comprise (i) polymeric A blocks which (a) are crystalline and have a melting point T.sub.q, and (b) wherein at least one of the A blocks comprises a side chain comprising crystallizable moieties which render the block crystalline; and (ii) at least one polymeric B block which is linked to at least two A blocks and which (a) is crystalline and has a melting point T.sub.ms which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C., or (b) is amorphous and has a glass transition point T.sub.gs which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C. Second Aspect--Processes for Preparing the Novel TPE's Any process can be employed to make the novel TPE's of the present invention. However, particularly useful processes, which provide the second aspect of the present invention, comprise I. reacting together (i) an A block precursor which is the A block containing at least one reactive group J, and (ii) a B block precursor which is the B block containing at least two reactive groups K, which may be the same or different, which will react with the reactive group J to form a link which is part of the polymer backbone, PAL the molar ratio of (i) to (ii) being at least 2, thus making a TPE of the ABA, A.sub.n B or (AB).sub.n type; or II. reacting together (i) a B block precursor which is the B block containing at least two reactive groups L, which may be the same or different, and (ii) (a) a monomeric component comprising at least one monomer which will react with the group L and with itself or with a reactive group resulting from reaction of the monomeric. component with the B block precursor, optionally with the aid of an initiator, to form the A block, or (b) an A block precursor which is the A block containing at least one reactive group M which will react with the group L to form the A block; or III. reacting together (i) an A block precursor which is the A block terminated by a reactive group N, and (ii) a monomeric component comprising at least one monomer which will react with the group N and with itself to form the B block with at least two A blocks pendant from the polymeric backbone of the soft block; PAL or IV. performing a living polymerization in which the monomers for the A and B blocks are polymerized separately and sequentially, using an initiator so that the growing polymer chain has a terminal group which reacts with the monomer present at that time and in turn produces a reactive terminal group on the residue of the monomer which has reacted with the growing polymer chain. In all of these reactions, other ingredients may be present in order to modify the properties of the product, for example initiators, chain transfer agents and monomers which may be chemically or physically incorporated into the resulting TPE. Third Aspect--Compositions, Shaped Articles and Assemblies Comprising the Novel TPE In a third aspect, this invention provides a composition, shaped article or assembly which comprises a novel TPE as defined above and a second component which is mixed with the TPE, or which is surrounded (e.g. encapsulated) by the TPE, or which contacts (e.g. surrounds or otherwise provides a substrate for) the TPE. In one embodiment, this aspect of the invention is particularly valuable when the second component is a thermally responsive substance which undergoes a thermally induced change at a temperature T.sub.crit which is above the temperature at which the TPE can conveniently be melt processed. Because the novel TPE's can be melt-processed at temperatures close to T.sub.q, generally below (T.sub.q +60).degree. C., often below (T.sub.q +40).degree. C., and even lower, they are superior to conventional TPE's which are usually melt processed at temperatures well above their melting point. T.sub.crit is preferably above (T.sub.q +10).degree. C., e.g. (T.sub.q +10).degree. C. to (T.sub.q +40).degree. C. or (T.sub.q +60).degree. C. In another embodiment, this aspect of the invention is particularly valuable when the second component is intimately mixed with the TPE and is a crystalline polymeric additive, preferably an SCC polymer, which (a) has a first order transition point T.sub.a in the composition of 23.degree. to 120.degree. C., preferably 30.degree. to 60.degree. C., and (b) has a heat of fusion of at least 5 Joules/g, preferably at least 20 Joules/g. PAL The presence of the crystalline additive can substantially improve the shear value of the composition. This is particularly useful when the composition is to be used as a PSA, for which purpose the composition may also contain an amorphous polymer, e.g. a conventional PSA, as well as other conventional ingredients of PSA's. Fourth Aspect--Making Shaped Articles of the Third Aspect of the Invention In a fourth aspect, this invention provides a process for making a shaped article, which process comprises (A) melting a novel TPE as defined above, (B) dispersing an additive in the molten TPE, (C) shaping the dispersion from step B, and (D) cooling the shaped article from step C to a temperature below T.sub.q.

The heat may be conveyed to the TPE by convection, conduction or radiation, but is preferably conveyed by means of a stream of heated fluid, e.g. heated air or a body fluid, which also assists in removal of the second component from the TPE. Sixth Aspect--PSA's and PSA Composites Comprising TPE's Containing SCC Blocks, and Methods of Using Them In a sixth aspect, this invention provides a composition which is suitable for use as (or in the production of) a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) and which comprises a TPE in which the A blocks, or the B blocks, or both, are SCC blocks.

In this aspect, the invention includes also PSA composites comprising a backing having a coating thereon of such a composition, particularly PSA-coated articles for use in the medical field, for example an assembly which comprises (i) a flexible backing, (ii) a solvent-free layer of a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) which is secured to the backing, and which comprises a TPE or is at least partially covered by a layer comprising a TPE, said TPE comprising polymeric molecules which comprise (i) polymeric A blocks which (a) are crystalline and have a melting point T.sub.q, or (b) are amorphous and have a glass transition point T.sub.gh ; (ii) at least one polymeric B block which is linked to at least two A blocks and which (a) is crystalline and has a melting point T.sub.ms which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C. or less than (T.sub.gh -10).degree. C. or (b) is amorphous and has a glass transition point T.sub.gs which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C. or less than (T.sub.gh -10).degree. C. PAL wherein at least one block selected from the A and B blocks comprises a side chain comprising crystallizable moieties which render the block crystalline. This aspect of the invention also includes processes for preparing assemblies by joining articles together using such a composition; and processes for disassembling such assemblies which include heating the PSA to weaken it. These PSA's, PSA composites, assemblies, and processes preferably have the functional characteristics set out in the Schmitt et al. applications incorporated by reference herein, which also discloses amorphous base resins, crystalline polymer additives, methods of formulating PSA's, methods of applying PSA's to backings, backings, and methods of using PSA composites, which are generally suitable for use in this aspect of the invention. Seventh Aspect--Heat-Sealed Assemblies Comprising Articles Comprising TPE's Containing SCC Blocks In a seventh aspect, this invention provides a film or other article which comprises a TPE in which the A blocks, or the B blocks, or both, are SCC blocks, particularly an article which is suitable for use as a component of a food package and/or in a method which requires heat-sealing the film. These films preferably have the functional characteristics set out in Stewart Ser. No. 07/885,915 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,654 incorporated by reference herein, which also discloses food packages, and methods of packaging and storing foodstuffs, suitable for use in this aspect of the invention. One assembly according to this aspect of the invention comprises (1) a first film which comprises a TPE comprising polymeric molecules which comprise (i) polymeric A blocks which (a) are crystalline and have a melting point T.sub.q, or (b) are amorphous and have a glass transition point T.sub.gh ; (ii) at least one polymeric B block which is linked to at least two A blocks and which (a) is crystalline and has a melting point T.sub.ms which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree.

4521239,Coating agent for particulate materials,1982-11-29,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of providing particulate materials with a protective coating. More particularly, the invention relates to the coating of particulate fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate with the reaction product of an amine and a siloxane. 2. Description of the Prior Art In the past diatomaceous earth (DE) and treated clays have been used as a coating/conditioning agent for particulate fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate. However, for several reasons, diatomaceous earth is becoming increasingly unacceptable as a protective coating material for fertilizers. One reason is that the quality of diatomaceous earth, per se, has been declining as the better grades of the earth have been removed by mining. The inferior grades of DE have resulted in coatings which do not meet the stringent physical and chemical requirements for acceptable DE coatings. Storage and handling problems have resulted because of the inferior grades of DE which are being used. Another disadvantage of using diatomaceous earth and clays is that there is always the undesirable problem of dust generation in the handling of diatomaceous earth since it is a relatively dry, small particle size solid. Usually, from about 1-1.5% by weight of DE is coated on ammonium nitrate particles. Not all of the DE, however, adheres to the fertilizer particles. This fact results in serious problems for ammonium nitrate manufacturing plants which are the likes of additional equipment maintenance, extra clean-up costs and the like. Moreover, there are serious customer handling problems involved with DE coated ammonium nitrate. Yet another problem with diatomaceous earth is that the costs of agricultural grade diatomaceous earth have sharply increased over the past few years as the available supplies have decreased as a result of the diversion of supplies to other markets. Because diatomaceous earth suppliers no longer need the agricultural market as a consumer of their product, ammonium nitrate producers are placed in an increasingly more vulnerable and expensive position. A need, therefore, exists for a satisfactory replacement for diatomaceous earth as a fertilizer coating agent. Various types of fertilizers have been coated with different materials in the past to produce a product of improved stability. Urea is usually coated with kaolin clay or is treated with formaldehyde to alleviate caking. However, kaolin, because of its very small particle size, is dusty. On the other hand, formaldehyde treatment of urea does not yield a completely satisfactory product. Phosphate based fertilizers such as ammonium phosphate, superphosphate, homogeneous N-P-K fertilizers and the like, which when dried to very low water contents to reduce their caking tendencies, become quite dusty when handled. Fuel oil is frequently used as a surface coating material in order to suppress dust generation. While fuel oil exhibits some dust suppressing activity, it is not fully effective in this role, and is not a good use for an energy yielding substance. Organic materials have been used in the past as coating materials for particulate fertilizers. Thus, Choi in U.S. Pat. No. 4,259,102 discloses a heterocyclic polymer which can be used as a fertilizer coating agent. Iwao, U.S. Pat. No. 3,660,070, shows the use of high molecular weight polymers of the vinyl and acrylate type as a coating agent. U.S. Pat. No. 3,388,990 provides a very similar type of disclosure. Passmore, U.S. Pat. No. 3,544,297, shows polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and polyacrylonitrile as coating materials. Haruhiro, U.S. Pat. No. 3,475,154 discloses fertilizer particles coated with a multi-layered coating of a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin in order to provide a low water-soluble fertilizer. None of the above-discussed references provide any disclosure of either of the ingredients used in the coating agent of the present invention. Hansen in U.S. Pat. No. 3,223,518 discloses a technique of providing a slow-release fertilizer by providing a particulate fertilizer substrate with a multi-layer coating, the outer layer being of a hydrophobic material. The reference further discloses the use of a primer coating which may be any substance selected from an extremely broad group of organic compounds. Hansen also describes that a major characteristic of the fertilizer product is its water durability which is characterized by solids which remain in the shell-like water-insoluble exterior coatings. Any fertilizer product which does not exhibit this characteristic, which includes the product of the present invention, presumably is outside the scope of the reference. Moreover, the fertilizer product of the present invention is not a slow-release multi-layer coated product having a hydrophobic exterior coating. Still further, the product of the reference possesses a large amount of coating material, i.e., about 7% by weight, while the amount of coating material applied to the present product is in most cases less than 0.1% by weight. Bradley in U.S. Pat. No. 3,951,638, discloses a prilling process which at one point uses an organosilicon compound to prevent dust pick-up by fertilizer particles. Accordingly, the reference does not show the coating of fertilizer particles with an organic material. Assuming that the dust is an inert material, the organic material would seem to serve as a moisture barrier, which is a teaching contrary to the present invention. Hijfte in U.S. Pat. No. 4,150,965 discloses the use of an alkylamine-mineral oil combination as a coating agent for ammonium nitrate fertilizer. The reference discloses a three-step coating process, while the present process is usually a one-step coating procedure. In the reference process an ammonium nitrate containing fertilizer is treated with the alkylamine while relatively hot, i.e., at least 5.degree. C. above the melting point of the amine or mixture containing the amine. In fact, the reference discloses that prills at 50.degree. C. cannot be coated satisfactorily, while in the present invention, on the other hand, superior coatings for ammonium nitrate can be achieved at temperatures less than 38.degree. C. Another disclosure in the reference which is contrary to the present invention is that unadulterated alkylamine must be added to the fertilizer in the first process step. That is, the amine cannot be premixed with another compound if acceptable results are to be obtained. In the present process, an amine is, in fact, premixed with another reagent, i.e., a silicone fluid, before application to the fertilizer particles. Another difference between the reference disclosure and the present invention is that the reference does not disclose the coating procedure to be effective on fertilizers which do not contain a diluent. The working examples of the reference disclose fertilizers which contain a diluent. A need, therefore, continues to exist for a technique of providing particulate fertilizers, particularly ammonium nitrate, with an improved coating material. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a protective coating for fertilizer particles which suppresses dusting, minimizes caking of the fertilizer particles and prill breakdown and makes handling of particulate fertilizer much easier. Briefly, this object and other objects of the present invention as hereinafter will become more readily apparent can be attained by a particulate substrate provided with a protective coating of the reaction product of at least one amine compound and a siloxane. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the particulate substrate is prilled ammonium nitrate fertilizer."
5004026,Felling head,1989-10-06,0,1,"This invention is directed toward an improved tree felling head. The invention is more particularly directed towards an improved tree felling head of the type that accumulates cut trees. The invention is also directed toward a method of cutting and accumulating trees with the improved felling head. Felling heads for cutting trees are well known as are felling heads that both cut and accumulate trees. One type of felling head employs means to tightly grip the tree to be cut. While the tree is tightly gripped, cutting means on the head are moved and operated to cut through the gripped tree. The gripping means then release the cut tree. Grapple means may be provided on the felling head to accumulate one or more released cut trees while cutting continues. Cutting through tightly gripped trees can result in the butt end of the tree splintering as the cut nears completion. This is due to the tree occasionally being highly stressed when tightly gripped by the felling head. A tree with a splintered butt end is not as valuable as an unpslintered tree. One way to minimize splintering of the butt ends is to cut the trees without tightly gripping them. It is known to provide felling heads that cut free standing trees. This type of felling head has a fixed cutting means, usually a large circular saw, with a butt plate over a portion of the saw. The felling head is moved to have the saw cut the free standing tree which then rests on the butt plate. Grapple means are provided on the felling head to accumulate one or more cut trees off the butt plate while cutting continues. Often however, the just cut tree on the butt plate is unstable and it can fall of the felling head before it is trapped by the accumulating arms. The problems associated with splintering in cut trees, and with tree loss off the felling head, can be minimized by improving the handling of the trees by the felling head. It is therefore the purpose of the present invention to provide an improved tree felling head having improved tree handling means. It is more particularly a purpose of the present invention to provide an improved tree felling head with improved tree handling means that minimize splintering in cut trees. It is also more particularly another purpose of the present invention to provide an improved tree felling head with improved tree handling means that minimizes both splintering in cut trees and loss of cut trees off the felling head. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a felling head with cradle means for loosely receiving a tree and with retaining means on the felling head for loosely retaining the tree in the cradle means. In one embodiment of the invention, the felling head employs movable cutting means. The felling head is manoeuvred to place the standing tree to be cut within the cradles and the retaining means is operated to loosely retain the standing tree within the cradles while the cutting means is operated and moved to cut through the tree. The loosely retained tree is free to have some movement while being cut and therefore is not as likely to splinter as a tree that is cut while tightly held. Preferably, the felling head is provided with grapple means to accumulate one or more cut trees while still being able to loosely retain the next tree being cut. In another embodiment of the invention, the felling head employs a fixed cutting means. A butt plate is provided on top of a portion of the cutting means. The felling head is manoeuvred to have the cutting means cut through a free standing tree. The cut tree ends up on the butt plate within cradle means provided on the felling head. The retaining means on the felling head are immediately operated at the conclusion of cutting to loosely retain the cut tree on the butt plate and within the cradles to prevent it from falling off the felling head. The felling head is provided with grapple means to accumulate one or more cut trees while still being able to loosely retain the next cut tree. The invention is particularly directed toward a tree felling head having a frame with tree cutting means at the bottom of the frame. Vertically spaced-apart cradles are provided on the frame for loosely receiving a tree therein. Retaining means are provided on the frame between the cradles for loosely retaining a tree within the cradles. Means are also provided on the frame for supporting a cut tree by its butt end while retained in the cradles. Preferably, the felling head includes grapple means on the frame between the cradles to accumulate cut trees against the cradles in the frame. In one embodiment, means are provided for movably mounting the tree cutting means on the frame to cut through a free-standing tree that is positioned within the cradles by manoeuvring the felling head. The movable tree cutting means support the cut tree by its butt end while it is loosely retained in the cradles. In another embodiment, the tree cutting means are fixed on the frame, and the felling head is manoeuvred to have the fixed cutting means cut through a free standing tree. The cut tree support means comprise a butt plate covering a portion of the tree cutting means. The invention is also directed toward a method for falling trees using a felling head which comprises: positioned the felling head to locate a standing tree within vertically spaced-apart tree cradles on the felling head; moving retaining means to a closed position to loosely retain the standing tree within the cradles; and cutting the standing tree while loosely retained within the cradles. The invention is further directed toward a method for felling trees using a felling head which comprises; manoeuvring the felling head to have a fixed cutting means on the head cut through a free standing tree, the cut tree resting on a butt plate and within tree receiving cradles on the felling head; and moving retaining means to a closed position to loosely retain the cut tree on the butt plate and within the cradle means. The methods preferably include the step of tightly gripping the cut tree against the cradles with grapple means to hold the cut tree while moving the head to the next standing tree to be cut."

No. 4,564,504 to Sorber, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, discloses an early process (the “Sorber process”) that used water, ammonia, and sulfuric acid to produce a novel acid. The Sorber process involved a vat mixing batch process where sulfuric acid is slowly mixed to an aqueous ammonium solution. The Sorber process was performed in open vats and was dangerous due to the extremely exothermic nature of the reactions involved. The Sorber process may be termed a “cold process” as the mixing was slowed down to avoid excess heat generation and/or explosions from occurring.

6299663,Granulation method and apparatus therefor,1998-05-11,0,1,"The present invention is directed to a series of products formed by a pan granulation method for forming granules and more particularly, the present invention is directed to an improved fertilizer granule as well as additional granules. Generally speaking, pan granulation has been proposed in the art many times previously and with significant variations. One of the latest issued patents in the art to which the present invention relates is U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,765, issued to Derdall et al., Oct. 24, 1995. The reference teaches a process for pan granulating a particulate material. Based on the teachings of the Derdall et al. reference, a final particle size distribution that is achievable by practicing the invention is between about -5 mesh to about +10 mesh. In order to initiate the process, the Derdall et al. process is limited to the introduction of a seeding material typically between about -14 mesh and +28 mesh. This is required in order to control the granule growth and as indicated in the Derdall et al. disclosure, seed minimizes mutual agglomeration and results in high yields being obtained. The Derdall et al. reference further indicates that the proper sizing of the seed is fundamental to the operation of the process for granulation in order to have product yields exceed 90%. Reference is made in the disclosure that a seed core in the range of -14 mesh to +35 mesh is required in order to achieve a steady state and maintain uniform size distribution of between -8 mesh to +6 mesh. One of the greatest limitations existing in the granulation art is centered on the fact that known processes require a seeding agent in order to achieve the proper conditions for material accretion to result in a pellet or granule. By making use of a seed, the resulting granule is adversely affected in two key properties; roundness and cross-sectional uniformity. Typically, seeding material is not round and as the precursor particle, the result is irregular initial feedstock accretion which, in turn, forms an out-of-round particle upon which further material accretes. A further detriment from this results in terms of nonuniform particle density. Methodology is required for synthesizing a granule in the absence of seed material and which is round, tightly packed with a uniform homogeneous cross-section and capable of eliminating hazards associated with fertilizer granule production. The Derdall et al. process, although a meritorious procedure, did not recognize the limitations of employing a seeding agent or the need for controlling the dust generated during granulation which not only creates an unhealthy environment for workers, but more seriously, results in a potentially explosive environment. This is evident from the teachings of Derdall et al., particularly at column 3, beginning at line 24, wherein it is stated: """"It may be more difficult to keep the granulation steady or stable with fine seed, such as -35 mesh."""" The difficulty to which the Derdall et al. disclosure alludes is directed to cycling which is an inherent problem with pan granulation processes. If the size distribution of the seeding agent is not constant, then the process will not stabilize and effectively """"cycles"""" as is known to those skilled in this art. The result of this is that larger formed granules on the pan effectively destroy the smaller particles. This, of course, defeats the purpose of the pan granulation to generate particles. Furthermore, at line 36 in column 3, the disclosure indicates that: """"Fine seed sizes can be used, such as +35 mesh, but a point is reached where over-seeding or nucleation occurs easily and causes the final product yield to drop down."""" It is also indicated at column 3, beginning at line 45 that: """"Seed material in the range of 20 mesh is the best single point for each of control and uniformity of product size distribution . . . """" As is known, the larger the mesh numerical value the smaller the micron size of the respond to the stated micron sizes: Approximate Mesh Size Micron Size 12 1680 16 1190 20 840 30 590 40 420 100 149 200 74 Based on the teachings of the Derdall et al. disclosure, mesh sizes greater than +35 cause potential nucleation problems and result in a final product yield to decrease. With the technology disclosed infra, it has been found that by using a fine powder of between -35 mesh to +150 mesh, that a superior quality product can be formed in a high yield and typically in the range of greater than 90% yield. When the above passage regarding Derdall et al. is considered, it is clear that Derdall et al. effectively contradict what the technology set forth herein has found to be particularly successful. In the present application the size distribution of the nucleating material is between -35 mesh and +150 mesh which corresponds to micron size less than 590 .mu.m and 105 .mu.m, respectively. Nowhere in the prior is a powdered nucleating agent in this size distribution disclosed for purpose of forming a uniform granule in the size distribution of, for example, 3 mesh to about 10 mesh. Advantages have been ascribed to this process and one of the most attracttive advantages is that the granule or pellet has an enormous break strenght and a uniform cross-section, It has been found by practicing the present invention, that break strenghts in the range of 1 to 4 kg or greater have been achieved. In the Derdall et al. disclosure, at column 3, beginning at line 33 it is stated: """"Seed of large size forms granules of very poor strength."""" If one considers these teachings in light of the size of the nucleating agent provided herein, the admissions made in the Derdall et al. disclosure would clearly go against the appeal of using a seeding agent in the size range as clearly taught by Derdall et al. The instruction in Derdall et al. indicates an ideal seeding agent size is 20 mesh (supra); the instant application uses a powder having a particle size between 75-750% smaller than Derdall et al. and yet achieve very desirable results. In Statutory Invention Registration H1070, authored by Harrison et al., Jul. 7, 1992, a method for granulating potash materials is disclosed. The process involves the conversion of particulate potassium sulfate or potassium chloride by agglomeration using a conventional rotary drum granulator, pan granulator or other conventional granulating device. In the disclosure of this document, there are no specific teachings regarding the elimination of a seeding agent, feedstock size or other important factors related to process control in order to generate superior quality granules having commercial viability. Further, the process clearly is an agglomeration process. It is known that agglomeration typically involves the aggregation of colloidal particles suspended in a liquid into clusters or flocs. These clusters or flocs have varying degrees of interstice and are loosely bound (Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, eleventh edition, 1987). It would be desirable if it were possible to achieve a high yield granular product within specified mesh sizes which does not require the use of a seed in the process. The present invention is directed to satisfying the limitations in the art and more particularly those limitations in the Derdall et al. reference. One object of the present invention is to provide a granulated homogeneous fertilizer product having a uniform cross-section devoid of a seeding agent and having a break strength of at least two kilograms in a size distribution of 3 mesh to 10 mesh. A further object of the present invention is to provide a granule made in accordance with a method comprising the steps of: providing an initial feedstock having a uniform size distribution of about 99.9% particle size of -150 mesh and of said 99.9% particle size of -150 mesh about 90% comprising a particle size of -200 mesh; providing a nucleating material in a size distribution of 35 mesh to 150 mesh; providing a binder solution; contacting the binder and the feedstock in a pan granulator; and forming fertilizer granules directly in the pan granulator in the absence of a seeding agent. Advantageously, it has been found that the granulation process can be achieved in the absence of any seed material to result in a high yield product with high break strength in a single pan granulator. As an alternative the product may be formed in a two-stage method where an intermediate sized granule can be produced that is predominantly -8 mesh to +20 mesh in a first stage. This product can then be dried and screened such that the -8 to +20 portion of granules is used as a feed to the second stage. In the second stage, the -8 to +20 mesh portion may be added to a second stage granulator pan where suitable binder is added to grow the small balls into uniform sized +8 to -4 mesh granules or balls which are then dried in a dryer. The so-dried product may be then screened on -8 to +4 mesh to produce a new product in the form of a premium granular fertilizer, for example, break strength of greater than 1.0 kilograms (kg) with 3 to 4 kilograms (kg) being typical. The -8 to +20 mesh portion leaving the dryer may be recovered and recycled to the second stage pan. The +4 mesh and the -20 mesh portions may be sent to a suitable pulverizer for recycling. It has been found that the nucleation center in the size range of -35 mesh to +150 mesh may be employed as a basis for granule growth and further, that the nucleation center may comprise any suitable material known to those skilled in the art. As is known from prior art granules, the presence of a core, i.e. a seed significantly affects the quality of the final product. Since the seed is relatively large (14 mesh), such materials are often irregularly shaped which, in turn, leads to irregular feedstock accretion. This leaves the final product aspherical, loosely packed and with an irregular nonuniform cross-sectional appearance. By making use of a nucleating material which is a dust relative to the core arrangements in the prior art, the above limitations are circumvented. This feature has dramatic consequences in terms of cost savings as well as providing the user with the capacity to """"shell"""" or """"onion-skin"""" nucleation center with additional materials which may be similar or different from one another. This degree of freedom is obviously favorable, since multiple component homogenous granules can be readily produced. As an example, and without being limiting, the process is applicable to granule formation where the granule includes a base fertilizer material which may be surrounded by a coating having limited solubility in order that the fertilizer be a time release type compound. As a further example, the process is particularly well suited to the formation of novel water softener balls or granules for use in water softening systems. Additionally, specialty fertilizer grades may be easily formed using the process according to the present invention. Utility for the process can be realized for a plethora of particle types. As a further option, the process has applicability in other fields such as the preparation of ice melt product. As an example, for the formation of the sodium chloride granules, the process, according to one embodiment of the invention, permits the addition of Mg or CaCl2 to the sodium chloride to enhance the ice melt characteristics and make a more efficient ice melt product. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a host of additional examples may be achievable depending on the particular end use. In accordance with the further desirable features of the present invention, the provision of a plurality of pan granulators permits full control and customization of the granule characteristics. By using one or a plurality of pan granulators when the process steps are observed, the result is that the granule can be uniformly grown under stabilized conditions without continual cycling as is the limitation in the prior art where only a single pan is disclosed for use. By employing the process parameters and apparatus according to the present invention, progressive accretion of the material on the granule is possible to result in a high density packed pellet with extremely high break strength, solid, uniform cross-section and a user predetermined size. Significant additional advantages can be realized by the technology set forth herein including: i) an enhanced market value of the formed product; ii) the formation of a more user friendly product; iii) significantly improved product handleability; iv) a significantly improved uniformity index: v) no product loss or waste. vi) uniform cross-section; vii) tightly packed feedstock; viii) absence of a seed or crystal core; ix) increased break strength relative to the prior art; x) material homogeneity throughout the granule; and xi) greater quantity of feedstock material per granule The process and apparatus contribute to achieve a greater than 90% recovery of product which is on specification (spec) in the desired size range. Of the remaining 10% of the product, the same may be simply reintroduced into the pulverizer to create fines for reintroduction into the system. Accordingly, it will be readily apparent to those skilled that the process may be not only particularly useful for the user but further, results in monetary and energy savings from 100% use of the product. In view of the elegance of the technology set forth herein, the result is that the apparatus and method may be applied in a retrofit application to existing systems which cannot achieve the level of efficiency attributed to the present technology set forth in the present case; existing systems may be significantly improved by simply adding the apparatus of the present invention and the method disclosed herein to improve such systems. This is a further advantage of the present invention in that the method is interruptible and does not require any specific parameters in terms of temperature, etc. in order to operate efficiently. In this manner, the pan granulators, employed in the present invention, may be arranged in any number of ways, i.e. in series, parallel, towered, etc., and may include any number of compounds to apply any number of layers on a granule as the same is grown through the system. Having thus described the invention, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawing illustrating preferred embodiments."
8354852,Wireless soil sensor utilizing a RF frequency for performing soil measurements,2010-01-31,0,1,"STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is related to a wireless sub-surface sensor having a radio for performing real-time soil measurements. 2. Description of the Related Art The prior art discusses other irrigation systems and methods. Closing an underground to above ground RF communication link is a challenging task. The challenge is typically due to difficult propagation conditions perpetrated by high water content as well as high conductivity in the soil. The moisture and conductivity vary over time depending on environmental stimulus. High water content increases the rate of absorption of RF energy. Salinity and moisture both change the die-electric constant of the soil, effectively detuning the antenna element as water content changes over time. In instances, it is possible to adaptively modify the antenna tuning elements, to attempt to tune the antenna to the current state of the soil. However, in some instances it may not be possible to overcome the adverse effects of moisture in the ground by direct tuning of the RF and antenna components on board the underground wireless sensor. In other instances, certain wireless sensing devices may not be able to adapt their tuning in close to real time to match the soil conditions. The Present Invention seeks to resolve the problems of the prior art. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a solution to the problems of the prior art. The inventors of the present invention noticed the dielectric of soil, and how it changes with moisture and salinity, which led them to believe that a radiofrequency (“RF”) antenna of a wireless sub-surface soil sensor may be able to be tuned based on moisture and salinity measurements. The inventors measured soil moisture and salinity using novel sensors which also provided the electrical properties of the soil in which the wireless sub-surface soil sensor was placed. These electrical properties affect the efficient transmission and range of an antenna. The inventors realized that an antenna could be configured to optimize transmission efficiency and boost range. Components added to the antenna circuitry controlled by the processor allow for the antenna to be tuned based on the electrical properties of the soil. RF impedances (complex resistances) are often characterized on a two dimensional SMITH® Chart. A discussion of SMITH® Charts is set forth in Designing Impedance Matching Networks With the HP 8751 A , Hewlett-Packard Company, 1990, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Another discussion of SMITH® Charts is set forth in Stephen D Stearns, Mysteries of the Smith Chart , Pacificon 2001, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The inventors noticed that if the antenna is tuned in a specific and novel manner, its impedance is shifted in an arc around the ideal match (about 50 ohms) as moisture levels in the soil changed. By characterizing the arc by a radius and angle, the inventors were able to tune the radius to remain nearly constant. Only the phase angle of the impedance changed. The inventors designed the physical antenna structure, board structure, housing (air space) and tuning elements to maintain a constant impedance magnitude. This became an automatic, adaptive RF tuning which improved antenna performance across a range of soil moisture levels. One aspect of the present invention is a wireless soil sensor comprising a main body having a sensing component, a removable sleeve positioned over the sensing component, a radio, a processor configured to utilize a RF frequency for performing soil moisture measurements. Another aspect of the present invention is a wireless soil sensor comprising a sensing component integrated directly with a radio and a microcontroller. The microcontroller is configured to utilize a RF frequency for performing soil moisture measurements. Another aspect of the present invention is a method for performing soil moisture measurements utilizing radiofrequency. The method includes transmitting a radiofrequency signal through a soil material at a set frequency and power. The method also includes measuring a signal strength for the radiofrequency signal received at a receiver. The method also includes comparing the signal strength to a table of signal strength correlated with moisture values for the soil material. The method also includes determining the soil moisture measurement from the table. The radiofrequency signal is preferably transmitted from a wireless sub-surface soil sensor to an above-ground receiver. Alternatively, the radiofrequency signal is transmitted from an above ground receiver to a wireless sub-surface soil sensor. The radiofrequency signal is preferably transmitted at a frequency of 2.4 GigaHertz. Another aspect of the present invention is a wireless soil sensor. The wireless soil sensor is preferably capable of measuring soil moisture, soil salinity and soil temperature, while buried beneath the surface and also capable of wirelessly transmitting the measurements to a receiver above the surface for eventual transmission to an engine for calculations and other outputs. The wireless soil sensor preferably has a tine sleeve for placement over a portion of the sensor. The sleeve is removed when the sensor is ready to be buried beneath the surface of the soil. The sensor preferably links to a controller, is preferably associated with a watering zone which is to be controlled by a controller. At least a portion of the sensor is preferably waterproof. The tine sleeve preferably has a small patch of exposed PCB conductor which is connected to another, which allows the sensor to assume it is in a hibernation state (for power savings, suppressed communications and suppressed emissions). Essentially, while the sensor has the tine sleeve attached, it is in an inactive state. The tine sleeve further protects the sensitive components of the sensor during shipment. Removal of the tine sleeve is an intuitive indication that the sensor is to be associated and buried. The sensor assumes a period of active communication so that a controller/interrupter can learn of its presence and prompt assignment to a watering zone or zones. After a set period of time, the sensor preferably assumes a normal sensing and broadcast mode. The tine sleeve further acts a physical receipt, allowing for marking with the date, position of installation and corresponding watering zones. The tine sleeve further provides the function of enabling safe transportation of the end-of-life or return for repair of the sensor to a factory or alternative site. The wireless sensor preferably infers moisture and salinity levels by measuring the dielectric constant of the surrounding soil. A radio antenna used to relay these measurements to a central controller is affected (de-tuned) by surrounding changes in the dielectric constant. The present invention can adaptively tune the antenna impedance match via RF switches and passive components based on moisture and salinity readings. This increases the communication range and reduces power consumption. A user interface for an irrigation interrupter preferably has a default display of 128 by 64 pixel. In a limited space, the display communicates a tremendous amount of information in an extremely intuitive way. Six columns for watering zones are used in the display. Each zone shows a moisture assessment of Ok, Wet, Dry, or Cold. Next to this is a visual indication of the moisture level in the zone, as reported by one or more sensors, adapted to a soil/plant type. A bar showing moisture level preferably has two marks indicating a lower level where no watering would be interrupted, an upper level indicating that all watering would be interrupted, and in the zone in between, a sensor for how much of the normal watering period will be allowed before a mid-flow cutoff attenuates watering. A bold OFF and ON indication blinks between the view and the underlying moisture status normally shown. The blinking behavior is set to occur when a zone input is active, and indicates the action being taken by the interrupter. Above the moisture indications is a row showing the control status of each zone—whether it is controlled by one or more sensors, or has been placed in manual ON or manual OFF. The user interface allows for determination of a manual mode with only a casual view of the user interface. The top line shows the system status (Auto, Bypass, Master, Slave) and the recent average of water saving, calculated by the percentage of time normally watering has been attenuated. Master and Slave are used to enable “chaining” of multiple interrupters together to control additional zones, preferably six at a time. At the bottom of the display, icons show whether one or more than one sensor is assigned per zone. A solid square is a sensor with no performance issues. A hollow square indicates low battery. A triangle indicates RF reception issues. A hollow triangle represents RF reception and battery issues. In such conditions, where information about soil moisture and salinity conditions at the time of attempted transmission is available to the wireless sensor, for example when there are on board moisture and conductivity sensor present, the wireless transmitter will perform a simple computation to determine whether its transmission will be successful given the network activity history and the soil moisture and conductivity levels. The wireless sensor will track the moisture and conductivity levels, and based on those levels will adjust its transmission attempts. The impact of this decision making is that it will predict when the transmission will fail, and thus refrain from transmitting. This adaptive adjustment of the transmission schedule will help conservation battery life for battery operated sensor nodes. This adaptive schedule will be effective for one way as well as two way communication links. However its impact will be most evident for two-way over the air protocols. It is an object of the present invention to provide a proprietary wireless root zone intelligence system that measures real time soil moisture, temperature and salinity. It is an object of the present invention to provide an advanced wireless sensor and analytical, intuitive, fully interactive software. It is an object of the present invention to optimize turf health and playability, improve product quality, optimize resource utilization. Having briefly described the present invention, the above and further objects, features and advantages thereof will be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings."

No. 12/427,051 entitled “A Method for Providing an Application to Plants”; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,059 entitled “Horticultural Knowledge Base for Managing Yards and Gardens”; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,043 entitled “System and Method for Managing Resource Use”; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,065, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,028,470, entitled “Robotic Watering Unit” all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention relates generally to an irrigation control system and, more particularly, to a system and method for managing resource use in yards and gardens. Horticulture is the industry and science of plant cultivation. Horticulturists work and conduct research in the disciplines of plant propagation and cultivation, crop production, plant breeding and genetic engineering, plant biochemistry, and plant physiology. The work particularly involves fruits, berries, nuts, vegetables, flowers, trees, shrubs, and turf. Horticulturists work to improve crop yield, quality, nutritional value, and resistance to insects, diseases, and environmental stresses. One aspect of horticultural management is irrigation. Irrigation is typically used to water large, homogeneous areas such as fields, lawns, and gardens. The water is assumed to be available from a single source, such as a well, canal, or municipal water system. Water from municipal water systems are often stressed during times of heat and drought, and watering restrictions are frequently implemented to provide adequate water for higher priority uses. These restrictions may start as odd-even day lawn watering and progress to complete bans on lawn watering, and finally to complete bans on garden watering. The fields and lawns typically have a single species of plant and water application is based on water sensors, evapotranspiration models, or rules. This type of irrigation system can be inadequate for yards and gardens where numerous species are growing in close proximity, particularly large water users like trees and shrubs in proximity to lesser water users. Trees, shrubs, and structures also provide shade, which impacts evapotranspiration, which is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration. An embodiment of the present invention provides a computer program product comprising a computer recordable media having computer usable program code. Resource needs are determined for each plant in a plurality of plants to form individual resource needs. Conditions are identified in an environment in which the plurality of plants are located by receiving input from a sensor system to form current conditions. A plurality of per plant prescriptions are calculated for the plurality of plants using the individual resource needs and the current conditions. The application of the resource is controlled from a mobile utility vehicle to each plant in the plurality of plants using the plurality of per plant prescriptions. The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present invention or may be combined in yet other embodiments in which further details can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings."

8260465,Data communication in a multi-wire irrigation control system,2009-07-17,1,0,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation devices, and more particularly to the communication of data using an alternating power signal to be supplied to irrigation devices. 2. Discussion of the Related Art Typical irrigation control systems cooperate with water valves and pumps to control the flow of irrigation water through a variety of water dispensing devices, including sprinklers, rotors, drip-lines, and other water delivery devices. These control systems are used in a wide variety of irrigation applications, from residential and commercial landscapes to golf course and agricultural irrigation. Many irrigation systems and electronics are powered by 50/60 Hz AC voltage signals. Some systems further modulate this power source to provide data communication, for example, by selectively clipping the positive half of the AC voltage signal. Data and power sent in this manner are often over a two-wire transmission line and are often referred to as a two-wire interface. Irrigation devices variously located in the field couple to the two-wire interface and derive their operational power therefrom. The irrigation devices demodulate the data monitoring the received power signal for a missing negative half of a cycle, then taking eight voltage samples at a predetermined time thereafter during the positive half to detect whether the signal is clipped or unclipped. Such systems are well known in the art and described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,395 to Evelyn-Veere. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for providing power and data to an irrigation device. The method includes modulating data onto an alternating power signal by distorting an amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, permitting effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and applying the alternating power signal to a multi-wire interface configured to couple with a plurality of irrigation devices. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system. The method includes receiving an alternating power signal comprising cycles each having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and demodulating data represented by the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device having a modulator configured to modulate data onto an alternating power signal by distorting amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, and permit effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal. The irrigation controller further includes an interface configured to couple the modulator to a multi-wire interface coupled to a plurality of irrigation devices to permit the alternating power signal to be applied to the multi-wire interface. In still yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation device having an input configured to receive an alternating power signal comprising cycles having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and a demodulator configured to provide data by demodulating the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In a further embodiment, the invention may be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system, the method comprising: receiving, at an irrigation device, an alternating power signal comprising cycles, where an amplitude of a portion of each cycle is selectively distorted to modulate data on the alternating power signal; determining a slope of the portion of each cycle; and demodulating the data based upon the determining the slope"
4921024,Method and apparatus to fell a tree,1989-10-16,1,0,"This invention relates to a method and apparatus to sever a standing tree from its base, specifically the invention relates to a circular saw and a saw guard mounted on a vehicle to sever a tree by advancing the saw toward the tree. Many devices have been developed for felling trees. Some of these devices have been incorporated into self propelled mechanisms by mounting the felling head on a vehicle. The one thing all of the machines have in common is that a mechanism is provided to sever the tree from its base. Large shears, reciprocating saw blades, various configurations of chain saw blades and circular saws all have been used with some success. Generally the devices which use circular saws have a guard or housing about the circular saw blade to protect the operator and other personnel from the saw blade. An opening is usually provided in the front portion of the guard to expose a portion of the saw blade for cutting the tree. This arrangement, however, limits the diameter of the tree which can be cut. One method to cut oversize trees was to partially cut the front side of a tree, drive the felling apparatus to the back of the tree and complete the severing from the backside of the tree. This method is time consuming and often is not practical because of the density of most woodlots. Kurelek, U.S. Pat. No. 4,446,897, recognized the mobility problem and mounted the circular saw and felling head on a boom which is attached to a vehicle. Kurelek also placed a second opening in the saw guard to allow the saw blade to cut on either side. The Kurelek apparatus was thus able to cut in a straight ahead mode or in a side-swing or scything mode. Although an improvement over the prior art the Kurelek patent has the disadvantage of leaving the second portion of the saw blade exposed and unprotected. Kurelek also does not address the problem of felling an oversize tree. The present invention thus overcomes the limitations and problems in the prior art. The present invention includes a felling head mounted on a vehicle. The felling head includes a frame having an upper portion and a lower portion. A bunching arm is attached to the upper portion of the frame and a circular saw is supported by the lower portion of the frame. A guard overlays the circular saw. The guard has a first or fixed portion attached to the frame and a second or movable portion hinged to the first portion. A means to move the second portion of the guard has its first end attached to the frame and its second end attached to the second portion of the guard. An opening is provided in the fixed portion of the guard to expose a first arcuate portion of the circular saw. The second portion of the guard, when raised, exposes a second arcuate portion of the circular saw. To sever a large tree, the guard is raised and the second arcuate portion of the circular saw is advanced in a first direction to cut a first side of the tree. The vehicle is reversed, bringing the circular saw out of engagement with the tree. The vehicle is then advanced in a second direction which is at an angle to the first direction bringing the first arcuate portion of the saw into cutting engagement with the second side of the tree to completely sever the tree. It is an object of the invention to provide a mobile apparatus to fell a tree, the apparatus having a circular saw mounted thereon which can fell a tree larger in diameter than the radius of the saw. It is a further object of the invention to provide a guard about the circular saw, the guard having a movable portion which can selectively either expose or overlay a portion of the circular saw. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof and from the attached drawings."
7294343,Biodegradable sorbents,2002-06-14,0,1,"The invention relates to a grain based material useful as a general sorbent. In some embodiments, the invention relates to the introduction of a material into an environment, the material being sorbed within the sorbent. These embodiments are particularly applicable to the introduction of a control agent, such as a mosquito larvicide, into an environment. In other embodiments, the invention relates to the removal of a material from an environment by sorbing the material within the sorbent. Many methods exist for removing an undesired material from an environment. For instance, numerous products are available commercially for removing spilled liquids from a surface. Some such products are used to remove oil from open water, such as when an oil spill has occurred. In this application, it is desirable to selectively remove oil from water. For such absorbents, efforts are sometimes made to increase the selectivity of oil over water. Currently available products for spill control include clay, kaolin, illite, bentonite, diatomite, hectorite, montmorillonite, attapulgite, silica, silica sand, polypropylene, sodium polyacrylate/polyacrylamides, vermiculite, gypsum, limestone, metal oxides, asphalt, fiberglass, diatomaceous earth, perlite and other materials. Such materials, while satisfactory in function, suffer from certain drawbacks. Many such products contain silica, which poses a hazard to humans. In addition, most such materials are not biodegradable, which is a factor that can limit the options for disposal of the used sorbent material. There are also several organic spill control products described in the art. Examples of such materials include natural fibers such as grass, pre-cooked cereal kernels, sawdust, cellulose, and peat. U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,881 purports to describe a cellulose based sorbent system, where the cellulose has been treated with an additive to render it both hydrophobic and oleophilic so it will selectively remove oil from water. U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,774 purports to describe the use of pre-cooked and puffed cereals for oil removal. Another document, U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,350, purports to disclose a particulate milled seed material in which the lipids have been removed through solvent extraction and wherein the material is designed to remove and disperse oil from open water and solid surfaces. The composition is a solvent-extracted proteinaceous material derived from grain products having oil sorptive properties. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,881 purports to describe the use of diatomaceous earth, clay, silica, corncob, peatmoss, perlite, polypropylene, sawdust, cellulose, polystyrene, vermiculite, peat and cork to absorb liquids. This composition is taught as a general absorbent; in this document, it is stated that materials that absorb both water and oil are undesirable. U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,937 purports to disclose the use of corn stalks, husks, cobs, and kernels as carriers. U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,323 purports to disclose the use of delignified waste from hulls, straw, stover, and shells as a carrier. Other carriers are purportedly disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,383,609 and 6,391,120. Generally, other biodegradable materials such as peat moss, sawdust, hair, feathers, cotton, cork, starch, bagasse, seeds, seed hulls, and other seed components have also been proposed. Many methods for introducing a material into an environment also are known. In many cases, it is desired to introduce the material in a delayed-release manner, by which is contemplated that at least some of the material is bound up with another material or otherwise is not immediately available to function in the environment for its intended purpose. For instance, it is often desired to introduce a control agent, i.e., a material that limits the growth or spread of a living thing, into an environment. Known control agents, such as insecticides, larvicides, rodenticides, fungicides, and so forth may be oil-based or water-based. It is desirable to provide a sorbent for such control agents, and in particular, it is desirable to provide a sorbent that allows delayed release of at least some control agents into an environment. Further, it is highly desirable to provide a sorbent that is useful in sorbing both oil- and water-based control agents. Typical control agents are provided in liquid or solid form. There are advantages and disadvantages to each product form. Liquid pesticides can be applied as a spray, which is advantages in some respect. Drift control of the spray can be a challenge, however, especially in an aerial broadcast application. Solid pesticide products are better at targeting an area for pest control, because there is less drift of the solid product. Pelleted or compacted compositions are typically used in solid pesticide products. The majority of such composition is composed of a carrier or absorbent material, and the active ingredient is usually a small percentage (<10%) of the pellet weight. Another advantage of a solid control agent composition is that the weight of the composition allows penetration into vegetative areas that are less accessible via a liquid spray. Heavier pellets often can penetrate through a tree canopy, whereas liquid droplets would tend to coat and contaminate the tree canopy. One drawback to many known solid pesticides products is that non-biodegradable carriers often are used in such products. These carriers can lead to contamination of the area of treatment. In recognition of this problem, numerous biodegradable carriers have been provided; examples include materials such as corncob, peanut hulls, and starches. Many known biodegradable carriers are unsatisfactory. In many cases, the resulting composition does not perform as well as a non-biodegradable product. In addition, many biodegradable materials such as corncob, peanut hulls, and starches do not disperse easily when in contact with water, leaving a contaminant residue. Corncob is especially poor in this regard, because it has low density as well as poor dispersibility in water. In addition, when a granular pesticide does not readily disintegrate in an aquatic environment, the active ingredient is not readily released and thus a less efficacious pest control product with residual contaminant pesticide activity is provided. In the case of mosquito larvicides, such materials ordinarily are released into standing or slowly moving water to destroy larvae growing in the water. It is particularly preferred that the carrier should release at least a portion of the larvicide within the topmost two feet of water in a standing or slowly moving water column, where most or all of the larvae are found. It is further preferred that the larvae in the water column be destroyed within 24 hours, and preferably within 8 hours of treatment. Although the prior art has provided numerous carriers for control agents, not all carriers allow for the preparation of a control agent composition that meets these preferred criteria. In a first preferred embodiment of the invention, it is a general object to provide a sorbent that is useful in conjunction with the introduction of a material into an environment. In a second preferred embodiment of the invention, it is a general object to provide a sorbent that is useful in conjunction with the removal of a material from an environment, the material being removed by sorption of the material into the sorbent and removal of the sorbed composition thus formed from the environment. THE INVENTION The invention provides a number of embodiments in which the sorbing properties of spent grain germ and seed meal are utilized. These organic, naturally derived sorbents, alone or in combination, can be used to introduce material into an environment, or to remove material from an environment. When such sorbent is used to introduce a material into an environment, the environment preferably is one in which the sorbent will biodegrade. In such instances, delayed release of the sorbed material into the environment often is possible. When the sorbent is used to remove material from an environment, the sorbed material composition can be allowed to biodegrade prior to ultimate disposal of the composition. Many of the disclosures in the prior art fail to address the fate of the sorbed composition formed upon removing a material from an environment. Generally, the volume of sorbent introduced into the environment is much greater than the volume of the liquid to be removed from the environment. Where the removed material is or contains a hazardous compound, the relatively large quantity of sorbent having the material sorbed therewithin must also be treated as a hazardous material, which can increase the ultimate disposal cost considerably. The sorbents useful in conjunction with the present invention can be biodegraded, thereby reducing the total volume of material that must be treated as hazardous. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a control agent composition is provided. The composition includes a sorbent, the sorbent being selected from the group consisting of spent grain germ, seed meal, and mixtures thereof, and a control agent sorbed within the sorbent. Most preferably, the composition is in the form of discrete plural pellets, by which is contemplated the product of a pelletizing operation in a pellet mill. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for limiting the growth of an undesired pest in an environment is provided. The method includes selecting a control agent for the pest, and introducing into the environment an amount of a control agent composition effective to limit the growth of the pest. The control agent composition includes a sorbent and control agent as described hereinabove. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for introducing a material into an environment is provided. A material for which delayed release into the environment is desirable is selected. Subsequently, a granular material composition that includes the selected material sorbed within a sorbent, the sorbent being spent grain germ, seed meal, or a mixture thereof, is introduced into the environment. The timing of the release of the material into the environment can be controlled to an extent by adjusting the integrity of the granules, whereby more durable granules generally will release the sorbed material more slowly than less durable granules. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for removing an unwanted material present in an environment is provided. The method includes selecting a sorbent for the material, introducing into the environment an amount of the sorbent effective to sorb at least a portion of the material, allowing at least some of the material to become sorbed to thereby formed a sorbed composition, and removing at least a portion of the sorbed composition from the environment. The sorbed material may be a combustible material, and, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a method for generating heat is provided, the method including providing a combustible material composition and oxidizing the combustible material composition. The combustible material composition includes a sorbent and a combustible material sorbed within the sorbent. Preferably, the combustible material is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight of the composition. The invention contemplates the use of a sorbent, by which is contemplated a material that absorbs and/or adsorbs another material. Generally, absorption is a term used in the art to refer to the penetration of one substance into the inner structure of another substance, whereas the term adsorption refer to adherence of atoms, ions, or molecules onto the surface of another material. It is believed that one or both phenomena occur in accordance with the various embodiments of the invention, but it is contemplated that the material may serve as a sorbent even if only one of the two phenomena is present. By “sorbed within” is herein contemplated the sorption of a material in or on the sorbent. The sorbent used in conjunction with the invention preferably is spent germ, which is a germ from which oil has been expelled, for instance, by pressing or extraction with an extracting liquid such as hexane or water. Spent grain germ material has numerous advantages, in that it is derived from natural, renewable resources, is biodegradable and safely incinerable, is nontoxic and safe for the environment, and is economical to produce and use. This material is able to sorb both hydrophilic and lipophilic liquids. The spent germ may be washed to render it substantially free of odor components. It is known that washing of the germ will remove substantially odor and flavor components, which may be an advantage in some instances. In other embodiments, unwashed germ may be used. Germ obtained from any suitable grain may be employed in conjunction with the invention. Grains such as corn, wheat, soy, sorghum, barley, and the like are particularly suitable for use in conjunction with the invention. The preferred sorbent is expeller-extruded corn germ. Virgin germ (i.e., germ from which oil has not been extracted) may also be used, whereby in the manufacture of the sorbent as described herein some or all oil present in the germ is extracted. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the sorbent used in conjunction with the invention may be a seed meal. Examples of such meals include linseed meal, soybean meal, sunflower meal, cottonseed meal, rapeseed meal, peanut meal, safflower seed meal, and combinations thereof. By “seed” is meant to include that part of a plant which is capable of forming a new plant upon germination, e.g., whole grains of wheat, including the fruit or fruit-like structure housing the seed. The seed meal comprises a spent oil bearing seed residue, which is a seed residue from which oil has been expelled, such as by solvent extraction or expeller extraction. The extracted residue then is ground, by which is contemplated the reduction of the residue to smaller particles, preferably to a semi-course to fine powder. It is contemplated that some seeds will include a hull that may (but need not) be removed prior to expelling oil and grinding. Thus, the meal may comprise a dehulled meal. The seed meal in some embodiments is washed to substantially remove odor components therefrom. The germ and seed meal component of the sorbent collectively should be present in the sorbent in an amount of at least 50% by dry basis weight of the sorbent. Preferably, the germ and meal are present in a greater amount, such as an amount of 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% by weight of the sorbent. Most preferably, the germ and meal collectively are present in an amount of 100% by dry basis weight of the sorbent, that is, the sorbent includes the meal and/or germ to the substantially or complete exclusion of other sorbents. With respect to one another, the germ and meal can be used in any ratio desired. For instance, expresses as a percentage, the ratio may be 100% meal, 90% meal, 80% meal, 70% meal, 60% meal, 50% meal, 40% meal, 30% meal, 20% meal, 10% meal, or 0% meal (i.e., 100% germ). Other sorbents, such as these described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,391,328, optionally may be used in conjunction with the sorbents described herein, but preferably, such other sorbents are not present. The sorbent may be used in conjunction with the introduction of a material into an environment. The environment can be any place, area, or region in which the introduction of the material is desired. Generally, the material is selected as being desirable for use in the environment. For instance, the material may be a control agent, by which is completed a material that limits the growth of unwanted pests in the environment. A control agent preferably is selected as being an agent that limits the growth of the pest, by which is contemplated checking the spread of the pest by killing, sterilizing, destroying eggs or otherwise limiting the growth of the pest. Control agents generally are toxic chemicals; in accordance with the invention, any control agent now known or otherwise found to be suitable for use in limiting the growth of a pest may be used. The pest may be present in the environment, or may not be present in the environment (in other words, it is contemplated that the environment may be treated prophylactically). The pest can be any organism whose presence in the environment is undesired. Any organism found in the Animalia, Protista, Fungi (in particular non-mold fungi), Plantae, or Monera kingdoms may be deemed a pest in particular circumstances, and the control agent may be any agent that limits the growth of such pest in the environment. With respect to animals, the pest may be mammal, for instance, a rodent such as a mouse or rat, or a non-mammal, such as a fish, bird or other animal. The invention is believed to be particularly applicable to the control of animals in the phylum Arthropoda, including especially the classes Insecta (representing insects, millipedes, and centipedes), and Cheliceramorpha, especially arachnids. The control agent in preferred embodiments may be a rodenticide, a herbicide, an insecticide, a fungicide, or a bactericide. Specific embodiments of the invention employ, for instance, a larvicide, a pupicide, an ovicide, a hormone, a growth regulator (e.g. an insect growth regulator), a biological control agent, a microbial control agent, a toxicant, a fumigant, a pheromone, a repellent, a chemosterilant, a miticide, an acarcide, a molluscicide, an avicide, a predicide, an algaecide, a nematicide, an amoebicide, a nymphicide, and the like. In preferred embodiments, the control agent is selected from among an animal control agent (which may be a control agent for any species in the kingdom Animalia), a plant control agent (any species which may be a control agent for any species in the kingdom Plantae), a non-mold fungal control agent (which may be a control agent for any species in the kingdom Fungi, excepting the molds), a protist control agent (which may be a control agent for any species in the kingdom Protista) or a monera control agent (which may be a bacterial species or any other species in the Monera kingdom). In some embodiments, the control agent may be a virus control agent. Two or more agents can be combined to increase efficacy or to achieve multifunctional performance in the same composition. Specific preferred examples of suitable control agents include insecticides such as temephos, chlorpyfifos, methyl isocyanate, methoprene, propaphos, DURSBAN® dimilin, malathien, carbaryl, and diazinon; herbicides such as 2,4-D and 2,4-D ester, ammonium sulfamate, BROMACIL®, copper salts, molinate, propanil, pyrazolate, metolachlor, and the like. Other control agents include bioactives such as Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus sphaericus ; flugicides, such as fenoxanil, iprobenfos, menopril, tricyclozole, and valdamycin, and the like. The invention is not limited to the foregoing, and indeed any material that functions as a control agent may be used in conjunction with the invention. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,911,952; 4,983,390; 5997,445; 6,159,489; 6,316,447; 6,335,027; and 6,340,656, all disclose numerous control agents, any or all which in certain embodiments may be deemed suitable for use in conjunction with the invention. The control agent or other material sorbed within the sorbent may be a lipophilic or oleogenous material, or may be a hydrophilic material or a combination thereof (such as an emulsion). The material may be present in any amount with respect to the sorbent suitable for the intended purpose of the sorbent/material composition. In some embodiments, the material is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight of the total composition, more preferably at least 7% by weight, and even more preferably, at 10% by weight. When the sorbed material is a control agent, the sorbed material preferably is present in an amount ranging from 0.001 to 50% by weight, more preferably, from 0.001 to 10% by weight, and even more preferably, from 0.005 to 5% by weight of the composition. In some embodiments, the sorbed material is present in an amount from 0.05 to 1%, or, within this range, from 0.05 to 0.5% by weight. More generally, any amount suitable for the intended purpose may be employed in conjunction with the invention. The composition optionally may include any other additives, which may be present in any amounts suitable for their intended purposes or omitted altogether. Examples of such additives include surfactants, spreading agents, adjuvants, other carriers, binders, deflocculating agents, dispersing agents, synergists, penetrants, suspending agents, baits, phagostimulants, sticking agents, stabilizers, coupling agents, foaming or antifoaming agents, diluents, waxes, oils, superabsorbents, and more generally, any other additives. The sorbents described herein are not limited to the introduction of a control agent into an environment. To the contrary, the sorbets can be used to introduce any desirable sorbable materials into an environment. It is contemplated that in some cases the sorbable material may be a solid material that is carried in or on the sorbent. In one embodiment of the invention, the sorbable material is a fertilizer. Any suitable material or synthetic fertilizer may be employed in conjunction with the invention. In one embodiment, the sorbable material is an animal nutrient, such a vitamin or mineral. These materials may be present in any amounts suitable for their intended purpose. The selection of specific ingredients, loading levels, and application rates may be made by one is skilled in the art. One embodiment of the invention encompasses a method for fertilizing an arable area by applying a fertilizer composition as described above. In another embodiment, the invention encompasses a method for providing nutrients to an animal, the method including feeding the animal an animal nutrient composition as described above. The animal may be for instance, a horse, a cow, a pig, a sheep, a bird, or even a human. The composition that includes the sorbent and sorbed material (including any additives) may be provided in any suitable form. Most preferably, the composition is provided in the form of discrete plural particles of a substantially uniform and homogenous admixture of the sorbent and the sorbed materials. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the particles are in a form of compressed or compacted particles, i.e., in the form of granules. By “granules” is meant particles that are compressed or compacted, such by a pelletizing, extrusion or similar compacting step. Such compression or compacting of the particles is preferred, inasmuch as the intraparticle cohesion of the particles will be enhanced by such compacting or compressing step. The granules may be prepared via any suitable manner. Preferably, the material to be sorbed, if not a liquid, is dissolved or suspended in a liquid and the liquid is applied to the sorbent, followed by compression of the mixture to form granules. In a highly preferred embodiment of the invention, the granules are prepared by pelletizing the sorbent in a pellet mill. The composition may be prepared by sorbing the material into pellets thus formed, or alternatively may be prepared by pelletizing a mixture of the material and the sorbent. In either case, the pellets exiting the pellet mill may be ground or crumbled to thereby reduce the granules of the composition to a desired granule size. The mixture may be pelletized under any suitable conditions. Typically, the ingredients are pre-ground and are introduced into the pellet mill with moisture. Typical moisture content ranges from 2-30%, more preferably 5-15% by total weight of the blend. The blend is pelleted through a die such as a 3/32 in×2 in die at any suitable temperature, preferably a temperature ranging from 150° F. to 220° F., more preferably from 180° F. to 200° F. Final moisture preferably is in the range from 4-20%, more preferably from 7-12% by total weight. After pelleting, the pellets may be cooled and crumbled through dry rollers to reduce the size of the granules (it is also possible to cut the pellets from the die). The final granule size may vary depending on the application. For an application such as mosquito control, the granule size preferably should be between 4 and 30 mesh (U.S. standard test sieve. ASTM E-11 specification) and more preferably should be between 6 and 20 mesh. Fines generated during the pelletizing process may be removed by screening, preferable on a 10-mesh screen to a level of less than 20% by weight and ideally less than 5%. Such fines may be recycled. In the pelletizing operation, use of a lubricity agent such as corn oil may be necessary or helpful. Other lubricants such as added corn oil or oils from soy, peanut, sunflower, rapeseed, canola, coconut, or cotton, or animal fats such as tallow, yellow grease, or white grease, may be used. Other lubricants include lecithin, waxes, fish oils, castor oil, long-chain alkyl sulphonates, alkyl poyglucosides, tall oil, stearates, and silicones. The lubricant (including any oil present in the germ) preferably is present in an amount of up to 30% by total weight of the composition (excluding moisture) more preferably, an amount of 10-15% by weight. Pelletizing is not the only manner of forming suitable granules. For instance, in another embodiment of the invention, extrusion of sorbent through a dye and grinding of the extrudate to a suitable granular size is useful in conjunction with the preparation of the composition. Once again, the extrudate may itself comprise a composition of a sorbent and the material to be sorbed, or the material may be sorbed within granules of extruded sorbent subsequent to extrusion. The granules should be sufficiently cohesive for use for their intended purpose. Especially when the granule is used as a carrier for control agent, the granule must have sufficient integrity to survive the production, transport, and application of the product. If the granule is too durable, however, it will not disintegrate easily, and may not be effective in releasing the control agent in the desired manner, for instance, when the granule is introduced into a water column. In embodiments of the invention where a delayed release of the control agent or other sorbed material is desired, the granules may be made more durable by incorporating additional binder or cohesiveness agent. The binder may comprise an extrudate of corn hulls and sodium hydroxide (as taught is copending application Ser. No. 09/901,342, filed Jul. 9, 2001), lignin, lignosulfate, hemicelluloses, celluloses, water, starch hydrolyzates, hydrogenated starch hydrolyzates, fatty acids, and clay materials such as bentonite and zeolites. In such embodiments, the binder preferably is present in an amount of about 5% by weight of the granule. In some embodiments of the invention, the granules may include a polysaccharide cohesiveness agent to enhance the cohesiveness of the granules. The cohesiveness agent is believed to provide additional hydroxyl groups, which groups enhance the bonding between grain proteins within the sorbent granules. It is further believed that the additional hydroxyl groups so function by enhancing the hydrogen bonding of proteins to starch and to other proteins. When used, the polysaccharide cohesiveness agent may be present in any amount suitable to enhance the cohesiveness of the sorbent granules. Generally, the cohesiveness agent may be present in a dry basis amount ranging up to about 45% by weight of the sorbent granules, preferably, an amount ranging from about 3% to about 35% by weight, more preferably, an amount ranging from about 5% to about 25% by weight. When the binder is or includes virgin germ, some or all of this may come from starch naturally present in the virgin germ In accordance with these embodiments of the invention, any suitable polysaccharide may be used in conjunction with the invention, and thus, for example, the cohesiveness agent may comprise one or more polysaccharides such as dextrin, maltodextrins, starches, flours, cellulosics, hemicellulosics, and the like. Preferably, the cohesiveness agent comprises a starch, and most preferably, the cohesiveness agent comprises a corn starch. When a polysaccharide cohesiveness agent is used, preferably a supplemental cohesiveness agent also is used. In accordance with the invention, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is an ionic species that is believed to enhance protein-protein and/or protein-starch interactions. Any suitable ionic salt may be used in conjunction with the invention. For example, in accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is selected from among the alkali and alkaline-earth salts of common anions, such as the halide, nitrate, nitrite, carbonate, phosphate, sulfate, and bicarbonate salts, and the like. More preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and mixtures thereof. Even more preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is selected from among sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, and mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is sodium chloride. The supplemental cohesiveness agent may be present in any amount sufficient to assist the cohesiveness agent in enhancing the cohesion of the granules. When used, the supplemental cohesiveness agent preferably is present in an amount of at least about 0.05% by dry basis weight, of the composition exclusive of the polysaccharide cohesiveness agent. More preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is present in an amount ranging from about 0.05% to about 10% by weight; more preferably, about 0.1% to about 8% by weight; and most preferably, about 1.5% to about 4% by weight. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is present in an amount of about 2% by weight of the composition. To prevent or inhibit spoilage, the sorbent composition may include a preservative. Preferably, the sorbent composition includes a mold inhibitor, which may be present in any amount sufficient to inhibit the molding of the sorbent composition. Any suitable mold inhibitor may be employed in conjunction with the invention. The mold inhibitor preferably is selected from among the propionate salts, and most preferably is selected from the group consisting of sodium propionate and calcium propionate. Other preservatives include sodium metabisulfite, citric acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, butylated hydroyxytoluene (BHT) butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and sodium benzoate. When a mold inhibitor is employed, it preferably is present in an amount ranging from about 0.02% to about 3.5% by weight. The mold inhibitor may function to some extent as agent for controlling mold if the composition is introduced into an environment; however, at the levels used herein, the mold inhibitor is intended for the purpose of retarding mold of the sorbent composition itself. The composition may be introduced into an environment via any suitable means. Where it is desired to disseminate the composition over a large area, the composition may be disseminated from an aircraft, such as plane, helicopter, blimp, balloon, or the like, or may be disseminated from a watercraft. Particularly when the control agent is a mosquito adulticide or larvicide, the environment may be a water-containing environment, by which is contemplated any environment containing standing or slowly moving water. For example, the water-containing environment may be a pond, lake, swamp, marsh, bog, area with collected rainwater, (such as a tire) and so forth. It is contemplated that in these or other embodiments of the invention the environment may be an indoor environment. The composition preferably is formulated to release at least a portion of the larvicide within the first two feet of water column. The sorbent composition also may be used to remove a material from an environment. In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, at least a portion of undesired material present in an environment may be removed by introducing a sorbent into the environment, allowing the sorbent to sorb at least a portion of the material, and removing at least a portion of the sorbed composition from the environment. The material which may be removed from the environment is not limited to the materials described herein, but to the contrary it is contemplated that any materials that is sorbable by the sorbent composition may be removed form an environment. For instance, the material may be an oleogenus or lipophilic material, or may be a hydrophilic material. In some embodiments, the material may be a gaseous material, such as ammonia. Generally, the sorbent may be prepared as described hereinabove, and may be introduced into the environment in any suitable manner, for instance, by dispersing the sorbent from an aircraft or watercraft as described above. The sorbent may be introduced into the environment in any amount effective for its intended purpose. The sorbent used in conjunction with the invention is incinerable. It is contemplated that the sorbed material may be a combustible material, and in particular a hydrophilic material such as ethanol or an oleogenous material such as oil. It is contemplated that a combustible material composition so composed may be oxidized, such as by incineration, to thereby generate heat. The heat thus generated may be used in industrial applications or may be used to generate electrical energy. The combustible material composition may include any suitable ratio of sorbent to combustible material. Preferably, the composition includes from 1-75%, by weight combustible material, more preferably, the combustible material is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight, even more preferably, the combustible material is present in an mount from 10-75% by weight. The sorbents useful in conjunction with the invention are biodegradable at 25° C. By “biodegradable” is contemplated that the sorbents are susceptible to degradation via microbial influence or other breakdown of the biological structure of the sorbent, such as by thermal or internal chemical or biochemical influence. It is further contemplated that the sorbent will be biodegradable over a wide range of other temperatures. When the sorbent is used to introduce a material into an environment, in particular an outdoor environment, the sorbent preferably is biodegradable in the environment. Such biodegradability prevents long-term contamination of the environment of the sorbent, and, in some embodiments, may effect a delayed release of the sorbed material into the environment. In embodiments of the invention where the sorbent is used to remove material from an environment, the sorbent may be allowed to biodegrade after removal of the sorbed unwanted material but before final disposal of the sorbed material compositions. The biodegradation of the sorbent will in some instances reduce the volume of the sorbed material composition, thereby reducing the disposal costs (particularly in the case of a hazardous material). The sorbed material may be stored until the volume of the material has been reduced by a desired amount preferably at least 10%, more preferably 15%, and even more preferably 20% of the original volume. The following Examples illustrate the invention, but should not be construed as limiting the invention in scope."
8813370,Trigger-operated portable electric tool,2009-08-19,0,1,"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED U.S. APPLICATIONS Not applicable. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not applicable. NAMES OF PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT Not applicable. REFERENCE TO AN APPENDIX SUBMITTED ON COMPACT DISC Not applicable. 1. Field of the Invention The present invention applies to trigger-operated portable electric tools. More specifically, it concerns the field of portable electric tools that are controlled during use by a trigger activated by at least one finger of the hand holding said tools. By pressing on this trigger, a command is given to an actuator (often consisting of an electric motor) to activate the element or moving active elements of the tool in a given direction; by letting go of said trigger, a command is given to the actuator either to stop (for tools operating in a single direction) or to activate the element or moving active elements of the tool in the opposite direction (for tools operating in two directions). 2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98. Motorized pruning shears, especially electric and electronic pruning shears, are examples of contemporary tools having a bidirectional control trigger (opening and closing the cutting elements). The applications of the invention described below apply especially to electronic pruning shears, but it is important to note that the invention can also be applied to other types of motorized pruning shears and to other types of trigger-operated tools, such as shears, drills, grinders, planes, and so on. In their most advanced versions, such tools are provided, in addition to their principal function, with at least one additional function. This second function consists of, for example, in the ability to maintain an intermediary speed or position, or to reverse the direction of the motor, or to place the tool on standby. This second function is controlled by the addition of a control device distinct and separate from the trigger, such as a pushbutton, a switch, and so on, positioned on the body of the tool, this device being intended to be activated by a finger other than the one that acts on said trigger. However, this situation has the disadvantage of being uncomfortable for the user when operating the tool, for the user must either employ two fingers from one hand at the same time or, if the distance between these two control elements is too great, use his other hand, which results in a loss of time. For example, many pruning shear models, in addition to the function of opening and closing the cutting elements controlled by a trigger activated by the user's finger, are equipped with a second function performed by an electrical or electronic system that can be used to arrest the rotation of the moving blade in a predetermined position intermediate between the closed position and the fully open position, thereby providing the ability to limit the opening of the blades, which is desirable in certain situations, for example, when cutting kindling wood, or when pruning, in order to save time and energy. This second function is controlled by a switch that is independent of the control trigger and must be activated by a finger other than the one used to activate said control trigger, and this must occur each time the operator wishes to go from the “fully open” position to the “intermediate” position and vice versa. The transition from one position to another being frequent due to the varying thicknesses of wood being cut on the same plant, it is easy to imagine the inconvenience and loss of time occasioned by such a device. An object of the invention is to correct the aforementioned drawbacks and inadequacies of portable electric tools, especially electric pruning shears. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invention, this objective is achieved by means of a portable electric tool configured to fulfill a primary function notable in that it has a double trigger having, on the one hand, a main actuator-control trigger effecting the movements of at least one moving active element of said tool and, on the other hand, an auxiliary, or secondary, trigger connected to said main trigger by means of an articulation and arranged so as to form a reentrant angle with said main trigger, wherein pivoting said auxiliary trigger activates control means of a system designed to fulfill at least one supplementary function of said tool. It is apparent that this double-trigger device can be used to control several tool functions with a single finger, which provides comfort and saves time. According to a preferred embodiment applicable to portable electric tools comprising a cutting head having at least one moving blade whose movements are controlled by an electronic control card, this latter is configured to control the complete opening of the “fully opened” blades or the stable positioning of said moving blade(s) in a partly opened “intermediate” position, and the auxiliary trigger can be used to act upon a complementary control means of said actuator via said electronic control card. By means of this arrangement, the blades of cutting tools such as electronic pruning shears can be stably positioned in a partly open “intermediate” position that allows for better adaptation of the opening of the cutting blades to the diameter of the wood (branches, vine shoots, etc.) being cut, which results in significant savings of energy and time, together with improved ease of use and greater precision. It is possible to proceed instantaneously from a predetermined partly open “intermediate” position to the “fully open” position and vice versa. The width of the intermediate angle of opening can be adjustable. According to a highly preferred embodiment, a sensor, preferably having a Hall-effect or magnetoresistive sensor, is fixedly arranged on the body of the tool, and the free end of the auxiliary trigger is equipped with a permanent magnet capable of being brought in proximity with said sensor or away from it. By means of this embodiment of the supplementary actuator control means, the auxiliary trigger of the double trigger does not make contact with any mechanical element. Therefore, there is no mechanical wear of this control means, which provides longer operating life for the latter over time."
8851447,Integrated control circuitry and coil assembly for irrigation control,2009-07-27,0,4,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation control devices and more specifically to multi-wire irrigation control systems including remote devices coupled to a multi-wire path and for coupling to actuator coil-controlled irrigation equipment. 2. Discussion of the Related Art In decoder-based irrigation control systems, an irrigation controller sends signaling along a wire path to which one or more decoder devices are attached. Each decoder device monitors transmissions on the wire path and decodes this signaling to determine when to cause irrigation devices coupled thereto to be activated and deactivated. The decoder module typically includes circuitry formed on a printed circuit board located within a housing. Wiring from the decoder module housing must be coupled to the wiring of the wire path as well as coupled to one or more actuator devices each controlling the opening and closing of an irrigation rotor or valve. In one form, the rotor or valve is operated by a solenoid coil as is well known in the art. Likewise, during installation, the operator must provide and electrically connect two separate devices, a decoder module and an actuator coil module, to each other and to the control wire path. FIG. 1 illustrates a separate decoder module 102 and a coil unit 104 that are conventionally coupled together. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 2 , for a solenoid activated rotor assembly 200 , the coil module 104 is coupled (in part by a bracket 212 and retainer 214 ) to the parts of a selector valve assembly 202 (including a pressure regulator) attached to a casing assembly 204 . The electrical wire inputs to the coil module 104 are then connected to the electrical wire outputs from the decoder module 102 , while the electrical wire inputs to the decoder module 102 are coupled to the control wire path from the irrigation controller. Thus, a typical installation requires the connection of six wires to install the decoder module 102 and a coil module 104 . As is well known, in operation, a portion of a plunger (not shown) of the selector valve assembly 202 is disposed within the coil unit 104 while another portion is seated against a solenoid plunge port (not shown) within the selector valve assembly 202 in a normally closed position. In this position, high pressure water flow from a main water control valve (not shown) located within a main control valve portion 206 of the device is flowed up high pressure water line 208 into the selector valve assembly 202 and its regulator and is prevented from further movement by the normally closed position of the plunger against the solenoid port in the selector valve assembly 202 . This results in a back pressure that causes the main water control valve to close. In response to signals from the decoder module 102 , the coil module 104 causes the actuation of the plunger to move it off of (or unseat from) the solenoid plunge port allowing the high pressure flow in the high pressure line 208 to flow through the selector valve assembly 202 (and its pressure regulator), which relieves the back pressure and allows water to flow through the main control valve and to a pop-up sprinkler device, i.e., the main water control valve is opened. The pop-up sprinkler device is located within the casing assembly 204 and extends upwardly due to the water pressure through a top portion of the casing assembly 204 . The high pressure flow exits the selector valve assembly 202 down through a discharge flow line 210 which terminates within the casing assembly 204 at a location downstream of the main water control valve. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Several embodiments of the invention provide an integrated valve actuator coil and control module for use in irrigation control systems. In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device comprising: a coil adapted to develop an electromagnetic flux sufficient to cause actuation of irrigation equipment; control circuitry to receive a control signals from an irrigation control unit and electrically coupled to the coil to control the flux at the coil; and a housing covering at least a portion of the coil and at least a portion of the control circuitry. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method of making an irrigation control device comprising: holding a solenoid assembly with a coil near to control circuitry having circuitry for controlling an electromagnetic flux at the coil; electrically connecting the coil to the control circuitry; placing the solenoid assembly and control circuitry into a housing; securing the solenoid assembly to the housing so that the solenoid assembly is actuated to reciprocate a valve member through an aperture in the housing to selectively engage a valve seat external to the housing; and fixing the control circuitry and coil within the housing."

7584542,Trimmer,2003-11-03,0,1,"This invention relates to a grass trimming device which is capable of being switched between at least two alternative configurations which are suitable for grass trimming and edge trimming respectively. A known grass trimming device (trimmer) comprises a cutting head mounted at one end of a shaft, an operator handle being positioned at the other end of the shaft. The cutting head includes a cutter constituted by a rotatable blade or a rotatable flexible cutting line. The cutting head can be moved relative to the shaft, to position the cutter generally horizontal for grass trimming and generally vertical for edge trimming. DE-A-3 010 092 describes a known trimmer of this type, the trimmer having a handle that can be moved from a first socket on the cutting head to a second socket on the same head, in order to shift the cutting head from a configuration in which the cutter plane is horizontal for grass trimming to a configuration in which the cutter is vertical for edge trimming. In both configurations of the device, a shaft fitted to the handle is directed upwardly towards the operator. This device suffers from the drawback that changing from one function to the other is difficult, because it is necessary to release and then remove the handle from one socket, and then replace it and lock it into position in the second socket. EP-A-0 005 540 shows a similar device where the handle is pivotally adjustable in a plane which is perpendicular to the cutting plane. Changing the configuration of this device requires releasing a handle catch, turning the handle through 180°, releasing the cutting head, and then adjusting it to the required angle. Moreover, a relatively complex arrangement of parts is necessary to achieve the changeover. This results in considerable expense, and a risk that the components, which are not totally covered may be damaged by the ingress of dirt and debris. EP-A-0 296 789 describes a trimmer in which the shaft includes a coupling section to which the cutting head is pivotally attached. The cutting head includes a surface defining a parting plane at which plane the coupling section is coupled to the cutting head. The parting plane, extends laterally with respect to the shaft, so that relative movement at the parting plane between the coupling section and the cutting head is about an axis which is perpendicular to the parting plane and obliquely to the shaft, so that relative movement between the coupling section and the cutting head about the parting plane positions the cutter in grass trimming and edge trimming configurations. Each of the trimmers described above is relatively easy to operate when in the trimming configuration. However, when in the edging configuration, the user must stand at right-angles to the edge of a lawn being trimmed, and move sideways along that edge as trimming progresses. This is disadvantageous, in that it is difficult to align the cutter accurately with the edge of the lawn (owing to the eye of the user not being in alignment with the lawn edge), and this can lead to a poor edging performance. Moreover, each of the known trimmers requires a relatively complex series of operations to convert between trimming and edging configurations. The aim of the invention is to provide a trimmer having improved edging capabilities. The present invention provides a trimmer comprising a cutting head housing a cutter means, and an elongate shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being connected to the shaft by connection means permitting the cutting head to be positioned with its cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical without disconnecting the cutting head and the shaft, the shaft having a hand-grippable portion at a position remote from the cutting head, the arrangement being such that the line joining a point within the hand-grippable portion and the connection means is substantially parallel to plane of rotation of the cutter means when the cutter means is substantially vertical. Preferably, the connection means is such that the cutting head is movable between positions in which its cutter means is substantially horizontal and substantially vertical in a single movement. Advantageously, the connection means is such that the cutter means is movable between the substantially horizontal position and the substantially vertical position by an effective rotation of the cutting head relative to the handle of 120° in one direction or 240° in the other direction. Preferably, the connection means is constituted by a rotatable joint. In this case, the rotatable joint is such that the cutting head is movable between positions in which its cutter means is substantially horizontal and substantially vertical about a single axis. In a preferred embodiment, the axis of rotation of the rotatable joint lies substantially at 35.5° to the plane of rotation of the cutter means, and lies substantially at 35.5° to the horizontal when the cutting head is positioned with the cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical. Connection means of this nature enables the cutting head to be moved between a trimming mode (in which the cutter means is substantially horizontal) and an edging mode (in which the cutter means is substantially vertical) by a simple rotation of the cutting head relative to the shaft. A particular advantage of this connection means is that the elongate shaft is generally aligned with a lawn edge in the edging mode, so that the user can carry out an edging operation when positioned behind the cutting head and moving forwards (or backwards) along the edge portion of the lawn. Advantageously, the rotatable joint is constituted by a ball-and-socket joint. Preferably, the ball is fixed to the cutting head, and the socket is defined by a generally spherical socket portion formed at the end of the shaft remote from the hand-grippable portion. The trimmer may further comprise a motor for driving the cutter means. Conveniently, the cutter means is rotatable, and the drive engagement between the motor and the cutter means is a rotatable drive engagement. Preferably, the motor is housed within the ball, and is an electric motor. Preferably, a rotatable cutter line constitutes the cutter means, In a preferred embodiment, the trimmer further comprises a wheel rotatably mounted on the cutting head. The axis of rotation of the wheel may be substantially coincident with the axis of rotation of the cutter means. Advantageously, the radius of the wheel is of the order of, but slightly less than, the effective radius of the cutter means. The invention also provides a cutting head housing a cutter means, and a shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being adjustably mounted with respect to the shaft by connection means enabling the cutter means to be moved between substantially vertical and substantially horizontal positions by adjusting the position of the cutting head relative to the shaft by an effective rotation of 120° in one direction or 240° in the other direction. The invention further provides a cutting head housing a cutter means, and a shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being rotatably mounted with respect to the shaft by means of a rotatable joint whose axis of rotation lies substantially at 45° to the plane rotation of the cutter means, and lies substantially at 45° to the horizontal when the cutting head is positioned with its cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical."

8260465,Data communication in a multi-wire irrigation control system,2009-07-17,1,0,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation devices, and more particularly to the communication of data using an alternating power signal to be supplied to irrigation devices. 2. Discussion of the Related Art Typical irrigation control systems cooperate with water valves and pumps to control the flow of irrigation water through a variety of water dispensing devices, including sprinklers, rotors, drip-lines, and other water delivery devices. These control systems are used in a wide variety of irrigation applications, from residential and commercial landscapes to golf course and agricultural irrigation. Many irrigation systems and electronics are powered by 50/60 Hz AC voltage signals. Some systems further modulate this power source to provide data communication, for example, by selectively clipping the positive half of the AC voltage signal. Data and power sent in this manner are often over a two-wire transmission line and are often referred to as a two-wire interface. Irrigation devices variously located in the field couple to the two-wire interface and derive their operational power therefrom. The irrigation devices demodulate the data monitoring the received power signal for a missing negative half of a cycle, then taking eight voltage samples at a predetermined time thereafter during the positive half to detect whether the signal is clipped or unclipped. Such systems are well known in the art and described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,395 to Evelyn-Veere. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for providing power and data to an irrigation device. The method includes modulating data onto an alternating power signal by distorting an amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, permitting effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and applying the alternating power signal to a multi-wire interface configured to couple with a plurality of irrigation devices. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system. The method includes receiving an alternating power signal comprising cycles each having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and demodulating data represented by the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device having a modulator configured to modulate data onto an alternating power signal by distorting amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, and permit effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal. The irrigation controller further includes an interface configured to couple the modulator to a multi-wire interface coupled to a plurality of irrigation devices to permit the alternating power signal to be applied to the multi-wire interface. In still yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation device having an input configured to receive an alternating power signal comprising cycles having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and a demodulator configured to provide data by demodulating the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In a further embodiment, the invention may be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system, the method comprising: receiving, at an irrigation device, an alternating power signal comprising cycles, where an amplitude of a portion of each cycle is selectively distorted to modulate data on the alternating power signal; determining a slope of the portion of each cycle; and demodulating the data based upon the determining the slope"

8150554,Resource use management in yards and gardens,2009-04-21,0,1,"CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is related to commonly assigned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,051 entitled “A Method for Providing an Application to Plants”; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,059 entitled “Horticultural Knowledge Base for Managing Yards and Gardens”; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,043 entitled “System and Method for Managing Resource Use”; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,065, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,028,470, entitled “Robotic Watering Unit” all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention relates generally to an irrigation control system and, more particularly, to a system and method for managing resource use in yards and gardens. Horticulture is the industry and science of plant cultivation. Horticulturists work and conduct research in the disciplines of plant propagation and cultivation, crop production, plant breeding and genetic engineering, plant biochemistry, and plant physiology. The work particularly involves fruits, berries, nuts, vegetables, flowers, trees, shrubs, and turf. Horticulturists work to improve crop yield, quality, nutritional value, and resistance to insects, diseases, and environmental stresses. One aspect of horticultural management is irrigation. Irrigation is typically used to water large, homogeneous areas such as fields, lawns, and gardens. The water is assumed to be available from a single source, such as a well, canal, or municipal water system. Water from municipal water systems are often stressed during times of heat and drought, and watering restrictions are frequently implemented to provide adequate water for higher priority uses. These restrictions may start as odd-even day lawn watering and progress to complete bans on lawn watering, and finally to complete bans on garden watering. The fields and lawns typically have a single species of plant and water application is based on water sensors, evapotranspiration models, or rules. This type of irrigation system can be inadequate for yards and gardens where numerous species are growing in close proximity, particularly large water users like trees and shrubs in proximity to lesser water users. Trees, shrubs, and structures also provide shade, which impacts evapotranspiration, which is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration. An embodiment of the present invention provides a computer program product comprising a computer recordable media having computer usable program code. Resource needs are determined for each plant in a plurality of plants to form individual resource needs. Conditions are identified in an environment in which the plurality of plants are located by receiving input from a sensor system to form current conditions. A plurality of per plant prescriptions are calculated for the plurality of plants using the individual resource needs and the current conditions. The application of the resource is controlled from a mobile utility vehicle to each plant in the plurality of plants using the plurality of per plant prescriptions. The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present invention or may be combined in yet other embodiments in which further details can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings."

Field of the Invention This invention relates coated surfaces upon which insects can neither climb nor alight and methods and means for applying the coatings. More particularly, the invention relates to surfaces coated with non-toxic, non-debilitating fluorocarbon resin films which are effective to discourage crawling insects from infesting a site where they are not wanted, to cause crawling insects to abandon a site they have infested, to confine crawling insects within a given enclosure and to prevent insects from alighting, climbing or building nests or webs on selected surfaces. 3. Discussion of the Prior Art The crawling insects with which this invention is concerned are those which are pests or nuisances to man. These include, for example, gypsy moths that crawl from the ground up into trees and devour the leaves of the trees; cockroaches, spiders, scales and palm aphids which are often offensive in appearance and may carry and spread disease; and, perhaps the most widespread and annoying of the general group, the ubiquitous ant. The ant exists in many forms including the leaf eater, Argentine, carpenter and pharaoh ants, the termites and, of course, the militant and destructive fire ant. It is the primary concern of this invention to restrict the movement and colonization of these insects. Many pesticides and insecticides are available which will kill or disrupt the life cycle of crawling insects, but essentially all of them are environmentally objectionable because of their toxicity. The toxicity of pesticides can endanger the health of animals and humans and curtail their use when food is present as in dinning rooms, kitchens, picnic tables, pet food dishes and the like. It is also well recognized that insects develop strains which are resistent to the effect of a given insecticide over a period of time. As an alternative to insecticides, it has been proposed to control insects with traps. One common type of trap is built with downwardly and inwardly sloping side walls that are covered with a loosely adhering powdered material, such as talcum powder. The loosely adhering particles are dislodged when an insect attempts to crawl over them and the insect falls with the powder into a trap. This technique is relied on in U.S. Pat. No 4,263,740 which teaches the application of particulate organic and inorganic materials to a vertical or sloping surface. The particulate materials are applied by coating a surface with a liquid dispersion of polytetrafluoroethylene, sand, clay, ground pyrophyllite-aluminum silicate, cellulosics, talc, sand, and flour. When the liquid content of the dispersion is evaporated, a dry, loosely adherent layer of powder remains on the surface. The size of the particles is not critical since patentee teaches that the particulate material of the dispersions may vary from less than 1 micron to more that 1000 microns in diameter, although his preferred range is from 100 to 300 microns. In use, patentee relates, when an insect first crawls over a coated surface at the entrance to a trap, its sticky pads (pulvilli) are coated with the loosely adhered powders and the ability of the pulvilli to adhere to a smooth surface is rendered ineffective. If and when the insect reverses its direction in an attempt to crawl up a smooth slanting sidewall and escape from the trap, its pulvilli are no longer """"sticky"""" and the insect must grip the particulate material with its tarsal claws to gain a purchase. At this point, the weight of the insect grasping the particulate matter dislodges the powder and causes an """"avalanche"""" of the loosely held particles carrying the insect down with them into the trap. The powdery coatings taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,740 have a limited useful life. They are consumed in use when one or more """"avalanche"""" occurs and they will break loose and flake away if the coated surface is impacted as by bumping or shaking or is exposed to the elements such as wind and rain. A less obvious defect in the powdery coatings is that loose powder can suffocate the insects and destroy their value to a hobbyist or an entomologist. Entomologists have discovered that they can nondestructively confine crawling insects in tub shaped containers by painting circumferential, horizontal bands of a water dispersion of finely divided polytetrafluoroethylene, generally about 0.05 to 0.5 microns in diameter, on the inside walls of the container. Perhaps because of their extremely small size, the particles making up the dried coating, unlike the coatings of U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,740, adhere sufficiently well to the side walls of the container to prevent them from being pulled loose when traversed by an insect. It was discovered that the insects could not climb these dried films of sub micron resin polytetrafluoroethylene particles. Since the insects appear to slide down the coated surfaces when they try to climb them, it seemed reasonable to assume, even though it has now been proven false, that the phenomenum was due to the slippery surface characteristics (low coefficient of friction) of polytetrafluoroethylene. The dispersions that the entomologists have used are commercial formulations that typically contain about 60%, by total weight, of 0.05 to 0.5 micron sized polytetrafluoroethylene particles suspended in water along with from about 5% to 8%, by weight of polytetrafluoroethylene, of a wetting agent and stabilizer. At room temperatures (20.degree.-25.degree. C.) the dispersions have viscosities of from about 20 to 27 centipoise. An example of the method used by entomologists, can be found in a trap for flying insects disclosed in European patent application 0 160 712 A1 to Montedison S.p.A. Here flying insects are prevented from crawling out of a trap having a funnel shaped (30.degree.-60.degree. cone angle) entrance by coating the interior surface of the funnel with dispersions of polytetrafluoroethylene. The dispersions are the same as those described above as used by entomologists which are commercially available formulations of aqueous dispersions of polytetrafluoroethylene. They are described in the patent application as being comprised of a granulometric dispersion of between 0.2 and 0.4 microns of 50-61% by weight polytetrafluoroethylene and 2.5-4% by weight of a non-ionic dispersant, the rest being water. It is further taught that the coatings of these dispersions can be applied by spraying or brushing. The European patent application acknowledges that the prior art has made use of sticky substances to entrap insects and powdered substances, such as kaolin or talc, to reduce an insects ability to cling to a surface. The patent application states that the powdered substances of the prior art are not useful over prolonged periods since the powders are easily removed by the mechanical action of wind, rain and humidity. The coatings of the entomologists and those disclosed in the European patent application improved over the prior powdered coatings, but they too have their deficiencies both with respect to the methods by which they are applied and to the characteristics of the applied coatings. Considering the coatings themselves the following is a listing of some of their failings. 1. While the coatings adhere to their substrates somewhat better than do the powdered coatings, the polytetrafluoroethylene coatings are so loosely bound to their substrates that they can be removed by running tap water over the surface, by lightly brushing the surface, by flexing the substrate or by applying and removing ordinary transparent adhesive tape. 2. The coatings are effective only for relatively short periods of time. In discussions with entomologists who use these coatings, it has been uniformly reported that the effective life of the coatings range from as short as several weeks to a maximum of about two, or, at most, three months. The mechanisms of the failures are not understood as often there is no apparent or observable change in the appearance of the coating. 3. The effectiveness of the coating is adversely effected if more than a single layer is applied to a surface. Care is required to avoid overcoating when the dispersion is applied for, otherwise, multiple coating layers will crack or flake off rendering the coating ineffective to prevent insects from crawling on a surface. It follows that it is necessary to remove all of an old coating which has lost its effectiveness before a new coating is applied. The difficulty of thoroughly removing all of an old coating is enough of a chore to make it common practice among entomologists to discard used insect containers after they have lost their effectiveness rather than to clean and recoat the old containers. 4. The effectiveness of the coatings are temperature sensitive. When exposed to ambient temperatures over about 30.degree.-35.degree. C., insects begin climbing over surfaces that they could not climb at lower ambient temperatures. 5. Depending on the dispersing agent used in making up the polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions, most coatings loose their effectiveness when they become damp or wet. This limits the utility of the coatings to protected environments where they can be sheltered from the effects of rain, snow, dew and other surface moisture. 6. The relatively poor adhesion of the coatings makes it impractical to clean the coated surfaces. For example, if a coating is applied to a dog dish, the coating will not survive even one dish washer cycle. The method of application of coatings from polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions as taught by the prior art, also raises a number of problems. 1. The effectiveness of the coating is influenced by the thickness of the coating. It has now been discovered that better coatings are obtained if the thickness of the dried coating is preferably 1 mil or less. This desired thickness has not been obtained in the prior art for a number of reasons including the viscosity of the available polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions, the means by which the coatings are applied as by brushing or dipping, and the dependency of the thickness on the angle the substrate makes to the horizontal as it dries. In this latter regard it may be understood that if a freshly coated surface is allowed to dry while in a vertical position, the dispersion will flow by gravity down the plate, run-off will be maximized and the coating thickness will be minimized. If, on the other hand, the surface is oriented horizontally, the run-off will be minimized and the thickness of the coating maximized. 2. The viscosity of commercially available polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions increases rapidly at higher temperatures. As a result, the coating thickness is a function of the ambient temperatures at the time the coating is applied. 3. Polytetrafluoroethylene resins are soft and subject to fibrillation when exposed to shear forces. The effect is so pronounced that fibrillation occurs when polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions are forced through an orifice as in spraying. For this reason the dispersions are difficult to handle and, for practical reasons, cannot be sprayed unto a substrate. They can not be pumped through feed lines and care must be taken to avoid fibrillation if the dispersions are shaken, stirred or pumped. 4. The high viscosity (about 20 centipoise and over) of the polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions of the prior art make it difficult to form a smooth. coating because of the relatively high viscosity and poor flow-out. 5. The polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions of the prior art are unstable and coagulate during prolonged storage. Temperatures above 25.degree. C. accelerate the coagulation of the dispersions and temperatures below the freezing point of the liquids destroy the dispersion. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to apply surface coatings to substrates which coatings prevent crawling insects from climbing on the surfaces and discourage crawling insects from infesting defined certain areas. Another object of this invention is to protect areas from infestation from crawling insects without using insecticides or toxic substances that are harmful to the environment. Another object of this invention is selectively to control the type or size of crawling insects which enter or leave an area. Another object of this invention is to prevent flying or hopping insects from alighting on or clinging to surfaces such as walls or ceilings. Another object of this invention is to provide a device for trapping insects. Another object of this invention is to create an environment which is not hospitable to crawling insects and will cause them to leave and establish their nests elsewhere. Another object of this invention is to provide wearing apparel such as shoes and boots, ankle protectors, outer garments and the like which will prevent crawling insects from climbing onto the human body. Another object of this invention is to prevent insects from crawling up the legs of furniture. Another object of this invention is to provide methods and means for controlling the movement of crawling insects which methods are simple and effective, remain effective over prolonged periods of time, withstand moderate abuse, and remain effective at elevated temperatures and when wet. Another object of this invention is the provision of methods and means to control the movement of crawling insects that retain their effectiveness for long periods of time even when used in outdoor environments and exposed to all weather conditions. Another object of this invention is to provide coatings of polytetrafluoroethylene which can withstand washing under running tap water or in a dishwasher. Another object of this invention is to provide dispersions of a polytetrafluoroethylene resins having a particle size between about 0.05 and 0.5 microns which have improved storage life, less sensitivity to higher temperatures, mixing and forces of shear and reduced tendencies to fibrillation. These and other objects of this invention are achieved by coating a surface with an aqueous dispersion of polytetrafluoroethylene particles, preferably less than 0.5 microns in size as measured along their major axis, and drying the dispersion to form a coherent film free from bubbles and other visible surface imperfections, characterized in that the viscosity of the dispersion is less than 16 centipoise. Insects cannot climb on the surfaces in accordance with the foregoing if the surfaces are at an angle to the horizontal. The minimum angle required to impede the progress of an insect over a surface coated in accordance with this invention will vary with the characteristics of the insect such as its size, whether it has any sticky substances on its legs, whether its tarsi have claws, and in the case of crawling pests such as caterpillars, how many legs it has. Nonetheless, as a generality, it may reasonably be estimated that surfaces treated in accordance with this invention should be skewed at least about 20 degrees to a horizontal axis to be effective. In the case of flying insects such as flies, gnats, or mosquitoes, and hopping insects, such as fleas, surfaces treated in accordance with this invention will prevent these pests from alighting or resting on steeply slanting surfaces, such as walls or ceilings. It has been observed that the surface characteristics of the film forming materials of this invention may change when the film becomes wet with water when a surface which has been prepared in accordance with this invention is exposed to the outdoor elements like snow, rain or high humidity, it may re-wet and lose its effectiveness in preventing insects from crawling on its surface. It is believed that the tendency of the film to re-wet is largely a function of the surfactant. Used in preparing the dispersion and it has been established that the problem can be overcome either by utilizing a surfactant that does not re-wet, or by removing the surfactant after the film has been formed. In this latter instance, it noted that some surfactants are naturally destroyed by exposure to an outdoor environment and UV light and other surfactants can be leached from a film by washing the film with a solvent which, depending upon the surfactant, may include water, alcohols, acids, bases and the like. However, when surfactants are removed by leaching, it is a sine qua non that the coatings must adhere to the substrate well enough to prevent the coatings from being washed away during the leaching process. In the preferred practice of this invention, aqueous dispersions are stabilized from the harmful effects of freeze/thaw cycles to permit their transportation and storage during colder times of the year. Suitable stabilizers for use in the dispersions of this invention include monohydric alcohols of less than five carbon atoms that form clathrates with water, polyhydric compounds, and the amine analogs of the alcohols and polyhydric compounds. These stabilizers are disclosed PCT patent application filed Apr. 30, 1992 serial number PCT/US92/03630 in the name of Thomas H. Eberlein and PCT patent application filed Apr. 30, 1992 serial number PCT/US92/03647 in the names of Thomas H. Eberlein and Allan H. Olsen both entitled """"Aqueous Dispersions Stabilized from Freeze/Thaw Cycles"""" which are incorporated herein by reference. The solids which are used to form the dispersions of this invention average less than 0.5 microns when measured along their major axis. The small size of the particles is responsible for making a surface difficult for an insect to climb and it is suspected the small particle size contributes to the formation of a more adherent film. Here and elsewhere in the specification and claims, the dried residue that remains after a dispersion of the invention has been applied to a surface is referred to as a """"film"""" since it appears to the naked eye to be continuous and since it is known that it will be effective to control the movement of insects only if it is free from discontinuities and other anomalies that will enable an insect to grip the surface of a film, On the other hand, the """"film"""" has little or no tear strength and, unless applied to an adhesive substance as is discussed below, the dried coating cannot be peeled away from a surface without destroying the """"film"""". For this reason, and since a better term does not suggest itself, it should be understood that the term """"film"""" as used herein may not be entirely consistent with some definitions of the term. The fluorocarbon resins that are of utility in the practice of the present invention are fluorocarbon polymers prepared by dispersion polymerizations and include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP) and perfluoroalkoxy (PFA). The dispersion grades of these resins are commercially available in particle sizes ranging from about 0.05 to about 0.5 microns, at solids concentrations of about 60 wt % dispersing agents, balance water, and in viscosities of from about 20 to about 27 centipoise. Since polytetrafluoroethylene resins are the most widely available, known and used of the fluorocarbon resins, the specification and claims refer specifically to this member of the group although it is to be understood that the term """"polytetrafluoroethylene"""" as used in the specification and appended claims is meant to include other dispersion grade fluorocarbon resins."
7584542,Trimmer,2003-11-03,0,1,"This invention relates to a grass trimming device which is capable of being switched between at least two alternative configurations which are suitable for grass trimming and edge trimming respectively. A known grass trimming device (trimmer) comprises a cutting head mounted at one end of a shaft, an operator handle being positioned at the other end of the shaft. The cutting head includes a cutter constituted by a rotatable blade or a rotatable flexible cutting line. The cutting head can be moved relative to the shaft, to position the cutter generally horizontal for grass trimming and generally vertical for edge trimming. DE-A-3 010 092 describes a known trimmer of this type, the trimmer having a handle that can be moved from a first socket on the cutting head to a second socket on the same head, in order to shift the cutting head from a configuration in which the cutter plane is horizontal for grass trimming to a configuration in which the cutter is vertical for edge trimming. In both configurations of the device, a shaft fitted to the handle is directed upwardly towards the operator. This device suffers from the drawback that changing from one function to the other is difficult, because it is necessary to release and then remove the handle from one socket, and then replace it and lock it into position in the second socket. EP-A-0 005 540 shows a similar device where the handle is pivotally adjustable in a plane which is perpendicular to the cutting plane. Changing the configuration of this device requires releasing a handle catch, turning the handle through 180°, releasing the cutting head, and then adjusting it to the required angle. Moreover, a relatively complex arrangement of parts is necessary to achieve the changeover. This results in considerable expense, and a risk that the components, which are not totally covered may be damaged by the ingress of dirt and debris. EP-A-0 296 789 describes a trimmer in which the shaft includes a coupling section to which the cutting head is pivotally attached. The cutting head includes a surface defining a parting plane at which plane the coupling section is coupled to the cutting head. The parting plane, extends laterally with respect to the shaft, so that relative movement at the parting plane between the coupling section and the cutting head is about an axis which is perpendicular to the parting plane and obliquely to the shaft, so that relative movement between the coupling section and the cutting head about the parting plane positions the cutter in grass trimming and edge trimming configurations. Each of the trimmers described above is relatively easy to operate when in the trimming configuration. However, when in the edging configuration, the user must stand at right-angles to the edge of a lawn being trimmed, and move sideways along that edge as trimming progresses. This is disadvantageous, in that it is difficult to align the cutter accurately with the edge of the lawn (owing to the eye of the user not being in alignment with the lawn edge), and this can lead to a poor edging performance. Moreover, each of the known trimmers requires a relatively complex series of operations to convert between trimming and edging configurations. The aim of the invention is to provide a trimmer having improved edging capabilities. The present invention provides a trimmer comprising a cutting head housing a cutter means, and an elongate shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being connected to the shaft by connection means permitting the cutting head to be positioned with its cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical without disconnecting the cutting head and the shaft, the shaft having a hand-grippable portion at a position remote from the cutting head, the arrangement being such that the line joining a point within the hand-grippable portion and the connection means is substantially parallel to plane of rotation of the cutter means when the cutter means is substantially vertical. Preferably, the connection means is such that the cutting head is movable between positions in which its cutter means is substantially horizontal and substantially vertical in a single movement. Advantageously, the connection means is such that the cutter means is movable between the substantially horizontal position and the substantially vertical position by an effective rotation of the cutting head relative to the handle of 120° in one direction or 240° in the other direction. Preferably, the connection means is constituted by a rotatable joint. In this case, the rotatable joint is such that the cutting head is movable between positions in which its cutter means is substantially horizontal and substantially vertical about a single axis. In a preferred embodiment, the axis of rotation of the rotatable joint lies substantially at 35.5° to the plane of rotation of the cutter means, and lies substantially at 35.5° to the horizontal when the cutting head is positioned with the cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical. Connection means of this nature enables the cutting head to be moved between a trimming mode (in which the cutter means is substantially horizontal) and an edging mode (in which the cutter means is substantially vertical) by a simple rotation of the cutting head relative to the shaft. A particular advantage of this connection means is that the elongate shaft is generally aligned with a lawn edge in the edging mode, so that the user can carry out an edging operation when positioned behind the cutting head and moving forwards (or backwards) along the edge portion of the lawn. Advantageously, the rotatable joint is constituted by a ball-and-socket joint. Preferably, the ball is fixed to the cutting head, and the socket is defined by a generally spherical socket portion formed at the end of the shaft remote from the hand-grippable portion. The trimmer may further comprise a motor for driving the cutter means. Conveniently, the cutter means is rotatable, and the drive engagement between the motor and the cutter means is a rotatable drive engagement. Preferably, the motor is housed within the ball, and is an electric motor. Preferably, a rotatable cutter line constitutes the cutter means, In a preferred embodiment, the trimmer further comprises a wheel rotatably mounted on the cutting head. The axis of rotation of the wheel may be substantially coincident with the axis of rotation of the cutter means. Advantageously, the radius of the wheel is of the order of, but slightly less than, the effective radius of the cutter means. The invention also provides a cutting head housing a cutter means, and a shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being adjustably mounted with respect to the shaft by connection means enabling the cutter means to be moved between substantially vertical and substantially horizontal positions by adjusting the position of the cutting head relative to the shaft by an effective rotation of 120° in one direction or 240° in the other direction. The invention further provides a cutting head housing a cutter means, and a shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being rotatably mounted with respect to the shaft by means of a rotatable joint whose axis of rotation lies substantially at 45° to the plane rotation of the cutter means, and lies substantially at 45° to the horizontal when the cutting head is positioned with its cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical."

There is no federally sponsored research and development as respects the instant device. 1.

The top plate is circular in shape and is made of ALMAG 35, an aluminum and magnesium alloy. This plate has a flat top side and a centerhole extending from the top side through to a bottom side. Its bottom side is characterized by the presence of a slightly elevated circular rim circumscribing its outer perimeter. Moreover, its bottom side is characterized by a cylindrically shaped downwardly directed well therefrom co-extensive with a conically inclined recession downward which is in turn co-extensive with the flooring of the bottom side, the greatest diameter of which downwardly directed well is significantly less than that of the plate. The vertical axis of symmetry of the centerhole, the downwardly directed well and the plate itself is one and the same. Extending from and co-extensive with the outer walls of the recession and the well are each of three solid rectangularly shaped abutments that are likewise co-extensive. with the flooring of the bottom side the recession and the above-mentioned circular rim. Each abutment, the vertical axes of symmetry of each of which are 120.degree. removed from the vertical axes of symmetry of the two adjacent abutments, contains one of the abovementioned top plate through holes into which, one each respectively of the cylindrical pins have been press-fitted. A first rounded concave depression in the wall of the well is found just adjacent the left side of one abutment and a second rounded concave depression in the wall of the well is found just adjacent the right side of an adjacent abutment such that the depressions are 180.degree. removed from one another. At the base of the inner wall of the well there is also flooring of the bottom side within the center of which there is the centerhole. An arrow pointing in a clockwise direction is etched into this portion of the bottom side flooring. Finally, there is also a bottom plate. This bottom plate is made of ALMAG 35 alloy material as well. It is likewise circular in shape with an outer diameter equal to that of the top plate. The bottom side of the bottom plate has a flat external surface that is slightly recessed closer to the center of the bottom plate. Closer still to the center of the bottom plate there is to be found a hollow cylindrical elevation extending from bottom to top within the center of which there is a center hole extending from the floor of the hollow cylindrical elevation through to the top side of the bottom plate and about and co-extensive with the lower portion of which hollow cylindrical elevation there is a conically shaped elevation surfacewise co-extensive with the base surface of the top side. The top side of the bottom plate is characterized by the presence of a slightly elevated circular rim that circumscribes its outer perimeter. On the top outer surface of the cylindrical elevation in the bottom plate there is etched an arrow pointed in a counterclockwise direction. The top outer surface of the previously described conically shaped elevation of the bottom plate which is co-extensive with the outer wall of the bottom plate hollow cylindrical elevation is also co-extensive with each of three solid rectangularly shaped abutments jutting therefrom and reaching to the outer rim of the top side of the bottom plate. The long vertical central axis of symmetry of each abutment is 120.degree. removed from the long vertical central axes of the two adjacent abutments. In each of these abutments near the outer rim of the top plate is a closed hole just large enough to receive the bottom portions of each one of the abovementioned pins each holding a beveled blade when the top plate and bottom plate are assembled to one another. Extending from and co-extensive with the outer surface of the hollow cylindrically shaped elevation on the top side of the bottom plate and co-extensive with the top outer surface of the concave shaped elevation of the bottom plate are each of two rounded convex ridges 180.degree. removed from one another that each fit respectively snug into one of the abovementioned concave depressions in the bottom side of the top plate when the two plates are assembled together. When the two plates with pins and blades are assembled together, they are then fitted to the rotatory head of a motorized brush cutter stem, top side of top plate first and affixed thereto by way of an appropriate nut and bolt combination depending on the type of head to be fitted to. The instant invention so affixed to a rotatory head is then ready to serve as a heavy duty vegetation cutting tool. There is a virtually never ending need for the expeditious commercial forging of ski trails, snowmobile trails, cross-country trails, horse trails and commercial clearing of power line rights-of-way and golf courses throughout the country. Such undertakings often prove to be laborious, time-consuming and relatively expensive. The instant invention however serves to greatly minimize such labor, time and cost. To begin with, one of the major problems with respect to the utilization of any currently used brushcutting device is the one wherein invariably it proves virtually impossible to cut level to ground. Consequently, after cutting, there are nevertheless vestiges of stumps still left standing that can prove to be problematic with respect to vehicular tires or to ski units after cutting. The instant invention unlike all of the prior art however permits cutting right level to ground rather than only to a level of two inches or so above ground such that therefore such problems associated with stump vestiges are totally eliminated. Additionally, the plates of the instant invention being made of ALMAG 35, an alloy of aluminum and magnesium make for a much lighter cutting tool to be fitted to the head of a brush cutting stem unit. Ease of use by a workman is thus greatly facilitated. The instant invention consisting of two plates, one with three press fitted pins and three freely rotatable beveled blades is extremely easy to assemble. This feature together with its relatively light weight as well as its facility for absorbing the shock of cutting and thereby greatly reducing any flow of cutting shock up the stem of a brush cutter renders the instant invention inherently much more user friendly than any of the various currently in vogue cutting tools utilized for such clearing. Also, the instant invention is amenable to being fitted to a counterclockwise turning rotatory head or to one that turns clockwise simply by fitting its three blade components to its pin components during assembly such that blade beveled ends face in the direction of rotation of the head. If a user cuts right to left when utilizing a cutter with a counterclockwise turning head, he or she will avoid kickback when hitting a tree, once again due to the swivel capability of each of the invention's blade components held by its press fitted pins. This feature of swivelability about pins permits a simple collapsing inward of blades upon impact with rocks thereby alleviating problems associated with rock impact shock. Also, the plate components are rust proof and shatterproof under all conditions of cutting thereby rendering the instant invention eminently more durable and inherently much safer than any of the cutting tools currently in use for such heavy brush and stump cutting purposes in areas where lots of rocks are located. Finally, unlike any other cutting tool available for clearing heavy, thick brush and small tree stumps during the course of a significant commercial undertaking, deformation with use and wear to the extent it might ever occur at all occurs only uniformly throughout the whole tool by virtue of the manner in which the two plates fit together when assembled. Also, blades of varying length and hardness can be utilized in conjunction with the plates and pins. Short, relatively thick blades are particularly useful to cut small tree stumps flush to the level of ground. Longer not quite so thick blades serve to cut heavy clumps of grass and weeks flush to the level of ground. Respectfully submitted, the instant invention in view of its above-described user and rock friendly features that enable heavy vegetation cutting and clearing to be undertaken on the average 27 percent faster on the basis of studies conducted by your inventor comparing its capabilities to other cutting heads currently in use render it indeed not only new, useful and unique but indeed virtually revolutionary in the art of brush cutting tools."
6506243,Environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends,1999-05-05,0,1,"FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the selection and use of environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends which exhibit low or reduced reactivity with respect to ozone formation. These environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends are useful in a number of applications, particularly as industrial solvents, and allow formulators an effective means to improve the environmental performance of their formulations or products. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fluid applications are broad, varied, and complex, and each application has its own set of characteristics and requirements. Proper fluid selection and fluid blend development have a large impact on the success of the operation in which the fluid is used. For instance, in a typical industrial coatings operation, a blend of several fluids is used in order to get an appropriate evaporation profile. Such a blend must also provide the appropriate solvency properties, including formulation stability, viscosity, flow/leveling, and the like. The fluid blend choice also affects the properties of the dry film, such as gloss, adhesion, and the like. Moreover, these and other properties may further vary according to the application method (e.g., spray-on), whether the substrate is original equipment (OEM), refinished, etc., and the nature of the substrate coated. Other operations involving the use of fluids and fluid blends include cleaning, printing, delivery of agricultural insecticides and pesticides, extraction processes, use in adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, and drilling muds, and countless others. The term """"fluid"""" encompasses the traditional notion of a solvent, but the latter term no longer adequately describes the possible function of a fluid or blend in the countless possible operations. As used herein the term """"fluid"""" includes material that may function as one or more of a carrier, a diluent, a surface tension modifier, dispersant, and the like, as well as a material functioning as a solvent, in the traditional sense of a liquid which solvates a substance (e.g., a solute). The term """"industrial solvent"""" applies to a class of liquid organic compounds used on a large scale to perform one or more of the numerous functions of a fluid in a variety of industries. Relatively few of the large number of known organic compounds that could be used as fluids find use as industrial solvents. Fluids that are used in large quantities have heretofore been selected because they can be produced economically and have attractive safety and use characteristics in manufacturing, consumer and commercial environments. Examples of commercial solvents and their uses as industrial solvents are described in an article entitled """"Solvents, Industrial"""", by Don A. Sullivan, Shell Chemical, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th. ed., V. 22, pp.529-571(III) (1997). In addition to the problems with fluid and fluid blend selection mentioned at the outset, there is also the problem that, in most applications, at least some of the fluid evaporates and can escape into the environment. Although many industrial coating operations, such as in original equipment manufacturing (OEM), utilize control equipment to capture or incinerate >95% of the solvent emissions, nevertheless in a majority of applications some of the solvents inevitably enters the atmosphere. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six pollutants: ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and particulates. Of all the NAAQS standards, ozone non-attainment has the greatest impact on solvent operations. Solvents typically are volatile organic compounds (VOC), which are involved in complex photochemical atmospheric reactions, along with oxygen and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere under the influence of sunlight, to produce ozone. Ozone formation is a problem in the troposphere (low atmospheric or """"ground-based""""), particularly in an urban environment, since it leads to the phenomenon of smog. Since VOC emissions are a source of ozone formation, industrial operations and plants using solvents are heavily regulated to attain ozone compliance. As different regulations have been adopted, the various approaches to controlling pollution have evolved. Certain early regulations controlled solvent composition, while later regulations primarily concerned overall VOC reduction. According to current VOC emission regulations in the U.S.A., solvents generally belong to one of two groups depending on their reactivity toward atmospheric photochemical ozone formation: (a) Negligible reactivity organic compounds which generate about the same or less quantity of ozone as would be produced by the same weight % as ethane. These organic compounds are exempt from the definition of a VOC and are not considered to be a VOC in any solvent (fluid) composition. There are numerous such compounds exempted by the EPA from the definition of VOC. However, a majority of such exempted compounds are halogenated derivatives which can possess one or more of the following deficiencies: toxicity, ozone depletion, or waste disposal or incineration problems. Other non-halogenated, oxygenated organic compounds, such as acetone and methyl acetate, have been exempted by the EPA, but such compounds have extremely high evaporation rates and high flammability so as to reduce their applicability in numerous applications. Other such organic compounds, such as tertiary butyl acetate which is under exemption consideration by the EPA, while having a significantly improved flammability level and evaporation rate, may be too chemically and thermally unstable for many applications. (b) All other oxygenated and hydrocarbon solvents are considered to be VOC's and treated by the EPA as equally (on a weight basis) polluting. A more recent U.S. regulation has combined VOC reduction with composition constraints. While the traditional source of emission reduction is large stationary industrial facilities, the EPA and other governmental entities have turned increasingly to consumer and commercial products for reduction in their solvent usage as an additional means to lower VOC emission and therefore ozone formation. Numerous government and trade publications discuss VOC's, and information is readily available on the Internet. See, for instance, http://www.paintcoatings.net/VOCW97.html. Various measurements of reactivity with respect to ozone formation are known. For instance, reactivity can be measured in environmental smog chambers, or they may be calculated using computer airshed models. See, for instance, Dr. William P. L. Carter, """"Uncertainties and Research Needs in Quantifying VOC Reactivity for Stationary Source Emission Controls"""", presented at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Consumer Products Reactivity Subgroup Meeting, Sacramento, Calif. (Oct. 17, 1995). There has also been developed a """"KOH scale"""", which provides a relative scale of the reactivity of VOC with the OH radicals involved in the complex reactions that produce ozone. See, for instance, Picquet et al., Int. J. Chem. Kinet. 30, 839-847 (1998); Bilde et al., J. Phys. Chem. A 101, 3514-3525 (1997). Numerous other reactivity scales are known and new reactivity scales are constantly being developed. Since this is a rapidly changing area of research, the most up-to-date information is often obtained via the Internet. One example is Airsite, the Atmospheric Chemistry International Research Site for Information and Technology Exchange, sponsored by the University of North Carolina and the University of Leeds, at http://airsite.unc.edu. Another way to measure the reactivity of a chemical in ozone formation is by using a technique developed by Dr. Carter (supra) at the Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CERT), University of California at Riverside. The CERT technique measures """"incremental reactivities"""", the incremental amount of ozone that is produced when the chemical is added to an already polluted atmosphere. Two experiments are conducted to measure the incremental reactivity. A base case experiment measures the ozone produced in an environmental smog chamber under atmospheric conditions designed to represent a polluted atmosphere. The second experiment called """"the test case"""" adds the chemical to the """"polluted"""" smog chamber to determine how much more ozone is produced by the newly added chemical. The results of these tests under certain conditions of VOC and nitrogen oxide ratios are then used in mechanistic models to determine the Maximum Incremental Reactivities (MIR), which is a measure of ozone formation by the chemical compound in question. The State of California has adopted a reactivity program for alternative fuels based on this technique and the EPA has exempted several compounds due to studies conducted by CERT. See, for instance, Federal Register 31,633 (Jun. 16, 1995) (acetone); 59 Federal Register 50,693 (Oct. 5, 1994) (methyl siloxanes), Federal Register 17,331 (Apr. 9, 1998) (methyl acetate). CARB and EPA have uses a weight average MIR for regulatory purposes, wherein the weight average MIR of a solvent blend is calculated by summing the product of the weight percent of each solvent and its respective MIR value. A list of compounds and their MIR values is available in the Preliminary Report to California Air Resources Board, Contract No. 95-308, William P. L. Carter, Aug. 6, 1998. A table of known MIR values may be found on the internet at http://helium.ucr.edu/~carter/index.html. CERT obtains other incremental reactivities by varying the ratios of VOC and nitrogen oxides. A detailed explanation of the methods employed and the determination of incremental reactivities and MIR scale may be found in the literature. See, for instance, International Journal of Chemical Kinetics, 28, 497-530 (1996); Atmospheric Environment, 29, 2513-2527 (1995), and 29, 2499-2511 (1995); and Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 44, 881-899 (1994); Environ. Sci. Technol. 23, 864 (1989). Moreover, various computer programs to assist in calculating MIR values are available, such as the SAPRC97 model, at http://helium.ucr.edu/~carter/saprc97.htm. Any of these aforementioned scales could be used for regulatory purposes, however the MIR scale has been found to correlate best to peak ozone formation in certain urban areas having high pollution, such as the Los Angeles basin. MIR values can be reported as the absolute MIR determined by the CERT method or as a relative MIR. One common relative MIR scale uses the Reactive Organic Gas (ROG) in the base case as a benchmark. The Absolute Reactivity ROG is 3.93 g O3 per gram ROG. This value is then the divisor for the absolute MIR of other VOCs, if MIR is cited relative to ROG. Absolute reactivities related to the ROG with the above mentioned absolute reactivity 3.93 are provided in """"Updated Maximum Incremental Reactivity Scale for Regulatory Applications"""", Preliminary Report to California Air Resources Board, Contract No. 95-308, William P. Carter, Aug. 6, 1998. For the purposes of this invention and specification, unless otherwise specifically stated, all MIR values provided herein are Absolute MIR values. It is understood, however, that the Absolute MIR values can be converted to Relative MIR and back to Absolute MIR by division or multiplication of MIR by ROG. Current regulations based on VOC emissions do not take into consideration the wide difference in ozone formation among non-exempt VOC compounds. For example, two non-exempt VOC compounds can have dramatically different ozone formation characteristics. Accordingly, current regulations do not encourage end users to minimize ozone formation by using low reactivity solvent compositions. Although there are federal and state regulatory trends toward requiring the reduction of the reactivity of solvents, the number of exempt solvents is small and in no way satisfies all the other properties required for an effective solvent such as good solvency, appropriate flash point, evaporation rate, boiling temperature, chemical and thermal stability. Solvents currently viewed as essentially non-ozone producing are those which have reactivity rates in the range of ethane. Ethane has a measured reactivity based on the MIR method of 0.35. In fact, the EPA has granted a VOC exemption to certain solvents with reactivity values in this range including acetone (MIR=0.48) and methyl acetate (MIR=0.12). However, the number of known materials having reactivities of 0.50 or less based on the MIR scale is relatively small. Moreover, it is a discovery of the present inventors that many if not most of the known fluids having acceptable reactivities with respect to ozone formation have other unfavorable performance characteristics, e.g., poor solvent properties, low flash point, inappropriate evaporation rate or volatility characteristics, unacceptable toxicity, unacceptable particulate matter formation, thermal or chemical instability and as such have limited, if any, applicability in industry. For example, ethane is a gas under ambient conditions and hence is a poor choice as an industrial solvent. Methyl acetate has an excellent MIR=0.12, but a low flash point of about -12deg C.; acetone has an acceptable MIR=0.48, but is extremely flammable. As a further example, tertiary butyl acetate (t-butyl acetate) has an excellent MIR=0.21, but has limited thermal stability and is unstable to acid catalysts which may be present in an industrial operation. Regarding particulate matter, the EPA has recently proposed standards for particulate matter under 2.5 &mgr;m (microns) in diameter (""""PM2.5""""). See 61 Federal Register 65638-65713 (Dec. 13, 1996). The proposal sets an annual limit, spatially averaged across designated air quality monitors, of 15 &mgr;g/m3, and a 24-hour standard of 65 &mgr;g/m3. Numerous discussions of this proposed standard are available on the internet, such as at http://www.cnie.org/nle/air~html, which cites numerous references (such as Wolf, """"The Scientific Basis for a Particulate Matter Standard"""", Environmental Management (Oct. 26-31, 1996)). As far as the present inventors are aware, the prior art has not addressed ways of meeting these proposed requirements, much less in meeting these requirements in conjunction with ozone reduction requirements. Moreover, the present inventors have also discovered that in many applications, VOC exempt solvents cannot be used as a one-for-one replacement for conventional solvents. Rather the formulator must balance a number of performance factors to develop an acceptable solvent or solvent blend for a particular application. Some factors are more relevant than others for specific applications. Nevertheless, many performance factors are similar for a number of applications. Numerous attempts have been made to utilize the concept of """"environmentally friendly"""" fluids in practical applications. For instance, there are a number of cleaning and/or stripping formulations available that are said to overcome certain prior art environmental problems. Examples include a binary azeotrope of octamethyltrisiloxane with n-propoxypropanol (U.S. Pat. No. 5,516,450), hexamethyidisiloxane and azeotropes and other mixtures thereof (U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,403), a nonazeotropic mixture including a halocarbon and an oxygenated organic solvent component having at least 3 carbons, which may be, for instance, dimethylcarbonate (U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,080), and a composition comprising an amide and a dialkyl carbonate (U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,133). In addition, there have been a number of patents and literature references to materials intended to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as, for instance, blowing agents. These efforts address stratospheric ozone depletion, which is the opposite phenomenon addressed by the present invention. Examples include the use of dimethoxymethane and cyclopentane (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,631,305; 5,665,788; and 5,723,509), cyclopentane (U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,652) and polyglycols (U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,144). Still further, a """"non-ozone depleting"""" solvent comprising halogenated compounds and an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon compound having 6-20 carbon atoms is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,749,956. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,480 describes a method for reducing the levels of air pollution resulting from the combustion of diesel fuel in engines comprising blending dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with diesel fuel and combusting the blended fuel in engines. U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,144 also discusses the addition of oxygenates, including methyl pivalate (methyl 1,1,1-trimethyl acetate) to gasoline (as octane boosters). The problems addressed by these patents do not relate to the problem of industrial solvent evaporation. WO 98/42774 discloses solvent-resin compositions which """"do not contribute appreciably to the formation of ground based ozone"""". Organic solvents are selected based upon having """"reaction rates with hydroxyl ion slower than ethane"""", and generally selected from halogenated solvents such as chlorobromomethane, methyl chloride, and the like. The only non-halogenated solvents that are suggested are n-alkanes (C12 -C18), methyl and t-butyl acetate, acetone, dimethoxymethane, and mineral oils. However, heretofore there has been no general solution to the problem of ground-based ozone formation that also provides for a fluid with appropriate performance attributes for an industrial solvent. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends, their use as industrial solvents, and to a method of reducing ozone formation in a process wherein at least a portion of a fluid eventually evaporates. The fluids and fluid blends of this invention have been selected by the present inventors for their actual or potential low reactivity in the complex photochemical atmospheric reaction with molecular oxygen (O2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to create ozone. The present invention provides a means to reduce ozone formation by photochemical atmospheric reactions from a fluid solvent composition which is intended at application conditions to at least partially evaporate into the atmosphere. By properly selecting low reactive components for a fluid solvent composition, ozone formation can be reduced. For the purposes of the present invention three groups of reduced ozone reactivity fluids and their uses are described and claimed: (a) Low Polluting Potential Fluid (LPPF), (b) Very Low Polluting Potential Fluid (VLPPF), and (c) Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid (NPPF), according to the Absolute MIR numbers as follows: Fluid Solvent Designation Absolute MIR Low Polluting Potential Fluid >1.0-<=1.5 gm ozone produced/ gm fluid Very Low Polluting Potential Fluid >0.5-<=1.0 gm ozone produced/ gm fluid Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid <=0.5 gm ozone produced/gm fluid Where a composition is a blend of fluids, a weight average MIR (WAMIR) can be calculated as WAMIR=&Sgr;Wi*MIRi Where Wi is a weight fraction of solvent fluid component i and MIRi is the absolute MIR value of solvent fluid component i. For the purposes of the present invention, WAMIR will be the preferred method of measuring """"ozone formation potential"""" or OFP. It is preferred that the fluids and fluid blends also provide at least one other desirable performance property such as high flash point, low particulate formation, suitable evaporation rates, suitable solvency, low toxicity, high thermal stability, and chemical inertness with respect to non-ozone producing reactions, particularly with respect to acids which may be present in coating formulations. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the fluids are used in a blend with known industrial solvents or other fluids which present an environmental problem with respect to MIR or lack one or more of the aforementioned desirable performance properties, so that the new fluid blends will have lower MIR than they would without the substituted low ozone formation reactivity fluid or have at least one of the aforementioned other desirable performance properties. The present invention is also directed to a method of reducing ozone formation from atmospheric photochemical reactions in an application wherein a fluid eventually evaporates, at least partially, into the atmosphere, comprising replacing at least a portion of a fluid having a relatively higher MIR with a fluid having a relatively lower MIR. In the case where a blend results, it is preferred that the weighted average MIR of the blend be similar to or less than the MIR of a Low Polluting Potential Fluid, and most preferably similar to the MIR of a Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid. A fluid or fluid blend according to the present invention may be used in any process, e.g., any process using a fluid as a carrier, diluent, dispersant, solvent, and the like, on any scale, e.g., pilot plant scale, or industrial scale. It is preferred that the process be a stationary industrial process and it is preferred that the process is a non-combustion process. The present invention offers its greatest benefit from the standpoint of safety and health in large-scale industrial or commercial processes, particularly industrial coating processes or in formulations used in large quantities overall, albeit on a small scale for each individual use, e.g., by a consumer, such as in household paints, cosmetics, and the like. The ordinary artisan can readily differentiate between what is an industrial scale, pilot plant scale, and laboratory scale processes. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to identify liquid organic compounds not heretofore identified as low reactivity solvent fluids and have not been used on a large scale commercial basis to reduce ozone formation. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of selecting fluids and/or fluid blends for applications which release fluids into the air and wherein there is a need to reduce ozone formation due to low atmospheric or ground-based (tropospheric) photochemical reactivity, in order to replace conventional solvents and/or solvent blends currently used in various compositions or processes. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of optimizing compositions comprising an evaporative fluid by selecting a fluid and/or fluid blend providing a reduced MIR as well as at least one additional performance attribute selected from high flash point, low particulate formation, suitable evaporation rates, suitable solvency, low toxicity, high thermal and chemical stability. Still another object of the present invention includes the selection of fluids and/or fluid blends providing low reactivity in ozone formation having compatibility with a wide range of organic compounds of different polarity and molecular weights to make the fluids and/or fluid blends suitable for a wide range of compositions. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of reducing ozone formation caused by the release into the troposphere of a fluid or fluid blend in a process utilizing the fluid or fluid blend, comprising replacing at least a portion of the fluid with another fluid having a lower MIR. A further object is to provide a method of reducing ground-based ozone formation due to fluid evaporation without resorting to expensive control equipment to capture all fluid emission into the environment. Another object is to provide solvents that reduce ground base ozone formation without the use of halogenated solvents and their associated toxicity, incineration, and waste disposal issues. These and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent as reference is made below to a detailed description, preferred embodiments, and specific examples of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The fluids used in accordance with this invention have been selected for their low or reduced ozone formation potential (as reflected in their low or reduced MIR). The ozone formation potential of a composition or fluid solvent may be determined by any scientifically recognized or peer reviewed method including but not limited to, the MIR scale, the KOH scale, smog chamber studies, and modeling studies such as those performed by Dr. William P. L. Carter. Most references in the description of the present invention will be to the Absolute MIR scale measured in grams ozone produced/gram of fluid solvent. By """"low MIR"""" is meant that the fluids have an MIR similar to or less than 1.5 gram of ozone per gram of the solvent fluid. By """"reduced MIR"""" is meant that, in a process according to the present invention, a first fluid is replaced, in whole or in part, by a second fluid, the second fluid having an MIR lower than the first fluid. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine ozone reactivity of a material according to methods in numerous literature sources and tabulated data published in the open literature. It is mentioned that the terms """"replace"""", """"replacement"""", """"replacing"""" and the like used herein are not to be taken as implying only the act of substituting a second fluid (having acceptable MIR as described herein) in a formulation for a first fluid that may have been previously used in that and similar formulation(s), with such first fluid has undesirable MIR as described herein. Rather, the terms are intended to include the formulations themselves comprising a mixture of the first and second fluids, or one or more such second fluid(s) without any of said first fluid(s), as the fluid system of the formulation. In the case where no such first fluid(s) are present, the concept of """"replacement"""" is intended to refer to corresponding formulations that have only such first fluid(s) present instead of such second fluid(s) and therefore have a lower OFP. The MIR is preferably determined by smog chamber studies, modeling studies, or a combination thereof, but is more preferably determined by """"incremental reactivity"""", and still more preferably by the Absolute MIR, as discussed above. The MIR of a fluid used in this invention is preferably less than or equal to 1.5 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid, more preferably less than or equal to 1.0 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid, and most preferably less than or equal to 0.5 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid, but the benefits of the present invention are realized if ozone formation is reduced by replacing a first fluid with a second fluid, in whole or in part, wherein the MIR of the second fluid is reduced from that of the first fluid, even if the second fluid has an MIR greater than 1.5 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid. Therefore, it is preferred that the fluid according to the present invention have an MIR less than or equal to 1.50 and more preferably less than or equal to 1.00, still more preferably less than or equal to 0.50. In an even more preferred embodiment, the reactivity in ozone formation is preferably equal to or less than that of acetone and even more preferably equal to or less than that of ethane, by whatever scale or method is used, but most preferably by the MIR scale. Thus, in a more preferred embodiment, the fluid used in a composition according to the present invention will have an MIR less than or equal to 0.50, even more preferably less than or equal to 0.35. Specifically preferred fluids according to the present invention include: dialkyl carbonates, such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl ethyl carbonate, methyl isopropyl carbonate, methyl sec-butyl carbonate, methyl t-butyl carbonate, methyl neopentyl carbonate, and diisopropyl carbonate; alkyl acetates, such as neopentyl acetate, ethylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-butylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-butylene glycol diacetate, 2,3-butylene glycol diacetate, neopentyl glycol diacetate; dioxolanes such as 2,2-dimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4-trimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4,5-tetra methyl dioxolane; pivalates such as methyl pivalate (methyl 1,1,1-trimethyl acetate), ethyl pivalate, isopropyl pivalate, t-butyl pivalate (TBP), neopentyl pivalate (NPP), 1,2-propylene glycol bis-pivalate (PGBP), ethylene glycol bis-pivalate, ethylene glycol monopivalate, 1,2-butylene glycol mono-pivalate (1,2-BGMP), 2,3-butylene glycol monopivalate (2,3-BGMP), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 2,3-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (2,3-BGPA), ethylene glycol pivalate acetate, 1,2 propylene glycol monopivalate, neopentyl glycol mono pivalate, and 1,2-propylene glycol pivalate acetate; isobutyrate compounds such as isopropyl isobutyrate, neopentyl isobutyrate, and neopentyl glycol mono isobutyrate; and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanonitrile (TMPN); isopropyl neononanoate; pivalonitrile; methyl 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanoate (methyl neononanoate) and methyl 3,5,5 trimethyl hexanoate. Other preferred fluids are oxygenated (oxygen containing) organic compounds substantially free of moieties containing unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds or aromatic groups. In the case of a blend, the weighted average MIR of the fluids in a composition according to the present invention will also have the perferred, more preferred, and most preferred MIR levels as discussed above. In another preferred embodiment, wherein the blend results from replacing part of a first fluid with a second fluid and thereby reducing the weight average MIR, it is preferred that the weight average MIR be reduced 10%, more preferably 25%, still more preferably 50%, from the MIR calculated prior to the fluid replacement. In yet another preferred embodiment, the Low Polluting Potential Fluids (LPPF), Very Low Polluting Potential Fluids (VLPPF), and Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluids (NPPF), as described herein will provide at least one other desirable performance property such as high flash point low particulate formation, suitable evaporation rates, suitable solvency, low toxicity, high thermal stability, and chemical inertness. Of course, it is more preferable that the fluid or blends have two or more of these performance attributes, and so on, so that the most preferred fluid or fluid blend has all of these performance attributes. In the case of a process of reducing ozone formation, wherein a fluid according to the present invention replaces a fluid, at least in part, having a higher MIR, described in more detail below, it is preferred that this fluid replacement process, in addition to reducing ozone formation does not negatively impact any other desirable performance attributes of the composition as described above. The flash point of a fluid according to the present invention is preferably at least -6.1deg C. or higher, more preferably greater than +6.0deg C., even more preferably greater than 15deg C., still more preferably greater than 25deg C., yet even more preferably greater than 37.8deg C., and most preferably greater than 60deg C. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine the flash point of a fluid or blend (e.g., ASTM D92-78). In the case of a blend, the flash point of the blend may be the flash point of the more volatile component, in the instance where the flash points of the individual components differ markedly or where the more volatile component is the predominant component. The flash point of the blend may be in between the flash points of the individual components. As used herein, the term """"flash point"""" will refer to the flash point experimentally determined for a single fluid or a blend, as applicable. The fluid or blend thereof, according to the present invention, should preferably not contribute measurably to particulate formation of particulates having a size diameter below 2.5 &mgr;m--referred to as 2.5PM herein--in the atmosphere. In a preferred embodiment of a process of reducing ozone formation, the fluid selected to replace a previously-used solvent will be one that also reduces particulate matter to less than or equal to 65 &mgr;g/m3, and more preferably less than or equal to 50 &mgr;g/m3, when measured over a 24-hour period, preferably spatially averaged over all monitors in a given geographic area. The evaporation rate should be suitable for the intended purpose. In many if not most applications, the fluid according to the present invention will be used to replace, at least in part, a fluid which is environmentally disadvantaged, meaning it has a reactivity in ozone formation greater than 1.5 in Absolute MIR units. The fluid selected preferably will have a similar evaporation rate to the disadvantaged fluid being replaced, particularly in the case where a fluid blend is used and an acceptable evaporation profile is desired. It is convenient for the fluid selected to have an evaporation rate less than 12 times the evaporation rate of n-butyl acetate. Evaporation rates may also be given relative to n-butyl acetate at 1.0 (ASTM D3539-87). Ranges of evaporation rates important for different applications are 5-3, 3-2, 2-1, 1.0-0.3, 0.3-0.1, and 25% of the fluid is evaporated, more preferably when >50% of the fluid is evaporated, more preferably when >80% of the fluid is evaporated, more preferably when >95% of the fluid is evaporated, and most preferably when >99% of the fluid is evaporated. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention wherein, in a method of reducing ozone formation, a fluid according to the present invention replaces, at least in part, another fluid not according to the present invention, the fluid replaced has an evaporative rate ranging from that of MEK (methyl ethyl ketone) to less than that of n-butyl acetate. The fluid or fluid blend according to the present invention may act in the traditional manner of a solvent by dissolving completely the intended solute or it may act to disperse the solute, or it may act otherwise as a fluid defined above. It is important that the solvency of the fluid be adequate for the intended purpose. In addition to the required solvency, the formulated product must be of a viscosity to enable facile application. Thus, the fluid or fluid blend must have the appropriate viscosities along with other performance attributes. One of ordinary skill in the art, in possession of the present disclosure, can determine appropriate solvent properties, including viscosity. Toxicity relates to the adverse effect that chemicals have on living organisms. One way to measure the toxic effects of a chemical is to measure the dose-effect relationship; the dose is usually measured in mg of chemical per kg of body mass. This is typically done experimentally by administering the chemical to mice or rats at several doses in the lethal range and plotting the logarithm of the dose versus the percentage of the population killed by the chemical. The dose lethal to 50% of the test population is called the median lethal dose (LD50) and is typically used as a guide for the toxicity of a chemical. See, for instance, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth Edition, Vol. 24, pp. 456-490. Currently an LD50 of >500 mg/kg qualifies as """"not classified"""" for oral toxicity under OSHA rules. EU (European Union) uses a cutoff of >2,000 mg/kg. It is preferred that the fluid or fluid blend according to the present invention have an oral rat LD50 of >500 mg/kg, more preferably >1000 mg/kg, still more preferably >2,000 mg/kg, even more preferably >3,000 mg/kg, and most preferably >5,000 mg/kg. Likewise, the fluid or blend should also cause no toxicity problems by dermal or inhalation routes and should also not be an eye or skin irritant, as measured by OSHA or European Union (EU) standards. As described above, the present invention is related to fluid solvents and fluid solvent blends which produce reduced ozone formation due to atmospheric photochemical reactions and which avoid the deficiencies associated with halogenated organic compounds, particularly toxicity, ozone depletion, incineration by-products and waste disposal problems. In this aspect, the volatile components of the preferred fluid solvents and fluid solvent blends preferably do not have more than 2.0 wt. % of halogen and more preferably less than 0.5 wt. %, and most preferably less than 0.1 wt. %. The fluid according to the present invention should be thermally stable so that it does not break down. For instance, the material should not break down into reactive species. In a preferred embodiment, the fluid is more thermally stable than t-butyl acetate. Inertness, as used herein, refers to the lack of a tendency to undergo decomposition with other materials in the fluid system. It may include, for example, inertness towards acids or bases, but particularly to acid catalysts, which are typically present in coating compositions. It is preferred that the fluid being replaced have an MIR greater than that of acetone. In another embodiment, the incremental reactivity, based on the MIR scale, of the fluid being replaced is preferably >0.50, still more preferably >0.1.00, and most preferably >1.50. In another embodiment, it is critical that in a process of reducing tropospheric ozone formation according to the present invention, the fluid replaced have a greater MIR than the fluid added, that is, the fluid according to the present invention. Of course it is to be recognized that only a portion of the higher MIR fluid need be replaced, thus obtaining a blend, in order to achieve the ozone formation reduction. However, in another embodiment of the present invention, the fluid being replaced may have an acceptable MIR, but be unacceptable with respect to one or more of the aforementioned performance attributes of flash point or flammability, particulate formation, evaporation rate, solvency, toxicity, thermal stability, or inertness. Examples of a given blend of DMC and MEK will be provided wherein the appropriate addition of DMC (or """"replacement"""" of acetone) provided for an improvement in at least one of these attributes. Examples of fluids which are replaced by fluids according to the present invention include aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon fluids such as: branched C6-C9 alkanes, straight chain alkanes, cycloaliphatic C6-C10 hydrocarbons, natural hydrocarbons (alpha or beta pinenes, or turpentines, etc.), ethanol, propanol and higher nontertiary alcohols, C3 and higher ethers, ether alcohols, ether alcohol acetates, ethyl ethoxy propionate, C5 and higher ketones, cyclic ketones, etc., C7+aromatic hydrocarbons; halocarbons, particularly chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons; and ethers such as cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF),. Examples of other common industrial solvents which may be replaced by fluids according to the present invention are those listed in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth Edition, Vol. 22, p. 536-548. Some particularly preferred replacements, i.e., a fluid according to the present invention for a currently used industrial solvent, include: in any application, but particularly coatings applications, DMC or methyl pivalate for toluene, xylene, or t-butyl acetate; methyl isopropyl carbonate (MIPC) for xylene or methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK); and diisopropyl carbonate (DIPC) for methyl amyl ketone (MAK), propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMAc), or ethyl ethoxy propionate (EEP); in any application, but particularly consumer product applications DMC, MIPC, or DIPC for hydrocarbons; in any application but particularly agricultural applications, DIPC for aromatic fluids; in any application but particularly cleaning applications, DIPC or methyl sec-butyl carbonate (MSBC) for chlorinated solvents; in any application, but particularly inks, substitute DMC or methyl pivalate for MEK and light acetates. The fluids and blends according to the present invention may be used in any process using a fluid, and particularly those process wherein at least a portion of the fluid evaporates and even more particularly wherein at least a portion evaporates into the atmosphere. Preferred processes are those utilizing the fluid as one or more of a carrier, diluent, dispersant, solvent, and the like, include processes wherein the fluid functions as an inert reaction medium in which other compounds react; as a heat-transfer fluid removing heat of reaction; to improve workability of a manufacturing process; as a viscosity reducer to thin coatings to application viscosity; as an extraction fluid to separate one material from another by selective dissolution; as a tackifier or to improve adhesion to a substrate for better bonding; as a dissolving medium to prepare solutions of polymers, resins, and other substances; to suspend or disperse pigments and other particulates; and the like. It is preferred that the process be a stationary process and also preferred that the process be a non-combustion process. It is particularly beneficial if the fluid according to the present invention be used to replace at least a portion of a traditional industrial solvent in a process using a large amount of fluid, e.g., a process using 1000 lb/year (500 kg/year), even more preferably 5 tons/year (5000 kg/yr), still more preferably 50 tons/year (50,000 kg/yr), and most preferably one million lbs/year (500,000 kg/yr). In a preferred embodiment, the process wherein the aforementioned fluid replacement occurs is on the scale of at least pilot plant-scale or greater. It is also preferred that the process in which a fluid or blend according to the present invention is used or in which at least one fluid according to the present invention replaces, at least partially, a fluid having a higher MIR, be a process in which the fluid is intended to evaporate, such as in a coating process. In such a process were the fluid is intended to evaporate, it is preferred that at least 10% of the fluid or fluids evaporate, more preferably 20% of the fluids, and so on, so that it is most preferable if >99% of the fluid or fluids present in the coating evaporate. Furthermore, one of the greatest environmental benefits of replacing a currently-used industrial solvent with a solvent according to the present invention will be realized if performed in a geographic area where monitoring for ozone and particulate matter formation occurs, and more particularly in geographic areas defined by a city and its contiguous area populated by at least 500,000 persons, and wherein the replacement of at least a portion of the currently-used industrial solvent with a fluid according to the present invention causes at least one of: (i) a reduction in the ozone formation, as measured by either monitoring devices or by a calculation of the reduction using the MIR of the industrial solvent replaced and the fluid added according to the present formation; or (ii) a reduction in particulate formation of particles having a diameter less than 2.5 &mgr;m (2.5 PM), preferably measured as a 24 hour standard, more preferably wherein that reduction is from greater than 65 &mgr;g/m3 to less than that amount in a 24 hour period, still more preferably from greater than 65 &mgr;g/m3 to less than or equal to 50 &mgr;g/m3 in a 24 hour period; and more preferably both (i) and (ii). In another embodiment, there is a method of selecting a fluid for use in a process wherein at least a portion of the fluid eventually evaporates into the atmosphere, comprising selecting as the fluid a blend of: (a) at least one fluid A having a low MIR, preferably similar to or less than or equal to 1.50, more preferably less than or equal to 1.00, yet still more preferably wherein the MIR is less than or equal to 0.50 and still even more preferably less than or equal to 0.35; and (b) at least one fluid B characterized by having at least one unsuitable attribute selected from: (i) high MIR, preferably measured by the MIR scale, e.g., having an MIR>0.50, more preferably >1.00, and yet even more preferably >1.50; (ii) low flash point, preferably less than or equal to 37.8deg C., more preferably less than or equal to 25deg C., even more preferably less than or equal to 15deg C., yet even more preferably less than or equal to 6.0deg C., and most preferably less than -6.1deg C.; (iii) formation of 2.5 PM particulates (e.g., wherein said process, using fluid B, produces 2.5 PM greater than 65 micrograms per cubic meter or greater, as measured in a 24-hour period); (iv) toxicity, preferably those having an oral rat LD50 less than or equal to 1,000 mg/kg, and most preferably less than or equal to 500 mg/kg; (vi) thermal stability, preferably having a thermal stability equal to or less than (more unstable) than t-butyl acetate; and (vii) inertness in the fluid or fluid blend, particularly with respect to any acids or bases present in the fluid or blend. Preferred examples of fluid A include: dialkyl carbonates, such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl ethyl carbonate, methyl isopropyl carbonate, methyl sec-butyl carbonate, methyl t-butyl carbonate, methyl neopentyl carbonate, and diisopropyl carbonate; alkyl acetates, such as neopentyl acetate, ethylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-butylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-butylene glycol diacetate, 2,3-butylene glycol diacetate, neopentyl glycol diacetate; dioxolanes such as 2,2-dimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4-trimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4,5-tetra methyl dioxolane; pivalates (trimethyl acetates) such as methyl pivalate (MP), isopropyl pivalate, t-butyl pivalate (TBP), neopentyl pivalate (NPP), 1,2-propylene glycol bis-pivalate (PGBP), ethylene glycol bis-pivalate, ethylene glycol monopivalate, 1,2-butylene glycol mono-pivalate (1,2-BGMP), 2,3-butylene glycol monopivalate (2,3-BGMP), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 2,3-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (2,3-BGPA), ethylene glycol pivalate acetate, 1,2 propylene glycol monopivalate, neopentyl glycol mono pivalate, and 1,2-propylene glycol pivalate acetate; isobutyrate compounds such as isopropyl isobutyrate, neopentyl isobutyrate, and neopentyl glycol mono isobutyrate; and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanonitrile (TMPN); isopropyl neononanoate; pivalonitrile; methyl 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanoate (methyl neononanoate); and methyl 3,5,5 trimethyl hexanoate. Preferred examples of fluid B include aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon fluids such as toluene and xylenes; alcohols such as ethanol, n-butyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, and sec-butanol; esters such as ethyl ethoxy propionate propylene glycol methyl ether acetate; ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), C5-C10 linear ketones, cyclic ketones; halocarbons, particularly chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons; cyclic ethers such as THF, and non-cyclic ethers such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The present invention also concerns mixtures or blends of at least one fluid according to the present invention and fluids which are known to have acceptable low OFP, e.g., acetone (MIR=0.48), methyl acetate (MIR=0.12), tert-butyl acetate (MIR=0.21), tertiary butanol (MIR=0.40), dimethyl succinate (MIR=0.20), dimethyl glutarate (MIR=0.40), and propylene carbonate (MIR=0.43). Such blends can have some important advantages, for example, blends of DMC and MEK, or DMC and methyl acetate, as previously mentioned. These blends are also considered to be part of the present invention. In combination with fluids having an MIR higher than 0.50, the fluids still can provide significant reduction in ozone formation for blended fluid compositions with other important properties for the particular application. Therefore, fluid compositions with low or reduced OFP comprising solvents selected from the list above are important goals of the present invention, even if their weighted OFP is above 0.50 in the MIR scale. The fluids listed above are recommended to be used in solvent compositions intended for release into air and are required to provide low reactivity in ozone formation. The solvents selected according to the present invention can be used in blends with each other as well as in blends with other solvents (e.g., solvents B, above), different from the solvents of the present invention. When all solvents included in the blend have MIR reactivity~0.50 or less, the solvent blends also will have low atmospheric photochemical reactivity with MIR of about 0.50 and less. The present inventors have found that many solvent blends can have an MIR in the range of ethane or acetone, even though one component may exceed that range, and therefore in terms of reactivity toward ozone formation behave as exempt solvents. The range of reactivities in exempt solvents allows a selection of fluids with extremely low reactivity, with MIR number in range of &lE;0.35 and more suitably &lE;0.24. These fluids can be blended not only with fluids with reactivity based on MIR of ~0.50 or less but, with appropriately selected fluids with MIR numbers >0.50 and at certain ratios still form fluid compositions with weighted reactivity about 0.50 or less. These blends can significantly expand the range of properties of solvent compositions and provide formulators with necessary flexibility for different applications. The selection of fluids with MIRs >0.50 can be relatively wide, however, to achieve significant reduction in weighted reactivity to ~0.50 or less, it is recommended to choose solvent with MIR <1.5, suitably <1.2, and more suitably <1.0. The conception of blends demonstrating MIR of about 0.50 or less can be applied to other solvents with known extremely low reactivities. For example, methyl acetate has an MIR 0.12 but flash point ~-12deg C. Thus, methyl acetate can be blended with butyl acetate (MIR=1.00 and flash point 27deg C.) in weight ratio of 57:43 forming a blend with MIR=0.50, providing reactivity similar to exempt solvents. This blend would have a better flash point and lower evaporation rate, making it useful for many applications which methyl acetate could not satisfy due to very low flash point. Butyl acetate which is not an exempt solvent, would become part of a mixture which by its weighted reactivity would behave similar to exempt solvent and, therefore, constitute preferred solvent composition. This special case of blends comprising at least one solvent with MIR reactivity 0.50 which have their weighted reactivity about 0.50 or less is one very important part of the present invention. Among known solvents with extremely low MIR, suitable components for the preferred blended solvents are methyl acetate (MIR=0.12), t-butyl acetate (MIR=0.21), dimethyl succinate (MIR=0.20) and methyl siloxanes including cyclomethylsiloxanes. Blends of these solvents with other solvents with MIR >0.50 resulting in weighted MIR of about 0.50 or less for the blend are preferred solvents according to the present invention. However, some of the most interesting blends are the blends of at least one solvent with MIR reactivity 0.50, which can be generated with the solvents from the list of the present invention. The present invention offers fluids and fluid blends for use in a variety of industrial applications such as paints and other coatings, adhesives, sealants, agricultural chemicals, cleaning solution, consumer products such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, drilling muds, extraction, reaction diluents, inks, metalworking fluids, etc. Among the most preferred fluids according to the present invention are dimethyl carbonate and methyl pivalate. Table 1 demonstrates the extremely low relative reactivities--significantly lower than both acetone and ethane--of dimethyl carbonate and methyl pivalate. This data shows that these two compounds satisfy the EPA requirements for exempt solvents in accordance with current VOC regulations and demonstrating extremely low reactivity for the possible future reactivity based rules. Additionally, DMC is shown to be one of the lowest reactivity compounds among all currently known oxygenated compounds.

As seen from Table 2, Absolute Ozone Formation for different levels of NOx in ROG is highest for highest level of NOx scenario (MIR) and lowest for lowest level of NOx scenario (EBIR). As a result, Absolute Reactivity in atmospheric photochemical ozone formation for tested compounds is highest for MIR scenario and lowest for EBIR scenario. This data demonstrates the outstanding value as Low Polluting Potential Fluids (LPPF), Very Low Polluting Potential Fluid (VLPPF), and Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid (NPPF). Additionally Table 2b shows both compounds as having acceptable flash points, boiling temperatures, evaporation rates, low toxicity, good solvency and overall outstanding performance as versatile environmentally preferred exempt, extremely low ozone formation fluids (solvents) for a very wide range of applications.

DMC blended with another organic solvent would also exhibit other desirable environmental properties because DMC has a relatively high flash point and low toxicity. Again, heretofore unrecognized as a low OFP fluid, the Relative MIR of DMC is calculated to be 0.02, using the SAPRC97 model. The compounds presented in Tables 3-5 show calculated Absolute MIR reactivities for compounds useful as Low Polluting Potential Fluids (LPPF), Very Low Polluting Potential Fluids (VLPPF), and Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluids (NPPF) or as part of a fluid solvent blend. These fluids provide favorable MIR reactivities, a very wide range of evaporation rates, and a wide range of solvency and compatability with other solvents, polymers, pigments, catalysts, additives, etc., necessary for actual applications. All the compounds listed in the present invention, especially in Tables 2a-5, are very useful as substitute conventional solvents having an Absolute MIR between 1.5 and 3.0 and especially in solvents having high reactivity Absolute MIR greater than 3.0 in atmospheric photochemical ozone formation.

The most preferred use of the fluids according to the present invention is with any process wherein the reduction of ozone formation is desired, and more particularly in consumer products, and coatings such as auto refinishing, architectural and industrial coatings and paints. Paints and coatings comprise the largest single category of traditional solvent consumption, accounting for nearly half the solvents used. Fluids serve multiple functions in paints and coatings, including solubility, wetting, viscosity reduction, adhesion promotion, and gloss enhancement. Fluids dissolve the resins, dyes and pigments used in the coating formulations. Also, prior to application, it is common practice to add solvent thinner to attain the desired viscosity for the particular application. Solvents begin to evaporate as soon as the coating materials are applied. As the solvent evaporates, film formation occurs and a continuous, compact film develops. Single solvents are sometimes used in coatings formulations, but most formulations are blends of several solvents. In many coatings applications, the solvent system includes a slow-evaporating active solvent that remains in the film for an extended period to enhance the film's gloss and smoothness. Because of evaporation and the large amounts of solvents used in coatings, there is a significant amount of VOC emissions into the atmosphere. Resins which may be incorporated into compositions comprising fluids according to the present invention include acrylic, alkyd, polyester, epoxy, silicone, cellulosic and derivatives thereof (e.g., nitrocellulosic and cellulosic esters), PVC, and isocyanate-based resins. Numerous pigments may also be incorporated into compositions according to the present invention, and it is within the skill of the ordinary artisan to determine proper selection of the resin and pigment, depending on the end use of the coating. One of the cleaning applications is cold solvent cleaning which is used to degrease metal parts and other objects in many operations. Mineral spirits have been popular in cold cleaning, but are being supplanted by higher flash point hydrocarbon solvents due to emissions and flammability concerns. Efforts to eliminate organic solvents entirely from cleaning compositions have not been successful because aqueous cleaners do not have the performance properties that make organic solvent based cleaners so desirable. This invention allows formulators the option to seek the use of solvents with very low reactivity as environmentally preferred products meeting environmental concerns and customer performance concerns. A cleaning solution application which uses evaporation to clean is called vapor degreasing. In vapor degreasing, the solvents vaporize and the cold part is suspended in the vapor stream. The solvent condenses on the part, and the liquid dissolves and flushes dirt, grease, and other contaminants off the surface. The part remains in the vapor until it is heated to the vapor temperature. Drying is almost immediate when the part is removed and solvent residues are not a problem. The most common solvent used in vapor degreasing operations has been 1,1,1-trichloroethane. However, since 1,1,1-trichloroethane is being phased out due to ozone depletion in the stratosphere, alternatives are needed. Moreover, chlorine-based solvents have toxicity concerns. Thus, some of the low reactivity, high flash point solvents in this invention can be used in place of 1,1,1-trichloroethane and other halogenated solvents. An application that is similar to coatings is printing inks. In printing inks, the resin is dissolved in the solvent to produce the ink. Most printing operations use fast evaporating solvents for best production speeds, but the currently used solvents are highly reactive. Some of the previously described fast evaporation, high flash point, low reactivity in ozone formation fluids according to the present invention are suitable for printing inks. An application that is suitable to the low toxicity, high flash point and low reactivity in ozone formation fluids according to the present invention is agricultural products. Pesticides are frequently applied as emulsifiable concentrates. The active insecticide or herbicide is dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent which also contains an emulsifier. Hydrocarbon solvent selection is critical for this application. It can seriously impact the efficiency of the formulation. The solvent should have adequate solvency for the pesticide, promote good dispersion when diluted with water, have low toxicity and a flash point high enough to minimize flammability hazards. Extraction processes, used for separating one substance from another, are commonly employed in the pharmaceutical and food processing industries. Oilseed extraction is a widely used extraction process. Extraction-grade hexane is a common solvent used to extract oil from soybeans, cottonseed, corn, peanuts, and other oil seeds to produce edible oils and meal used for animal feed supplements. Low toxicity, high flash point, low MIR fluids and fluid blends of the present invention can be useful in such industries. In addition to the above-mentioned applications, other applications that can use high flash point, low toxicity, low reactivity in ozone formation fluids are adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, drilling muds, reaction diluents, metal working fluids, and consumer products, such as pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. The invention is further described in the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting. One of skill in the art will recognize that numerous variations are possible within the scope of the appendaged claims. Examples of Fluid Blends Having Negligible Reactivity Tables A and B below demonstrate fluid solvent blends may be created using (a) negligibly low reactivity fluid solvents and (b) low to very low reactivity fluid solvent in ratios which provide Weight Average MIR reactivity for the total solvent blend of <0.45 and therefore providing ozone formation similar to individual fluid solvents with negligibly low reactivity in atmospheric ozone formation. However, the blends shown in Tables A and B possess characteristics such as better evaporation profiles, flash points, as compared to the individual fluids. Table A demonstrates negligibly reactive blends based on a known negligibly reactive solvent--methyl acetate and other very low reactivity fluids previously known and from the present invention. In Table A the column with methyl acetate shows the minimum methyl acetate content that will provide negligible reactivity to the blend. As shown, all blends with increased methyl acetate content will result in reduced reactivity in ozone formation. However, a main interest in blends with reduced methyl acetate content that maintain negligible reactivity is in an increased flash point of the blend. As seen from Table A, especially advantageous are the two blends with the very low reactivity fluid solvents from the present invention, diisopropyl carbonate and ethyl pivalate which require the lowest levels of methyl acetate. This concept of blending the negligible reactivity compounds with low and very low reactivity secondary fluids that can provide Weight Average MIR less than 0.5 is also subject of this invention. Although it is not necessary that every component of the blend be selected from the list of compounds of the present invention, it should be noted that components selected from the list of the present invention provide especially desireable attributes to a finished solvent blend with reduced or negligible reactivity in atmospheric photochemical ozone formation. Advantages of the blends created with at least one compound of the present invention is further demonstrated in Table B which utilizes blends"
8354852,Wireless soil sensor utilizing a RF frequency for performing soil measurements,2010-01-31,0,1,"STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is related to a wireless sub-surface sensor having a radio for performing real-time soil measurements. 2. Description of the Related Art The prior art discusses other irrigation systems and methods. Closing an underground to above ground RF communication link is a challenging task. The challenge is typically due to difficult propagation conditions perpetrated by high water content as well as high conductivity in the soil. The moisture and conductivity vary over time depending on environmental stimulus. High water content increases the rate of absorption of RF energy. Salinity and moisture both change the die-electric constant of the soil, effectively detuning the antenna element as water content changes over time. In instances, it is possible to adaptively modify the antenna tuning elements, to attempt to tune the antenna to the current state of the soil. However, in some instances it may not be possible to overcome the adverse effects of moisture in the ground by direct tuning of the RF and antenna components on board the underground wireless sensor. In other instances, certain wireless sensing devices may not be able to adapt their tuning in close to real time to match the soil conditions. The Present Invention seeks to resolve the problems of the prior art. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a solution to the problems of the prior art. The inventors of the present invention noticed the dielectric of soil, and how it changes with moisture and salinity, which led them to believe that a radiofrequency (“RF”) antenna of a wireless sub-surface soil sensor may be able to be tuned based on moisture and salinity measurements. The inventors measured soil moisture and salinity using novel sensors which also provided the electrical properties of the soil in which the wireless sub-surface soil sensor was placed. These electrical properties affect the efficient transmission and range of an antenna. The inventors realized that an antenna could be configured to optimize transmission efficiency and boost range. Components added to the antenna circuitry controlled by the processor allow for the antenna to be tuned based on the electrical properties of the soil. RF impedances (complex resistances) are often characterized on a two dimensional SMITH® Chart. A discussion of SMITH® Charts is set forth in Designing Impedance Matching Networks With the HP 8751 A , Hewlett-Packard Company, 1990, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Another discussion of SMITH® Charts is set forth in Stephen D Stearns, Mysteries of the Smith Chart , Pacificon 2001, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The inventors noticed that if the antenna is tuned in a specific and novel manner, its impedance is shifted in an arc around the ideal match (about 50 ohms) as moisture levels in the soil changed. By characterizing the arc by a radius and angle, the inventors were able to tune the radius to remain nearly constant. Only the phase angle of the impedance changed. The inventors designed the physical antenna structure, board structure, housing (air space) and tuning elements to maintain a constant impedance magnitude. This became an automatic, adaptive RF tuning which improved antenna performance across a range of soil moisture levels. One aspect of the present invention is a wireless soil sensor comprising a main body having a sensing component, a removable sleeve positioned over the sensing component, a radio, a processor configured to utilize a RF frequency for performing soil moisture measurements. Another aspect of the present invention is a wireless soil sensor comprising a sensing component integrated directly with a radio and a microcontroller. The microcontroller is configured to utilize a RF frequency for performing soil moisture measurements. Another aspect of the present invention is a method for performing soil moisture measurements utilizing radiofrequency. The method includes transmitting a radiofrequency signal through a soil material at a set frequency and power. The method also includes measuring a signal strength for the radiofrequency signal received at a receiver. The method also includes comparing the signal strength to a table of signal strength correlated with moisture values for the soil material. The method also includes determining the soil moisture measurement from the table. The radiofrequency signal is preferably transmitted from a wireless sub-surface soil sensor to an above-ground receiver. Alternatively, the radiofrequency signal is transmitted from an above ground receiver to a wireless sub-surface soil sensor. The radiofrequency signal is preferably transmitted at a frequency of 2.4 GigaHertz. Another aspect of the present invention is a wireless soil sensor. The wireless soil sensor is preferably capable of measuring soil moisture, soil salinity and soil temperature, while buried beneath the surface and also capable of wirelessly transmitting the measurements to a receiver above the surface for eventual transmission to an engine for calculations and other outputs. The wireless soil sensor preferably has a tine sleeve for placement over a portion of the sensor. The sleeve is removed when the sensor is ready to be buried beneath the surface of the soil. The sensor preferably links to a controller, is preferably associated with a watering zone which is to be controlled by a controller. At least a portion of the sensor is preferably waterproof. The tine sleeve preferably has a small patch of exposed PCB conductor which is connected to another, which allows the sensor to assume it is in a hibernation state (for power savings, suppressed communications and suppressed emissions). Essentially, while the sensor has the tine sleeve attached, it is in an inactive state. The tine sleeve further protects the sensitive components of the sensor during shipment. Removal of the tine sleeve is an intuitive indication that the sensor is to be associated and buried. The sensor assumes a period of active communication so that a controller/interrupter can learn of its presence and prompt assignment to a watering zone or zones. After a set period of time, the sensor preferably assumes a normal sensing and broadcast mode. The tine sleeve further acts a physical receipt, allowing for marking with the date, position of installation and corresponding watering zones. The tine sleeve further provides the function of enabling safe transportation of the end-of-life or return for repair of the sensor to a factory or alternative site. The wireless sensor preferably infers moisture and salinity levels by measuring the dielectric constant of the surrounding soil. A radio antenna used to relay these measurements to a central controller is affected (de-tuned) by surrounding changes in the dielectric constant. The present invention can adaptively tune the antenna impedance match via RF switches and passive components based on moisture and salinity readings. This increases the communication range and reduces power consumption. A user interface for an irrigation interrupter preferably has a default display of 128 by 64 pixel. In a limited space, the display communicates a tremendous amount of information in an extremely intuitive way. Six columns for watering zones are used in the display. Each zone shows a moisture assessment of Ok, Wet, Dry, or Cold. Next to this is a visual indication of the moisture level in the zone, as reported by one or more sensors, adapted to a soil/plant type. A bar showing moisture level preferably has two marks indicating a lower level where no watering would be interrupted, an upper level indicating that all watering would be interrupted, and in the zone in between, a sensor for how much of the normal watering period will be allowed before a mid-flow cutoff attenuates watering. A bold OFF and ON indication blinks between the view and the underlying moisture status normally shown. The blinking behavior is set to occur when a zone input is active, and indicates the action being taken by the interrupter. Above the moisture indications is a row showing the control status of each zone—whether it is controlled by one or more sensors, or has been placed in manual ON or manual OFF. The user interface allows for determination of a manual mode with only a casual view of the user interface. The top line shows the system status (Auto, Bypass, Master, Slave) and the recent average of water saving, calculated by the percentage of time normally watering has been attenuated. Master and Slave are used to enable “chaining” of multiple interrupters together to control additional zones, preferably six at a time. At the bottom of the display, icons show whether one or more than one sensor is assigned per zone. A solid square is a sensor with no performance issues. A hollow square indicates low battery. A triangle indicates RF reception issues. A hollow triangle represents RF reception and battery issues. In such conditions, where information about soil moisture and salinity conditions at the time of attempted transmission is available to the wireless sensor, for example when there are on board moisture and conductivity sensor present, the wireless transmitter will perform a simple computation to determine whether its transmission will be successful given the network activity history and the soil moisture and conductivity levels. The wireless sensor will track the moisture and conductivity levels, and based on those levels will adjust its transmission attempts. The impact of this decision making is that it will predict when the transmission will fail, and thus refrain from transmitting. This adaptive adjustment of the transmission schedule will help conservation battery life for battery operated sensor nodes. This adaptive schedule will be effective for one way as well as two way communication links. However its impact will be most evident for two-way over the air protocols. It is an object of the present invention to provide a proprietary wireless root zone intelligence system that measures real time soil moisture, temperature and salinity. It is an object of the present invention to provide an advanced wireless sensor and analytical, intuitive, fully interactive software. It is an object of the present invention to optimize turf health and playability, improve product quality, optimize resource utilization. Having briefly described the present invention, the above and further objects, features and advantages thereof will be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings."

6299663,Granulation method and apparatus therefor,1998-05-11,0,1,"The present invention is directed to a series of products formed by a pan granulation method for forming granules and more particularly, the present invention is directed to an improved fertilizer granule as well as additional granules. Generally speaking, pan granulation has been proposed in the art many times previously and with significant variations. One of the latest issued patents in the art to which the present invention relates is U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,765, issued to Derdall et al., Oct. 24, 1995. The reference teaches a process for pan granulating a particulate material. Based on the teachings of the Derdall et al. reference, a final particle size distribution that is achievable by practicing the invention is between about -5 mesh to about +10 mesh. In order to initiate the process, the Derdall et al. process is limited to the introduction of a seeding material typically between about -14 mesh and +28 mesh. This is required in order to control the granule growth and as indicated in the Derdall et al. disclosure, seed minimizes mutual agglomeration and results in high yields being obtained. The Derdall et al. reference further indicates that the proper sizing of the seed is fundamental to the operation of the process for granulation in order to have product yields exceed 90%. Reference is made in the disclosure that a seed core in the range of -14 mesh to +35 mesh is required in order to achieve a steady state and maintain uniform size distribution of between -8 mesh to +6 mesh. One of the greatest limitations existing in the granulation art is centered on the fact that known processes require a seeding agent in order to achieve the proper conditions for material accretion to result in a pellet or granule. By making use of a seed, the resulting granule is adversely affected in two key properties; roundness and cross-sectional uniformity. Typically, seeding material is not round and as the precursor particle, the result is irregular initial feedstock accretion which, in turn, forms an out-of-round particle upon which further material accretes. A further detriment from this results in terms of nonuniform particle density. Methodology is required for synthesizing a granule in the absence of seed material and which is round, tightly packed with a uniform homogeneous cross-section and capable of eliminating hazards associated with fertilizer granule production. The Derdall et al. process, although a meritorious procedure, did not recognize the limitations of employing a seeding agent or the need for controlling the dust generated during granulation which not only creates an unhealthy environment for workers, but more seriously, results in a potentially explosive environment. This is evident from the teachings of Derdall et al., particularly at column 3, beginning at line 24, wherein it is stated: """"It may be more difficult to keep the granulation steady or stable with fine seed, such as -35 mesh."""" The difficulty to which the Derdall et al. disclosure alludes is directed to cycling which is an inherent problem with pan granulation processes. If the size distribution of the seeding agent is not constant, then the process will not stabilize and effectively """"cycles"""" as is known to those skilled in this art. The result of this is that larger formed granules on the pan effectively destroy the smaller particles. This, of course, defeats the purpose of the pan granulation to generate particles. Furthermore, at line 36 in column 3, the disclosure indicates that: """"Fine seed sizes can be used, such as +35 mesh, but a point is reached where over-seeding or nucleation occurs easily and causes the final product yield to drop down."""" It is also indicated at column 3, beginning at line 45 that: """"Seed material in the range of 20 mesh is the best single point for each of control and uniformity of product size distribution . . . """" As is known, the larger the mesh numerical value the smaller the micron size of the respond to the stated micron sizes: Approximate Mesh Size Micron Size 12 1680 16 1190 20 840 30 590 40 420 100 149 200 74 Based on the teachings of the Derdall et al. disclosure, mesh sizes greater than +35 cause potential nucleation problems and result in a final product yield to decrease. With the technology disclosed infra, it has been found that by using a fine powder of between -35 mesh to +150 mesh, that a superior quality product can be formed in a high yield and typically in the range of greater than 90% yield. When the above passage regarding Derdall et al. is considered, it is clear that Derdall et al. effectively contradict what the technology set forth herein has found to be particularly successful. In the present application the size distribution of the nucleating material is between -35 mesh and +150 mesh which corresponds to micron size less than 590 .mu.m and 105 .mu.m, respectively. Nowhere in the prior is a powdered nucleating agent in this size distribution disclosed for purpose of forming a uniform granule in the size distribution of, for example, 3 mesh to about 10 mesh. Advantages have been ascribed to this process and one of the most attracttive advantages is that the granule or pellet has an enormous break strenght and a uniform cross-section, It has been found by practicing the present invention, that break strenghts in the range of 1 to 4 kg or greater have been achieved. In the Derdall et al. disclosure, at column 3, beginning at line 33 it is stated: """"Seed of large size forms granules of very poor strength."""" If one considers these teachings in light of the size of the nucleating agent provided herein, the admissions made in the Derdall et al. disclosure would clearly go against the appeal of using a seeding agent in the size range as clearly taught by Derdall et al. The instruction in Derdall et al. indicates an ideal seeding agent size is 20 mesh (supra); the instant application uses a powder having a particle size between 75-750% smaller than Derdall et al. and yet achieve very desirable results. In Statutory Invention Registration H1070, authored by Harrison et al., Jul. 7, 1992, a method for granulating potash materials is disclosed. The process involves the conversion of particulate potassium sulfate or potassium chloride by agglomeration using a conventional rotary drum granulator, pan granulator or other conventional granulating device. In the disclosure of this document, there are no specific teachings regarding the elimination of a seeding agent, feedstock size or other important factors related to process control in order to generate superior quality granules having commercial viability. Further, the process clearly is an agglomeration process. It is known that agglomeration typically involves the aggregation of colloidal particles suspended in a liquid into clusters or flocs. These clusters or flocs have varying degrees of interstice and are loosely bound (Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, eleventh edition, 1987). It would be desirable if it were possible to achieve a high yield granular product within specified mesh sizes which does not require the use of a seed in the process. The present invention is directed to satisfying the limitations in the art and more particularly those limitations in the Derdall et al. reference. One object of the present invention is to provide a granulated homogeneous fertilizer product having a uniform cross-section devoid of a seeding agent and having a break strength of at least two kilograms in a size distribution of 3 mesh to 10 mesh. A further object of the present invention is to provide a granule made in accordance with a method comprising the steps of: providing an initial feedstock having a uniform size distribution of about 99.9% particle size of -150 mesh and of said 99.9% particle size of -150 mesh about 90% comprising a particle size of -200 mesh; providing a nucleating material in a size distribution of 35 mesh to 150 mesh; providing a binder solution; contacting the binder and the feedstock in a pan granulator; and forming fertilizer granules directly in the pan granulator in the absence of a seeding agent. Advantageously, it has been found that the granulation process can be achieved in the absence of any seed material to result in a high yield product with high break strength in a single pan granulator. As an alternative the product may be formed in a two-stage method where an intermediate sized granule can be produced that is predominantly -8 mesh to +20 mesh in a first stage. This product can then be dried and screened such that the -8 to +20 portion of granules is used as a feed to the second stage. In the second stage, the -8 to +20 mesh portion may be added to a second stage granulator pan where suitable binder is added to grow the small balls into uniform sized +8 to -4 mesh granules or balls which are then dried in a dryer. The so-dried product may be then screened on -8 to +4 mesh to produce a new product in the form of a premium granular fertilizer, for example, break strength of greater than 1.0 kilograms (kg) with 3 to 4 kilograms (kg) being typical. The -8 to +20 mesh portion leaving the dryer may be recovered and recycled to the second stage pan. The +4 mesh and the -20 mesh portions may be sent to a suitable pulverizer for recycling. It has been found that the nucleation center in the size range of -35 mesh to +150 mesh may be employed as a basis for granule growth and further, that the nucleation center may comprise any suitable material known to those skilled in the art. As is known from prior art granules, the presence of a core, i.e. a seed significantly affects the quality of the final product. Since the seed is relatively large (14 mesh), such materials are often irregularly shaped which, in turn, leads to irregular feedstock accretion. This leaves the final product aspherical, loosely packed and with an irregular nonuniform cross-sectional appearance. By making use of a nucleating material which is a dust relative to the core arrangements in the prior art, the above limitations are circumvented. This feature has dramatic consequences in terms of cost savings as well as providing the user with the capacity to """"shell"""" or """"onion-skin"""" nucleation center with additional materials which may be similar or different from one another. This degree of freedom is obviously favorable, since multiple component homogenous granules can be readily produced. As an example, and without being limiting, the process is applicable to granule formation where the granule includes a base fertilizer material which may be surrounded by a coating having limited solubility in order that the fertilizer be a time release type compound. As a further example, the process is particularly well suited to the formation of novel water softener balls or granules for use in water softening systems. Additionally, specialty fertilizer grades may be easily formed using the process according to the present invention. Utility for the process can be realized for a plethora of particle types. As a further option, the process has applicability in other fields such as the preparation of ice melt product. As an example, for the formation of the sodium chloride granules, the process, according to one embodiment of the invention, permits the addition of Mg or CaCl2 to the sodium chloride to enhance the ice melt characteristics and make a more efficient ice melt product. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a host of additional examples may be achievable depending on the particular end use. In accordance with the further desirable features of the present invention, the provision of a plurality of pan granulators permits full control and customization of the granule characteristics. By using one or a plurality of pan granulators when the process steps are observed, the result is that the granule can be uniformly grown under stabilized conditions without continual cycling as is the limitation in the prior art where only a single pan is disclosed for use. By employing the process parameters and apparatus according to the present invention, progressive accretion of the material on the granule is possible to result in a high density packed pellet with extremely high break strength, solid, uniform cross-section and a user predetermined size. Significant additional advantages can be realized by the technology set forth herein including: i) an enhanced market value of the formed product; ii) the formation of a more user friendly product; iii) significantly improved product handleability; iv) a significantly improved uniformity index: v) no product loss or waste. vi) uniform cross-section; vii) tightly packed feedstock; viii) absence of a seed or crystal core; ix) increased break strength relative to the prior art; x) material homogeneity throughout the granule; and xi) greater quantity of feedstock material per granule The process and apparatus contribute to achieve a greater than 90% recovery of product which is on specification (spec) in the desired size range. Of the remaining 10% of the product, the same may be simply reintroduced into the pulverizer to create fines for reintroduction into the system. Accordingly, it will be readily apparent to those skilled that the process may be not only particularly useful for the user but further, results in monetary and energy savings from 100% use of the product. In view of the elegance of the technology set forth herein, the result is that the apparatus and method may be applied in a retrofit application to existing systems which cannot achieve the level of efficiency attributed to the present technology set forth in the present case; existing systems may be significantly improved by simply adding the apparatus of the present invention and the method disclosed herein to improve such systems. This is a further advantage of the present invention in that the method is interruptible and does not require any specific parameters in terms of temperature, etc. in order to operate efficiently. In this manner, the pan granulators, employed in the present invention, may be arranged in any number of ways, i.e. in series, parallel, towered, etc., and may include any number of compounds to apply any number of layers on a granule as the same is grown through the system. Having thus described the invention, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawing illustrating preferred embodiments."
10099947,Water treatment solution with chelating base product,2016-06-16,0,1,"BACKGROUND 1.

Description of Related Art Base products such as chelating agents have been blended with copper sulfate for various uses in water-based treatment systems. U.S. Pat. No. 4,564,504 to Sorber, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, discloses an early process (the “Sorber process”) that used water, ammonia, and sulfuric acid to produce a novel acid. The Sorber process involved a vat mixing batch process where sulfuric acid is slowly mixed to an aqueous ammonium solution. The Sorber process was performed in open vats and was dangerous due to the extremely exothermic nature of the reactions involved. The Sorber process may be termed a “cold process” as the mixing was slowed down to avoid excess heat generation and/or explosions from occurring. There have been several attempts to improve upon the “cold process” (Sorber process). Examples of these attempts are found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,595 to Cummins, U.S. Pat. No. 6,242,011 to Cummins, U.S. Pat. No. RE41,109 to Cummins, and U.S. Pat. No. 8,012,511 to Cummins, each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

5004026,Felling head,1989-10-06,0,1,"This invention is directed toward an improved tree felling head. The invention is more particularly directed towards an improved tree felling head of the type that accumulates cut trees. The invention is also directed toward a method of cutting and accumulating trees with the improved felling head. Felling heads for cutting trees are well known as are felling heads that both cut and accumulate trees. One type of felling head employs means to tightly grip the tree to be cut. While the tree is tightly gripped, cutting means on the head are moved and operated to cut through the gripped tree. The gripping means then release the cut tree. Grapple means may be provided on the felling head to accumulate one or more released cut trees while cutting continues. Cutting through tightly gripped trees can result in the butt end of the tree splintering as the cut nears completion. This is due to the tree occasionally being highly stressed when tightly gripped by the felling head. A tree with a splintered butt end is not as valuable as an unpslintered tree. One way to minimize splintering of the butt ends is to cut the trees without tightly gripping them. It is known to provide felling heads that cut free standing trees. This type of felling head has a fixed cutting means, usually a large circular saw, with a butt plate over a portion of the saw. The felling head is moved to have the saw cut the free standing tree which then rests on the butt plate. Grapple means are provided on the felling head to accumulate one or more cut trees off the butt plate while cutting continues. Often however, the just cut tree on the butt plate is unstable and it can fall of the felling head before it is trapped by the accumulating arms. The problems associated with splintering in cut trees, and with tree loss off the felling head, can be minimized by improving the handling of the trees by the felling head. It is therefore the purpose of the present invention to provide an improved tree felling head having improved tree handling means. It is more particularly a purpose of the present invention to provide an improved tree felling head with improved tree handling means that minimize splintering in cut trees. It is also more particularly another purpose of the present invention to provide an improved tree felling head with improved tree handling means that minimizes both splintering in cut trees and loss of cut trees off the felling head. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a felling head with cradle means for loosely receiving a tree and with retaining means on the felling head for loosely retaining the tree in the cradle means. In one embodiment of the invention, the felling head employs movable cutting means. The felling head is manoeuvred to place the standing tree to be cut within the cradles and the retaining means is operated to loosely retain the standing tree within the cradles while the cutting means is operated and moved to cut through the tree. The loosely retained tree is free to have some movement while being cut and therefore is not as likely to splinter as a tree that is cut while tightly held. Preferably, the felling head is provided with grapple means to accumulate one or more cut trees while still being able to loosely retain the next tree being cut. In another embodiment of the invention, the felling head employs a fixed cutting means. A butt plate is provided on top of a portion of the cutting means. The felling head is manoeuvred to have the cutting means cut through a free standing tree. The cut tree ends up on the butt plate within cradle means provided on the felling head. The retaining means on the felling head are immediately operated at the conclusion of cutting to loosely retain the cut tree on the butt plate and within the cradles to prevent it from falling off the felling head. The felling head is provided with grapple means to accumulate one or more cut trees while still being able to loosely retain the next cut tree. The invention is particularly directed toward a tree felling head having a frame with tree cutting means at the bottom of the frame. Vertically spaced-apart cradles are provided on the frame for loosely receiving a tree therein. Retaining means are provided on the frame between the cradles for loosely retaining a tree within the cradles. Means are also provided on the frame for supporting a cut tree by its butt end while retained in the cradles. Preferably, the felling head includes grapple means on the frame between the cradles to accumulate cut trees against the cradles in the frame. In one embodiment, means are provided for movably mounting the tree cutting means on the frame to cut through a free-standing tree that is positioned within the cradles by manoeuvring the felling head. The movable tree cutting means support the cut tree by its butt end while it is loosely retained in the cradles. In another embodiment, the tree cutting means are fixed on the frame, and the felling head is manoeuvred to have the fixed cutting means cut through a free standing tree. The cut tree support means comprise a butt plate covering a portion of the tree cutting means. The invention is also directed toward a method for falling trees using a felling head which comprises: positioned the felling head to locate a standing tree within vertically spaced-apart tree cradles on the felling head; moving retaining means to a closed position to loosely retain the standing tree within the cradles; and cutting the standing tree while loosely retained within the cradles. The invention is further directed toward a method for felling trees using a felling head which comprises; manoeuvring the felling head to have a fixed cutting means on the head cut through a free standing tree, the cut tree resting on a butt plate and within tree receiving cradles on the felling head; and moving retaining means to a closed position to loosely retain the cut tree on the butt plate and within the cradle means. The methods preferably include the step of tightly gripping the cut tree against the cradles with grapple means to hold the cut tree while moving the head to the next standing tree to be cut."
7294343,Biodegradable sorbents,2002-06-14,0,1,"The invention relates to a grain based material useful as a general sorbent. In some embodiments, the invention relates to the introduction of a material into an environment, the material being sorbed within the sorbent. These embodiments are particularly applicable to the introduction of a control agent, such as a mosquito larvicide, into an environment. In other embodiments, the invention relates to the removal of a material from an environment by sorbing the material within the sorbent. Many methods exist for removing an undesired material from an environment. For instance, numerous products are available commercially for removing spilled liquids from a surface. Some such products are used to remove oil from open water, such as when an oil spill has occurred. In this application, it is desirable to selectively remove oil from water. For such absorbents, efforts are sometimes made to increase the selectivity of oil over water. Currently available products for spill control include clay, kaolin, illite, bentonite, diatomite, hectorite, montmorillonite, attapulgite, silica, silica sand, polypropylene, sodium polyacrylate/polyacrylamides, vermiculite, gypsum, limestone, metal oxides, asphalt, fiberglass, diatomaceous earth, perlite and other materials. Such materials, while satisfactory in function, suffer from certain drawbacks. Many such products contain silica, which poses a hazard to humans. In addition, most such materials are not biodegradable, which is a factor that can limit the options for disposal of the used sorbent material. There are also several organic spill control products described in the art. Examples of such materials include natural fibers such as grass, pre-cooked cereal kernels, sawdust, cellulose, and peat. U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,881 purports to describe a cellulose based sorbent system, where the cellulose has been treated with an additive to render it both hydrophobic and oleophilic so it will selectively remove oil from water. U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,774 purports to describe the use of pre-cooked and puffed cereals for oil removal. Another document, U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,350, purports to disclose a particulate milled seed material in which the lipids have been removed through solvent extraction and wherein the material is designed to remove and disperse oil from open water and solid surfaces. The composition is a solvent-extracted proteinaceous material derived from grain products having oil sorptive properties. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,881 purports to describe the use of diatomaceous earth, clay, silica, corncob, peatmoss, perlite, polypropylene, sawdust, cellulose, polystyrene, vermiculite, peat and cork to absorb liquids. This composition is taught as a general absorbent; in this document, it is stated that materials that absorb both water and oil are undesirable. U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,937 purports to disclose the use of corn stalks, husks, cobs, and kernels as carriers. U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,323 purports to disclose the use of delignified waste from hulls, straw, stover, and shells as a carrier. Other carriers are purportedly disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,383,609 and 6,391,120. Generally, other biodegradable materials such as peat moss, sawdust, hair, feathers, cotton, cork, starch, bagasse, seeds, seed hulls, and other seed components have also been proposed. Many methods for introducing a material into an environment also are known. In many cases, it is desired to introduce the material in a delayed-release manner, by which is contemplated that at least some of the material is bound up with another material or otherwise is not immediately available to function in the environment for its intended purpose. For instance, it is often desired to introduce a control agent, i.e., a material that limits the growth or spread of a living thing, into an environment. Known control agents, such as insecticides, larvicides, rodenticides, fungicides, and so forth may be oil-based or water-based. It is desirable to provide a sorbent for such control agents, and in particular, it is desirable to provide a sorbent that allows delayed release of at least some control agents into an environment. Further, it is highly desirable to provide a sorbent that is useful in sorbing both oil- and water-based control agents. Typical control agents are provided in liquid or solid form. There are advantages and disadvantages to each product form. Liquid pesticides can be applied as a spray, which is advantages in some respect. Drift control of the spray can be a challenge, however, especially in an aerial broadcast application. Solid pesticide products are better at targeting an area for pest control, because there is less drift of the solid product. Pelleted or compacted compositions are typically used in solid pesticide products. The majority of such composition is composed of a carrier or absorbent material, and the active ingredient is usually a small percentage (<10%) of the pellet weight. Another advantage of a solid control agent composition is that the weight of the composition allows penetration into vegetative areas that are less accessible via a liquid spray. Heavier pellets often can penetrate through a tree canopy, whereas liquid droplets would tend to coat and contaminate the tree canopy. One drawback to many known solid pesticides products is that non-biodegradable carriers often are used in such products. These carriers can lead to contamination of the area of treatment. In recognition of this problem, numerous biodegradable carriers have been provided; examples include materials such as corncob, peanut hulls, and starches. Many known biodegradable carriers are unsatisfactory. In many cases, the resulting composition does not perform as well as a non-biodegradable product. In addition, many biodegradable materials such as corncob, peanut hulls, and starches do not disperse easily when in contact with water, leaving a contaminant residue. Corncob is especially poor in this regard, because it has low density as well as poor dispersibility in water. In addition, when a granular pesticide does not readily disintegrate in an aquatic environment, the active ingredient is not readily released and thus a less efficacious pest control product with residual contaminant pesticide activity is provided. In the case of mosquito larvicides, such materials ordinarily are released into standing or slowly moving water to destroy larvae growing in the water. It is particularly preferred that the carrier should release at least a portion of the larvicide within the topmost two feet of water in a standing or slowly moving water column, where most or all of the larvae are found. It is further preferred that the larvae in the water column be destroyed within 24 hours, and preferably within 8 hours of treatment. Although the prior art has provided numerous carriers for control agents, not all carriers allow for the preparation of a control agent composition that meets these preferred criteria. In a first preferred embodiment of the invention, it is a general object to provide a sorbent that is useful in conjunction with the introduction of a material into an environment. In a second preferred embodiment of the invention, it is a general object to provide a sorbent that is useful in conjunction with the removal of a material from an environment, the material being removed by sorption of the material into the sorbent and removal of the sorbed composition thus formed from the environment. THE INVENTION The invention provides a number of embodiments in which the sorbing properties of spent grain germ and seed meal are utilized. These organic, naturally derived sorbents, alone or in combination, can be used to introduce material into an environment, or to remove material from an environment. When such sorbent is used to introduce a material into an environment, the environment preferably is one in which the sorbent will biodegrade. In such instances, delayed release of the sorbed material into the environment often is possible. When the sorbent is used to remove material from an environment, the sorbed material composition can be allowed to biodegrade prior to ultimate disposal of the composition. Many of the disclosures in the prior art fail to address the fate of the sorbed composition formed upon removing a material from an environment. Generally, the volume of sorbent introduced into the environment is much greater than the volume of the liquid to be removed from the environment. Where the removed material is or contains a hazardous compound, the relatively large quantity of sorbent having the material sorbed therewithin must also be treated as a hazardous material, which can increase the ultimate disposal cost considerably. The sorbents useful in conjunction with the present invention can be biodegraded, thereby reducing the total volume of material that must be treated as hazardous. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a control agent composition is provided. The composition includes a sorbent, the sorbent being selected from the group consisting of spent grain germ, seed meal, and mixtures thereof, and a control agent sorbed within the sorbent. Most preferably, the composition is in the form of discrete plural pellets, by which is contemplated the product of a pelletizing operation in a pellet mill. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for limiting the growth of an undesired pest in an environment is provided. The method includes selecting a control agent for the pest, and introducing into the environment an amount of a control agent composition effective to limit the growth of the pest. The control agent composition includes a sorbent and control agent as described hereinabove. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for introducing a material into an environment is provided. A material for which delayed release into the environment is desirable is selected. Subsequently, a granular material composition that includes the selected material sorbed within a sorbent, the sorbent being spent grain germ, seed meal, or a mixture thereof, is introduced into the environment. The timing of the release of the material into the environment can be controlled to an extent by adjusting the integrity of the granules, whereby more durable granules generally will release the sorbed material more slowly than less durable granules. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for removing an unwanted material present in an environment is provided. The method includes selecting a sorbent for the material, introducing into the environment an amount of the sorbent effective to sorb at least a portion of the material, allowing at least some of the material to become sorbed to thereby formed a sorbed composition, and removing at least a portion of the sorbed composition from the environment. The sorbed material may be a combustible material, and, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a method for generating heat is provided, the method including providing a combustible material composition and oxidizing the combustible material composition. The combustible material composition includes a sorbent and a combustible material sorbed within the sorbent. Preferably, the combustible material is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight of the composition. The invention contemplates the use of a sorbent, by which is contemplated a material that absorbs and/or adsorbs another material. Generally, absorption is a term used in the art to refer to the penetration of one substance into the inner structure of another substance, whereas the term adsorption refer to adherence of atoms, ions, or molecules onto the surface of another material. It is believed that one or both phenomena occur in accordance with the various embodiments of the invention, but it is contemplated that the material may serve as a sorbent even if only one of the two phenomena is present. By “sorbed within” is herein contemplated the sorption of a material in or on the sorbent. The sorbent used in conjunction with the invention preferably is spent germ, which is a germ from which oil has been expelled, for instance, by pressing or extraction with an extracting liquid such as hexane or water. Spent grain germ material has numerous advantages, in that it is derived from natural, renewable resources, is biodegradable and safely incinerable, is nontoxic and safe for the environment, and is economical to produce and use. This material is able to sorb both hydrophilic and lipophilic liquids. The spent germ may be washed to render it substantially free of odor components. It is known that washing of the germ will remove substantially odor and flavor components, which may be an advantage in some instances. In other embodiments, unwashed germ may be used. Germ obtained from any suitable grain may be employed in conjunction with the invention. Grains such as corn, wheat, soy, sorghum, barley, and the like are particularly suitable for use in conjunction with the invention. The preferred sorbent is expeller-extruded corn germ. Virgin germ (i.e., germ from which oil has not been extracted) may also be used, whereby in the manufacture of the sorbent as described herein some or all oil present in the germ is extracted. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the sorbent used in conjunction with the invention may be a seed meal. Examples of such meals include linseed meal, soybean meal, sunflower meal, cottonseed meal, rapeseed meal, peanut meal, safflower seed meal, and combinations thereof. By “seed” is meant to include that part of a plant which is capable of forming a new plant upon germination, e.g., whole grains of wheat, including the fruit or fruit-like structure housing the seed. The seed meal comprises a spent oil bearing seed residue, which is a seed residue from which oil has been expelled, such as by solvent extraction or expeller extraction. The extracted residue then is ground, by which is contemplated the reduction of the residue to smaller particles, preferably to a semi-course to fine powder. It is contemplated that some seeds will include a hull that may (but need not) be removed prior to expelling oil and grinding. Thus, the meal may comprise a dehulled meal. The seed meal in some embodiments is washed to substantially remove odor components therefrom. The germ and seed meal component of the sorbent collectively should be present in the sorbent in an amount of at least 50% by dry basis weight of the sorbent. Preferably, the germ and meal are present in a greater amount, such as an amount of 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% by weight of the sorbent. Most preferably, the germ and meal collectively are present in an amount of 100% by dry basis weight of the sorbent, that is, the sorbent includes the meal and/or germ to the substantially or complete exclusion of other sorbents. With respect to one another, the germ and meal can be used in any ratio desired. For instance, expresses as a percentage, the ratio may be 100% meal, 90% meal, 80% meal, 70% meal, 60% meal, 50% meal, 40% meal, 30% meal, 20% meal, 10% meal, or 0% meal (i.e., 100% germ). Other sorbents, such as these described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,391,328, optionally may be used in conjunction with the sorbents described herein, but preferably, such other sorbents are not present. The sorbent may be used in conjunction with the introduction of a material into an environment. The environment can be any place, area, or region in which the introduction of the material is desired. Generally, the material is selected as being desirable for use in the environment. For instance, the material may be a control agent, by which is completed a material that limits the growth of unwanted pests in the environment. A control agent preferably is selected as being an agent that limits the growth of the pest, by which is contemplated checking the spread of the pest by killing, sterilizing, destroying eggs or otherwise limiting the growth of the pest. Control agents generally are toxic chemicals; in accordance with the invention, any control agent now known or otherwise found to be suitable for use in limiting the growth of a pest may be used. The pest may be present in the environment, or may not be present in the environment (in other words, it is contemplated that the environment may be treated prophylactically). The pest can be any organism whose presence in the environment is undesired. Any organism found in the Animalia, Protista, Fungi (in particular non-mold fungi), Plantae, or Monera kingdoms may be deemed a pest in particular circumstances, and the control agent may be any agent that limits the growth of such pest in the environment. With respect to animals, the pest may be mammal, for instance, a rodent such as a mouse or rat, or a non-mammal, such as a fish, bird or other animal. The invention is believed to be particularly applicable to the control of animals in the phylum Arthropoda, including especially the classes Insecta (representing insects, millipedes, and centipedes), and Cheliceramorpha, especially arachnids.

The invention is not limited to the foregoing, and indeed any material that functions as a control agent may be used in conjunction with the invention. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,911,952; 4,983,390; 5997,445; 6,159,489; 6,316,447; 6,335,027; and 6,340,656, all disclose numerous control agents, any or all which in certain embodiments may be deemed suitable for use in conjunction with the invention. The control agent or other material sorbed within the sorbent may be a lipophilic or oleogenous material, or may be a hydrophilic material or a combination thereof (such as an emulsion). The material may be present in any amount with respect to the sorbent suitable for the intended purpose of the sorbent/material composition. In some embodiments, the material is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight of the total composition, more preferably at least 7% by weight, and even more preferably, at 10% by weight. When the sorbed material is a control agent, the sorbed material preferably is present in an amount ranging from 0.001 to 50% by weight, more preferably, from 0.001 to 10% by weight, and even more preferably, from 0.005 to 5% by weight of the composition. In some embodiments, the sorbed material is present in an amount from 0.05 to 1%, or, within this range, from 0.05 to 0.5% by weight. More generally, any amount suitable for the intended purpose may be employed in conjunction with the invention. The composition optionally may include any other additives, which may be present in any amounts suitable for their intended purposes or omitted altogether. Examples of such additives include surfactants, spreading agents, adjuvants, other carriers, binders, deflocculating agents, dispersing agents, synergists, penetrants, suspending agents, baits, phagostimulants, sticking agents, stabilizers, coupling agents, foaming or antifoaming agents, diluents, waxes, oils, superabsorbents, and more generally, any other additives. The sorbents described herein are not limited to the introduction of a control agent into an environment. To the contrary, the sorbets can be used to introduce any desirable sorbable materials into an environment. It is contemplated that in some cases the sorbable material may be a solid material that is carried in or on the sorbent. In one embodiment of the invention, the sorbable material is a fertilizer. Any suitable material or synthetic fertilizer may be employed in conjunction with the invention. In one embodiment, the sorbable material is an animal nutrient, such a vitamin or mineral. These materials may be present in any amounts suitable for their intended purpose. The selection of specific ingredients, loading levels, and application rates may be made by one is skilled in the art. One embodiment of the invention encompasses a method for fertilizing an arable area by applying a fertilizer composition as described above. In another embodiment, the invention encompasses a method for providing nutrients to an animal, the method including feeding the animal an animal nutrient composition as described above. The animal may be for instance, a horse, a cow, a pig, a sheep, a bird, or even a human. The composition that includes the sorbent and sorbed material (including any additives) may be provided in any suitable form. Most preferably, the composition is provided in the form of discrete plural particles of a substantially uniform and homogenous admixture of the sorbent and the sorbed materials. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the particles are in a form of compressed or compacted particles, i.e., in the form of granules. By “granules” is meant particles that are compressed or compacted, such by a pelletizing, extrusion or similar compacting step. Such compression or compacting of the particles is preferred, inasmuch as the intraparticle cohesion of the particles will be enhanced by such compacting or compressing step. The granules may be prepared via any suitable manner. Preferably, the material to be sorbed, if not a liquid, is dissolved or suspended in a liquid and the liquid is applied to the sorbent, followed by compression of the mixture to form granules. In a highly preferred embodiment of the invention, the granules are prepared by pelletizing the sorbent in a pellet mill. The composition may be prepared by sorbing the material into pellets thus formed, or alternatively may be prepared by pelletizing a mixture of the material and the sorbent. In either case, the pellets exiting the pellet mill may be ground or crumbled to thereby reduce the granules of the composition to a desired granule size. The mixture may be pelletized under any suitable conditions. Typically, the ingredients are pre-ground and are introduced into the pellet mill with moisture. Typical moisture content ranges from 2-30%, more preferably 5-15% by total weight of the blend. The blend is pelleted through a die such as a 3/32 in×2 in die at any suitable temperature, preferably a temperature ranging from 150° F. to 220° F., more preferably from 180° F. to 200° F. Final moisture preferably is in the range from 4-20%, more preferably from 7-12% by total weight. After pelleting, the pellets may be cooled and crumbled through dry rollers to reduce the size of the granules (it is also possible to cut the pellets from the die). The final granule size may vary depending on the application. For an application such as mosquito control, the granule size preferably should be between 4 and 30 mesh (U.S. standard test sieve. ASTM E-11 specification) and more preferably should be between 6 and 20 mesh. Fines generated during the pelletizing process may be removed by screening, preferable on a 10-mesh screen to a level of less than 20% by weight and ideally less than 5%. Such fines may be recycled. In the pelletizing operation, use of a lubricity agent such as corn oil may be necessary or helpful. Other lubricants such as added corn oil or oils from soy, peanut, sunflower, rapeseed, canola, coconut, or cotton, or animal fats such as tallow, yellow grease, or white grease, may be used. Other lubricants include lecithin, waxes, fish oils, castor oil, long-chain alkyl sulphonates, alkyl poyglucosides, tall oil, stearates, and silicones. The lubricant (including any oil present in the germ) preferably is present in an amount of up to 30% by total weight of the composition (excluding moisture) more preferably, an amount of 10-15% by weight. Pelletizing is not the only manner of forming suitable granules. For instance, in another embodiment of the invention, extrusion of sorbent through a dye and grinding of the extrudate to a suitable granular size is useful in conjunction with the preparation of the composition. Once again, the extrudate may itself comprise a composition of a sorbent and the material to be sorbed, or the material may be sorbed within granules of extruded sorbent subsequent to extrusion. The granules should be sufficiently cohesive for use for their intended purpose. Especially when the granule is used as a carrier for control agent, the granule must have sufficient integrity to survive the production, transport, and application of the product. If the granule is too durable, however, it will not disintegrate easily, and may not be effective in releasing the control agent in the desired manner, for instance, when the granule is introduced into a water column. In embodiments of the invention where a delayed release of the control agent or other sorbed material is desired, the granules may be made more durable by incorporating additional binder or cohesiveness agent. The binder may comprise an extrudate of corn hulls and sodium hydroxide (as taught is copending application Ser. No. 09/901,342, filed Jul. 9, 2001), lignin, lignosulfate, hemicelluloses, celluloses, water, starch hydrolyzates, hydrogenated starch hydrolyzates, fatty acids, and clay materials such as bentonite and zeolites. In such embodiments, the binder preferably is present in an amount of about 5% by weight of the granule. In some embodiments of the invention, the granules may include a polysaccharide cohesiveness agent to enhance the cohesiveness of the granules. The cohesiveness agent is believed to provide additional hydroxyl groups, which groups enhance the bonding between grain proteins within the sorbent granules. It is further believed that the additional hydroxyl groups so function by enhancing the hydrogen bonding of proteins to starch and to other proteins. When used, the polysaccharide cohesiveness agent may be present in any amount suitable to enhance the cohesiveness of the sorbent granules. Generally, the cohesiveness agent may be present in a dry basis amount ranging up to about 45% by weight of the sorbent granules, preferably, an amount ranging from about 3% to about 35% by weight, more preferably, an amount ranging from about 5% to about 25% by weight. When the binder is or includes virgin germ, some or all of this may come from starch naturally present in the virgin germ In accordance with these embodiments of the invention, any suitable polysaccharide may be used in conjunction with the invention, and thus, for example, the cohesiveness agent may comprise one or more polysaccharides such as dextrin, maltodextrins, starches, flours, cellulosics, hemicellulosics, and the like. Preferably, the cohesiveness agent comprises a starch, and most preferably, the cohesiveness agent comprises a corn starch. When a polysaccharide cohesiveness agent is used, preferably a supplemental cohesiveness agent also is used. In accordance with the invention, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is an ionic species that is believed to enhance protein-protein and/or protein-starch interactions. Any suitable ionic salt may be used in conjunction with the invention. For example, in accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is selected from among the alkali and alkaline-earth salts of common anions, such as the halide, nitrate, nitrite, carbonate, phosphate, sulfate, and bicarbonate salts, and the like. More preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and mixtures thereof. Even more preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is selected from among sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, and mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is sodium chloride. The supplemental cohesiveness agent may be present in any amount sufficient to assist the cohesiveness agent in enhancing the cohesion of the granules. When used, the supplemental cohesiveness agent preferably is present in an amount of at least about 0.05% by dry basis weight, of the composition exclusive of the polysaccharide cohesiveness agent. More preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is present in an amount ranging from about 0.05% to about 10% by weight; more preferably, about 0.1% to about 8% by weight; and most preferably, about 1.5% to about 4% by weight. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is present in an amount of about 2% by weight of the composition. To prevent or inhibit spoilage, the sorbent composition may include a preservative. Preferably, the sorbent composition includes a mold inhibitor, which may be present in any amount sufficient to inhibit the molding of the sorbent composition. Any suitable mold inhibitor may be employed in conjunction with the invention. The mold inhibitor preferably is selected from among the propionate salts, and most preferably is selected from the group consisting of sodium propionate and calcium propionate. Other preservatives include sodium metabisulfite, citric acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, butylated hydroyxytoluene (BHT) butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and sodium benzoate. When a mold inhibitor is employed, it preferably is present in an amount ranging from about 0.02% to about 3.5% by weight. The mold inhibitor may function to some extent as agent for controlling mold if the composition is introduced into an environment; however, at the levels used herein, the mold inhibitor is intended for the purpose of retarding mold of the sorbent composition itself. The composition may be introduced into an environment via any suitable means. Where it is desired to disseminate the composition over a large area, the composition may be disseminated from an aircraft, such as plane, helicopter, blimp, balloon, or the like, or may be disseminated from a watercraft. Particularly when the control agent is a mosquito adulticide or larvicide, the environment may be a water-containing environment, by which is contemplated any environment containing standing or slowly moving water. For example, the water-containing environment may be a pond, lake, swamp, marsh, bog, area with collected rainwater, (such as a tire) and so forth. It is contemplated that in these or other embodiments of the invention the environment may be an indoor environment. The composition preferably is formulated to release at least a portion of the larvicide within the first two feet of water column. The sorbent composition also may be used to remove a material from an environment. In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, at least a portion of undesired material present in an environment may be removed by introducing a sorbent into the environment, allowing the sorbent to sorb at least a portion of the material, and removing at least a portion of the sorbed composition from the environment. The material which may be removed from the environment is not limited to the materials described herein, but to the contrary it is contemplated that any materials that is sorbable by the sorbent composition may be removed form an environment. For instance, the material may be an oleogenus or lipophilic material, or may be a hydrophilic material. In some embodiments, the material may be a gaseous material, such as ammonia. Generally, the sorbent may be prepared as described hereinabove, and may be introduced into the environment in any suitable manner, for instance, by dispersing the sorbent from an aircraft or watercraft as described above. The sorbent may be introduced into the environment in any amount effective for its intended purpose. The sorbent used in conjunction with the invention is incinerable. It is contemplated that the sorbed material may be a combustible material, and in particular a hydrophilic material such as ethanol or an oleogenous material such as oil. It is contemplated that a combustible material composition so composed may be oxidized, such as by incineration, to thereby generate heat. The heat thus generated may be used in industrial applications or may be used to generate electrical energy. The combustible material composition may include any suitable ratio of sorbent to combustible material. Preferably, the composition includes from 1-75%, by weight combustible material, more preferably, the combustible material is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight, even more preferably, the combustible material is present in an mount from 10-75% by weight. The sorbents useful in conjunction with the invention are biodegradable at 25° C. By “biodegradable” is contemplated that the sorbents are susceptible to degradation via microbial influence or other breakdown of the biological structure of the sorbent, such as by thermal or internal chemical or biochemical influence. It is further contemplated that the sorbent will be biodegradable over a wide range of other temperatures. When the sorbent is used to introduce a material into an environment, in particular an outdoor environment, the sorbent preferably is biodegradable in the environment. Such biodegradability prevents long-term contamination of the environment of the sorbent, and, in some embodiments, may effect a delayed release of the sorbed material into the environment. In embodiments of the invention where the sorbent is used to remove material from an environment, the sorbent may be allowed to biodegrade after removal of the sorbed unwanted material but before final disposal of the sorbed material compositions. The biodegradation of the sorbent will in some instances reduce the volume of the sorbed material composition, thereby reducing the disposal costs (particularly in the case of a hazardous material). The sorbed material may be stored until the volume of the material has been reduced by a desired amount preferably at least 10%, more preferably 15%, and even more preferably 20% of the original volume. The following Examples illustrate the invention, but should not be construed as limiting the invention in scope."
8813370,Trigger-operated portable electric tool,2009-08-19,0,1,"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED U.S. APPLICATIONS Not applicable. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not applicable. NAMES OF PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT Not applicable. REFERENCE TO AN APPENDIX SUBMITTED ON COMPACT DISC Not applicable. 1. Field of the Invention The present invention applies to trigger-operated portable electric tools. More specifically, it concerns the field of portable electric tools that are controlled during use by a trigger activated by at least one finger of the hand holding said tools. By pressing on this trigger, a command is given to an actuator (often consisting of an electric motor) to activate the element or moving active elements of the tool in a given direction; by letting go of said trigger, a command is given to the actuator either to stop (for tools operating in a single direction) or to activate the element or moving active elements of the tool in the opposite direction (for tools operating in two directions). 2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98. Motorized pruning shears, especially electric and electronic pruning shears, are examples of contemporary tools having a bidirectional control trigger (opening and closing the cutting elements). The applications of the invention described below apply especially to electronic pruning shears, but it is important to note that the invention can also be applied to other types of motorized pruning shears and to other types of trigger-operated tools, such as shears, drills, grinders, planes, and so on. In their most advanced versions, such tools are provided, in addition to their principal function, with at least one additional function. This second function consists of, for example, in the ability to maintain an intermediary speed or position, or to reverse the direction of the motor, or to place the tool on standby. This second function is controlled by the addition of a control device distinct and separate from the trigger, such as a pushbutton, a switch, and so on, positioned on the body of the tool, this device being intended to be activated by a finger other than the one that acts on said trigger. However, this situation has the disadvantage of being uncomfortable for the user when operating the tool, for the user must either employ two fingers from one hand at the same time or, if the distance between these two control elements is too great, use his other hand, which results in a loss of time. For example, many pruning shear models, in addition to the function of opening and closing the cutting elements controlled by a trigger activated by the user's finger, are equipped with a second function performed by an electrical or electronic system that can be used to arrest the rotation of the moving blade in a predetermined position intermediate between the closed position and the fully open position, thereby providing the ability to limit the opening of the blades, which is desirable in certain situations, for example, when cutting kindling wood, or when pruning, in order to save time and energy. This second function is controlled by a switch that is independent of the control trigger and must be activated by a finger other than the one used to activate said control trigger, and this must occur each time the operator wishes to go from the “fully open” position to the “intermediate” position and vice versa. The transition from one position to another being frequent due to the varying thicknesses of wood being cut on the same plant, it is easy to imagine the inconvenience and loss of time occasioned by such a device. An object of the invention is to correct the aforementioned drawbacks and inadequacies of portable electric tools, especially electric pruning shears. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invention, this objective is achieved by means of a portable electric tool configured to fulfill a primary function notable in that it has a double trigger having, on the one hand, a main actuator-control trigger effecting the movements of at least one moving active element of said tool and, on the other hand, an auxiliary, or secondary, trigger connected to said main trigger by means of an articulation and arranged so as to form a reentrant angle with said main trigger, wherein pivoting said auxiliary trigger activates control means of a system designed to fulfill at least one supplementary function of said tool. It is apparent that this double-trigger device can be used to control several tool functions with a single finger, which provides comfort and saves time. According to a preferred embodiment applicable to portable electric tools comprising a cutting head having at least one moving blade whose movements are controlled by an electronic control card, this latter is configured to control the complete opening of the “fully opened” blades or the stable positioning of said moving blade(s) in a partly opened “intermediate” position, and the auxiliary trigger can be used to act upon a complementary control means of said actuator via said electronic control card. By means of this arrangement, the blades of cutting tools such as electronic pruning shears can be stably positioned in a partly open “intermediate” position that allows for better adaptation of the opening of the cutting blades to the diameter of the wood (branches, vine shoots, etc.) being cut, which results in significant savings of energy and time, together with improved ease of use and greater precision. It is possible to proceed instantaneously from a predetermined partly open “intermediate” position to the “fully open” position and vice versa. The width of the intermediate angle of opening can be adjustable. According to a highly preferred embodiment, a sensor, preferably having a Hall-effect or magnetoresistive sensor, is fixedly arranged on the body of the tool, and the free end of the auxiliary trigger is equipped with a permanent magnet capable of being brought in proximity with said sensor or away from it. By means of this embodiment of the supplementary actuator control means, the auxiliary trigger of the double trigger does not make contact with any mechanical element. Therefore, there is no mechanical wear of this control means, which provides longer operating life for the latter over time."
8851447,Integrated control circuitry and coil assembly for irrigation control,2009-07-27,0,4,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation control devices and more specifically to multi-wire irrigation control systems including remote devices coupled to a multi-wire path and for coupling to actuator coil-controlled irrigation equipment. 2. Discussion of the Related Art In decoder-based irrigation control systems, an irrigation controller sends signaling along a wire path to which one or more decoder devices are attached. Each decoder device monitors transmissions on the wire path and decodes this signaling to determine when to cause irrigation devices coupled thereto to be activated and deactivated. The decoder module typically includes circuitry formed on a printed circuit board located within a housing. Wiring from the decoder module housing must be coupled to the wiring of the wire path as well as coupled to one or more actuator devices each controlling the opening and closing of an irrigation rotor or valve. In one form, the rotor or valve is operated by a solenoid coil as is well known in the art. Likewise, during installation, the operator must provide and electrically connect two separate devices, a decoder module and an actuator coil module, to each other and to the control wire path. FIG. 1 illustrates a separate decoder module 102 and a coil unit 104 that are conventionally coupled together. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 2 , for a solenoid activated rotor assembly 200 , the coil module 104 is coupled (in part by a bracket 212 and retainer 214 ) to the parts of a selector valve assembly 202 (including a pressure regulator) attached to a casing assembly 204 . The electrical wire inputs to the coil module 104 are then connected to the electrical wire outputs from the decoder module 102 , while the electrical wire inputs to the decoder module 102 are coupled to the control wire path from the irrigation controller. Thus, a typical installation requires the connection of six wires to install the decoder module 102 and a coil module 104 . As is well known, in operation, a portion of a plunger (not shown) of the selector valve assembly 202 is disposed within the coil unit 104 while another portion is seated against a solenoid plunge port (not shown) within the selector valve assembly 202 in a normally closed position. In this position, high pressure water flow from a main water control valve (not shown) located within a main control valve portion 206 of the device is flowed up high pressure water line 208 into the selector valve assembly 202 and its regulator and is prevented from further movement by the normally closed position of the plunger against the solenoid port in the selector valve assembly 202 . This results in a back pressure that causes the main water control valve to close. In response to signals from the decoder module 102 , the coil module 104 causes the actuation of the plunger to move it off of (or unseat from) the solenoid plunge port allowing the high pressure flow in the high pressure line 208 to flow through the selector valve assembly 202 (and its pressure regulator), which relieves the back pressure and allows water to flow through the main control valve and to a pop-up sprinkler device, i.e., the main water control valve is opened. The pop-up sprinkler device is located within the casing assembly 204 and extends upwardly due to the water pressure through a top portion of the casing assembly 204 . The high pressure flow exits the selector valve assembly 202 down through a discharge flow line 210 which terminates within the casing assembly 204 at a location downstream of the main water control valve. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Several embodiments of the invention provide an integrated valve actuator coil and control module for use in irrigation control systems. In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device comprising: a coil adapted to develop an electromagnetic flux sufficient to cause actuation of irrigation equipment; control circuitry to receive a control signals from an irrigation control unit and electrically coupled to the coil to control the flux at the coil; and a housing covering at least a portion of the coil and at least a portion of the control circuitry. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method of making an irrigation control device comprising: holding a solenoid assembly with a coil near to control circuitry having circuitry for controlling an electromagnetic flux at the coil; electrically connecting the coil to the control circuitry; placing the solenoid assembly and control circuitry into a housing; securing the solenoid assembly to the housing so that the solenoid assembly is actuated to reciprocate a valve member through an aperture in the housing to selectively engage a valve seat external to the housing; and fixing the control circuitry and coil within the housing."
8065834,Two piece plant container with water reservoir,2010-02-26,0,1,"This invention concerns plant containers and more particularly plant containers which have a built-in water reservoir to reduce the need for frequent watering. Municipalities commonly maintain large numbers container plantings hanging from light poles, etc., for decorative effect, and a need for frequent watering presents a substantial burden on city resources. There have heretofore been developed containers with a built-in water reservoir which is situated to allow the planting to draw water from the reservoir in addition to the moisture in the soil in which the plant is growing. In such large scale deployment of containers, it is common to frequently switch plantings for achieving seasonal displays or to rotate out plantings which are not doing well in favor of more healthy specimens. Such practice also entails considerable labor particularly when large plants and containers are involved. In the practice of including a water reservoir defined within the container, it is important to prevent excessive water from being wicked into the soil mass as this will cause waterlogging of the soil which will cause the roots to die from disease and lack of air. If the reservoir were overfilled, this will result may occur. It is an object of the present invention to provide a plant container which includes a water reservoir which is isolated from the soil to prevent saturation of the soil, but is spaced only a very short distance therefrom so as to allow growth of roots into the reservoir space. It is another object to provide a two part container which allows easy removal of the inner container holding the soil and planting, as well as convenient lifting and handling of the outer container part. It is yet another object to provide a two part container which is sturdy enough to hold heavy plantings and which has contours which are easily molded from plastic. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The above recited objects and other objects which will be understood by those with knowledge of this art are achieved by a two part container of molded plastic, an outer tub part having a bottom region defining a reservoir space and which receives an inner holder part nested within an upper region of the outer part and which holds the soil and planting. The side wall of the outer tub part has a plurality of inwardly projecting steps formed about the perimeter defining horizontal support surfaces arranged about its interior on which a bottom wall of the inner part rests, located just above the water reservoir. At least one of the support surfaces has a localized depressed space communicating with the reservoir space such that water can flow beneath an inner part bottom wall even while resting on the step surfaces to a drain hole in the bottom of the depressed space. The drain hole establishes a maximum level of water in the reservoir space. The bottom of the inner container has a pattern of openings in a major area of its bottom wall which is located just above the maximum water level in the reservoir to allow the planting roots to quickly grow into the water in the reservoir through the openings to allow water to be absorbed by the plant in addition to moisture in the soil being absorbed without danger of waterlogging the soil by a wicking action. The planting can be thoroughly watered by pouring water into the soil mass with any excess draining into the reservoir space until the water overflows but through the drain hole with such outflow indicating to the person watering the plant that the reservoir space is filled to the maximum so that watering can be stopped. Further drainage from the soil will also flow out through the drainage hole. In order to provide a sturdy bottom wall easily capable of supporting the weight of the soil and plantings in the inner part, a series of radial ribs converging into a center connection are molded therein to stiffen the bottom wall. These ribs may continue up the side wall for large containers such that the inner container is sturdy enough to support the soil and plant independently of the outer tub part. The perimeter wall of the inner part of the container is radially indented at locations on either side thereof and open at the top to create hand grip features enabling the fingers of each hand and to be inserted therein and to be wrapped around undersurfaces, providing convenient handholds allowing easy gripping and lifting out of the inner container part from the outer part. The steps formed into the perimeter of the outer tub part also provide handholds for lifting both parts. A removable plug in a drain hole in the bottom of the reservoir allows substantially complete draining when both parts of the container is to be removed."
5665822,Thermoplastic Elastomers,1993-04-14,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to thermoplastic elastomers. 2. Introduction to the Invention Thermoplastic elastomers, which are often referred to as TPE's, are well known. The TPE's in general use contain (i) polymeric blocks (usually referred to as """"hard"""" blocks or A blocks) which (a) are amorphous and have a second order transition point, T.sub.gh, which is well above room temperature, or (b) have a crystalline polymer backbone and have a crystalline melting point, T.sub.mh, which is well above room temperature, and (ii) amorphous polymeric blocks (usually referred to as """"soft"""" blocks or B blocks) which have a glass transition point, T.sub.gs, which is well below room temperature. Each soft block is linked to at least two hard blocks, so that at temperatures between T.sub.gs and T.sub.mh, or T.sub.gs and T.sub.gh, the amorphous B blocks are tied together, resulting in elastomeric behavior. Above T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh, melting or softening of the hard blocks permits viscous flow of the polymeric chains, resulting in thermoplastic behavior. Known TPE's are described for example in U.S. Pat.

The disclosure of each of those patents and articles is incorporated herein by reference. It has also been proposed in the patent literature to use, as components in temperature-sensitive dispensers for pesticides, disinfectants, drugs and other active agents, block copolymers containing a side chain crystallizable (SCC) polymer and a second polymer which exhibits a glass transition or melting point higher than the SCC polymer, such that the entire mass exhibits mechanical stability above the melting point of the SCC polymer but below the transition of the second polymer. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,830,855 (Stewart), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The block copolymer undergoes a rapid change in permeability to the active agent in the region of the melting point of the SCC polymer, and the second polymer ensures that the SCC polymer remains immobilized even if its melting point is reached or exceeded. This invention relates to TPE's which comprise A blocks, or B blocks, is or both A blocks and B blocks, which are crystalline and in which at least a part of the crystallinity results from the presence of crystallizable side chains. Such crystalline blocks are referred to herein as SCC blocks. TPE's containing SCC A blocks are novel and as such form part of the present invention. The invention also includes processes, compositions, shaped articles and assemblies which make use of TPE's containing SCC A blocks. TPE's containing SCC B blocks and non-SCC A blocks are not novel as a class, but this invention includes a wide range of novel processes, compositions, shaped articles and assemblies which make use of such TPE's. TPE's Containing SCC A Blocks TPE's containing SCC A blocks have the advantage that they can exhibit a much more rapid change in viscosity in the region of the crystalline melting point of the side chains in the TPE (referred to herein as T.sub.q) than is exhibited by known TPE's in the region of T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh. This rapid change in viscosity results in a number of important advantages. One advantage is that the novel TPE's can be melt processed at temperatures not far above T.sub.q, e.g. below about (T.sub.q +10).degree. C., whereas known TPE's are typically melt processed at temperatures at least 40.degree. C. above T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh. Known TPE's are typically melt processed at temperatures above 100.degree. C., whereas the preferred TPE's of the invention can be melt processed at temperatures below 100.degree. C., for example below 75.degree. C. and even below 50.degree. C. This is particularly useful when the TPE is preferably or necessarily maintained at a temperature below a critical limit (referred to herein as T.sub.crit). Such conditions arise for example when the TPE is associated with (e.g. is contained within, surrounds, forms a layer on, or is mixed with) a thermally responsive substance which may undergo, at a temperature above T.sub.crit, a change which is undesirable during such processing. The substance may be for example in the form of (i) solid particles dispersed within the TPE, e.g. particles of an explosive solid, or a pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical, or (ii) a substrate which is contacted by the TPE, e.g. a vessel in a living animal into which the TPE has been injected or otherwise placed, or (iii) a solid or a liquid which is encapsulated by the TPE. Another advantage is that the novel TPE's can be used as carriers (including encapsulants) for substances which are at least partially protected by the TPE at temperatures substantially below and approaching T.sub.q. The protection may be against physical attack and/or against chemical attack. The hard blocks in the TPE will begin to melt at a temperature T.sub.o which is somewhat below T.sub.q, e.g. 3.degree.-12.degree. C. below T.sub.q. As the temperature is increased from T.sub.o to T.sub.q, there is a rapid change in the protection provided by the TPE, and above T.sub.q the substance may be released entirely from the TPE. For example, a mixture of the TPE and an agricultural chemical can be applied during a cold season of the year while the ambient temperature is below T.sub.q and the chemical will be released when the ambient temperature exceeds T.sub.q. Similarly a seed can be coated with a TPE and will not germinate until the ambient temperature approaches or exceeds T.sub.q. Another very important advantage of the novel TPE's containing SCC A blocks is that the value of T.sub.q can be closely controlled through selection of the crystallizable moieties in the side chains. Thus, for a given crystallizable moiety, T.sub.q is mainly dependent on the length of the crystallizable moiety, and changes by at most a few .degree. C., e.g. less than 5.degree. C., with changes in the molecular weight of the A block. In the known TPE's, by contrast, T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh changes substantially with changes in the molecular weight of the A block, because the melting point is dependent on folding of the main chain. In the TPE's containing SCC A blocks, it is possible to change the physical properties of the TPE, e.g. the elongation, modulus and tensile strength, without substantially changing T.sub.q, by changing the molecular weight of the TPE and/or the molecular weight of the A blocks and/or the relative mounts of the A and B blocks. The TPE's containing SCC A blocks also show a relatively small difference between T.sub.q (the endotherm melt peak on a DSC curve as the TPE is heated) and the crystallization peak on a DSC curve as the molten TPE is cooled. Another very important advantage of the novel TPE's containing SCC hard (A) blocks is that the presence of the SCC A blocks results in improved shear strength. Furthermore their shear strength can be yet further improved by incorporation therein of a relatively low molecular weight and low melting crystalline additive, particularly an SCC polymer. The crystalline additive must be intimately mixed with the TPE, preferably through a melt mixing process or a process which comprises mixing the TPE and the additive in a common solvent. Particularly good results are obtained when the SCC blocks in the TPE and in the additive are structurally similar, and it appears that the improved shear strength results from co-crystallization of the additive and the SCC blocks. Thus a preferred combination is a TPE containing SCC blocks comprising polyethylene or poly (substituted methylene) groups and an SCC additive comprising polymethylene or poly (substituted methylene) groups. Suitable crystalline additives include those disclosed in the Schmitt et al. Application No. 07/928,800, U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,035, incorporated by reference herein. The advantages noted above make the novel TPE's with SCC hard blocks, and mixtures thereof with crystalline additives, particularly suitable for us as pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA's) and as hot melt adhesives. The TPE, or mixture thereof with a crystalline additive, can be the sole polymeric ingredient(s) of the adhesive, or can be mixed with other polymeric ingredients. For example, a conventional PSA can be modified by addition of the TPE or mixture of TPE and additive. The adhesive preferably contains 25 to 100%, particularly 75 to 100% of the TPE, and 0 to 50%, preferably 1 to 40%, of the additive. PSA's for use in the medical field for attachment to human skin preferably contain 20 to 35% of the additive. PSA's for use in other fields preferably contain less than 15%, e.g. 1 to 5%, of the additive. The adhesive can also contain additives such as tackifiers, plasticizers, fillers, stabilizers and pigments. PSA's which contain the crystalline additive have the valuable property that they have reduced adhesive strength when heated to temperatures approaching or above the crystalline melting point of the additive, as discussed in Schmitt et al. Application No. 07/928,800, U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,035. The novel TPE's containing SCC hard blocks can also contain SCC soft blocks. We have found that such TPE's, in addition to the advantages noted above for TPE's containing SCC hard blocks, are particularly useful in the form of films and other shaped articles which are heat-sealed to other polymeric articles. The TPE will undergo a rapid change in its physical properties, including its permeability to at least some gases and vapors, e.g. O.sub.2, CO.sub.2 and water vapor, in the region of T.sub.ms, but will retain substantial strength until heated to a temperature in the region of T.sub.q, when it will again undergo a rapid change in its physical properties, including its heat sealability. The repeating units of the different SCC blocks can be selected to provide a change in permeability (or other property) over a desired temperature range, and to provide a hard block which, above T.sub.mh, will be compatible with the other polymeric material to which the TPE is to be heat sealed. In this way, it is possible to make a TPE which is sufficiently flexible at 0.degree. C., which undergoes a marked change in permeability in the range of 0.degree. C. to 40.degree. C., which retains adequate physical strength at temperatures up to T.sub.q (or close to it) and which can be melt extruded and heat sealed at temperatures not far above T.sub.q, e.g. 60.degree. to 100.degree. C. If desired, the physical strength of the TPE can be improved by crosslinking, but this is not generally necessary. Such a TPE can be particularly useful as a packaging material, e.g. for actively respiring biological material, as disclosed in the Stewart Application No. 885,915 incorporated by reference herein. TPE's Containing SCC B Blocks and Non-SCC A Blocks We have found that SCC soft (B) blocks can confer important and previously unrealized benefits on TPE's containing them, making it possible to use such TPE's in ways which are novel and surprisingly valuable, even when the A blocks are not SCC blocks and the TPE is in itself known for use in other ways. For example, such TPE's can be used to provide pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA's) with very valuable properties, to provide films and other shaped articles which can be heat-sealed to other articles, and to provide hot melt adhesives. Summary of Various Aspects of the Invention First Aspect--Novel TPE In a first aspect, this invention provides novel TPE's containing SCC hard (A) blocks. These novel TPE's preferably comprise polymeric molecules which comprise (i) polymeric A blocks which (a) are crystalline and have a melting point T.sub.q, and (b) wherein at least one of the A blocks comprises a side chain comprising crystallizable moieties which render the block crystalline; and (ii) at least one polymeric B block which is linked to at least two A blocks and which (a) is crystalline and has a melting point T.sub.ms which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C., or (b) is amorphous and has a glass transition point T.sub.gs which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C. Second Aspect--Processes for Preparing the Novel TPE's Any process can be employed to make the novel TPE's of the present invention. However, particularly useful processes, which provide the second aspect of the present invention, comprise I. reacting together (i) an A block precursor which is the A block containing at least one reactive group J, and (ii) a B block precursor which is the B block containing at least two reactive groups K, which may be the same or different, which will react with the reactive group J to form a link which is part of the polymer backbone, PAL the molar ratio of (i) to (ii) being at least 2, thus making a TPE of the ABA, A.sub.n B or (AB).sub.n type; or II. reacting together (i) a B block precursor which is the B block containing at least two reactive groups L, which may be the same or different, and (ii) (a) a monomeric component comprising at least one monomer which will react with the group L and with itself or with a reactive group resulting from reaction of the monomeric. component with the B block precursor, optionally with the aid of an initiator, to form the A block, or (b) an A block precursor which is the A block containing at least one reactive group M which will react with the group L to form the A block; or III. reacting together (i) an A block precursor which is the A block terminated by a reactive group N, and (ii) a monomeric component comprising at least one monomer which will react with the group N and with itself to form the B block with at least two A blocks pendant from the polymeric backbone of the soft block; PAL or IV. performing a living polymerization in which the monomers for the A and B blocks are polymerized separately and sequentially, using an initiator so that the growing polymer chain has a terminal group which reacts with the monomer present at that time and in turn produces a reactive terminal group on the residue of the monomer which has reacted with the growing polymer chain. In all of these reactions, other ingredients may be present in order to modify the properties of the product, for example initiators, chain transfer agents and monomers which may be chemically or physically incorporated into the resulting TPE. Third Aspect--Compositions, Shaped Articles and Assemblies Comprising the Novel TPE In a third aspect, this invention provides a composition, shaped article or assembly which comprises a novel TPE as defined above and a second component which is mixed with the TPE, or which is surrounded (e.g. encapsulated) by the TPE, or which contacts (e.g. surrounds or otherwise provides a substrate for) the TPE. In one embodiment, this aspect of the invention is particularly valuable when the second component is a thermally responsive substance which undergoes a thermally induced change at a temperature T.sub.crit which is above the temperature at which the TPE can conveniently be melt processed. Because the novel TPE's can be melt-processed at temperatures close to T.sub.q, generally below (T.sub.q +60).degree. C., often below (T.sub.q +40).degree. C., and even lower, they are superior to conventional TPE's which are usually melt processed at temperatures well above their melting point. T.sub.crit is preferably above (T.sub.q +10).degree. C., e.g. (T.sub.q +10).degree. C. to (T.sub.q +40).degree. C. or (T.sub.q +60).degree. C. In another embodiment, this aspect of the invention is particularly valuable when the second component is intimately mixed with the TPE and is a crystalline polymeric additive, preferably an SCC polymer, which (a) has a first order transition point T.sub.a in the composition of 23.degree. to 120.degree. C., preferably 30.degree. to 60.degree. C., and (b) has a heat of fusion of at least 5 Joules/g, preferably at least 20 Joules/g. PAL The presence of the crystalline additive can substantially improve the shear value of the composition. This is particularly useful when the composition is to be used as a PSA, for which purpose the composition may also contain an amorphous polymer, e.g. a conventional PSA, as well as other conventional ingredients of PSA's. Fourth Aspect--Making Shaped Articles of the Third Aspect of the Invention In a fourth aspect, this invention provides a process for making a shaped article, which process comprises (A) melting a novel TPE as defined above, (B) dispersing an additive in the molten TPE, (C) shaping the dispersion from step B, and (D) cooling the shaped article from step C to a temperature below T.sub.q. Fifth Aspect--Releasing Second Components from Compositions, Shaped Articles and Assemblies of the Third Aspect of the Invention In a fifth aspect, this invention provides a process for releasing the second component from a composition, shaped article or assembly of the third aspect of the invention, which process comprises heating the composition, article or assembly by means of heat which is (i) generated by a mammalian body or (ii) generated artifically, e.g. by an electrical or other heater or by an engine or electrical motor, and/or (iii) conveyed artifically to the TPE. The heat may be conveyed to the TPE by convection, conduction or radiation, but is preferably conveyed by means of a stream of heated fluid, e.g. heated air or a body fluid, which also assists in removal of the second component from the TPE. Sixth Aspect--PSA's and PSA Composites Comprising TPE's Containing SCC Blocks, and Methods of Using Them In a sixth aspect, this invention provides a composition which is suitable for use as (or in the production of) a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) and which comprises a TPE in which the A blocks, or the B blocks, or both, are SCC blocks.

In this aspect, the invention includes also PSA composites comprising a backing having a coating thereon of such a composition, particularly PSA-coated articles for use in the medical field, for example an assembly which comprises (i) a flexible backing, (ii) a solvent-free layer of a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) which is secured to the backing, and which comprises a TPE or is at least partially covered by a layer comprising a TPE, said TPE comprising polymeric molecules which comprise (i) polymeric A blocks which (a) are crystalline and have a melting point T.sub.q, or (b) are amorphous and have a glass transition point T.sub.gh ; (ii) at least one polymeric B block which is linked to at least two A blocks and which (a) is crystalline and has a melting point T.sub.ms which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C. or less than (T.sub.gh -10).degree. C. or (b) is amorphous and has a glass transition point T.sub.gs which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C. or less than (T.sub.gh -10).degree. C. PAL wherein at least one block selected from the A and B blocks comprises a side chain comprising crystallizable moieties which render the block crystalline. This aspect of the invention also includes processes for preparing assemblies by joining articles together using such a composition; and processes for disassembling such assemblies which include heating the PSA to weaken it. These PSA's, PSA composites, assemblies, and processes preferably have the functional characteristics set out in the Schmitt et al. applications incorporated by reference herein, which also discloses amorphous base resins, crystalline polymer additives, methods of formulating PSA's, methods of applying PSA's to backings, backings, and methods of using PSA composites, which are generally suitable for use in this aspect of the invention. Seventh Aspect--Heat-Sealed Assemblies Comprising Articles Comprising TPE's Containing SCC Blocks In a seventh aspect, this invention provides a film or other article which comprises a TPE in which the A blocks, or the B blocks, or both, are SCC blocks, particularly an article which is suitable for use as a component of a food package and/or in a method which requires heat-sealing the film. These films preferably have the functional characteristics set out in Stewart Ser. No. 07/885,915 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,654 incorporated by reference herein, which also discloses food packages, and methods of packaging and storing foodstuffs, suitable for use in this aspect of the invention. One assembly according to this aspect of the invention comprises (1) a first film which comprises a TPE comprising polymeric molecules which comprise (i) polymeric A blocks which (a) are crystalline and have a melting point T.sub.q, or (b) are amorphous and have a glass transition point T.sub.gh ; (ii) at least one polymeric B block which is linked to at least two A blocks and which (a) is crystalline and has a melting point T.sub.ms which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree.

4521239,Coating agent for particulate materials,1982-11-29,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of providing particulate materials with a protective coating. More particularly, the invention relates to the coating of particulate fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate with the reaction product of an amine and a siloxane. 2. Description of the Prior Art In the past diatomaceous earth (DE) and treated clays have been used as a coating/conditioning agent for particulate fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate. However, for several reasons, diatomaceous earth is becoming increasingly unacceptable as a protective coating material for fertilizers. One reason is that the quality of diatomaceous earth, per se, has been declining as the better grades of the earth have been removed by mining. The inferior grades of DE have resulted in coatings which do not meet the stringent physical and chemical requirements for acceptable DE coatings. Storage and handling problems have resulted because of the inferior grades of DE which are being used. Another disadvantage of using diatomaceous earth and clays is that there is always the undesirable problem of dust generation in the handling of diatomaceous earth since it is a relatively dry, small particle size solid. Usually, from about 1-1.5% by weight of DE is coated on ammonium nitrate particles. Not all of the DE, however, adheres to the fertilizer particles. This fact results in serious problems for ammonium nitrate manufacturing plants which are the likes of additional equipment maintenance, extra clean-up costs and the like. Moreover, there are serious customer handling problems involved with DE coated ammonium nitrate. Yet another problem with diatomaceous earth is that the costs of agricultural grade diatomaceous earth have sharply increased over the past few years as the available supplies have decreased as a result of the diversion of supplies to other markets. Because diatomaceous earth suppliers no longer need the agricultural market as a consumer of their product, ammonium nitrate producers are placed in an increasingly more vulnerable and expensive position. A need, therefore, exists for a satisfactory replacement for diatomaceous earth as a fertilizer coating agent. Various types of fertilizers have been coated with different materials in the past to produce a product of improved stability. Urea is usually coated with kaolin clay or is treated with formaldehyde to alleviate caking. However, kaolin, because of its very small particle size, is dusty. On the other hand, formaldehyde treatment of urea does not yield a completely satisfactory product. Phosphate based fertilizers such as ammonium phosphate, superphosphate, homogeneous N-P-K fertilizers and the like, which when dried to very low water contents to reduce their caking tendencies, become quite dusty when handled. Fuel oil is frequently used as a surface coating material in order to suppress dust generation. While fuel oil exhibits some dust suppressing activity, it is not fully effective in this role, and is not a good use for an energy yielding substance. Organic materials have been used in the past as coating materials for particulate fertilizers. Thus, Choi in U.S. Pat. No. 4,259,102 discloses a heterocyclic polymer which can be used as a fertilizer coating agent. Iwao, U.S. Pat. No. 3,660,070, shows the use of high molecular weight polymers of the vinyl and acrylate type as a coating agent. U.S. Pat. No. 3,388,990 provides a very similar type of disclosure. Passmore, U.S. Pat. No. 3,544,297, shows polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and polyacrylonitrile as coating materials. Haruhiro, U.S. Pat. No. 3,475,154 discloses fertilizer particles coated with a multi-layered coating of a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin in order to provide a low water-soluble fertilizer. None of the above-discussed references provide any disclosure of either of the ingredients used in the coating agent of the present invention. Hansen in U.S. Pat. No. 3,223,518 discloses a technique of providing a slow-release fertilizer by providing a particulate fertilizer substrate with a multi-layer coating, the outer layer being of a hydrophobic material. The reference further discloses the use of a primer coating which may be any substance selected from an extremely broad group of organic compounds. Hansen also describes that a major characteristic of the fertilizer product is its water durability which is characterized by solids which remain in the shell-like water-insoluble exterior coatings. Any fertilizer product which does not exhibit this characteristic, which includes the product of the present invention, presumably is outside the scope of the reference. Moreover, the fertilizer product of the present invention is not a slow-release multi-layer coated product having a hydrophobic exterior coating. Still further, the product of the reference possesses a large amount of coating material, i.e., about 7% by weight, while the amount of coating material applied to the present product is in most cases less than 0.1% by weight. Bradley in U.S. Pat. No. 3,951,638, discloses a prilling process which at one point uses an organosilicon compound to prevent dust pick-up by fertilizer particles. Accordingly, the reference does not show the coating of fertilizer particles with an organic material. Assuming that the dust is an inert material, the organic material would seem to serve as a moisture barrier, which is a teaching contrary to the present invention. Hijfte in U.S. Pat. No. 4,150,965 discloses the use of an alkylamine-mineral oil combination as a coating agent for ammonium nitrate fertilizer. The reference discloses a three-step coating process, while the present process is usually a one-step coating procedure. In the reference process an ammonium nitrate containing fertilizer is treated with the alkylamine while relatively hot, i.e., at least 5.degree. C. above the melting point of the amine or mixture containing the amine. In fact, the reference discloses that prills at 50.degree. C. cannot be coated satisfactorily, while in the present invention, on the other hand, superior coatings for ammonium nitrate can be achieved at temperatures less than 38.degree. C. Another disclosure in the reference which is contrary to the present invention is that unadulterated alkylamine must be added to the fertilizer in the first process step. That is, the amine cannot be premixed with another compound if acceptable results are to be obtained. In the present process, an amine is, in fact, premixed with another reagent, i.e., a silicone fluid, before application to the fertilizer particles. Another difference between the reference disclosure and the present invention is that the reference does not disclose the coating procedure to be effective on fertilizers which do not contain a diluent. The working examples of the reference disclose fertilizers which contain a diluent. A need, therefore, continues to exist for a technique of providing particulate fertilizers, particularly ammonium nitrate, with an improved coating material. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a protective coating for fertilizer particles which suppresses dusting, minimizes caking of the fertilizer particles and prill breakdown and makes handling of particulate fertilizer much easier. Briefly, this object and other objects of the present invention as hereinafter will become more readily apparent can be attained by a particulate substrate provided with a protective coating of the reaction product of at least one amine compound and a siloxane. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the particulate substrate is prilled ammonium nitrate fertilizer."
7422682,"Compositions, devices, and methods for use in environmental remediation",2005-06-28,0,1,"FIELD OF THE ART The field of art disclosed herein pertains to compositions, devices, and methods suited for a variety of applications in environmental remediation. BACKGROUND The uses of structural barriers for a variety of applications in environmental remediation are generally well described. Several types of environmental remediation barriers (ERBs) are used in earth and hydraulic engineering, such exemplary structures including fiber rolls, mats, blankets, and berms. Originally, major applications of ERBs included erosion and sedimentation control, revegetation, and revetment. More recently, the potential for such structures to serve additionally in the capacity of removal of natural and manmade pollutants from residential, industrial, and agricultural sources, and remediation of eutrification has been described. As the name of one type of ERB, fiber roll, suggests, ERBs packed into a covering, such as a netted material, may be filled with fibers; typically a single natural fiber such as abaca, hemp, jute, flax, sisal, coir, or straw materials. For a major application of fiber-filled ERBs in erosion and sediment control, the purpose of the fiber filling is primarily structural. In that regard, though the natural fibers described are capable of absorbing water, one necessary attribute of the fiber filler has been to provide an effective porosity once packed that allows for the ready passage of water, while promoting the retention of mud, sediment, gravel, and the like. Other desirable attributes of natural fibers used in ERBs include ready availability in high volume and low cost, requirement to be germ, insect and weed free, free of chemical pollutants, ability to degrade after use; thereby obviating creation of harmful waste, and ease of processing into targeted devices. Materials in addition to natural fibers have been suggested as supplemental constituents in ERBs. Particularly, vegetative matter, as well as nutrients and fertilizers for revegetation and revetment have been described. Materials that have been suggested include saw dust, wood chips, bark, compost, flocculants, water absorbents, and pesticides. A major objective in the field has been to establish environmental remediation practices that are consistent with good practices for environmental protection in general. In that regard, the reuse of natural materials, such as saw dust, wood chips, bark, and compost, that would otherwise go to waste has been a motive for creating fillings for ERBs. Especially in consideration of the use of ERBs in functions where the filling has a requirement that is more than structural; moreover where the filling must perform additional multiple functions, such as clarification of runoff water and removal of pollutants, the targeted and judicious selection of materials tailored for such multifunctional use throughout the lifetime of the ERBs still remains a challenge. Accordingly, a need exists for more effective compositions of materials that are multifunctional for a variety of environmental remediation needs, and for a range of ERBs utilizing such compositions and their use."
5788450,Narrow self-propelled transportation apparatus,1996-07-05,0,1,"This invention relates to machinery for use by arborists in lifting and transporting tree debris from pruning and removal operations around homes and office buildings. There are many prior art large machines that are used in the logging industry to fell, delimb, cut, load and remove cut trees from wooded areas. However, for the professional arborists usually problems are encountered due to congested areas, like city homes, lawns, drives, walks, fences and narrow gates. Most of the jobs, perhaps about 80%, of tree pruning and/or removal occurs where the large pieces of machinery cannot have ready access for one or more of the problems listed above. These same problems are substantially eliminated in accord with this invention. In accord with this invention a machine be maneuvered from backyards of houses and narrow gates and is equipped with the necessary facilities to pick up large logs and branches, load them onto a narrow walled platform, and self-propelled and steered out of the congested area for eventual disposal of the logs and branches at the street curb. It is an object of this invention to provide a machine that can be operated by a single person to accomplish the above purposes. It is another object of this invention to provide a machine that makes full use of hydraulic apparatus for lifting loads and for moving the loads to a more convenient area for disposal of the waste tree portions without damage to lawns, or walks or drives. Other objects will become apparent in the more detailed descriptions which follow. This invention relates to a maneuverable, self-propelled apparatus for transporting tree debris from pruning and removal operations and fallen trees where the apparatus includes a long narrow body with high sidewalls and with the body mounted on an undercarriage having four pneumatic-tired wheels. An upright mast is mounted on the body and supports an articulated arm of several sections and ending in opposed grapple fingers powered by hydraulic cylinders so as to be capable of picking up logs and depositing them in the body. The apparatus is long and narrow so as to be maneuverable in locations where there are narrow gates of 36 inch widths. In one specific embodiment one of the sections of the articulated arm is telescopically extensible.

7997826,Roller assembly,2009-05-01,0,1,"This invention relates to an improved roller assembly which may be used as a drive roller or idler roller in machines or vehicles incorporating rolling apparatus for rolling of turf or grass surfaces inclusive of golf greens and bowling greens. However this is not the only application of the roller assembly of the invention which could be employed in relation to rolling of snowfields, road surfaces during preparation of roads and rolling of other uneven surfaces such as sand. One conventional rolling apparatus is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 which has a mobile main frame and at least a pair of undercarriages attached to the main frame in side by side relationship wherein each undercarriage has one or more smoothing rollers and there is further provided a control arm or plate pivotally attached to the main frame about a horizontal axis wherein each undercarriage is pivotally attached to the control arm or plate. There was further provided a transmission interconnecting each undercarriage to an operating lever or joystick wherein actuation of the operating lever or joystick causes reciprocatable pivotal movement of each undercarriage such that in use the or each smoothing roller closely follows ground contours. It is important in rolling of golf greens or bowling greens that smoothing or idler rollers as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 closely follow ground contours. If such is not the case the smoothing rollers may leave indentation lines or unsightly marks on the greens and this was detrimental to achievement of a smooth and even grass surface. Another problem of using smoothing rollers that did not closely follow ground contours was that surface corrugations in the greens still remained after repeated roller operations. However while this objective was achieved in U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 by the use of pivotal movement of each undercarriage to closely follow surface undulations or corrugations it will be appreciated that U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 still incorporated a conventional drive roller shaft which was provided with a pair of stub axles at each end thereof which were attached to mounting plates rigidly attached to the chassis of the rolling apparatus. Each stub axle was also mounted in bearing carriers carrying bearings for each stub axle so as to enable the drive roller to rotate relative to the chassis. Another conventional arrangement was that the drive roller was rigidly mounted to a support shaft which extended through each end of the drive roller thereby providing the pair of stub axles. However these conventional drive roller mounting arrangements had disadvantages in that (i) on uneven ground there was created greater ground pressure resulting in an uneven surface finish due to lines, marks or impressions left on the ground surface after passage of the drive roller. Other disadvantages were (ii) that the drive roller had reduced width compared to each smoothing roller, (iii) that there was less driving friction on the ground than desired which created loss of traction in certain driving conditions and situations, especially on increased slopes or wet turf and (iv) the drive roller was rigidly mounted to a support shaft which meant that the style of roller to be employed was limited being relatively short which was not adapted to follow ground contours. It was also to be appreciated that in relation to each of the smoothing rollers in order to achieve an objective of each smoothing roller closely following ground contours it was necessary to mount a plurality of smoothing rollers in undercarriages as described above and this procedure was relatively complicated although it operated in a perfectly satisfactory manner. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It therefore is an object of the invention to provide a roller assembly that is adapted to follow ground contours during operation. The roller assembly of the invention includes in a first embodiment a pair of roller components having respective inner ends connected to each other by a flexible and movable primary coupling and having their respective outer ends connected to a support shaft which extends through a hollow interior of each driven roller component by a secondary coupling. In a second embodiment there may be one or more intermediate or floating roller components located between the pair of roller components, which may constitute end roller components. In this embodiment each of the end roller components are connected at their respective outer ends to the support shaft which extends through a hollow interior of each end roller component and each intermediate or floating roller component by the secondary coupling. However each of the inner ends of the end roller components are connected to an adjacent end of an adjoining intermediate or floating roller component by the flexible and movable primary coupling. In the case where there are more than one intermediate floating roller components, adjacent ends of each intermediate or floating roller components are connected to each other by additional flexible and movable primary couplings. The flexible and movable primary coupling may comprise a disc or sleeve made from natural rubber, synthetic rubber or other form of flexible or elastomeric material. In one arrangement the flexible disc may have a plurality of holes to enhance flexibility or in another arrangement may have a relatively large central aperture to enhance flexibility. Preferably the flexible disc has a peripheral flange defining a pair of adjacent shoulders for supporting an adjacent end of a roller component. In the case of the first or second embodiment the primary coupling may be provided with a plurality of spigots or sockets which engage with corresponding sockets or spigots of an adjacent end of an end or driven roller component. In the case of adjacent ends of intermediate or floating roller components each of these may be interconnected by a primary coupling having spigots or sockets engaging with corresponding sockets or spigots of each adjacent end of the intermediate or floating roller component."

4517006,Composite materials comprising water-soluble glass particles,1982-11-17,0,1,"This invention relates to arrangements and methods for the controlled release of active materials into solution. There is a broad range of applications wherein it is necessary to provide for the release of an active material at a controlled rate into an aqueous environment. In the biosciences, particularly, the potential for prolonging the action of numerous bioactive compounds is stimulating considerable interest. Since the early 1950's researchers have attempted to develop controlled release compounds able to store active materials and then release them at controlled rates into aqueous systems. This research has tended to concentrate on polymeric materials. Any polymers may be fabricated at relatively low temperatures to encapsulate effectively active materials thereby protecting them from unwanted interaction with the environment. Subsequent release of the active material is effected by one of four general mechanisms, i.e. diffusion, swelling, (bio) chemical action and magnetic processes. However, in most cases it has proved impractical to engineer the required degree of control, especially over long periods, and in many instances toxicity of the special polymer itself has limited exploitation. Controlled Release Glasses (CRG), such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,350,675, are inorganic glasses that may be formulated to be non-toxic. Their solution rates in aqueous media are chemically controlled and may be varied to give a high degree of precision, even over long periods. Unfortunately CRG may only be fabricated at temperatures that would, on contact, destroy or degrade many of the active materials of interest. For this reason the development of CRG has tended to be concentrated on applications requiring the release of inorganic materials. The object of this invention is to combine the most advantageous properties of both the polymer and CRG approaches, without risk of toxicity. Thus the benefits of low temperature fabrication and release control combine to provide a new means of releasing a wide range of active materials. According to the invention there is provided a coherent composite structure, comprising a composite material and an active material, said composite material comprising a matrix material and a particulate material soluble in an aqueous medium and dispersed in said matrix material, the composite material being such that, when contacted with the aqueous medium, said particulate material dissolves thereby increasing the aqueous permeability of said composite whereby in use to control the release of the active material from the structure. Typically the matrix material is a polymer. When the composite comes into contact with an aqueous medium the particulate material dissolves to provide a series of passageways through the host matrix thus permitting the ingress of water. Such a composite can be employed for the delayed and controlled release of an active material which, prior to the dissolution of the particulate material and the consequent significant increase in the water permeability of the composite, is protected by the composite itself. Advantageously the particulate material is a soluble glass composition or a mixture of such glass compositions. Water soluble glass compositions have the important property that their dissolution rate may be tailored to a desired value by composition adjustment thus providing for the manufacture of composite materials with a wide range of release characteristics. Moreover, many of these glasses are biologically inert."

In further embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula 5-2 may be prepared as shown in Scheme 5. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole sulfide of formula 5-1 may be treated with about one or more equivalents of an oxidant, such as sodium perborate tetrahydrate, in a polar protic solvent, such as glacial AcOH, to give 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole sulfoxide or 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole sulfone of formula 5-2, where n is 1 and/or 2, respectively. Alternatively, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole sulfide 5-1 may be treated with about one or more equivalents of an oxidant, such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and a protic solvent, such as methanol (MeOH), to give the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone of formula 5-2, where n is 1 and/or 2, respectively. Pesticidally Acceptable Acid Addition Salts, Salt Derivatives, Solvates, Ester Derivatives, Polymorphs, Isotopes, Radionuclides and Stereoisomers In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be formulated into pesticidally acceptable acid addition salts. By way of a non-limiting example, an amine function can form salts with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, benzoic, citric, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, oxalic, succinic, tartaric, lactic, gluconic, ascorbic, maleic, aspartic, benzenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, hydroxymethanesulfonic, hydroxyethanesulfonic, and trifluoroacetic acids. Additionally, by way of a non-limiting example, an acid function can form salts including those derived from alkali or alkaline earth metals and those derived from ammonia and amines. Examples of preferred cations include sodium, potassium, and magnesium. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be formulated into salt derivatives. By way of a non-limiting example, a salt derivative can be prepared by contacting a free base with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt. A free base may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium carbonate, ammonia, and sodium bicarbonate. As an example, in many cases, a pesticide, such as 2,4-D, is made more water-soluble by converting it to its dimethylamine salt. In further embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be formulated into stable complexes with a solvent, such that the complex remains intact after the non-complexed solvent is removed. These complexes are often referred to as “solvates.” However, it is particularly desirable to form stable hydrates with water as the solvent. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be made into ester derivatives. These ester derivatives can then be applied in the same manner as the invention disclosed in this document is applied. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be made as various crystal polymorphs. Polymorphism is important in the development of agrochemicals since different crystal polymorphs or structures of the same molecule can have vastly different physical properties and biological performances. In further embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be made with different isotopes. Of particular importance are molecules having 2 H (also known as deuterium) in place of 1 H. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be made with different radionuclides. Of particular importance are molecules having 13 C or 14 C. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may exist as one or more stereoisomers. Thus, certain molecules can be produced as racemic mixtures. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that one stereoisomer may be more active than the other stereoisomers. Individual stereoisomers may be obtained by known selective synthetic procedures, by conventional synthetic procedures using resolved starting materials, or by conventional resolution procedures. Certain molecules disclosed in this document can exist as two or more isomers. The various isomers include geometric isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers. Thus, the molecules disclosed in this document include geometric isomers, racemic mixtures, individual stereoisomers, and optically active mixtures. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that one isomer may be more active than the others. The structures disclosed in the present disclosure are drawn in only one geometric form for clarity, but are intended to represent all geometric forms of the molecule.

Biopesticides The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may also be used in combination (such as in a compositional mixture, or a simultaneous or sequential application) with one or more biopesticides. The term “biopesticide” is used for microbial biological pest control agents that are applied in a similar manner to chemical pesticides. Commonly these are bacterial, but there are also examples of fungal control agents, including Trichoderma spp. and Ampelomyces quisqualis (a control agent for grape powdery mildew). Bacillus subtilis are used to control plant pathogens. Weeds and rodents have also been controlled with microbial agents. One well-known insecticide example is Bacillus thuringiensis , a bacterial disease of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera , and Diptera . Because it has little effect on other organisms, it is considered more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides. Biological insecticides include products based on: 1. entomopathogenic fungi (e.g. Metarhizium anisopliae ); 2. entomopathogenic nematodes (e.g. Steinernema feltiae ); and 3. entomopathogenic viruses (e.g. Cydia pomonella granulovirus). Other examples of entomopathogenic organisms include, but are not limited to, baculoviruses, bacteria and other prokaryotic organisms, fungi, protozoa and Microsproridia. Biologically derived insecticides include, but not limited to, rotenone, veratridine, as well as microbial toxins; insect tolerant or resistant plant varieties; and organisms modified by recombinant DNA technology to either produce insecticides or to convey an insect resistant property to the genetically modified organism. In one embodiment, the molecules of Formula One may be used with one or more biopesticides in the area of seed treatments and soil amendments.

Formulations A pesticide is rarely suitable for application in its pure form. It is usually necessary to add other substances so that the pesticide can be used at the required concentration and in an appropriate form, permitting ease of application, handling, transportation, storage, and maximum pesticide activity. Thus, pesticides are formulated into, for example, baits, concentrated emulsions, dusts, emulsifiable concentrates, fumigants, gels, granules, microencapsulations, seed treatments, suspension concentrates, suspoemulsions, tablets, water soluble liquids, water dispersible granules or dry flowables, wettable powders, and ultra low volume solutions. For further information on formulation types see “Catalogue of Pesticide Formulation Types and International Coding System” Technical Monograph no. 2, 5th Edition by CropLife International (2002). Pesticides are applied most often as aqueous suspensions or emulsions prepared from concentrated formulations of such pesticides. Such water-soluble, water-suspendable, or emulsifiable formulations are either solids, usually known as wettable powders, or water dispersible granules, or liquids usually known as emulsifiable concentrates, or aqueous suspensions. Wettable powders, which may be compacted to form water dispersible granules, comprise an intimate mixture of the pesticide, a carrier, and surfactants. The concentration of the pesticide is usually from about 10% to about 90% by weight. The carrier is usually selected from among the attapulgite clays, the montmorillonite clays, the diatomaceous earths, or the purified silicates. Effective surfactants, comprising from about 0.5% to about 10% of the wettable powder, are found among sulfonated lignins, condensed naphthalenesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkyl sulfates, and non-ionic surfactants such as ethylene oxide adducts of alkyl phenols. Emulsifiable concentrates of pesticides comprise a convenient concentration of a pesticide, such as from about 50 to about 500 grams per liter of liquid dissolved in a carrier that is either a water miscible solvent or a mixture of water-immiscible organic solvent and emulsifiers. Useful organic solvents include aromatics, especially xylenes and petroleum fractions, especially the high-boiling naphthalenic and olefinic portions of petroleum such as heavy aromatic naphtha. Other organic solvents may also be used, such as the terpenic solvents including rosin derivatives, aliphatic ketones such as cyclohexanone, and complex alcohols such as 2-ethoxyethanol. Suitable emulsifiers for emulsifiable concentrates are selected from conventional anionic and non-ionic surfactants. Aqueous suspensions comprise suspensions of water-insoluble pesticides dispersed in an aqueous carrier at a concentration in the range from about 5% to about 50% by weight. Suspensions are prepared by finely grinding the pesticide and vigorously mixing it into a carrier comprised of water and surfactants. Ingredients, such as inorganic salts and synthetic or natural gums may also be added, to increase the density and viscosity of the aqueous carrier. It is often most effective to grind and mix the pesticide at the same time by preparing the aqueous mixture and homogenizing it in an implement such as a sand mill, ball mill, or piston-type homogenizer. Pesticides may also be applied as granular compositions that are particularly useful for applications to the soil. Granular compositions usually contain from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the pesticide, dispersed in a carrier that comprises clay or a similar substance. Such compositions are usually prepared by dissolving the pesticide in a suitable solvent and applying it to a granular carrier which has been pre-formed to the appropriate particle size, in the range of from about 0.5 to about 3 mm. Such compositions may also be formulated by making a dough or paste of the carrier and compound and crushing and drying to obtain the desired granular particle size. Dusts containing a pesticide are prepared by intimately mixing the pesticide in powdered form with a suitable dusty agricultural carrier, such as kaolin clay, ground volcanic rock, and the like. Dusts can suitably contain from about 1% to about 10% of the pesticide. They can be applied as a seed dressing or as a foliage application with a dust blower machine. It is equally practical to apply a pesticide in the form of a solution in an appropriate organic solvent, usually petroleum oil, such as the spray oils, which are widely used in agricultural chemistry. Pesticides can also be applied in the form of an aerosol composition. In such compositions the pesticide is dissolved or dispersed in a carrier, which is a pressure-generating propellant mixture. The aerosol composition is packaged in a container from which the mixture is dispensed through an atomizing valve. Pesticide baits are formed when the pesticide is mixed with food or an attractant or both. When the pests eat the bait they also consume the pesticide. Baits may take the form of granules, gels, flowable powders, liquids, or solids. They can be used in pest harborages. Fumigants are pesticides that have a relatively high vapor pressure and hence can exist as a gas in sufficient concentrations to kill pests in soil or enclosed spaces. The toxicity of the fumigant is proportional to its concentration and the exposure time. They are characterized by a good capacity for diffusion and act by penetrating the pest's respiratory system or being absorbed through the pest's cuticle. Fumigants are applied to control stored product pests under gas proof sheets, in gas sealed rooms or buildings or in special chambers. Pesticides can be microencapsulated by suspending the pesticide particles or droplets in plastic polymers of various types. By altering the chemistry of the polymer or by changing factors in the processing, microcapsules can be formed of various sizes, solubility, wall thicknesses, and degrees of penetrability. These factors govern the speed with which the active ingredient within is released, which in turn, affects the residual performance, speed of action, and odor of the product. Oil solution concentrates are made by dissolving pesticide in a solvent that will hold the pesticide in solution. Oil solutions of a pesticide usually provide faster knockdown and kill of pests than other formulations due to the solvents themselves having pesticidal action and the dissolution of the waxy covering of the integument increasing the speed of uptake of the pesticide. Other advantages of oil solutions include better storage stability, better penetration of crevices, and better adhesion to greasy surfaces. Another embodiment is an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the emulsion comprises oily globules which are each provided with a lamellar liquid crystal coating and are dispersed in an aqueous phase, wherein each oily globule comprises at least one compound which is agriculturally active, and is individually coated with a monolamellar or oligolamellar layer comprising: (1) at least one non-ionic lipophilic surface-active agent, (2) at least one non-ionic hydrophilic surface-active agent and (3) at least one ionic surface-active agent, wherein the globules having a mean particle diameter of less than 800 nanometers. Further information on the embodiment is disclosed in U.S. patent publication 20070027034 published Feb. 1, 2007, having patent application Ser. No. 11/495,228.

Other Formulation Components Generally, when the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III are used in a formulation, such formulation can also contain other components. These components include, but are not limited to, (this is a non-exhaustive and non-mutually exclusive list) wetters, spreaders, stickers, penetrants, buffers, sequestering agents, drift reduction agents, compatibility agents, anti-foam agents, cleaning agents, and emulsifiers. A few components are described forthwith. A wetting agent is a substance that when added to a liquid increases the spreading or penetration power of the liquid by reducing the interfacial tension between the liquid and the surface on which it is spreading. Wetting agents are used for two main functions in agrochemical formulations: during processing and manufacture to increase the rate of wetting of powders in water to make concentrates for soluble liquids or suspension concentrates; and during mixing of a product with water in a spray tank to reduce the wetting time of wettable powders and to improve the penetration of water into water-dispersible granules. Examples of wetting agents used in wettable powder, suspension concentrate, and water-dispersible granule formulations are: sodium lauryl sulfate; sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate; alkyl phenol ethoxylates; and aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates. A dispersing agent is a substance which adsorbs onto the surface of particles and helps to preserve the state of dispersion of the particles and prevents them from reaggregating. Dispersing agents are added to agrochemical formulations to facilitate dispersion and suspension during manufacture, and to ensure the particles redisperse into water in a spray tank. They are widely used in wettable powders, suspension concentrates and water-dispersible granules. Surfactants that are used as dispersing agents have the ability to adsorb strongly onto a particle surface and provide a charged or steric barrier to reaggregation of particles. The most commonly used surfactants are anionic, non-ionic, or mixtures of the two types. For wettable powder formulations, the most common dispersing agents are sodium lignosulfonates. For suspension concentrates, very good adsorption and stabilization are obtained using polyelectrolytes, such as sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates. Tristyrylphenol ethoxylate phosphate esters are also used. Non-ionics such as alkylarylethylene oxide condensates and EO-PO block copolymers are sometimes combined with anionics as dispersing agents for suspension concentrates. In recent years, new types of very high molecular weight polymeric surfactants have been developed as dispersing agents. These have very long hydrophobic “backbones” and a large number of ethylene oxide chains forming the “teeth” of a “comb” surfactant. These high molecular weight polymers can give very good long-term stability to suspension concentrates because the hydrophobic backbones have many anchoring points onto the particle surfaces. Examples of dispersing agents used in agrochemical formulations are: sodium lignosulfonates; sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates; tristyrylphenol ethoxylate phosphate esters; aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates; alkyl ethoxylates; EO-PO block copolymers; and graft copolymers. An emulsifying agent is a substance which stabilizes a suspension of droplets of one liquid phase in another liquid phase. Without the emulsifying agent the two liquids would separate into two immiscible liquid phases. The most commonly used emulsifier blends contain alkylphenol or aliphatic alcohol with twelve or more ethylene oxide units and the oil-soluble calcium salt of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid. A range of hydrophile-lipophile balance (“HLB”) values from 8 to 18 will normally provide good stable emulsions. Emulsion stability can sometimes be improved by the addition of a small amount of an EO-PO block copolymer surfactant. A solubilizing agent is a surfactant which will form micelles in water at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration. The micelles are then able to dissolve or solubilize water-insoluble materials inside the hydrophobic part of the micelle. The types of surfactants usually used for solubilization are non-ionics, sorbitan monooleates, sorbitan monooleate ethoxylates, and methyl oleate esters. Surfactants are sometimes used, either alone or with other additives such as mineral or vegetable oils as adjuvants to spray-tank mixes to improve the biological performance of the pesticide on the target. The types of surfactants used for bioenhancement depend generally on the nature and mode of action of the pesticide. However, they are often non-ionics such as: alkyl ethoxylates; linear aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates; aliphatic amine ethoxylates. A carrier or diluent in an agricultural formulation is a material added to the pesticide to give a product of the required strength. Carriers are usually materials with high absorptive capacities, while diluents are usually materials with low absorptive capacities. Carriers and diluents are used in the formulation of dusts, wettable powders, granules and water-dispersible granules. Organic solvents are used mainly in the formulation of emulsifiable concentrates, oil-in-water emulsions, suspoemulsions, and ultra low volume formulations, and to a lesser extent, granular formulations. Sometimes mixtures of solvents are used. The first main groups of solvents are aliphatic paraffinic oils such as kerosene or refined paraffins. The second main group (and the most common) comprises the aromatic solvents such as xylene and higher molecular weight fractions of C9 and C10 aromatic solvents. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are useful as cosolvents to prevent crystallization of pesticides when the formulation is emulsified into water. Alcohols are sometimes used as cosolvents to increase solvent power. Other solvents may include vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters of vegetable and seed oils. Thickeners or gelling agents are used mainly in the formulation of suspension concentrates, emulsions and suspoemulsions to modify the rheology or flow properties of the liquid and to prevent separation and settling of the dispersed particles or droplets. Thickening, gelling, and anti-settling agents generally fall into two categories, namely water-insoluble particulates and water-soluble polymers. It is possible to produce suspension concentrate formulations using clays and silicas. Examples of these types of materials, include, but are not limited to, montmorillonite, bentonite, magnesium aluminum silicate, and attapulgite. Water-soluble polysaccharides have been used as thickening-gelling agents for many years. The types of polysaccharides most commonly used are natural extracts of seeds and seaweeds or are synthetic derivatives of cellulose. Examples of these types of materials include, but are not limited to, guar gum; locust bean gum; carrageenam; alginates; methyl cellulose; sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC); hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). Other types of anti-settling agents are based on modified starches, polyacrylates, polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene oxide. Another good anti-settling agent is xanthan gum. Microorganisms can cause spoilage of formulated products. Therefore preservation agents are used to eliminate or reduce their effect. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to: propionic acid and its sodium salt; sorbic acid and its sodium or potassium salts; benzoic acid and its sodium salt; p-hydroxybenzoic acid sodium salt; methyl p-hydroxybenzoate; and 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT). The presence of surfactants often causes water-based formulations to foam during mixing operations in production and in application through a spray tank. In order to reduce the tendency to foam, anti-foam agents are often added either during the production stage or before filling into bottles. Generally, there are two types of anti-foam agents, namely silicones and non-silicones. Silicones are usually aqueous emulsions of dimethyl polysiloxane, while the non-silicone anti-foam agents are water-insoluble oils, such as octanol and nonanol, or silica. In both cases, the function of the anti-foam agent is to displace the surfactant from the air-water interface. “Green” agents (e.g., adjuvants, surfactants, solvents) can reduce the overall environmental footprint of crop protection formulations. Green agents are biodegradable and generally derived from natural and/or sustainable sources, e.g. plant and animal sources. Specific examples are: vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters thereof, also alkoxylated alkyl polyglucosides.

Pesticidal Activities The disclosed pesticidal compositions may be used, for example, as nematicides, acaricides, pesticides, insecticides, miticides, and/or molluscicides. In one particular embodiment, a method of controlling pests comprises applying a pesticidal composition comprising a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III near a population of pests. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III are generally used in amounts from about 0.01 grams per hectare to about 5000 grams per hectare to provide control. Amounts from about 0.1 grams per hectare to about 500 grams per hectare are generally preferred, and amounts from about 1 gram per hectare to about 50 grams per hectare are generally more preferred. The area to which a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III is applied can be any area inhabited (or maybe inhabited, or traversed by) a pest, for example: where crops, trees, fruits, cereals, fodder species, vines, turf and ornamental plants, are growing; where domesticated animals are residing; the interior or exterior surfaces of buildings (such as places where grains are stored), the materials of construction used in building (such as impregnated wood), and the soil around buildings. Particular crop areas to use a molecule of Formula One include areas where apples, corn, sunflowers, cotton, soybeans, canola, wheat, rice, sorghum, barley, oats, potatoes, oranges, alfalfa, lettuce, strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, crucifers, pears, tobacco, almonds, sugar beets, beans and other valuable crops are growing or the seeds thereof are going to be planted. It is also advantageous to use ammonium sulfate with a 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound when growing various plants. Controlling pests generally means that pest populations, pest activity, or both, are reduced in an area. This can come about when: pest populations are repulsed from an area; when pests are incapacitated in or around an area; or pests are exterminated, in whole, or in part, in or around an area. Of course, a combination of these results can occur. Generally, pest populations, activity, or both are desirably reduced more than fifty percent, preferably more than 90 percent. Generally, the area is not in or on a human; consequently, the locus is generally a non-human area. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used in mixtures, applied simultaneously or sequentially, alone or with other compounds to enhance plant vigor (e.g. to grow a better root system, to better withstand stressful growing conditions). Such other compounds are, for example, compounds that modulate plant ethylene receptors, most notably 1-methylcyclopropene (also known as 1-MCP). Furthermore, such molecules may be used during times when pest activity is low, such as before the plants that are growing begin to produce valuable agricultural commodities. Such times include the early planting season when pest pressure is usually low. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be applied to the foliar and fruiting portions of plants to control pests. The molecules will either come in direct contact with the pest, or the pest will consume the pesticide when eating leaf, fruit mass, or extracting sap, that contains the pesticide. The 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound can also be applied to the soil, and when applied in this manner, root and stem feeding pests can be controlled. The roots can absorb a molecule taking it up into the foliar portions of the plant to control above ground chewing and sap feeding pests. Generally, with baits, the baits are placed in the ground where, for example, termites can come into contact with, and/or be attracted to, the bait. Baits can also be applied to a surface of a building, (horizontal, vertical, or slant surface) where, for example, ants, termites, cockroaches, and flies, can come into contact with, and/or be attracted to, the bait. Baits can comprise a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be encapsulated inside, or placed on the surface of a capsule. The size of the capsules can range from nanometer size (about 100-900 nanometers in diameter) to micrometer size (about 10-900 microns in diameter). Because of the unique ability of the eggs of some pests to resist certain pesticides, repeated applications of the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be desirable to control newly emerged larvae. Systemic movement of pesticides in plants may be utilized to control pests on one portion of the plant by applying (for example by spraying an area) the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III to a different portion of the plant. For example, control of foliar-feeding insects can be achieved by drip irrigation or furrow application, by treating the soil with for example pre- or post-planting soil drench, or by treating the seeds of a plant before planting. Seed treatment can be applied to all types of seeds, including those from which plants genetically modified to express specialized traits will germinate. Representative examples include those expressing proteins toxic to invertebrate pests, such as Bacillus thuringiensis or other insecticidal toxins, those expressing herbicide resistance, such as “Roundup Ready” seed, or those with “stacked” foreign genes expressing insecticidal toxins, herbicide resistance, nutrition-enhancement, drought resistance, or any other beneficial traits. Furthermore, such seed treatments with the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may further enhance the ability of a plant to better withstand stressful growing conditions. This results in a healthier, more vigorous plant, which can lead to higher yields at harvest time. Generally, about 1 gram of the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III to about 500 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide good benefits, amounts from about 10 grams to about 100 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide better benefits, and amounts from about 25 grams to about 75 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide even better benefits. It should be readily apparent that the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used on, in, or around plants genetically modified to express specialized traits, such as Bacillus thuringiensis or other insecticidal toxins, or those expressing herbicide resistance, or those with “stacked” foreign genes expressing insecticidal toxins, herbicide resistance, nutrition-enhancement, or any other beneficial traits. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used for controlling endoparasites and ectoparasites in the veterinary medicine sector or in the field of non-human animal keeping. The 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound are applied, such as by oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, granules, by dermal application in the form of, for example, dipping, spraying, pouring on, spotting on, and dusting, and by parenteral administration in the form of, for example, an injection. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be employed advantageously in livestock keeping, for example, cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, and geese. They may also be employed advantageously in pets such as, horses, dogs, and cats. Particular pests to control would be fleas and ticks that are bothersome to such animals. Suitable formulations are administered orally to the animals with the drinking water or feed. The dosages and formulations that are suitable depend on the species. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used for controlling parasitic worms, especially of the intestine, in the animals listed above. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be employed in therapeutic methods for human health care. Such methods include, but are limited to, oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, granules, and by dermal application. Pests around the world have been migrating to new environments (for such pest) and thereafter becoming a new invasive species in such new environment. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used on such new invasive species to control them in such new environment. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used in an area where plants, such as crops, are growing (e.g. pre-planting, planting, pre-harvesting) and where there are low levels (even no actual presence) of pests that can commercially damage such plants. The use of such molecules in such area is to benefit the plants being grown in the area. Such benefits, may include, but are not limited to, improving the health of a plant, improving the yield of a plant (e.g. increased biomass and/or increased content of valuable ingredients), improving the vigor of a plant (e.g. improved plant growth and/or greener leaves), improving the quality of a plant (e.g. improved content or composition of certain ingredients), and improving the tolerance to abiotic and/or biotic stress of the plant. Before a pesticide can be used or sold commercially, such pesticide undergoes lengthy evaluation processes by various governmental authorities (local, regional, state, national, and international). Voluminous data requirements are specified by regulatory authorities and must be addressed through data generation and submission by the product registrant or by a third party on the product registrant's behalf, often using a computer with a connection to the World Wide Web. These governmental authorities then review such data and if a determination of safety is concluded, provide the potential user or seller with product registration approval. Thereafter, in that locality where the product registration is granted and supported, such user or seller may use or sell such pesticide. A 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be tested to determine its efficacy against pests. Furthermore, mode of action studies can be conducted to determine if said molecule has a different mode of action than other pesticides. Thereafter, such acquired data can be disseminated, such as by the internet, to third parties. The disclosed pesticidal composition comprising a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used to control a wide variety of pests.

4921024,Method and apparatus to fell a tree,1989-10-16,1,0,"This invention relates to a method and apparatus to sever a standing tree from its base, specifically the invention relates to a circular saw and a saw guard mounted on a vehicle to sever a tree by advancing the saw toward the tree. Many devices have been developed for felling trees. Some of these devices have been incorporated into self propelled mechanisms by mounting the felling head on a vehicle. The one thing all of the machines have in common is that a mechanism is provided to sever the tree from its base. Large shears, reciprocating saw blades, various configurations of chain saw blades and circular saws all have been used with some success. Generally the devices which use circular saws have a guard or housing about the circular saw blade to protect the operator and other personnel from the saw blade. An opening is usually provided in the front portion of the guard to expose a portion of the saw blade for cutting the tree. This arrangement, however, limits the diameter of the tree which can be cut. One method to cut oversize trees was to partially cut the front side of a tree, drive the felling apparatus to the back of the tree and complete the severing from the backside of the tree. This method is time consuming and often is not practical because of the density of most woodlots. Kurelek, U.S. Pat. No. 4,446,897, recognized the mobility problem and mounted the circular saw and felling head on a boom which is attached to a vehicle. Kurelek also placed a second opening in the saw guard to allow the saw blade to cut on either side. The Kurelek apparatus was thus able to cut in a straight ahead mode or in a side-swing or scything mode. Although an improvement over the prior art the Kurelek patent has the disadvantage of leaving the second portion of the saw blade exposed and unprotected. Kurelek also does not address the problem of felling an oversize tree. The present invention thus overcomes the limitations and problems in the prior art. The present invention includes a felling head mounted on a vehicle. The felling head includes a frame having an upper portion and a lower portion. A bunching arm is attached to the upper portion of the frame and a circular saw is supported by the lower portion of the frame. A guard overlays the circular saw. The guard has a first or fixed portion attached to the frame and a second or movable portion hinged to the first portion. A means to move the second portion of the guard has its first end attached to the frame and its second end attached to the second portion of the guard. An opening is provided in the fixed portion of the guard to expose a first arcuate portion of the circular saw. The second portion of the guard, when raised, exposes a second arcuate portion of the circular saw. To sever a large tree, the guard is raised and the second arcuate portion of the circular saw is advanced in a first direction to cut a first side of the tree. The vehicle is reversed, bringing the circular saw out of engagement with the tree. The vehicle is then advanced in a second direction which is at an angle to the first direction bringing the first arcuate portion of the saw into cutting engagement with the second side of the tree to completely sever the tree. It is an object of the invention to provide a mobile apparatus to fell a tree, the apparatus having a circular saw mounted thereon which can fell a tree larger in diameter than the radius of the saw. It is a further object of the invention to provide a guard about the circular saw, the guard having a movable portion which can selectively either expose or overlay a portion of the circular saw. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof and from the attached drawings."

8260465,Data communication in a multi-wire irrigation control system,2009-07-17,1,0,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation devices, and more particularly to the communication of data using an alternating power signal to be supplied to irrigation devices. 2. Discussion of the Related Art Typical irrigation control systems cooperate with water valves and pumps to control the flow of irrigation water through a variety of water dispensing devices, including sprinklers, rotors, drip-lines, and other water delivery devices. These control systems are used in a wide variety of irrigation applications, from residential and commercial landscapes to golf course and agricultural irrigation. Many irrigation systems and electronics are powered by 50/60 Hz AC voltage signals. Some systems further modulate this power source to provide data communication, for example, by selectively clipping the positive half of the AC voltage signal. Data and power sent in this manner are often over a two-wire transmission line and are often referred to as a two-wire interface. Irrigation devices variously located in the field couple to the two-wire interface and derive their operational power therefrom. The irrigation devices demodulate the data monitoring the received power signal for a missing negative half of a cycle, then taking eight voltage samples at a predetermined time thereafter during the positive half to detect whether the signal is clipped or unclipped. Such systems are well known in the art and described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,395 to Evelyn-Veere. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for providing power and data to an irrigation device. The method includes modulating data onto an alternating power signal by distorting an amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, permitting effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and applying the alternating power signal to a multi-wire interface configured to couple with a plurality of irrigation devices. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system. The method includes receiving an alternating power signal comprising cycles each having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and demodulating data represented by the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device having a modulator configured to modulate data onto an alternating power signal by distorting amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, and permit effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal. The irrigation controller further includes an interface configured to couple the modulator to a multi-wire interface coupled to a plurality of irrigation devices to permit the alternating power signal to be applied to the multi-wire interface. In still yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation device having an input configured to receive an alternating power signal comprising cycles having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and a demodulator configured to provide data by demodulating the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In a further embodiment, the invention may be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system, the method comprising: receiving, at an irrigation device, an alternating power signal comprising cycles, where an amplitude of a portion of each cycle is selectively distorted to modulate data on the alternating power signal; determining a slope of the portion of each cycle; and demodulating the data based upon the determining the slope"

No. 8,028,470, entitled “Robotic Watering Unit” all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention relates generally to an irrigation control system and, more particularly, to a system and method for managing resource use in yards and gardens. Horticulture is the industry and science of plant cultivation. Horticulturists work and conduct research in the disciplines of plant propagation and cultivation, crop production, plant breeding and genetic engineering, plant biochemistry, and plant physiology. The work particularly involves fruits, berries, nuts, vegetables, flowers, trees, shrubs, and turf. Horticulturists work to improve crop yield, quality, nutritional value, and resistance to insects, diseases, and environmental stresses. One aspect of horticultural management is irrigation. Irrigation is typically used to water large, homogeneous areas such as fields, lawns, and gardens. The water is assumed to be available from a single source, such as a well, canal, or municipal water system. Water from municipal water systems are often stressed during times of heat and drought, and watering restrictions are frequently implemented to provide adequate water for higher priority uses. These restrictions may start as odd-even day lawn watering and progress to complete bans on lawn watering, and finally to complete bans on garden watering. The fields and lawns typically have a single species of plant and water application is based on water sensors, evapotranspiration models, or rules. This type of irrigation system can be inadequate for yards and gardens where numerous species are growing in close proximity, particularly large water users like trees and shrubs in proximity to lesser water users. Trees, shrubs, and structures also provide shade, which impacts evapotranspiration, which is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration. An embodiment of the present invention provides a computer program product comprising a computer recordable media having computer usable program code. Resource needs are determined for each plant in a plurality of plants to form individual resource needs. Conditions are identified in an environment in which the plurality of plants are located by receiving input from a sensor system to form current conditions. A plurality of per plant prescriptions are calculated for the plurality of plants using the individual resource needs and the current conditions. The application of the resource is controlled from a mobile utility vehicle to each plant in the plurality of plants using the plurality of per plant prescriptions.

Such systems are well known in the art and described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,395 to Evelyn-Veere. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for providing power and data to an irrigation device. The method includes modulating data onto an alternating power signal by distorting an amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, permitting effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and applying the alternating power signal to a multi-wire interface configured to couple with a plurality of irrigation devices. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system. The method includes receiving an alternating power signal comprising cycles each having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and demodulating data represented by the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device having a modulator configured to modulate data onto an alternating power signal by distorting amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, and permit effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal. The irrigation controller further includes an interface configured to couple the modulator to a multi-wire interface coupled to a plurality of irrigation devices to permit the alternating power signal to be applied to the multi-wire interface. In still yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation device having an input configured to receive an alternating power signal comprising cycles having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and a demodulator configured to provide data by demodulating the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In a further embodiment, the invention may be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system, the method comprising: receiving, at an irrigation device, an alternating power signal comprising cycles, where an amplitude of a portion of each cycle is selectively distorted to modulate data on the alternating power signal; determining a slope of the portion of each cycle; and demodulating the data based upon the determining the slope"

6506243,Environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends,1999-05-05,0,1,"FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the selection and use of environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends which exhibit low or reduced reactivity with respect to ozone formation. These environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends are useful in a number of applications, particularly as industrial solvents, and allow formulators an effective means to improve the environmental performance of their formulations or products. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fluid applications are broad, varied, and complex, and each application has its own set of characteristics and requirements. Proper fluid selection and fluid blend development have a large impact on the success of the operation in which the fluid is used. For instance, in a typical industrial coatings operation, a blend of several fluids is used in order to get an appropriate evaporation profile. Such a blend must also provide the appropriate solvency properties, including formulation stability, viscosity, flow/leveling, and the like. The fluid blend choice also affects the properties of the dry film, such as gloss, adhesion, and the like. Moreover, these and other properties may further vary according to the application method (e.g., spray-on), whether the substrate is original equipment (OEM), refinished, etc., and the nature of the substrate coated. Other operations involving the use of fluids and fluid blends include cleaning, printing, delivery of agricultural insecticides and pesticides, extraction processes, use in adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, and drilling muds, and countless others. The term """"fluid"""" encompasses the traditional notion of a solvent, but the latter term no longer adequately describes the possible function of a fluid or blend in the countless possible operations. As used herein the term """"fluid"""" includes material that may function as one or more of a carrier, a diluent, a surface tension modifier, dispersant, and the like, as well as a material functioning as a solvent, in the traditional sense of a liquid which solvates a substance (e.g., a solute). The term """"industrial solvent"""" applies to a class of liquid organic compounds used on a large scale to perform one or more of the numerous functions of a fluid in a variety of industries. Relatively few of the large number of known organic compounds that could be used as fluids find use as industrial solvents. Fluids that are used in large quantities have heretofore been selected because they can be produced economically and have attractive safety and use characteristics in manufacturing, consumer and commercial environments. Examples of commercial solvents and their uses as industrial solvents are described in an article entitled """"Solvents, Industrial"""", by Don A. Sullivan, Shell Chemical, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th. ed., V. 22, pp.529-571(III) (1997). In addition to the problems with fluid and fluid blend selection mentioned at the outset, there is also the problem that, in most applications, at least some of the fluid evaporates and can escape into the environment. Although many industrial coating operations, such as in original equipment manufacturing (OEM), utilize control equipment to capture or incinerate >95% of the solvent emissions, nevertheless in a majority of applications some of the solvents inevitably enters the atmosphere. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six pollutants: ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and particulates. Of all the NAAQS standards, ozone non-attainment has the greatest impact on solvent operations. Solvents typically are volatile organic compounds (VOC), which are involved in complex photochemical atmospheric reactions, along with oxygen and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere under the influence of sunlight, to produce ozone. Ozone formation is a problem in the troposphere (low atmospheric or """"ground-based""""), particularly in an urban environment, since it leads to the phenomenon of smog. Since VOC emissions are a source of ozone formation, industrial operations and plants using solvents are heavily regulated to attain ozone compliance. As different regulations have been adopted, the various approaches to controlling pollution have evolved. Certain early regulations controlled solvent composition, while later regulations primarily concerned overall VOC reduction. According to current VOC emission regulations in the U.S.A., solvents generally belong to one of two groups depending on their reactivity toward atmospheric photochemical ozone formation: (a) Negligible reactivity organic compounds which generate about the same or less quantity of ozone as would be produced by the same weight % as ethane. These organic compounds are exempt from the definition of a VOC and are not considered to be a VOC in any solvent (fluid) composition. There are numerous such compounds exempted by the EPA from the definition of VOC. However, a majority of such exempted compounds are halogenated derivatives which can possess one or more of the following deficiencies: toxicity, ozone depletion, or waste disposal or incineration problems. Other non-halogenated, oxygenated organic compounds, such as acetone and methyl acetate, have been exempted by the EPA, but such compounds have extremely high evaporation rates and high flammability so as to reduce their applicability in numerous applications. Other such organic compounds, such as tertiary butyl acetate which is under exemption consideration by the EPA, while having a significantly improved flammability level and evaporation rate, may be too chemically and thermally unstable for many applications. (b) All other oxygenated and hydrocarbon solvents are considered to be VOC's and treated by the EPA as equally (on a weight basis) polluting. A more recent U.S. regulation has combined VOC reduction with composition constraints. While the traditional source of emission reduction is large stationary industrial facilities, the EPA and other governmental entities have turned increasingly to consumer and commercial products for reduction in their solvent usage as an additional means to lower VOC emission and therefore ozone formation. Numerous government and trade publications discuss VOC's, and information is readily available on the Internet. See, for instance, http://www.paintcoatings.net/VOCW97.html. Various measurements of reactivity with respect to ozone formation are known. For instance, reactivity can be measured in environmental smog chambers, or they may be calculated using computer airshed models. See, for instance, Dr. William P. L. Carter, """"Uncertainties and Research Needs in Quantifying VOC Reactivity for Stationary Source Emission Controls"""", presented at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Consumer Products Reactivity Subgroup Meeting, Sacramento, Calif. (Oct. 17, 1995). There has also been developed a """"KOH scale"""", which provides a relative scale of the reactivity of VOC with the OH radicals involved in the complex reactions that produce ozone. See, for instance, Picquet et al., Int. J. Chem. Kinet. 30, 839-847 (1998); Bilde et al., J. Phys. Chem. A 101, 3514-3525 (1997). Numerous other reactivity scales are known and new reactivity scales are constantly being developed. Since this is a rapidly changing area of research, the most up-to-date information is often obtained via the Internet. One example is Airsite, the Atmospheric Chemistry International Research Site for Information and Technology Exchange, sponsored by the University of North Carolina and the University of Leeds, at http://airsite.unc.edu. Another way to measure the reactivity of a chemical in ozone formation is by using a technique developed by Dr. Carter (supra) at the Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CERT), University of California at Riverside. The CERT technique measures """"incremental reactivities"""", the incremental amount of ozone that is produced when the chemical is added to an already polluted atmosphere. Two experiments are conducted to measure the incremental reactivity. A base case experiment measures the ozone produced in an environmental smog chamber under atmospheric conditions designed to represent a polluted atmosphere. The second experiment called """"the test case"""" adds the chemical to the """"polluted"""" smog chamber to determine how much more ozone is produced by the newly added chemical. The results of these tests under certain conditions of VOC and nitrogen oxide ratios are then used in mechanistic models to determine the Maximum Incremental Reactivities (MIR), which is a measure of ozone formation by the chemical compound in question. The State of California has adopted a reactivity program for alternative fuels based on this technique and the EPA has exempted several compounds due to studies conducted by CERT. See, for instance, Federal Register 31,633 (Jun. 16, 1995) (acetone); 59 Federal Register 50,693 (Oct. 5, 1994) (methyl siloxanes), Federal Register 17,331 (Apr. 9, 1998) (methyl acetate). CARB and EPA have uses a weight average MIR for regulatory purposes, wherein the weight average MIR of a solvent blend is calculated by summing the product of the weight percent of each solvent and its respective MIR value. A list of compounds and their MIR values is available in the Preliminary Report to California Air Resources Board, Contract No. 95-308, William P. L. Carter, Aug. 6, 1998. A table of known MIR values may be found on the internet at http://helium.ucr.edu/~carter/index.html. CERT obtains other incremental reactivities by varying the ratios of VOC and nitrogen oxides. A detailed explanation of the methods employed and the determination of incremental reactivities and MIR scale may be found in the literature. See, for instance, International Journal of Chemical Kinetics, 28, 497-530 (1996); Atmospheric Environment, 29, 2513-2527 (1995), and 29, 2499-2511 (1995); and Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 44, 881-899 (1994); Environ. Sci. Technol. 23, 864 (1989). Moreover, various computer programs to assist in calculating MIR values are available, such as the SAPRC97 model, at http://helium.ucr.edu/~carter/saprc97.htm. Any of these aforementioned scales could be used for regulatory purposes, however the MIR scale has been found to correlate best to peak ozone formation in certain urban areas having high pollution, such as the Los Angeles basin. MIR values can be reported as the absolute MIR determined by the CERT method or as a relative MIR. One common relative MIR scale uses the Reactive Organic Gas (ROG) in the base case as a benchmark. The Absolute Reactivity ROG is 3.93 g O3 per gram ROG. This value is then the divisor for the absolute MIR of other VOCs, if MIR is cited relative to ROG. Absolute reactivities related to the ROG with the above mentioned absolute reactivity 3.93 are provided in """"Updated Maximum Incremental Reactivity Scale for Regulatory Applications"""", Preliminary Report to California Air Resources Board, Contract No. 95-308, William P. Carter, Aug. 6, 1998. For the purposes of this invention and specification, unless otherwise specifically stated, all MIR values provided herein are Absolute MIR values. It is understood, however, that the Absolute MIR values can be converted to Relative MIR and back to Absolute MIR by division or multiplication of MIR by ROG. Current regulations based on VOC emissions do not take into consideration the wide difference in ozone formation among non-exempt VOC compounds. For example, two non-exempt VOC compounds can have dramatically different ozone formation characteristics. Accordingly, current regulations do not encourage end users to minimize ozone formation by using low reactivity solvent compositions. Although there are federal and state regulatory trends toward requiring the reduction of the reactivity of solvents, the number of exempt solvents is small and in no way satisfies all the other properties required for an effective solvent such as good solvency, appropriate flash point, evaporation rate, boiling temperature, chemical and thermal stability. Solvents currently viewed as essentially non-ozone producing are those which have reactivity rates in the range of ethane. Ethane has a measured reactivity based on the MIR method of 0.35. In fact, the EPA has granted a VOC exemption to certain solvents with reactivity values in this range including acetone (MIR=0.48) and methyl acetate (MIR=0.12). However, the number of known materials having reactivities of 0.50 or less based on the MIR scale is relatively small. Moreover, it is a discovery of the present inventors that many if not most of the known fluids having acceptable reactivities with respect to ozone formation have other unfavorable performance characteristics, e.g., poor solvent properties, low flash point, inappropriate evaporation rate or volatility characteristics, unacceptable toxicity, unacceptable particulate matter formation, thermal or chemical instability and as such have limited, if any, applicability in industry. For example, ethane is a gas under ambient conditions and hence is a poor choice as an industrial solvent. Methyl acetate has an excellent MIR=0.12, but a low flash point of about -12deg C.; acetone has an acceptable MIR=0.48, but is extremely flammable. As a further example, tertiary butyl acetate (t-butyl acetate) has an excellent MIR=0.21, but has limited thermal stability and is unstable to acid catalysts which may be present in an industrial operation. Regarding particulate matter, the EPA has recently proposed standards for particulate matter under 2.5 &mgr;m (microns) in diameter (""""PM2.5""""). See 61 Federal Register 65638-65713 (Dec. 13, 1996). The proposal sets an annual limit, spatially averaged across designated air quality monitors, of 15 &mgr;g/m3, and a 24-hour standard of 65 &mgr;g/m3. Numerous discussions of this proposed standard are available on the internet, such as at http://www.cnie.org/nle/air~html, which cites numerous references (such as Wolf, """"The Scientific Basis for a Particulate Matter Standard"""", Environmental Management (Oct. 26-31, 1996)). As far as the present inventors are aware, the prior art has not addressed ways of meeting these proposed requirements, much less in meeting these requirements in conjunction with ozone reduction requirements. Moreover, the present inventors have also discovered that in many applications, VOC exempt solvents cannot be used as a one-for-one replacement for conventional solvents. Rather the formulator must balance a number of performance factors to develop an acceptable solvent or solvent blend for a particular application. Some factors are more relevant than others for specific applications. Nevertheless, many performance factors are similar for a number of applications. Numerous attempts have been made to utilize the concept of """"environmentally friendly"""" fluids in practical applications. For instance, there are a number of cleaning and/or stripping formulations available that are said to overcome certain prior art environmental problems. Examples include a binary azeotrope of octamethyltrisiloxane with n-propoxypropanol (U.S. Pat. No. 5,516,450), hexamethyidisiloxane and azeotropes and other mixtures thereof (U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,403), a nonazeotropic mixture including a halocarbon and an oxygenated organic solvent component having at least 3 carbons, which may be, for instance, dimethylcarbonate (U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,080), and a composition comprising an amide and a dialkyl carbonate (U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,133). In addition, there have been a number of patents and literature references to materials intended to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as, for instance, blowing agents. These efforts address stratospheric ozone depletion, which is the opposite phenomenon addressed by the present invention. Examples include the use of dimethoxymethane and cyclopentane (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,631,305; 5,665,788; and 5,723,509), cyclopentane (U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,652) and polyglycols (U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,144). Still further, a """"non-ozone depleting"""" solvent comprising halogenated compounds and an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon compound having 6-20 carbon atoms is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,749,956. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,480 describes a method for reducing the levels of air pollution resulting from the combustion of diesel fuel in engines comprising blending dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with diesel fuel and combusting the blended fuel in engines. U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,144 also discusses the addition of oxygenates, including methyl pivalate (methyl 1,1,1-trimethyl acetate) to gasoline (as octane boosters). The problems addressed by these patents do not relate to the problem of industrial solvent evaporation. WO 98/42774 discloses solvent-resin compositions which """"do not contribute appreciably to the formation of ground based ozone"""". Organic solvents are selected based upon having """"reaction rates with hydroxyl ion slower than ethane"""", and generally selected from halogenated solvents such as chlorobromomethane, methyl chloride, and the like. The only non-halogenated solvents that are suggested are n-alkanes (C12 -C18), methyl and t-butyl acetate, acetone, dimethoxymethane, and mineral oils. However, heretofore there has been no general solution to the problem of ground-based ozone formation that also provides for a fluid with appropriate performance attributes for an industrial solvent. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends, their use as industrial solvents, and to a method of reducing ozone formation in a process wherein at least a portion of a fluid eventually evaporates. The fluids and fluid blends of this invention have been selected by the present inventors for their actual or potential low reactivity in the complex photochemical atmospheric reaction with molecular oxygen (O2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to create ozone. The present invention provides a means to reduce ozone formation by photochemical atmospheric reactions from a fluid solvent composition which is intended at application conditions to at least partially evaporate into the atmosphere. By properly selecting low reactive components for a fluid solvent composition, ozone formation can be reduced. For the purposes of the present invention three groups of reduced ozone reactivity fluids and their uses are described and claimed: (a) Low Polluting Potential Fluid (LPPF), (b) Very Low Polluting Potential Fluid (VLPPF), and (c) Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid (NPPF), according to the Absolute MIR numbers as follows: Fluid Solvent Designation Absolute MIR Low Polluting Potential Fluid >1.0-<=1.5 gm ozone produced/ gm fluid Very Low Polluting Potential Fluid >0.5-<=1.0 gm ozone produced/ gm fluid Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid <=0.5 gm ozone produced/gm fluid Where a composition is a blend of fluids, a weight average MIR (WAMIR) can be calculated as WAMIR=&Sgr;Wi*MIRi Where Wi is a weight fraction of solvent fluid component i and MIRi is the absolute MIR value of solvent fluid component i. For the purposes of the present invention, WAMIR will be the preferred method of measuring """"ozone formation potential"""" or OFP. It is preferred that the fluids and fluid blends also provide at least one other desirable performance property such as high flash point, low particulate formation, suitable evaporation rates, suitable solvency, low toxicity, high thermal stability, and chemical inertness with respect to non-ozone producing reactions, particularly with respect to acids which may be present in coating formulations. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the fluids are used in a blend with known industrial solvents or other fluids which present an environmental problem with respect to MIR or lack one or more of the aforementioned desirable performance properties, so that the new fluid blends will have lower MIR than they would without the substituted low ozone formation reactivity fluid or have at least one of the aforementioned other desirable performance properties. The present invention is also directed to a method of reducing ozone formation from atmospheric photochemical reactions in an application wherein a fluid eventually evaporates, at least partially, into the atmosphere, comprising replacing at least a portion of a fluid having a relatively higher MIR with a fluid having a relatively lower MIR. In the case where a blend results, it is preferred that the weighted average MIR of the blend be similar to or less than the MIR of a Low Polluting Potential Fluid, and most preferably similar to the MIR of a Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid. A fluid or fluid blend according to the present invention may be used in any process, e.g., any process using a fluid as a carrier, diluent, dispersant, solvent, and the like, on any scale, e.g., pilot plant scale, or industrial scale. It is preferred that the process be a stationary industrial process and it is preferred that the process is a non-combustion process. The present invention offers its greatest benefit from the standpoint of safety and health in large-scale industrial or commercial processes, particularly industrial coating processes or in formulations used in large quantities overall, albeit on a small scale for each individual use, e.g., by a consumer, such as in household paints, cosmetics, and the like. The ordinary artisan can readily differentiate between what is an industrial scale, pilot plant scale, and laboratory scale processes. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to identify liquid organic compounds not heretofore identified as low reactivity solvent fluids and have not been used on a large scale commercial basis to reduce ozone formation. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of selecting fluids and/or fluid blends for applications which release fluids into the air and wherein there is a need to reduce ozone formation due to low atmospheric or ground-based (tropospheric) photochemical reactivity, in order to replace conventional solvents and/or solvent blends currently used in various compositions or processes. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of optimizing compositions comprising an evaporative fluid by selecting a fluid and/or fluid blend providing a reduced MIR as well as at least one additional performance attribute selected from high flash point, low particulate formation, suitable evaporation rates, suitable solvency, low toxicity, high thermal and chemical stability. Still another object of the present invention includes the selection of fluids and/or fluid blends providing low reactivity in ozone formation having compatibility with a wide range of organic compounds of different polarity and molecular weights to make the fluids and/or fluid blends suitable for a wide range of compositions. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of reducing ozone formation caused by the release into the troposphere of a fluid or fluid blend in a process utilizing the fluid or fluid blend, comprising replacing at least a portion of the fluid with another fluid having a lower MIR. A further object is to provide a method of reducing ground-based ozone formation due to fluid evaporation without resorting to expensive control equipment to capture all fluid emission into the environment. Another object is to provide solvents that reduce ground base ozone formation without the use of halogenated solvents and their associated toxicity, incineration, and waste disposal issues. These and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent as reference is made below to a detailed description, preferred embodiments, and specific examples of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The fluids used in accordance with this invention have been selected for their low or reduced ozone formation potential (as reflected in their low or reduced MIR). The ozone formation potential of a composition or fluid solvent may be determined by any scientifically recognized or peer reviewed method including but not limited to, the MIR scale, the KOH scale, smog chamber studies, and modeling studies such as those performed by Dr. William P. L. Carter. Most references in the description of the present invention will be to the Absolute MIR scale measured in grams ozone produced/gram of fluid solvent. By """"low MIR"""" is meant that the fluids have an MIR similar to or less than 1.5 gram of ozone per gram of the solvent fluid. By """"reduced MIR"""" is meant that, in a process according to the present invention, a first fluid is replaced, in whole or in part, by a second fluid, the second fluid having an MIR lower than the first fluid. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine ozone reactivity of a material according to methods in numerous literature sources and tabulated data published in the open literature. It is mentioned that the terms """"replace"""", """"replacement"""", """"replacing"""" and the like used herein are not to be taken as implying only the act of substituting a second fluid (having acceptable MIR as described herein) in a formulation for a first fluid that may have been previously used in that and similar formulation(s), with such first fluid has undesirable MIR as described herein. Rather, the terms are intended to include the formulations themselves comprising a mixture of the first and second fluids, or one or more such second fluid(s) without any of said first fluid(s), as the fluid system of the formulation. In the case where no such first fluid(s) are present, the concept of """"replacement"""" is intended to refer to corresponding formulations that have only such first fluid(s) present instead of such second fluid(s) and therefore have a lower OFP. The MIR is preferably determined by smog chamber studies, modeling studies, or a combination thereof, but is more preferably determined by """"incremental reactivity"""", and still more preferably by the Absolute MIR, as discussed above. The MIR of a fluid used in this invention is preferably less than or equal to 1.5 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid, more preferably less than or equal to 1.0 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid, and most preferably less than or equal to 0.5 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid, but the benefits of the present invention are realized if ozone formation is reduced by replacing a first fluid with a second fluid, in whole or in part, wherein the MIR of the second fluid is reduced from that of the first fluid, even if the second fluid has an MIR greater than 1.5 gram of ozone per gram of solvent fluid. Therefore, it is preferred that the fluid according to the present invention have an MIR less than or equal to 1.50 and more preferably less than or equal to 1.00, still more preferably less than or equal to 0.50. In an even more preferred embodiment, the reactivity in ozone formation is preferably equal to or less than that of acetone and even more preferably equal to or less than that of ethane, by whatever scale or method is used, but most preferably by the MIR scale. Thus, in a more preferred embodiment, the fluid used in a composition according to the present invention will have an MIR less than or equal to 0.50, even more preferably less than or equal to 0.35. Specifically preferred fluids according to the present invention include: dialkyl carbonates, such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl ethyl carbonate, methyl isopropyl carbonate, methyl sec-butyl carbonate, methyl t-butyl carbonate, methyl neopentyl carbonate, and diisopropyl carbonate; alkyl acetates, such as neopentyl acetate, ethylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-butylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-butylene glycol diacetate, 2,3-butylene glycol diacetate, neopentyl glycol diacetate; dioxolanes such as 2,2-dimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4-trimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4,5-tetra methyl dioxolane; pivalates such as methyl pivalate (methyl 1,1,1-trimethyl acetate), ethyl pivalate, isopropyl pivalate, t-butyl pivalate (TBP), neopentyl pivalate (NPP), 1,2-propylene glycol bis-pivalate (PGBP), ethylene glycol bis-pivalate, ethylene glycol monopivalate, 1,2-butylene glycol mono-pivalate (1,2-BGMP), 2,3-butylene glycol monopivalate (2,3-BGMP), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 2,3-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (2,3-BGPA), ethylene glycol pivalate acetate, 1,2 propylene glycol monopivalate, neopentyl glycol mono pivalate, and 1,2-propylene glycol pivalate acetate; isobutyrate compounds such as isopropyl isobutyrate, neopentyl isobutyrate, and neopentyl glycol mono isobutyrate; and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanonitrile (TMPN); isopropyl neononanoate; pivalonitrile; methyl 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanoate (methyl neononanoate) and methyl 3,5,5 trimethyl hexanoate. Other preferred fluids are oxygenated (oxygen containing) organic compounds substantially free of moieties containing unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds or aromatic groups. In the case of a blend, the weighted average MIR of the fluids in a composition according to the present invention will also have the perferred, more preferred, and most preferred MIR levels as discussed above. In another preferred embodiment, wherein the blend results from replacing part of a first fluid with a second fluid and thereby reducing the weight average MIR, it is preferred that the weight average MIR be reduced 10%, more preferably 25%, still more preferably 50%, from the MIR calculated prior to the fluid replacement. In yet another preferred embodiment, the Low Polluting Potential Fluids (LPPF), Very Low Polluting Potential Fluids (VLPPF), and Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluids (NPPF), as described herein will provide at least one other desirable performance property such as high flash point low particulate formation, suitable evaporation rates, suitable solvency, low toxicity, high thermal stability, and chemical inertness. Of course, it is more preferable that the fluid or blends have two or more of these performance attributes, and so on, so that the most preferred fluid or fluid blend has all of these performance attributes. In the case of a process of reducing ozone formation, wherein a fluid according to the present invention replaces a fluid, at least in part, having a higher MIR, described in more detail below, it is preferred that this fluid replacement process, in addition to reducing ozone formation does not negatively impact any other desirable performance attributes of the composition as described above. The flash point of a fluid according to the present invention is preferably at least -6.1deg C. or higher, more preferably greater than +6.0deg C., even more preferably greater than 15deg C., still more preferably greater than 25deg C., yet even more preferably greater than 37.8deg C., and most preferably greater than 60deg C. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine the flash point of a fluid or blend (e.g., ASTM D92-78). In the case of a blend, the flash point of the blend may be the flash point of the more volatile component, in the instance where the flash points of the individual components differ markedly or where the more volatile component is the predominant component. The flash point of the blend may be in between the flash points of the individual components. As used herein, the term """"flash point"""" will refer to the flash point experimentally determined for a single fluid or a blend, as applicable. The fluid or blend thereof, according to the present invention, should preferably not contribute measurably to particulate formation of particulates having a size diameter below 2.5 &mgr;m--referred to as 2.5PM herein--in the atmosphere. In a preferred embodiment of a process of reducing ozone formation, the fluid selected to replace a previously-used solvent will be one that also reduces particulate matter to less than or equal to 65 &mgr;g/m3, and more preferably less than or equal to 50 &mgr;g/m3, when measured over a 24-hour period, preferably spatially averaged over all monitors in a given geographic area. The evaporation rate should be suitable for the intended purpose. In many if not most applications, the fluid according to the present invention will be used to replace, at least in part, a fluid which is environmentally disadvantaged, meaning it has a reactivity in ozone formation greater than 1.5 in Absolute MIR units. The fluid selected preferably will have a similar evaporation rate to the disadvantaged fluid being replaced, particularly in the case where a fluid blend is used and an acceptable evaporation profile is desired. It is convenient for the fluid selected to have an evaporation rate less than 12 times the evaporation rate of n-butyl acetate. Evaporation rates may also be given relative to n-butyl acetate at 1.0 (ASTM D3539-87). Ranges of evaporation rates important for different applications are 5-3, 3-2, 2-1, 1.0-0.3, 0.3-0.1, and 25% of the fluid is evaporated, more preferably when >50% of the fluid is evaporated, more preferably when >80% of the fluid is evaporated, more preferably when >95% of the fluid is evaporated, and most preferably when >99% of the fluid is evaporated. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention wherein, in a method of reducing ozone formation, a fluid according to the present invention replaces, at least in part, another fluid not according to the present invention, the fluid replaced has an evaporative rate ranging from that of MEK (methyl ethyl ketone) to less than that of n-butyl acetate. The fluid or fluid blend according to the present invention may act in the traditional manner of a solvent by dissolving completely the intended solute or it may act to disperse the solute, or it may act otherwise as a fluid defined above. It is important that the solvency of the fluid be adequate for the intended purpose. In addition to the required solvency, the formulated product must be of a viscosity to enable facile application. Thus, the fluid or fluid blend must have the appropriate viscosities along with other performance attributes. One of ordinary skill in the art, in possession of the present disclosure, can determine appropriate solvent properties, including viscosity. Toxicity relates to the adverse effect that chemicals have on living organisms. One way to measure the toxic effects of a chemical is to measure the dose-effect relationship; the dose is usually measured in mg of chemical per kg of body mass. This is typically done experimentally by administering the chemical to mice or rats at several doses in the lethal range and plotting the logarithm of the dose versus the percentage of the population killed by the chemical. The dose lethal to 50% of the test population is called the median lethal dose (LD50) and is typically used as a guide for the toxicity of a chemical. See, for instance, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth Edition, Vol. 24, pp. 456-490. Currently an LD50 of >500 mg/kg qualifies as """"not classified"""" for oral toxicity under OSHA rules. EU (European Union) uses a cutoff of >2,000 mg/kg. It is preferred that the fluid or fluid blend according to the present invention have an oral rat LD50 of >500 mg/kg, more preferably >1000 mg/kg, still more preferably >2,000 mg/kg, even more preferably >3,000 mg/kg, and most preferably >5,000 mg/kg. Likewise, the fluid or blend should also cause no toxicity problems by dermal or inhalation routes and should also not be an eye or skin irritant, as measured by OSHA or European Union (EU) standards. As described above, the present invention is related to fluid solvents and fluid solvent blends which produce reduced ozone formation due to atmospheric photochemical reactions and which avoid the deficiencies associated with halogenated organic compounds, particularly toxicity, ozone depletion, incineration by-products and waste disposal problems. In this aspect, the volatile components of the preferred fluid solvents and fluid solvent blends preferably do not have more than 2.0 wt. % of halogen and more preferably less than 0.5 wt. %, and most preferably less than 0.1 wt. %. The fluid according to the present invention should be thermally stable so that it does not break down. For instance, the material should not break down into reactive species. In a preferred embodiment, the fluid is more thermally stable than t-butyl acetate. Inertness, as used herein, refers to the lack of a tendency to undergo decomposition with other materials in the fluid system. It may include, for example, inertness towards acids or bases, but particularly to acid catalysts, which are typically present in coating compositions. It is preferred that the fluid being replaced have an MIR greater than that of acetone. In another embodiment, the incremental reactivity, based on the MIR scale, of the fluid being replaced is preferably >0.50, still more preferably >0.1.00, and most preferably >1.50. In another embodiment, it is critical that in a process of reducing tropospheric ozone formation according to the present invention, the fluid replaced have a greater MIR than the fluid added, that is, the fluid according to the present invention. Of course it is to be recognized that only a portion of the higher MIR fluid need be replaced, thus obtaining a blend, in order to achieve the ozone formation reduction. However, in another embodiment of the present invention, the fluid being replaced may have an acceptable MIR, but be unacceptable with respect to one or more of the aforementioned performance attributes of flash point or flammability, particulate formation, evaporation rate, solvency, toxicity, thermal stability, or inertness. Examples of a given blend of DMC and MEK will be provided wherein the appropriate addition of DMC (or """"replacement"""" of acetone) provided for an improvement in at least one of these attributes. Examples of fluids which are replaced by fluids according to the present invention include aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon fluids such as: branched C6-C9 alkanes, straight chain alkanes, cycloaliphatic C6-C10 hydrocarbons, natural hydrocarbons (alpha or beta pinenes, or turpentines, etc.), ethanol, propanol and higher nontertiary alcohols, C3 and higher ethers, ether alcohols, ether alcohol acetates, ethyl ethoxy propionate, C5 and higher ketones, cyclic ketones, etc., C7+aromatic hydrocarbons; halocarbons, particularly chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons; and ethers such as cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF),. Examples of other common industrial solvents which may be replaced by fluids according to the present invention are those listed in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth Edition, Vol. 22, p. 536-548. Some particularly preferred replacements, i.e., a fluid according to the present invention for a currently used industrial solvent, include: in any application, but particularly coatings applications, DMC or methyl pivalate for toluene, xylene, or t-butyl acetate; methyl isopropyl carbonate (MIPC) for xylene or methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK); and diisopropyl carbonate (DIPC) for methyl amyl ketone (MAK), propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMAc), or ethyl ethoxy propionate (EEP); in any application, but particularly consumer product applications DMC, MIPC, or DIPC for hydrocarbons; in any application but particularly agricultural applications, DIPC for aromatic fluids; in any application but particularly cleaning applications, DIPC or methyl sec-butyl carbonate (MSBC) for chlorinated solvents; in any application, but particularly inks, substitute DMC or methyl pivalate for MEK and light acetates. The fluids and blends according to the present invention may be used in any process using a fluid, and particularly those process wherein at least a portion of the fluid evaporates and even more particularly wherein at least a portion evaporates into the atmosphere. Preferred processes are those utilizing the fluid as one or more of a carrier, diluent, dispersant, solvent, and the like, include processes wherein the fluid functions as an inert reaction medium in which other compounds react; as a heat-transfer fluid removing heat of reaction; to improve workability of a manufacturing process; as a viscosity reducer to thin coatings to application viscosity; as an extraction fluid to separate one material from another by selective dissolution; as a tackifier or to improve adhesion to a substrate for better bonding; as a dissolving medium to prepare solutions of polymers, resins, and other substances; to suspend or disperse pigments and other particulates; and the like. It is preferred that the process be a stationary process and also preferred that the process be a non-combustion process. It is particularly beneficial if the fluid according to the present invention be used to replace at least a portion of a traditional industrial solvent in a process using a large amount of fluid, e.g., a process using 1000 lb/year (500 kg/year), even more preferably 5 tons/year (5000 kg/yr), still more preferably 50 tons/year (50,000 kg/yr), and most preferably one million lbs/year (500,000 kg/yr). In a preferred embodiment, the process wherein the aforementioned fluid replacement occurs is on the scale of at least pilot plant-scale or greater. It is also preferred that the process in which a fluid or blend according to the present invention is used or in which at least one fluid according to the present invention replaces, at least partially, a fluid having a higher MIR, be a process in which the fluid is intended to evaporate, such as in a coating process. In such a process were the fluid is intended to evaporate, it is preferred that at least 10% of the fluid or fluids evaporate, more preferably 20% of the fluids, and so on, so that it is most preferable if >99% of the fluid or fluids present in the coating evaporate. Furthermore, one of the greatest environmental benefits of replacing a currently-used industrial solvent with a solvent according to the present invention will be realized if performed in a geographic area where monitoring for ozone and particulate matter formation occurs, and more particularly in geographic areas defined by a city and its contiguous area populated by at least 500,000 persons, and wherein the replacement of at least a portion of the currently-used industrial solvent with a fluid according to the present invention causes at least one of: (i) a reduction in the ozone formation, as measured by either monitoring devices or by a calculation of the reduction using the MIR of the industrial solvent replaced and the fluid added according to the present formation; or (ii) a reduction in particulate formation of particles having a diameter less than 2.5 &mgr;m (2.5 PM), preferably measured as a 24 hour standard, more preferably wherein that reduction is from greater than 65 &mgr;g/m3 to less than that amount in a 24 hour period, still more preferably from greater than 65 &mgr;g/m3 to less than or equal to 50 &mgr;g/m3 in a 24 hour period; and more preferably both (i) and (ii). In another embodiment, there is a method of selecting a fluid for use in a process wherein at least a portion of the fluid eventually evaporates into the atmosphere, comprising selecting as the fluid a blend of: (a) at least one fluid A having a low MIR, preferably similar to or less than or equal to 1.50, more preferably less than or equal to 1.00, yet still more preferably wherein the MIR is less than or equal to 0.50 and still even more preferably less than or equal to 0.35; and (b) at least one fluid B characterized by having at least one unsuitable attribute selected from: (i) high MIR, preferably measured by the MIR scale, e.g., having an MIR>0.50, more preferably >1.00, and yet even more preferably >1.50; (ii) low flash point, preferably less than or equal to 37.8deg C., more preferably less than or equal to 25deg C., even more preferably less than or equal to 15deg C., yet even more preferably less than or equal to 6.0deg C., and most preferably less than -6.1deg C.; (iii) formation of 2.5 PM particulates (e.g., wherein said process, using fluid B, produces 2.5 PM greater than 65 micrograms per cubic meter or greater, as measured in a 24-hour period); (iv) toxicity, preferably those having an oral rat LD50 less than or equal to 1,000 mg/kg, and most preferably less than or equal to 500 mg/kg; (vi) thermal stability, preferably having a thermal stability equal to or less than (more unstable) than t-butyl acetate; and (vii) inertness in the fluid or fluid blend, particularly with respect to any acids or bases present in the fluid or blend. Preferred examples of fluid A include: dialkyl carbonates, such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl ethyl carbonate, methyl isopropyl carbonate, methyl sec-butyl carbonate, methyl t-butyl carbonate, methyl neopentyl carbonate, and diisopropyl carbonate; alkyl acetates, such as neopentyl acetate, ethylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-propylene glycol diacetate, 1,2-butylene glycol diacetate, 1,3-butylene glycol diacetate, 2,3-butylene glycol diacetate, neopentyl glycol diacetate; dioxolanes such as 2,2-dimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4-trimethyl dioxolane, 2,2,4,5-tetra methyl dioxolane; pivalates (trimethyl acetates) such as methyl pivalate (MP), isopropyl pivalate, t-butyl pivalate (TBP), neopentyl pivalate (NPP), 1,2-propylene glycol bis-pivalate (PGBP), ethylene glycol bis-pivalate, ethylene glycol monopivalate, 1,2-butylene glycol mono-pivalate (1,2-BGMP), 2,3-butylene glycol monopivalate (2,3-BGMP), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 1,2-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (1,2-BGPA), 2,3-butylene glycol pivalate acetate (2,3-BGPA), ethylene glycol pivalate acetate, 1,2 propylene glycol monopivalate, neopentyl glycol mono pivalate, and 1,2-propylene glycol pivalate acetate; isobutyrate compounds such as isopropyl isobutyrate, neopentyl isobutyrate, and neopentyl glycol mono isobutyrate; and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanonitrile (TMPN); isopropyl neononanoate; pivalonitrile; methyl 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentanoate (methyl neononanoate); and methyl 3,5,5 trimethyl hexanoate. Preferred examples of fluid B include aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon fluids such as toluene and xylenes; alcohols such as ethanol, n-butyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, and sec-butanol; esters such as ethyl ethoxy propionate propylene glycol methyl ether acetate; ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), C5-C10 linear ketones, cyclic ketones; halocarbons, particularly chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons; cyclic ethers such as THF, and non-cyclic ethers such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The present invention also concerns mixtures or blends of at least one fluid according to the present invention and fluids which are known to have acceptable low OFP, e.g., acetone (MIR=0.48), methyl acetate (MIR=0.12), tert-butyl acetate (MIR=0.21), tertiary butanol (MIR=0.40), dimethyl succinate (MIR=0.20), dimethyl glutarate (MIR=0.40), and propylene carbonate (MIR=0.43). Such blends can have some important advantages, for example, blends of DMC and MEK, or DMC and methyl acetate, as previously mentioned. These blends are also considered to be part of the present invention. In combination with fluids having an MIR higher than 0.50, the fluids still can provide significant reduction in ozone formation for blended fluid compositions with other important properties for the particular application. Therefore, fluid compositions with low or reduced OFP comprising solvents selected from the list above are important goals of the present invention, even if their weighted OFP is above 0.50 in the MIR scale. The fluids listed above are recommended to be used in solvent compositions intended for release into air and are required to provide low reactivity in ozone formation. The solvents selected according to the present invention can be used in blends with each other as well as in blends with other solvents (e.g., solvents B, above), different from the solvents of the present invention. When all solvents included in the blend have MIR reactivity~0.50 or less, the solvent blends also will have low atmospheric photochemical reactivity with MIR of about 0.50 and less. The present inventors have found that many solvent blends can have an MIR in the range of ethane or acetone, even though one component may exceed that range, and therefore in terms of reactivity toward ozone formation behave as exempt solvents. The range of reactivities in exempt solvents allows a selection of fluids with extremely low reactivity, with MIR number in range of &lE;0.35 and more suitably &lE;0.24. These fluids can be blended not only with fluids with reactivity based on MIR of ~0.50 or less but, with appropriately selected fluids with MIR numbers >0.50 and at certain ratios still form fluid compositions with weighted reactivity about 0.50 or less. These blends can significantly expand the range of properties of solvent compositions and provide formulators with necessary flexibility for different applications. The selection of fluids with MIRs >0.50 can be relatively wide, however, to achieve significant reduction in weighted reactivity to ~0.50 or less, it is recommended to choose solvent with MIR <1.5, suitably <1.2, and more suitably <1.0. The conception of blends demonstrating MIR of about 0.50 or less can be applied to other solvents with known extremely low reactivities. For example, methyl acetate has an MIR 0.12 but flash point ~-12deg C. Thus, methyl acetate can be blended with butyl acetate (MIR=1.00 and flash point 27deg C.) in weight ratio of 57:43 forming a blend with MIR=0.50, providing reactivity similar to exempt solvents. This blend would have a better flash point and lower evaporation rate, making it useful for many applications which methyl acetate could not satisfy due to very low flash point. Butyl acetate which is not an exempt solvent, would become part of a mixture which by its weighted reactivity would behave similar to exempt solvent and, therefore, constitute preferred solvent composition. This special case of blends comprising at least one solvent with MIR reactivity 0.50 which have their weighted reactivity about 0.50 or less is one very important part of the present invention. Among known solvents with extremely low MIR, suitable components for the preferred blended solvents are methyl acetate (MIR=0.12), t-butyl acetate (MIR=0.21), dimethyl succinate (MIR=0.20) and methyl siloxanes including cyclomethylsiloxanes. Blends of these solvents with other solvents with MIR >0.50 resulting in weighted MIR of about 0.50 or less for the blend are preferred solvents according to the present invention. However, some of the most interesting blends are the blends of at least one solvent with MIR reactivity 0.50, which can be generated with the solvents from the list of the present invention. The present invention offers fluids and fluid blends for use in a variety of industrial applications such as paints and other coatings, adhesives, sealants, agricultural chemicals, cleaning solution, consumer products such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, drilling muds, extraction, reaction diluents, inks, metalworking fluids, etc. Among the most preferred fluids according to the present invention are dimethyl carbonate and methyl pivalate. Table 1 demonstrates the extremely low relative reactivities--significantly lower than both acetone and ethane--of dimethyl carbonate and methyl pivalate. This data shows that these two compounds satisfy the EPA requirements for exempt solvents in accordance with current VOC regulations and demonstrating extremely low reactivity for the possible future reactivity based rules. Additionally, DMC is shown to be one of the lowest reactivity compounds among all currently known oxygenated compounds. TABLE 1 Summary of calculated incremental reactivites (gram basis) for ethane, acetone, dimethyl carbonate, and methyl pivalate, relative to the average of all VOC emissions.

As seen from Table 2, Absolute Ozone Formation for different levels of NOx in ROG is highest for highest level of NOx scenario (MIR) and lowest for lowest level of NOx scenario (EBIR). As a result, Absolute Reactivity in atmospheric photochemical ozone formation for tested compounds is highest for MIR scenario and lowest for EBIR scenario. This data demonstrates the outstanding value as Low Polluting Potential Fluids (LPPF), Very Low Polluting Potential Fluid (VLPPF), and Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluid (NPPF). Additionally Table 2b shows both compounds as having acceptable flash points, boiling temperatures, evaporation rates, low toxicity, good solvency and overall outstanding performance as versatile environmentally preferred exempt, extremely low ozone formation fluids (solvents) for a very wide range of applications.

DMC blended with another organic solvent would also exhibit other desirable environmental properties because DMC has a relatively high flash point and low toxicity. Again, heretofore unrecognized as a low OFP fluid, the Relative MIR of DMC is calculated to be 0.02, using the SAPRC97 model. The compounds presented in Tables 3-5 show calculated Absolute MIR reactivities for compounds useful as Low Polluting Potential Fluids (LPPF), Very Low Polluting Potential Fluids (VLPPF), and Negligibly Polluting Potential Fluids (NPPF) or as part of a fluid solvent blend. These fluids provide favorable MIR reactivities, a very wide range of evaporation rates, and a wide range of solvency and compatability with other solvents, polymers, pigments, catalysts, additives, etc., necessary for actual applications. All the compounds listed in the present invention, especially in Tables 2a-5, are very useful as substitute conventional solvents having an Absolute MIR between 1.5 and 3.0 and especially in solvents having high reactivity Absolute MIR greater than 3.0 in atmospheric photochemical ozone formation.

The most preferred use of the fluids according to the present invention is with any process wherein the reduction of ozone formation is desired, and more particularly in consumer products, and coatings such as auto refinishing, architectural and industrial coatings and paints. Paints and coatings comprise the largest single category of traditional solvent consumption, accounting for nearly half the solvents used. Fluids serve multiple functions in paints and coatings, including solubility, wetting, viscosity reduction, adhesion promotion, and gloss enhancement. Fluids dissolve the resins, dyes and pigments used in the coating formulations. Also, prior to application, it is common practice to add solvent thinner to attain the desired viscosity for the particular application. Solvents begin to evaporate as soon as the coating materials are applied. As the solvent evaporates, film formation occurs and a continuous, compact film develops. Single solvents are sometimes used in coatings formulations, but most formulations are blends of several solvents. In many coatings applications, the solvent system includes a slow-evaporating active solvent that remains in the film for an extended period to enhance the film's gloss and smoothness. Because of evaporation and the large amounts of solvents used in coatings, there is a significant amount of VOC emissions into the atmosphere. Resins which may be incorporated into compositions comprising fluids according to the present invention include acrylic, alkyd, polyester, epoxy, silicone, cellulosic and derivatives thereof (e.g., nitrocellulosic and cellulosic esters), PVC, and isocyanate-based resins. Numerous pigments may also be incorporated into compositions according to the present invention, and it is within the skill of the ordinary artisan to determine proper selection of the resin and pigment, depending on the end use of the coating. One of the cleaning applications is cold solvent cleaning which is used to degrease metal parts and other objects in many operations. Mineral spirits have been popular in cold cleaning, but are being supplanted by higher flash point hydrocarbon solvents due to emissions and flammability concerns. Efforts to eliminate organic solvents entirely from cleaning compositions have not been successful because aqueous cleaners do not have the performance properties that make organic solvent based cleaners so desirable. This invention allows formulators the option to seek the use of solvents with very low reactivity as environmentally preferred products meeting environmental concerns and customer performance concerns. A cleaning solution application which uses evaporation to clean is called vapor degreasing. In vapor degreasing, the solvents vaporize and the cold part is suspended in the vapor stream. The solvent condenses on the part, and the liquid dissolves and flushes dirt, grease, and other contaminants off the surface. The part remains in the vapor until it is heated to the vapor temperature. Drying is almost immediate when the part is removed and solvent residues are not a problem. The most common solvent used in vapor degreasing operations has been 1,1,1-trichloroethane. However, since 1,1,1-trichloroethane is being phased out due to ozone depletion in the stratosphere, alternatives are needed. Moreover, chlorine-based solvents have toxicity concerns. Thus, some of the low reactivity, high flash point solvents in this invention can be used in place of 1,1,1-trichloroethane and other halogenated solvents. An application that is similar to coatings is printing inks. In printing inks, the resin is dissolved in the solvent to produce the ink. Most printing operations use fast evaporating solvents for best production speeds, but the currently used solvents are highly reactive. Some of the previously described fast evaporation, high flash point, low reactivity in ozone formation fluids according to the present invention are suitable for printing inks. An application that is suitable to the low toxicity, high flash point and low reactivity in ozone formation fluids according to the present invention is agricultural products. Pesticides are frequently applied as emulsifiable concentrates. The active insecticide or herbicide is dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent which also contains an emulsifier. Hydrocarbon solvent selection is critical for this application. It can seriously impact the efficiency of the formulation. The solvent should have adequate solvency for the pesticide, promote good dispersion when diluted with water, have low toxicity and a flash point high enough to minimize flammability hazards. Extraction processes, used for separating one substance from another, are commonly employed in the pharmaceutical and food processing industries. Oilseed extraction is a widely used extraction process. Extraction-grade hexane is a common solvent used to extract oil from soybeans, cottonseed, corn, peanuts, and other oil seeds to produce edible oils and meal used for animal feed supplements. Low toxicity, high flash point, low MIR fluids and fluid blends of the present invention can be useful in such industries. In addition to the above-mentioned applications, other applications that can use high flash point, low toxicity, low reactivity in ozone formation fluids are adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, drilling muds, reaction diluents, metal working fluids, and consumer products, such as pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. The invention is further described in the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting. One of skill in the art will recognize that numerous variations are possible within the scope of the appendaged claims. Examples of Fluid Blends Having Negligible Reactivity Tables A and B below demonstrate fluid solvent blends may be created using (a) negligibly low reactivity fluid solvents and (b) low to very low reactivity fluid solvent in ratios which provide Weight Average MIR reactivity for the total solvent blend of <0.45 and therefore providing ozone formation similar to individual fluid solvents with negligibly low reactivity in atmospheric ozone formation. However, the blends shown in Tables A and B possess characteristics such as better evaporation profiles, flash points, as compared to the individual fluids. Table A demonstrates negligibly reactive blends based on a known negligibly reactive solvent--methyl acetate and other very low reactivity fluids previously known and from the present invention. In Table A the column with methyl acetate shows the minimum methyl acetate content that will provide negligible reactivity to the blend. As shown, all blends with increased methyl acetate content will result in reduced reactivity in ozone formation. However, a main interest in blends with reduced methyl acetate content that maintain negligible reactivity is in an increased flash point of the blend. As seen from Table A, especially advantageous are the two blends with the very low reactivity fluid solvents from the present invention, diisopropyl carbonate and ethyl pivalate which require the lowest levels of methyl acetate. This concept of blending the negligible reactivity compounds with low and very low reactivity secondary fluids that can provide Weight Average MIR less than 0.5 is also subject of this invention. Although it is not necessary that every component of the blend be selected from the list of compounds of the present invention, it should be noted that components selected from the list of the present invention provide especially desireable attributes to a finished solvent blend with reduced or negligible reactivity in atmospheric photochemical ozone formation. Advantages of the blends created with at least one compound of the present invention is further demonstrated in Table B which utilizes blends"
5566500,Surfaces coated with fluorocarbon resins upon which insects cannot climb or alight and methods and means for their establishment,1994-11-08,0,1,"2. Field of the Invention This invention relates coated surfaces upon which insects can neither climb nor alight and methods and means for applying the coatings. More particularly, the invention relates to surfaces coated with non-toxic, non-debilitating fluorocarbon resin films which are effective to discourage crawling insects from infesting a site where they are not wanted, to cause crawling insects to abandon a site they have infested, to confine crawling insects within a given enclosure and to prevent insects from alighting, climbing or building nests or webs on selected surfaces. 3. Discussion of the Prior Art The crawling insects with which this invention is concerned are those which are pests or nuisances to man. These include, for example, gypsy moths that crawl from the ground up into trees and devour the leaves of the trees; cockroaches, spiders, scales and palm aphids which are often offensive in appearance and may carry and spread disease; and, perhaps the most widespread and annoying of the general group, the ubiquitous ant. The ant exists in many forms including the leaf eater, Argentine, carpenter and pharaoh ants, the termites and, of course, the militant and destructive fire ant. It is the primary concern of this invention to restrict the movement and colonization of these insects. Many pesticides and insecticides are available which will kill or disrupt the life cycle of crawling insects, but essentially all of them are environmentally objectionable because of their toxicity. The toxicity of pesticides can endanger the health of animals and humans and curtail their use when food is present as in dinning rooms, kitchens, picnic tables, pet food dishes and the like. It is also well recognized that insects develop strains which are resistent to the effect of a given insecticide over a period of time. As an alternative to insecticides, it has been proposed to control insects with traps. One common type of trap is built with downwardly and inwardly sloping side walls that are covered with a loosely adhering powdered material, such as talcum powder. The loosely adhering particles are dislodged when an insect attempts to crawl over them and the insect falls with the powder into a trap. This technique is relied on in U.S. Pat. No 4,263,740 which teaches the application of particulate organic and inorganic materials to a vertical or sloping surface. The particulate materials are applied by coating a surface with a liquid dispersion of polytetrafluoroethylene, sand, clay, ground pyrophyllite-aluminum silicate, cellulosics, talc, sand, and flour. When the liquid content of the dispersion is evaporated, a dry, loosely adherent layer of powder remains on the surface. The size of the particles is not critical since patentee teaches that the particulate material of the dispersions may vary from less than 1 micron to more that 1000 microns in diameter, although his preferred range is from 100 to 300 microns. In use, patentee relates, when an insect first crawls over a coated surface at the entrance to a trap, its sticky pads (pulvilli) are coated with the loosely adhered powders and the ability of the pulvilli to adhere to a smooth surface is rendered ineffective. If and when the insect reverses its direction in an attempt to crawl up a smooth slanting sidewall and escape from the trap, its pulvilli are no longer """"sticky"""" and the insect must grip the particulate material with its tarsal claws to gain a purchase. At this point, the weight of the insect grasping the particulate matter dislodges the powder and causes an """"avalanche"""" of the loosely held particles carrying the insect down with them into the trap. The powdery coatings taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,740 have a limited useful life. They are consumed in use when one or more """"avalanche"""" occurs and they will break loose and flake away if the coated surface is impacted as by bumping or shaking or is exposed to the elements such as wind and rain. A less obvious defect in the powdery coatings is that loose powder can suffocate the insects and destroy their value to a hobbyist or an entomologist. Entomologists have discovered that they can nondestructively confine crawling insects in tub shaped containers by painting circumferential, horizontal bands of a water dispersion of finely divided polytetrafluoroethylene, generally about 0.05 to 0.5 microns in diameter, on the inside walls of the container. Perhaps because of their extremely small size, the particles making up the dried coating, unlike the coatings of U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,740, adhere sufficiently well to the side walls of the container to prevent them from being pulled loose when traversed by an insect. It was discovered that the insects could not climb these dried films of sub micron resin polytetrafluoroethylene particles. Since the insects appear to slide down the coated surfaces when they try to climb them, it seemed reasonable to assume, even though it has now been proven false, that the phenomenum was due to the slippery surface characteristics (low coefficient of friction) of polytetrafluoroethylene. The dispersions that the entomologists have used are commercial formulations that typically contain about 60%, by total weight, of 0.05 to 0.5 micron sized polytetrafluoroethylene particles suspended in water along with from about 5% to 8%, by weight of polytetrafluoroethylene, of a wetting agent and stabilizer. At room temperatures (20.degree.-25.degree. C.) the dispersions have viscosities of from about 20 to 27 centipoise. An example of the method used by entomologists, can be found in a trap for flying insects disclosed in European patent application 0 160 712 A1 to Montedison S.p.A. Here flying insects are prevented from crawling out of a trap having a funnel shaped (30.degree.-60.degree. cone angle) entrance by coating the interior surface of the funnel with dispersions of polytetrafluoroethylene. The dispersions are the same as those described above as used by entomologists which are commercially available formulations of aqueous dispersions of polytetrafluoroethylene. They are described in the patent application as being comprised of a granulometric dispersion of between 0.2 and 0.4 microns of 50-61% by weight polytetrafluoroethylene and 2.5-4% by weight of a non-ionic dispersant, the rest being water. It is further taught that the coatings of these dispersions can be applied by spraying or brushing. The European patent application acknowledges that the prior art has made use of sticky substances to entrap insects and powdered substances, such as kaolin or talc, to reduce an insects ability to cling to a surface. The patent application states that the powdered substances of the prior art are not useful over prolonged periods since the powders are easily removed by the mechanical action of wind, rain and humidity. The coatings of the entomologists and those disclosed in the European patent application improved over the prior powdered coatings, but they too have their deficiencies both with respect to the methods by which they are applied and to the characteristics of the applied coatings. Considering the coatings themselves the following is a listing of some of their failings. 1. While the coatings adhere to their substrates somewhat better than do the powdered coatings, the polytetrafluoroethylene coatings are so loosely bound to their substrates that they can be removed by running tap water over the surface, by lightly brushing the surface, by flexing the substrate or by applying and removing ordinary transparent adhesive tape. 2. The coatings are effective only for relatively short periods of time. In discussions with entomologists who use these coatings, it has been uniformly reported that the effective life of the coatings range from as short as several weeks to a maximum of about two, or, at most, three months. The mechanisms of the failures are not understood as often there is no apparent or observable change in the appearance of the coating. 3. The effectiveness of the coating is adversely effected if more than a single layer is applied to a surface. Care is required to avoid overcoating when the dispersion is applied for, otherwise, multiple coating layers will crack or flake off rendering the coating ineffective to prevent insects from crawling on a surface. It follows that it is necessary to remove all of an old coating which has lost its effectiveness before a new coating is applied. The difficulty of thoroughly removing all of an old coating is enough of a chore to make it common practice among entomologists to discard used insect containers after they have lost their effectiveness rather than to clean and recoat the old containers. 4. The effectiveness of the coatings are temperature sensitive. When exposed to ambient temperatures over about 30.degree.-35.degree. C., insects begin climbing over surfaces that they could not climb at lower ambient temperatures. 5. Depending on the dispersing agent used in making up the polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions, most coatings loose their effectiveness when they become damp or wet. This limits the utility of the coatings to protected environments where they can be sheltered from the effects of rain, snow, dew and other surface moisture. 6. The relatively poor adhesion of the coatings makes it impractical to clean the coated surfaces. For example, if a coating is applied to a dog dish, the coating will not survive even one dish washer cycle. The method of application of coatings from polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions as taught by the prior art, also raises a number of problems. 1. The effectiveness of the coating is influenced by the thickness of the coating. It has now been discovered that better coatings are obtained if the thickness of the dried coating is preferably 1 mil or less. This desired thickness has not been obtained in the prior art for a number of reasons including the viscosity of the available polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions, the means by which the coatings are applied as by brushing or dipping, and the dependency of the thickness on the angle the substrate makes to the horizontal as it dries. In this latter regard it may be understood that if a freshly coated surface is allowed to dry while in a vertical position, the dispersion will flow by gravity down the plate, run-off will be maximized and the coating thickness will be minimized. If, on the other hand, the surface is oriented horizontally, the run-off will be minimized and the thickness of the coating maximized. 2. The viscosity of commercially available polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions increases rapidly at higher temperatures. As a result, the coating thickness is a function of the ambient temperatures at the time the coating is applied. 3. Polytetrafluoroethylene resins are soft and subject to fibrillation when exposed to shear forces. The effect is so pronounced that fibrillation occurs when polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions are forced through an orifice as in spraying. For this reason the dispersions are difficult to handle and, for practical reasons, cannot be sprayed unto a substrate. They can not be pumped through feed lines and care must be taken to avoid fibrillation if the dispersions are shaken, stirred or pumped. 4. The high viscosity (about 20 centipoise and over) of the polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions of the prior art make it difficult to form a smooth. coating because of the relatively high viscosity and poor flow-out. 5. The polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions of the prior art are unstable and coagulate during prolonged storage. Temperatures above 25.degree. C. accelerate the coagulation of the dispersions and temperatures below the freezing point of the liquids destroy the dispersion. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to apply surface coatings to substrates which coatings prevent crawling insects from climbing on the surfaces and discourage crawling insects from infesting defined certain areas. Another object of this invention is to protect areas from infestation from crawling insects without using insecticides or toxic substances that are harmful to the environment. Another object of this invention is selectively to control the type or size of crawling insects which enter or leave an area. Another object of this invention is to prevent flying or hopping insects from alighting on or clinging to surfaces such as walls or ceilings. Another object of this invention is to provide a device for trapping insects. Another object of this invention is to create an environment which is not hospitable to crawling insects and will cause them to leave and establish their nests elsewhere. Another object of this invention is to provide wearing apparel such as shoes and boots, ankle protectors, outer garments and the like which will prevent crawling insects from climbing onto the human body. Another object of this invention is to prevent insects from crawling up the legs of furniture. Another object of this invention is to provide methods and means for controlling the movement of crawling insects which methods are simple and effective, remain effective over prolonged periods of time, withstand moderate abuse, and remain effective at elevated temperatures and when wet. Another object of this invention is the provision of methods and means to control the movement of crawling insects that retain their effectiveness for long periods of time even when used in outdoor environments and exposed to all weather conditions. Another object of this invention is to provide coatings of polytetrafluoroethylene which can withstand washing under running tap water or in a dishwasher. Another object of this invention is to provide dispersions of a polytetrafluoroethylene resins having a particle size between about 0.05 and 0.5 microns which have improved storage life, less sensitivity to higher temperatures, mixing and forces of shear and reduced tendencies to fibrillation. These and other objects of this invention are achieved by coating a surface with an aqueous dispersion of polytetrafluoroethylene particles, preferably less than 0.5 microns in size as measured along their major axis, and drying the dispersion to form a coherent film free from bubbles and other visible surface imperfections, characterized in that the viscosity of the dispersion is less than 16 centipoise. Insects cannot climb on the surfaces in accordance with the foregoing if the surfaces are at an angle to the horizontal. The minimum angle required to impede the progress of an insect over a surface coated in accordance with this invention will vary with the characteristics of the insect such as its size, whether it has any sticky substances on its legs, whether its tarsi have claws, and in the case of crawling pests such as caterpillars, how many legs it has. Nonetheless, as a generality, it may reasonably be estimated that surfaces treated in accordance with this invention should be skewed at least about 20 degrees to a horizontal axis to be effective. In the case of flying insects such as flies, gnats, or mosquitoes, and hopping insects, such as fleas, surfaces treated in accordance with this invention will prevent these pests from alighting or resting on steeply slanting surfaces, such as walls or ceilings. It has been observed that the surface characteristics of the film forming materials of this invention may change when the film becomes wet with water when a surface which has been prepared in accordance with this invention is exposed to the outdoor elements like snow, rain or high humidity, it may re-wet and lose its effectiveness in preventing insects from crawling on its surface. It is believed that the tendency of the film to re-wet is largely a function of the surfactant. Used in preparing the dispersion and it has been established that the problem can be overcome either by utilizing a surfactant that does not re-wet, or by removing the surfactant after the film has been formed. In this latter instance, it noted that some surfactants are naturally destroyed by exposure to an outdoor environment and UV light and other surfactants can be leached from a film by washing the film with a solvent which, depending upon the surfactant, may include water, alcohols, acids, bases and the like. However, when surfactants are removed by leaching, it is a sine qua non that the coatings must adhere to the substrate well enough to prevent the coatings from being washed away during the leaching process. In the preferred practice of this invention, aqueous dispersions are stabilized from the harmful effects of freeze/thaw cycles to permit their transportation and storage during colder times of the year. Suitable stabilizers for use in the dispersions of this invention include monohydric alcohols of less than five carbon atoms that form clathrates with water, polyhydric compounds, and the amine analogs of the alcohols and polyhydric compounds. These stabilizers are disclosed PCT patent application filed Apr. 30, 1992 serial number PCT/US92/03630 in the name of Thomas H. Eberlein and PCT patent application filed Apr. 30, 1992 serial number PCT/US92/03647 in the names of Thomas H. Eberlein and Allan H. Olsen both entitled """"Aqueous Dispersions Stabilized from Freeze/Thaw Cycles"""" which are incorporated herein by reference. The solids which are used to form the dispersions of this invention average less than 0.5 microns when measured along their major axis. The small size of the particles is responsible for making a surface difficult for an insect to climb and it is suspected the small particle size contributes to the formation of a more adherent film. Here and elsewhere in the specification and claims, the dried residue that remains after a dispersion of the invention has been applied to a surface is referred to as a """"film"""" since it appears to the naked eye to be continuous and since it is known that it will be effective to control the movement of insects only if it is free from discontinuities and other anomalies that will enable an insect to grip the surface of a film, On the other hand, the """"film"""" has little or no tear strength and, unless applied to an adhesive substance as is discussed below, the dried coating cannot be peeled away from a surface without destroying the """"film"""". For this reason, and since a better term does not suggest itself, it should be understood that the term """"film"""" as used herein may not be entirely consistent with some definitions of the term. The fluorocarbon resins that are of utility in the practice of the present invention are fluorocarbon polymers prepared by dispersion polymerizations and include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP) and perfluoroalkoxy (PFA). The dispersion grades of these resins are commercially available in particle sizes ranging from about 0.05 to about 0.5 microns, at solids concentrations of about 60 wt % dispersing agents, balance water, and in viscosities of from about 20 to about 27 centipoise. Since polytetrafluoroethylene resins are the most widely available, known and used of the fluorocarbon resins, the specification and claims refer specifically to this member of the group although it is to be understood that the term """"polytetrafluoroethylene"""" as used in the specification and appended claims is meant to include other dispersion grade fluorocarbon resins."

The top plate is circular in shape and is made of ALMAG 35, an aluminum and magnesium alloy. This plate has a flat top side and a centerhole extending from the top side through to a bottom side. Its bottom side is characterized by the presence of a slightly elevated circular rim circumscribing its outer perimeter. Moreover, its bottom side is characterized by a cylindrically shaped downwardly directed well therefrom co-extensive with a conically inclined recession downward which is in turn co-extensive with the flooring of the bottom side, the greatest diameter of which downwardly directed well is significantly less than that of the plate. The vertical axis of symmetry of the centerhole, the downwardly directed well and the plate itself is one and the same. Extending from and co-extensive with the outer walls of the recession and the well are each of three solid rectangularly shaped abutments that are likewise co-extensive. with the flooring of the bottom side the recession and the above-mentioned circular rim. Each abutment, the vertical axes of symmetry of each of which are 120.degree. removed from the vertical axes of symmetry of the two adjacent abutments, contains one of the abovementioned top plate through holes into which, one each respectively of the cylindrical pins have been press-fitted. A first rounded concave depression in the wall of the well is found just adjacent the left side of one abutment and a second rounded concave depression in the wall of the well is found just adjacent the right side of an adjacent abutment such that the depressions are 180.degree. removed from one another. At the base of the inner wall of the well there is also flooring of the bottom side within the center of which there is the centerhole. An arrow pointing in a clockwise direction is etched into this portion of the bottom side flooring. Finally, there is also a bottom plate. This bottom plate is made of ALMAG 35 alloy material as well. It is likewise circular in shape with an outer diameter equal to that of the top plate. The bottom side of the bottom plate has a flat external surface that is slightly recessed closer to the center of the bottom plate. Closer still to the center of the bottom plate there is to be found a hollow cylindrical elevation extending from bottom to top within the center of which there is a center hole extending from the floor of the hollow cylindrical elevation through to the top side of the bottom plate and about and co-extensive with the lower portion of which hollow cylindrical elevation there is a conically shaped elevation surfacewise co-extensive with the base surface of the top side. The top side of the bottom plate is characterized by the presence of a slightly elevated circular rim that circumscribes its outer perimeter. On the top outer surface of the cylindrical elevation in the bottom plate there is etched an arrow pointed in a counterclockwise direction. The top outer surface of the previously described conically shaped elevation of the bottom plate which is co-extensive with the outer wall of the bottom plate hollow cylindrical elevation is also co-extensive with each of three solid rectangularly shaped abutments jutting therefrom and reaching to the outer rim of the top side of the bottom plate. The long vertical central axis of symmetry of each abutment is 120.degree. removed from the long vertical central axes of the two adjacent abutments. In each of these abutments near the outer rim of the top plate is a closed hole just large enough to receive the bottom portions of each one of the abovementioned pins each holding a beveled blade when the top plate and bottom plate are assembled to one another. Extending from and co-extensive with the outer surface of the hollow cylindrically shaped elevation on the top side of the bottom plate and co-extensive with the top outer surface of the concave shaped elevation of the bottom plate are each of two rounded convex ridges 180.degree. removed from one another that each fit respectively snug into one of the abovementioned concave depressions in the bottom side of the top plate when the two plates are assembled together. When the two plates with pins and blades are assembled together, they are then fitted to the rotatory head of a motorized brush cutter stem, top side of top plate first and affixed thereto by way of an appropriate nut and bolt combination depending on the type of head to be fitted to. The instant invention so affixed to a rotatory head is then ready to serve as a heavy duty vegetation cutting tool. There is a virtually never ending need for the expeditious commercial forging of ski trails, snowmobile trails, cross-country trails, horse trails and commercial clearing of power line rights-of-way and golf courses throughout the country. Such undertakings often prove to be laborious, time-consuming and relatively expensive. The instant invention however serves to greatly minimize such labor, time and cost. To begin with, one of the major problems with respect to the utilization of any currently used brushcutting device is the one wherein invariably it proves virtually impossible to cut level to ground. Consequently, after cutting, there are nevertheless vestiges of stumps still left standing that can prove to be problematic with respect to vehicular tires or to ski units after cutting. The instant invention unlike all of the prior art however permits cutting right level to ground rather than only to a level of two inches or so above ground such that therefore such problems associated with stump vestiges are totally eliminated. Additionally, the plates of the instant invention being made of ALMAG 35, an alloy of aluminum and magnesium make for a much lighter cutting tool to be fitted to the head of a brush cutting stem unit. Ease of use by a workman is thus greatly facilitated. The instant invention consisting of two plates, one with three press fitted pins and three freely rotatable beveled blades is extremely easy to assemble. This feature together with its relatively light weight as well as its facility for absorbing the shock of cutting and thereby greatly reducing any flow of cutting shock up the stem of a brush cutter renders the instant invention inherently much more user friendly than any of the various currently in vogue cutting tools utilized for such clearing. Also, the instant invention is amenable to being fitted to a counterclockwise turning rotatory head or to one that turns clockwise simply by fitting its three blade components to its pin components during assembly such that blade beveled ends face in the direction of rotation of the head. If a user cuts right to left when utilizing a cutter with a counterclockwise turning head, he or she will avoid kickback when hitting a tree, once again due to the swivel capability of each of the invention's blade components held by its press fitted pins. This feature of swivelability about pins permits a simple collapsing inward of blades upon impact with rocks thereby alleviating problems associated with rock impact shock. Also, the plate components are rust proof and shatterproof under all conditions of cutting thereby rendering the instant invention eminently more durable and inherently much safer than any of the cutting tools currently in use for such heavy brush and stump cutting purposes in areas where lots of rocks are located. Finally, unlike any other cutting tool available for clearing heavy, thick brush and small tree stumps during the course of a significant commercial undertaking, deformation with use and wear to the extent it might ever occur at all occurs only uniformly throughout the whole tool by virtue of the manner in which the two plates fit together when assembled. Also, blades of varying length and hardness can be utilized in conjunction with the plates and pins. Short, relatively thick blades are particularly useful to cut small tree stumps flush to the level of ground. Longer not quite so thick blades serve to cut heavy clumps of grass and weeks flush to the level of ground. Respectfully submitted, the instant invention in view of its above-described user and rock friendly features that enable heavy vegetation cutting and clearing to be undertaken on the average 27 percent faster on the basis of studies conducted by your inventor comparing its capabilities to other cutting heads currently in use render it indeed not only new, useful and unique but indeed virtually revolutionary in the art of brush cutting tools."
7584542,Trimmer,2003-11-03,0,1,"This invention relates to a grass trimming device which is capable of being switched between at least two alternative configurations which are suitable for grass trimming and edge trimming respectively. A known grass trimming device (trimmer) comprises a cutting head mounted at one end of a shaft, an operator handle being positioned at the other end of the shaft. The cutting head includes a cutter constituted by a rotatable blade or a rotatable flexible cutting line. The cutting head can be moved relative to the shaft, to position the cutter generally horizontal for grass trimming and generally vertical for edge trimming. DE-A-3 010 092 describes a known trimmer of this type, the trimmer having a handle that can be moved from a first socket on the cutting head to a second socket on the same head, in order to shift the cutting head from a configuration in which the cutter plane is horizontal for grass trimming to a configuration in which the cutter is vertical for edge trimming. In both configurations of the device, a shaft fitted to the handle is directed upwardly towards the operator. This device suffers from the drawback that changing from one function to the other is difficult, because it is necessary to release and then remove the handle from one socket, and then replace it and lock it into position in the second socket. EP-A-0 005 540 shows a similar device where the handle is pivotally adjustable in a plane which is perpendicular to the cutting plane. Changing the configuration of this device requires releasing a handle catch, turning the handle through 180°, releasing the cutting head, and then adjusting it to the required angle. Moreover, a relatively complex arrangement of parts is necessary to achieve the changeover. This results in considerable expense, and a risk that the components, which are not totally covered may be damaged by the ingress of dirt and debris. EP-A-0 296 789 describes a trimmer in which the shaft includes a coupling section to which the cutting head is pivotally attached. The cutting head includes a surface defining a parting plane at which plane the coupling section is coupled to the cutting head. The parting plane, extends laterally with respect to the shaft, so that relative movement at the parting plane between the coupling section and the cutting head is about an axis which is perpendicular to the parting plane and obliquely to the shaft, so that relative movement between the coupling section and the cutting head about the parting plane positions the cutter in grass trimming and edge trimming configurations. Each of the trimmers described above is relatively easy to operate when in the trimming configuration. However, when in the edging configuration, the user must stand at right-angles to the edge of a lawn being trimmed, and move sideways along that edge as trimming progresses. This is disadvantageous, in that it is difficult to align the cutter accurately with the edge of the lawn (owing to the eye of the user not being in alignment with the lawn edge), and this can lead to a poor edging performance. Moreover, each of the known trimmers requires a relatively complex series of operations to convert between trimming and edging configurations. The aim of the invention is to provide a trimmer having improved edging capabilities. The present invention provides a trimmer comprising a cutting head housing a cutter means, and an elongate shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being connected to the shaft by connection means permitting the cutting head to be positioned with its cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical without disconnecting the cutting head and the shaft, the shaft having a hand-grippable portion at a position remote from the cutting head, the arrangement being such that the line joining a point within the hand-grippable portion and the connection means is substantially parallel to plane of rotation of the cutter means when the cutter means is substantially vertical. Preferably, the connection means is such that the cutting head is movable between positions in which its cutter means is substantially horizontal and substantially vertical in a single movement. Advantageously, the connection means is such that the cutter means is movable between the substantially horizontal position and the substantially vertical position by an effective rotation of the cutting head relative to the handle of 120° in one direction or 240° in the other direction. Preferably, the connection means is constituted by a rotatable joint. In this case, the rotatable joint is such that the cutting head is movable between positions in which its cutter means is substantially horizontal and substantially vertical about a single axis. In a preferred embodiment, the axis of rotation of the rotatable joint lies substantially at 35.5° to the plane of rotation of the cutter means, and lies substantially at 35.5° to the horizontal when the cutting head is positioned with the cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical. Connection means of this nature enables the cutting head to be moved between a trimming mode (in which the cutter means is substantially horizontal) and an edging mode (in which the cutter means is substantially vertical) by a simple rotation of the cutting head relative to the shaft. A particular advantage of this connection means is that the elongate shaft is generally aligned with a lawn edge in the edging mode, so that the user can carry out an edging operation when positioned behind the cutting head and moving forwards (or backwards) along the edge portion of the lawn. Advantageously, the rotatable joint is constituted by a ball-and-socket joint. Preferably, the ball is fixed to the cutting head, and the socket is defined by a generally spherical socket portion formed at the end of the shaft remote from the hand-grippable portion. The trimmer may further comprise a motor for driving the cutter means. Conveniently, the cutter means is rotatable, and the drive engagement between the motor and the cutter means is a rotatable drive engagement. Preferably, the motor is housed within the ball, and is an electric motor. Preferably, a rotatable cutter line constitutes the cutter means, In a preferred embodiment, the trimmer further comprises a wheel rotatably mounted on the cutting head. The axis of rotation of the wheel may be substantially coincident with the axis of rotation of the cutter means. Advantageously, the radius of the wheel is of the order of, but slightly less than, the effective radius of the cutter means. The invention also provides a cutting head housing a cutter means, and a shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being adjustably mounted with respect to the shaft by connection means enabling the cutter means to be moved between substantially vertical and substantially horizontal positions by adjusting the position of the cutting head relative to the shaft by an effective rotation of 120° in one direction or 240° in the other direction. The invention further provides a cutting head housing a cutter means, and a shaft for supporting the cutting head, the cutting head being rotatably mounted with respect to the shaft by means of a rotatable joint whose axis of rotation lies substantially at 45° to the plane rotation of the cutter means, and lies substantially at 45° to the horizontal when the cutting head is positioned with its cutter means either substantially horizontal or substantially vertical."
8354852,Wireless soil sensor utilizing a RF frequency for performing soil measurements,2010-01-31,0,1,"STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is related to a wireless sub-surface sensor having a radio for performing real-time soil measurements. 2. Description of the Related Art The prior art discusses other irrigation systems and methods. Closing an underground to above ground RF communication link is a challenging task. The challenge is typically due to difficult propagation conditions perpetrated by high water content as well as high conductivity in the soil. The moisture and conductivity vary over time depending on environmental stimulus. High water content increases the rate of absorption of RF energy. Salinity and moisture both change the die-electric constant of the soil, effectively detuning the antenna element as water content changes over time. In instances, it is possible to adaptively modify the antenna tuning elements, to attempt to tune the antenna to the current state of the soil. However, in some instances it may not be possible to overcome the adverse effects of moisture in the ground by direct tuning of the RF and antenna components on board the underground wireless sensor. In other instances, certain wireless sensing devices may not be able to adapt their tuning in close to real time to match the soil conditions. The Present Invention seeks to resolve the problems of the prior art. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a solution to the problems of the prior art. The inventors of the present invention noticed the dielectric of soil, and how it changes with moisture and salinity, which led them to believe that a radiofrequency (“RF”) antenna of a wireless sub-surface soil sensor may be able to be tuned based on moisture and salinity measurements. The inventors measured soil moisture and salinity using novel sensors which also provided the electrical properties of the soil in which the wireless sub-surface soil sensor was placed. These electrical properties affect the efficient transmission and range of an antenna. The inventors realized that an antenna could be configured to optimize transmission efficiency and boost range. Components added to the antenna circuitry controlled by the processor allow for the antenna to be tuned based on the electrical properties of the soil. RF impedances (complex resistances) are often characterized on a two dimensional SMITH® Chart. A discussion of SMITH® Charts is set forth in Designing Impedance Matching Networks With the HP 8751 A , Hewlett-Packard Company, 1990, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Another discussion of SMITH® Charts is set forth in Stephen D Stearns, Mysteries of the Smith Chart , Pacificon 2001, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The inventors noticed that if the antenna is tuned in a specific and novel manner, its impedance is shifted in an arc around the ideal match (about 50 ohms) as moisture levels in the soil changed. By characterizing the arc by a radius and angle, the inventors were able to tune the radius to remain nearly constant. Only the phase angle of the impedance changed. The inventors designed the physical antenna structure, board structure, housing (air space) and tuning elements to maintain a constant impedance magnitude. This became an automatic, adaptive RF tuning which improved antenna performance across a range of soil moisture levels. One aspect of the present invention is a wireless soil sensor comprising a main body having a sensing component, a removable sleeve positioned over the sensing component, a radio, a processor configured to utilize a RF frequency for performing soil moisture measurements. Another aspect of the present invention is a wireless soil sensor comprising a sensing component integrated directly with a radio and a microcontroller. The microcontroller is configured to utilize a RF frequency for performing soil moisture measurements. Another aspect of the present invention is a method for performing soil moisture measurements utilizing radiofrequency. The method includes transmitting a radiofrequency signal through a soil material at a set frequency and power. The method also includes measuring a signal strength for the radiofrequency signal received at a receiver. The method also includes comparing the signal strength to a table of signal strength correlated with moisture values for the soil material. The method also includes determining the soil moisture measurement from the table. The radiofrequency signal is preferably transmitted from a wireless sub-surface soil sensor to an above-ground receiver. Alternatively, the radiofrequency signal is transmitted from an above ground receiver to a wireless sub-surface soil sensor. The radiofrequency signal is preferably transmitted at a frequency of 2.4 GigaHertz. Another aspect of the present invention is a wireless soil sensor. The wireless soil sensor is preferably capable of measuring soil moisture, soil salinity and soil temperature, while buried beneath the surface and also capable of wirelessly transmitting the measurements to a receiver above the surface for eventual transmission to an engine for calculations and other outputs. The wireless soil sensor preferably has a tine sleeve for placement over a portion of the sensor. The sleeve is removed when the sensor is ready to be buried beneath the surface of the soil. The sensor preferably links to a controller, is preferably associated with a watering zone which is to be controlled by a controller. At least a portion of the sensor is preferably waterproof. The tine sleeve preferably has a small patch of exposed PCB conductor which is connected to another, which allows the sensor to assume it is in a hibernation state (for power savings, suppressed communications and suppressed emissions). Essentially, while the sensor has the tine sleeve attached, it is in an inactive state. The tine sleeve further protects the sensitive components of the sensor during shipment. Removal of the tine sleeve is an intuitive indication that the sensor is to be associated and buried. The sensor assumes a period of active communication so that a controller/interrupter can learn of its presence and prompt assignment to a watering zone or zones. After a set period of time, the sensor preferably assumes a normal sensing and broadcast mode. The tine sleeve further acts a physical receipt, allowing for marking with the date, position of installation and corresponding watering zones. The tine sleeve further provides the function of enabling safe transportation of the end-of-life or return for repair of the sensor to a factory or alternative site. The wireless sensor preferably infers moisture and salinity levels by measuring the dielectric constant of the surrounding soil. A radio antenna used to relay these measurements to a central controller is affected (de-tuned) by surrounding changes in the dielectric constant. The present invention can adaptively tune the antenna impedance match via RF switches and passive components based on moisture and salinity readings. This increases the communication range and reduces power consumption. A user interface for an irrigation interrupter preferably has a default display of 128 by 64 pixel. In a limited space, the display communicates a tremendous amount of information in an extremely intuitive way. Six columns for watering zones are used in the display. Each zone shows a moisture assessment of Ok, Wet, Dry, or Cold. Next to this is a visual indication of the moisture level in the zone, as reported by one or more sensors, adapted to a soil/plant type. A bar showing moisture level preferably has two marks indicating a lower level where no watering would be interrupted, an upper level indicating that all watering would be interrupted, and in the zone in between, a sensor for how much of the normal watering period will be allowed before a mid-flow cutoff attenuates watering. A bold OFF and ON indication blinks between the view and the underlying moisture status normally shown. The blinking behavior is set to occur when a zone input is active, and indicates the action being taken by the interrupter. Above the moisture indications is a row showing the control status of each zone—whether it is controlled by one or more sensors, or has been placed in manual ON or manual OFF. The user interface allows for determination of a manual mode with only a casual view of the user interface. The top line shows the system status (Auto, Bypass, Master, Slave) and the recent average of water saving, calculated by the percentage of time normally watering has been attenuated. Master and Slave are used to enable “chaining” of multiple interrupters together to control additional zones, preferably six at a time. At the bottom of the display, icons show whether one or more than one sensor is assigned per zone. A solid square is a sensor with no performance issues. A hollow square indicates low battery. A triangle indicates RF reception issues. A hollow triangle represents RF reception and battery issues. In such conditions, where information about soil moisture and salinity conditions at the time of attempted transmission is available to the wireless sensor, for example when there are on board moisture and conductivity sensor present, the wireless transmitter will perform a simple computation to determine whether its transmission will be successful given the network activity history and the soil moisture and conductivity levels. The wireless sensor will track the moisture and conductivity levels, and based on those levels will adjust its transmission attempts. The impact of this decision making is that it will predict when the transmission will fail, and thus refrain from transmitting. This adaptive adjustment of the transmission schedule will help conservation battery life for battery operated sensor nodes. This adaptive schedule will be effective for one way as well as two way communication links. However its impact will be most evident for two-way over the air protocols. It is an object of the present invention to provide a proprietary wireless root zone intelligence system that measures real time soil moisture, temperature and salinity. It is an object of the present invention to provide an advanced wireless sensor and analytical, intuitive, fully interactive software. It is an object of the present invention to optimize turf health and playability, improve product quality, optimize resource utilization. Having briefly described the present invention, the above and further objects, features and advantages thereof will be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings."

Description of Related Art Base products such as chelating agents have been blended with copper sulfate for various uses in water-based treatment systems. U.S. Pat. No. 4,564,504 to Sorber, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, discloses an early process (the “Sorber process”) that used water, ammonia, and sulfuric acid to produce a novel acid. The Sorber process involved a vat mixing batch process where sulfuric acid is slowly mixed to an aqueous ammonium solution. The Sorber process was performed in open vats and was dangerous due to the extremely exothermic nature of the reactions involved. The Sorber process may be termed a “cold process” as the mixing was slowed down to avoid excess heat generation and/or explosions from occurring. There have been several attempts to improve upon the “cold process” (Sorber process). Examples of these attempts are found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,595 to Cummins, U.S. Pat.

6299663,Granulation method and apparatus therefor,1998-05-11,0,1,"The present invention is directed to a series of products formed by a pan granulation method for forming granules and more particularly, the present invention is directed to an improved fertilizer granule as well as additional granules. Generally speaking, pan granulation has been proposed in the art many times previously and with significant variations. One of the latest issued patents in the art to which the present invention relates is U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,765, issued to Derdall et al., Oct. 24, 1995. The reference teaches a process for pan granulating a particulate material. Based on the teachings of the Derdall et al. reference, a final particle size distribution that is achievable by practicing the invention is between about -5 mesh to about +10 mesh. In order to initiate the process, the Derdall et al. process is limited to the introduction of a seeding material typically between about -14 mesh and +28 mesh. This is required in order to control the granule growth and as indicated in the Derdall et al. disclosure, seed minimizes mutual agglomeration and results in high yields being obtained. The Derdall et al. reference further indicates that the proper sizing of the seed is fundamental to the operation of the process for granulation in order to have product yields exceed 90%. Reference is made in the disclosure that a seed core in the range of -14 mesh to +35 mesh is required in order to achieve a steady state and maintain uniform size distribution of between -8 mesh to +6 mesh. One of the greatest limitations existing in the granulation art is centered on the fact that known processes require a seeding agent in order to achieve the proper conditions for material accretion to result in a pellet or granule. By making use of a seed, the resulting granule is adversely affected in two key properties; roundness and cross-sectional uniformity. Typically, seeding material is not round and as the precursor particle, the result is irregular initial feedstock accretion which, in turn, forms an out-of-round particle upon which further material accretes. A further detriment from this results in terms of nonuniform particle density. Methodology is required for synthesizing a granule in the absence of seed material and which is round, tightly packed with a uniform homogeneous cross-section and capable of eliminating hazards associated with fertilizer granule production. The Derdall et al. process, although a meritorious procedure, did not recognize the limitations of employing a seeding agent or the need for controlling the dust generated during granulation which not only creates an unhealthy environment for workers, but more seriously, results in a potentially explosive environment. This is evident from the teachings of Derdall et al., particularly at column 3, beginning at line 24, wherein it is stated: """"It may be more difficult to keep the granulation steady or stable with fine seed, such as -35 mesh."""" The difficulty to which the Derdall et al. disclosure alludes is directed to cycling which is an inherent problem with pan granulation processes. If the size distribution of the seeding agent is not constant, then the process will not stabilize and effectively """"cycles"""" as is known to those skilled in this art. The result of this is that larger formed granules on the pan effectively destroy the smaller particles. This, of course, defeats the purpose of the pan granulation to generate particles. Furthermore, at line 36 in column 3, the disclosure indicates that: """"Fine seed sizes can be used, such as +35 mesh, but a point is reached where over-seeding or nucleation occurs easily and causes the final product yield to drop down."""" It is also indicated at column 3, beginning at line 45 that: """"Seed material in the range of 20 mesh is the best single point for each of control and uniformity of product size distribution . . . """" As is known, the larger the mesh numerical value the smaller the micron size of the respond to the stated micron sizes: Approximate Mesh Size Micron Size 12 1680 16 1190 20 840 30 590 40 420 100 149 200 74 Based on the teachings of the Derdall et al. disclosure, mesh sizes greater than +35 cause potential nucleation problems and result in a final product yield to decrease. With the technology disclosed infra, it has been found that by using a fine powder of between -35 mesh to +150 mesh, that a superior quality product can be formed in a high yield and typically in the range of greater than 90% yield. When the above passage regarding Derdall et al. is considered, it is clear that Derdall et al. effectively contradict what the technology set forth herein has found to be particularly successful. In the present application the size distribution of the nucleating material is between -35 mesh and +150 mesh which corresponds to micron size less than 590 .mu.m and 105 .mu.m, respectively. Nowhere in the prior is a powdered nucleating agent in this size distribution disclosed for purpose of forming a uniform granule in the size distribution of, for example, 3 mesh to about 10 mesh. Advantages have been ascribed to this process and one of the most attracttive advantages is that the granule or pellet has an enormous break strenght and a uniform cross-section, It has been found by practicing the present invention, that break strenghts in the range of 1 to 4 kg or greater have been achieved. In the Derdall et al. disclosure, at column 3, beginning at line 33 it is stated: """"Seed of large size forms granules of very poor strength."""" If one considers these teachings in light of the size of the nucleating agent provided herein, the admissions made in the Derdall et al. disclosure would clearly go against the appeal of using a seeding agent in the size range as clearly taught by Derdall et al. The instruction in Derdall et al. indicates an ideal seeding agent size is 20 mesh (supra); the instant application uses a powder having a particle size between 75-750% smaller than Derdall et al. and yet achieve very desirable results. In Statutory Invention Registration H1070, authored by Harrison et al., Jul. 7, 1992, a method for granulating potash materials is disclosed. The process involves the conversion of particulate potassium sulfate or potassium chloride by agglomeration using a conventional rotary drum granulator, pan granulator or other conventional granulating device. In the disclosure of this document, there are no specific teachings regarding the elimination of a seeding agent, feedstock size or other important factors related to process control in order to generate superior quality granules having commercial viability. Further, the process clearly is an agglomeration process. It is known that agglomeration typically involves the aggregation of colloidal particles suspended in a liquid into clusters or flocs. These clusters or flocs have varying degrees of interstice and are loosely bound (Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, eleventh edition, 1987). It would be desirable if it were possible to achieve a high yield granular product within specified mesh sizes which does not require the use of a seed in the process. The present invention is directed to satisfying the limitations in the art and more particularly those limitations in the Derdall et al. reference. One object of the present invention is to provide a granulated homogeneous fertilizer product having a uniform cross-section devoid of a seeding agent and having a break strength of at least two kilograms in a size distribution of 3 mesh to 10 mesh. A further object of the present invention is to provide a granule made in accordance with a method comprising the steps of: providing an initial feedstock having a uniform size distribution of about 99.9% particle size of -150 mesh and of said 99.9% particle size of -150 mesh about 90% comprising a particle size of -200 mesh; providing a nucleating material in a size distribution of 35 mesh to 150 mesh; providing a binder solution; contacting the binder and the feedstock in a pan granulator; and forming fertilizer granules directly in the pan granulator in the absence of a seeding agent. Advantageously, it has been found that the granulation process can be achieved in the absence of any seed material to result in a high yield product with high break strength in a single pan granulator. As an alternative the product may be formed in a two-stage method where an intermediate sized granule can be produced that is predominantly -8 mesh to +20 mesh in a first stage. This product can then be dried and screened such that the -8 to +20 portion of granules is used as a feed to the second stage. In the second stage, the -8 to +20 mesh portion may be added to a second stage granulator pan where suitable binder is added to grow the small balls into uniform sized +8 to -4 mesh granules or balls which are then dried in a dryer. The so-dried product may be then screened on -8 to +4 mesh to produce a new product in the form of a premium granular fertilizer, for example, break strength of greater than 1.0 kilograms (kg) with 3 to 4 kilograms (kg) being typical. The -8 to +20 mesh portion leaving the dryer may be recovered and recycled to the second stage pan. The +4 mesh and the -20 mesh portions may be sent to a suitable pulverizer for recycling. It has been found that the nucleation center in the size range of -35 mesh to +150 mesh may be employed as a basis for granule growth and further, that the nucleation center may comprise any suitable material known to those skilled in the art. As is known from prior art granules, the presence of a core, i.e. a seed significantly affects the quality of the final product. Since the seed is relatively large (14 mesh), such materials are often irregularly shaped which, in turn, leads to irregular feedstock accretion. This leaves the final product aspherical, loosely packed and with an irregular nonuniform cross-sectional appearance. By making use of a nucleating material which is a dust relative to the core arrangements in the prior art, the above limitations are circumvented. This feature has dramatic consequences in terms of cost savings as well as providing the user with the capacity to """"shell"""" or """"onion-skin"""" nucleation center with additional materials which may be similar or different from one another. This degree of freedom is obviously favorable, since multiple component homogenous granules can be readily produced. As an example, and without being limiting, the process is applicable to granule formation where the granule includes a base fertilizer material which may be surrounded by a coating having limited solubility in order that the fertilizer be a time release type compound. As a further example, the process is particularly well suited to the formation of novel water softener balls or granules for use in water softening systems. Additionally, specialty fertilizer grades may be easily formed using the process according to the present invention. Utility for the process can be realized for a plethora of particle types. As a further option, the process has applicability in other fields such as the preparation of ice melt product. As an example, for the formation of the sodium chloride granules, the process, according to one embodiment of the invention, permits the addition of Mg or CaCl2 to the sodium chloride to enhance the ice melt characteristics and make a more efficient ice melt product. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a host of additional examples may be achievable depending on the particular end use. In accordance with the further desirable features of the present invention, the provision of a plurality of pan granulators permits full control and customization of the granule characteristics. By using one or a plurality of pan granulators when the process steps are observed, the result is that the granule can be uniformly grown under stabilized conditions without continual cycling as is the limitation in the prior art where only a single pan is disclosed for use. By employing the process parameters and apparatus according to the present invention, progressive accretion of the material on the granule is possible to result in a high density packed pellet with extremely high break strength, solid, uniform cross-section and a user predetermined size. Significant additional advantages can be realized by the technology set forth herein including: i) an enhanced market value of the formed product; ii) the formation of a more user friendly product; iii) significantly improved product handleability; iv) a significantly improved uniformity index: v) no product loss or waste. vi) uniform cross-section; vii) tightly packed feedstock; viii) absence of a seed or crystal core; ix) increased break strength relative to the prior art; x) material homogeneity throughout the granule; and xi) greater quantity of feedstock material per granule The process and apparatus contribute to achieve a greater than 90% recovery of product which is on specification (spec) in the desired size range. Of the remaining 10% of the product, the same may be simply reintroduced into the pulverizer to create fines for reintroduction into the system. Accordingly, it will be readily apparent to those skilled that the process may be not only particularly useful for the user but further, results in monetary and energy savings from 100% use of the product. In view of the elegance of the technology set forth herein, the result is that the apparatus and method may be applied in a retrofit application to existing systems which cannot achieve the level of efficiency attributed to the present technology set forth in the present case; existing systems may be significantly improved by simply adding the apparatus of the present invention and the method disclosed herein to improve such systems. This is a further advantage of the present invention in that the method is interruptible and does not require any specific parameters in terms of temperature, etc. in order to operate efficiently. In this manner, the pan granulators, employed in the present invention, may be arranged in any number of ways, i.e. in series, parallel, towered, etc., and may include any number of compounds to apply any number of layers on a granule as the same is grown through the system. Having thus described the invention, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawing illustrating preferred embodiments."

5004026,Felling head,1989-10-06,0,1,"This invention is directed toward an improved tree felling head. The invention is more particularly directed towards an improved tree felling head of the type that accumulates cut trees. The invention is also directed toward a method of cutting and accumulating trees with the improved felling head. Felling heads for cutting trees are well known as are felling heads that both cut and accumulate trees. One type of felling head employs means to tightly grip the tree to be cut. While the tree is tightly gripped, cutting means on the head are moved and operated to cut through the gripped tree. The gripping means then release the cut tree. Grapple means may be provided on the felling head to accumulate one or more released cut trees while cutting continues. Cutting through tightly gripped trees can result in the butt end of the tree splintering as the cut nears completion. This is due to the tree occasionally being highly stressed when tightly gripped by the felling head. A tree with a splintered butt end is not as valuable as an unpslintered tree. One way to minimize splintering of the butt ends is to cut the trees without tightly gripping them. It is known to provide felling heads that cut free standing trees. This type of felling head has a fixed cutting means, usually a large circular saw, with a butt plate over a portion of the saw. The felling head is moved to have the saw cut the free standing tree which then rests on the butt plate. Grapple means are provided on the felling head to accumulate one or more cut trees off the butt plate while cutting continues. Often however, the just cut tree on the butt plate is unstable and it can fall of the felling head before it is trapped by the accumulating arms. The problems associated with splintering in cut trees, and with tree loss off the felling head, can be minimized by improving the handling of the trees by the felling head. It is therefore the purpose of the present invention to provide an improved tree felling head having improved tree handling means. It is more particularly a purpose of the present invention to provide an improved tree felling head with improved tree handling means that minimize splintering in cut trees. It is also more particularly another purpose of the present invention to provide an improved tree felling head with improved tree handling means that minimizes both splintering in cut trees and loss of cut trees off the felling head. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a felling head with cradle means for loosely receiving a tree and with retaining means on the felling head for loosely retaining the tree in the cradle means. In one embodiment of the invention, the felling head employs movable cutting means. The felling head is manoeuvred to place the standing tree to be cut within the cradles and the retaining means is operated to loosely retain the standing tree within the cradles while the cutting means is operated and moved to cut through the tree. The loosely retained tree is free to have some movement while being cut and therefore is not as likely to splinter as a tree that is cut while tightly held. Preferably, the felling head is provided with grapple means to accumulate one or more cut trees while still being able to loosely retain the next tree being cut. In another embodiment of the invention, the felling head employs a fixed cutting means. A butt plate is provided on top of a portion of the cutting means. The felling head is manoeuvred to have the cutting means cut through a free standing tree. The cut tree ends up on the butt plate within cradle means provided on the felling head. The retaining means on the felling head are immediately operated at the conclusion of cutting to loosely retain the cut tree on the butt plate and within the cradles to prevent it from falling off the felling head. The felling head is provided with grapple means to accumulate one or more cut trees while still being able to loosely retain the next cut tree. The invention is particularly directed toward a tree felling head having a frame with tree cutting means at the bottom of the frame. Vertically spaced-apart cradles are provided on the frame for loosely receiving a tree therein. Retaining means are provided on the frame between the cradles for loosely retaining a tree within the cradles. Means are also provided on the frame for supporting a cut tree by its butt end while retained in the cradles. Preferably, the felling head includes grapple means on the frame between the cradles to accumulate cut trees against the cradles in the frame. In one embodiment, means are provided for movably mounting the tree cutting means on the frame to cut through a free-standing tree that is positioned within the cradles by manoeuvring the felling head. The movable tree cutting means support the cut tree by its butt end while it is loosely retained in the cradles. In another embodiment, the tree cutting means are fixed on the frame, and the felling head is manoeuvred to have the fixed cutting means cut through a free standing tree. The cut tree support means comprise a butt plate covering a portion of the tree cutting means. The invention is also directed toward a method for falling trees using a felling head which comprises: positioned the felling head to locate a standing tree within vertically spaced-apart tree cradles on the felling head; moving retaining means to a closed position to loosely retain the standing tree within the cradles; and cutting the standing tree while loosely retained within the cradles. The invention is further directed toward a method for felling trees using a felling head which comprises; manoeuvring the felling head to have a fixed cutting means on the head cut through a free standing tree, the cut tree resting on a butt plate and within tree receiving cradles on the felling head; and moving retaining means to a closed position to loosely retain the cut tree on the butt plate and within the cradle means. The methods preferably include the step of tightly gripping the cut tree against the cradles with grapple means to hold the cut tree while moving the head to the next standing tree to be cut."
7294343,Biodegradable sorbents,2002-06-14,0,1,"The invention relates to a grain based material useful as a general sorbent. In some embodiments, the invention relates to the introduction of a material into an environment, the material being sorbed within the sorbent. These embodiments are particularly applicable to the introduction of a control agent, such as a mosquito larvicide, into an environment. In other embodiments, the invention relates to the removal of a material from an environment by sorbing the material within the sorbent. Many methods exist for removing an undesired material from an environment. For instance, numerous products are available commercially for removing spilled liquids from a surface. Some such products are used to remove oil from open water, such as when an oil spill has occurred. In this application, it is desirable to selectively remove oil from water. For such absorbents, efforts are sometimes made to increase the selectivity of oil over water. Currently available products for spill control include clay, kaolin, illite, bentonite, diatomite, hectorite, montmorillonite, attapulgite, silica, silica sand, polypropylene, sodium polyacrylate/polyacrylamides, vermiculite, gypsum, limestone, metal oxides, asphalt, fiberglass, diatomaceous earth, perlite and other materials. Such materials, while satisfactory in function, suffer from certain drawbacks. Many such products contain silica, which poses a hazard to humans. In addition, most such materials are not biodegradable, which is a factor that can limit the options for disposal of the used sorbent material. There are also several organic spill control products described in the art. Examples of such materials include natural fibers such as grass, pre-cooked cereal kernels, sawdust, cellulose, and peat. U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,881 purports to describe a cellulose based sorbent system, where the cellulose has been treated with an additive to render it both hydrophobic and oleophilic so it will selectively remove oil from water. U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,774 purports to describe the use of pre-cooked and puffed cereals for oil removal. Another document, U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,350, purports to disclose a particulate milled seed material in which the lipids have been removed through solvent extraction and wherein the material is designed to remove and disperse oil from open water and solid surfaces. The composition is a solvent-extracted proteinaceous material derived from grain products having oil sorptive properties. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,881 purports to describe the use of diatomaceous earth, clay, silica, corncob, peatmoss, perlite, polypropylene, sawdust, cellulose, polystyrene, vermiculite, peat and cork to absorb liquids. This composition is taught as a general absorbent; in this document, it is stated that materials that absorb both water and oil are undesirable. U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,937 purports to disclose the use of corn stalks, husks, cobs, and kernels as carriers. U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,323 purports to disclose the use of delignified waste from hulls, straw, stover, and shells as a carrier. Other carriers are purportedly disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,383,609 and 6,391,120. Generally, other biodegradable materials such as peat moss, sawdust, hair, feathers, cotton, cork, starch, bagasse, seeds, seed hulls, and other seed components have also been proposed. Many methods for introducing a material into an environment also are known. In many cases, it is desired to introduce the material in a delayed-release manner, by which is contemplated that at least some of the material is bound up with another material or otherwise is not immediately available to function in the environment for its intended purpose. For instance, it is often desired to introduce a control agent, i.e., a material that limits the growth or spread of a living thing, into an environment. Known control agents, such as insecticides, larvicides, rodenticides, fungicides, and so forth may be oil-based or water-based. It is desirable to provide a sorbent for such control agents, and in particular, it is desirable to provide a sorbent that allows delayed release of at least some control agents into an environment. Further, it is highly desirable to provide a sorbent that is useful in sorbing both oil- and water-based control agents. Typical control agents are provided in liquid or solid form. There are advantages and disadvantages to each product form. Liquid pesticides can be applied as a spray, which is advantages in some respect. Drift control of the spray can be a challenge, however, especially in an aerial broadcast application. Solid pesticide products are better at targeting an area for pest control, because there is less drift of the solid product. Pelleted or compacted compositions are typically used in solid pesticide products. The majority of such composition is composed of a carrier or absorbent material, and the active ingredient is usually a small percentage (<10%) of the pellet weight. Another advantage of a solid control agent composition is that the weight of the composition allows penetration into vegetative areas that are less accessible via a liquid spray. Heavier pellets often can penetrate through a tree canopy, whereas liquid droplets would tend to coat and contaminate the tree canopy. One drawback to many known solid pesticides products is that non-biodegradable carriers often are used in such products. These carriers can lead to contamination of the area of treatment. In recognition of this problem, numerous biodegradable carriers have been provided; examples include materials such as corncob, peanut hulls, and starches. Many known biodegradable carriers are unsatisfactory. In many cases, the resulting composition does not perform as well as a non-biodegradable product. In addition, many biodegradable materials such as corncob, peanut hulls, and starches do not disperse easily when in contact with water, leaving a contaminant residue. Corncob is especially poor in this regard, because it has low density as well as poor dispersibility in water. In addition, when a granular pesticide does not readily disintegrate in an aquatic environment, the active ingredient is not readily released and thus a less efficacious pest control product with residual contaminant pesticide activity is provided. In the case of mosquito larvicides, such materials ordinarily are released into standing or slowly moving water to destroy larvae growing in the water. It is particularly preferred that the carrier should release at least a portion of the larvicide within the topmost two feet of water in a standing or slowly moving water column, where most or all of the larvae are found. It is further preferred that the larvae in the water column be destroyed within 24 hours, and preferably within 8 hours of treatment. Although the prior art has provided numerous carriers for control agents, not all carriers allow for the preparation of a control agent composition that meets these preferred criteria. In a first preferred embodiment of the invention, it is a general object to provide a sorbent that is useful in conjunction with the introduction of a material into an environment. In a second preferred embodiment of the invention, it is a general object to provide a sorbent that is useful in conjunction with the removal of a material from an environment, the material being removed by sorption of the material into the sorbent and removal of the sorbed composition thus formed from the environment. THE INVENTION The invention provides a number of embodiments in which the sorbing properties of spent grain germ and seed meal are utilized. These organic, naturally derived sorbents, alone or in combination, can be used to introduce material into an environment, or to remove material from an environment. When such sorbent is used to introduce a material into an environment, the environment preferably is one in which the sorbent will biodegrade. In such instances, delayed release of the sorbed material into the environment often is possible. When the sorbent is used to remove material from an environment, the sorbed material composition can be allowed to biodegrade prior to ultimate disposal of the composition. Many of the disclosures in the prior art fail to address the fate of the sorbed composition formed upon removing a material from an environment. Generally, the volume of sorbent introduced into the environment is much greater than the volume of the liquid to be removed from the environment. Where the removed material is or contains a hazardous compound, the relatively large quantity of sorbent having the material sorbed therewithin must also be treated as a hazardous material, which can increase the ultimate disposal cost considerably. The sorbents useful in conjunction with the present invention can be biodegraded, thereby reducing the total volume of material that must be treated as hazardous. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a control agent composition is provided. The composition includes a sorbent, the sorbent being selected from the group consisting of spent grain germ, seed meal, and mixtures thereof, and a control agent sorbed within the sorbent. Most preferably, the composition is in the form of discrete plural pellets, by which is contemplated the product of a pelletizing operation in a pellet mill. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for limiting the growth of an undesired pest in an environment is provided. The method includes selecting a control agent for the pest, and introducing into the environment an amount of a control agent composition effective to limit the growth of the pest. The control agent composition includes a sorbent and control agent as described hereinabove. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for introducing a material into an environment is provided. A material for which delayed release into the environment is desirable is selected. Subsequently, a granular material composition that includes the selected material sorbed within a sorbent, the sorbent being spent grain germ, seed meal, or a mixture thereof, is introduced into the environment. The timing of the release of the material into the environment can be controlled to an extent by adjusting the integrity of the granules, whereby more durable granules generally will release the sorbed material more slowly than less durable granules. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for removing an unwanted material present in an environment is provided. The method includes selecting a sorbent for the material, introducing into the environment an amount of the sorbent effective to sorb at least a portion of the material, allowing at least some of the material to become sorbed to thereby formed a sorbed composition, and removing at least a portion of the sorbed composition from the environment. The sorbed material may be a combustible material, and, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a method for generating heat is provided, the method including providing a combustible material composition and oxidizing the combustible material composition. The combustible material composition includes a sorbent and a combustible material sorbed within the sorbent. Preferably, the combustible material is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight of the composition. The invention contemplates the use of a sorbent, by which is contemplated a material that absorbs and/or adsorbs another material. Generally, absorption is a term used in the art to refer to the penetration of one substance into the inner structure of another substance, whereas the term adsorption refer to adherence of atoms, ions, or molecules onto the surface of another material. It is believed that one or both phenomena occur in accordance with the various embodiments of the invention, but it is contemplated that the material may serve as a sorbent even if only one of the two phenomena is present. By “sorbed within” is herein contemplated the sorption of a material in or on the sorbent. The sorbent used in conjunction with the invention preferably is spent germ, which is a germ from which oil has been expelled, for instance, by pressing or extraction with an extracting liquid such as hexane or water. Spent grain germ material has numerous advantages, in that it is derived from natural, renewable resources, is biodegradable and safely incinerable, is nontoxic and safe for the environment, and is economical to produce and use. This material is able to sorb both hydrophilic and lipophilic liquids. The spent germ may be washed to render it substantially free of odor components. It is known that washing of the germ will remove substantially odor and flavor components, which may be an advantage in some instances. In other embodiments, unwashed germ may be used. Germ obtained from any suitable grain may be employed in conjunction with the invention. Grains such as corn, wheat, soy, sorghum, barley, and the like are particularly suitable for use in conjunction with the invention. The preferred sorbent is expeller-extruded corn germ. Virgin germ (i.e., germ from which oil has not been extracted) may also be used, whereby in the manufacture of the sorbent as described herein some or all oil present in the germ is extracted. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the sorbent used in conjunction with the invention may be a seed meal. Examples of such meals include linseed meal, soybean meal, sunflower meal, cottonseed meal, rapeseed meal, peanut meal, safflower seed meal, and combinations thereof. By “seed” is meant to include that part of a plant which is capable of forming a new plant upon germination, e.g., whole grains of wheat, including the fruit or fruit-like structure housing the seed. The seed meal comprises a spent oil bearing seed residue, which is a seed residue from which oil has been expelled, such as by solvent extraction or expeller extraction. The extracted residue then is ground, by which is contemplated the reduction of the residue to smaller particles, preferably to a semi-course to fine powder. It is contemplated that some seeds will include a hull that may (but need not) be removed prior to expelling oil and grinding. Thus, the meal may comprise a dehulled meal. The seed meal in some embodiments is washed to substantially remove odor components therefrom. The germ and seed meal component of the sorbent collectively should be present in the sorbent in an amount of at least 50% by dry basis weight of the sorbent. Preferably, the germ and meal are present in a greater amount, such as an amount of 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% by weight of the sorbent. Most preferably, the germ and meal collectively are present in an amount of 100% by dry basis weight of the sorbent, that is, the sorbent includes the meal and/or germ to the substantially or complete exclusion of other sorbents. With respect to one another, the germ and meal can be used in any ratio desired. For instance, expresses as a percentage, the ratio may be 100% meal, 90% meal, 80% meal, 70% meal, 60% meal, 50% meal, 40% meal, 30% meal, 20% meal, 10% meal, or 0% meal (i.e., 100% germ). Other sorbents, such as these described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,391,328, optionally may be used in conjunction with the sorbents described herein, but preferably, such other sorbents are not present. The sorbent may be used in conjunction with the introduction of a material into an environment. The environment can be any place, area, or region in which the introduction of the material is desired. Generally, the material is selected as being desirable for use in the environment. For instance, the material may be a control agent, by which is completed a material that limits the growth of unwanted pests in the environment. A control agent preferably is selected as being an agent that limits the growth of the pest, by which is contemplated checking the spread of the pest by killing, sterilizing, destroying eggs or otherwise limiting the growth of the pest. Control agents generally are toxic chemicals; in accordance with the invention, any control agent now known or otherwise found to be suitable for use in limiting the growth of a pest may be used. The pest may be present in the environment, or may not be present in the environment (in other words, it is contemplated that the environment may be treated prophylactically). The pest can be any organism whose presence in the environment is undesired. Any organism found in the Animalia, Protista, Fungi (in particular non-mold fungi), Plantae, or Monera kingdoms may be deemed a pest in particular circumstances, and the control agent may be any agent that limits the growth of such pest in the environment. With respect to animals, the pest may be mammal, for instance, a rodent such as a mouse or rat, or a non-mammal, such as a fish, bird or other animal. The invention is believed to be particularly applicable to the control of animals in the phylum Arthropoda, including especially the classes Insecta (representing insects, millipedes, and centipedes), and Cheliceramorpha, especially arachnids. The control agent in preferred embodiments may be a rodenticide, a herbicide, an insecticide, a fungicide, or a bactericide. Specific embodiments of the invention employ, for instance, a larvicide, a pupicide, an ovicide, a hormone, a growth regulator (e.g. an insect growth regulator), a biological control agent, a microbial control agent, a toxicant, a fumigant, a pheromone, a repellent, a chemosterilant, a miticide, an acarcide, a molluscicide, an avicide, a predicide, an algaecide, a nematicide, an amoebicide, a nymphicide, and the like. In preferred embodiments, the control agent is selected from among an animal control agent (which may be a control agent for any species in the kingdom Animalia), a plant control agent (any species which may be a control agent for any species in the kingdom Plantae), a non-mold fungal control agent (which may be a control agent for any species in the kingdom Fungi, excepting the molds), a protist control agent (which may be a control agent for any species in the kingdom Protista) or a monera control agent (which may be a bacterial species or any other species in the Monera kingdom). In some embodiments, the control agent may be a virus control agent. Two or more agents can be combined to increase efficacy or to achieve multifunctional performance in the same composition. Specific preferred examples of suitable control agents include insecticides such as temephos, chlorpyfifos, methyl isocyanate, methoprene, propaphos, DURSBAN® dimilin, malathien, carbaryl, and diazinon; herbicides such as 2,4-D and 2,4-D ester, ammonium sulfamate, BROMACIL®, copper salts, molinate, propanil, pyrazolate, metolachlor, and the like. Other control agents include bioactives such as Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus sphaericus ; flugicides, such as fenoxanil, iprobenfos, menopril, tricyclozole, and valdamycin, and the like. The invention is not limited to the foregoing, and indeed any material that functions as a control agent may be used in conjunction with the invention. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,911,952; 4,983,390; 5997,445; 6,159,489; 6,316,447; 6,335,027; and 6,340,656, all disclose numerous control agents, any or all which in certain embodiments may be deemed suitable for use in conjunction with the invention. The control agent or other material sorbed within the sorbent may be a lipophilic or oleogenous material, or may be a hydrophilic material or a combination thereof (such as an emulsion). The material may be present in any amount with respect to the sorbent suitable for the intended purpose of the sorbent/material composition. In some embodiments, the material is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight of the total composition, more preferably at least 7% by weight, and even more preferably, at 10% by weight. When the sorbed material is a control agent, the sorbed material preferably is present in an amount ranging from 0.001 to 50% by weight, more preferably, from 0.001 to 10% by weight, and even more preferably, from 0.005 to 5% by weight of the composition. In some embodiments, the sorbed material is present in an amount from 0.05 to 1%, or, within this range, from 0.05 to 0.5% by weight. More generally, any amount suitable for the intended purpose may be employed in conjunction with the invention. The composition optionally may include any other additives, which may be present in any amounts suitable for their intended purposes or omitted altogether. Examples of such additives include surfactants, spreading agents, adjuvants, other carriers, binders, deflocculating agents, dispersing agents, synergists, penetrants, suspending agents, baits, phagostimulants, sticking agents, stabilizers, coupling agents, foaming or antifoaming agents, diluents, waxes, oils, superabsorbents, and more generally, any other additives. The sorbents described herein are not limited to the introduction of a control agent into an environment. To the contrary, the sorbets can be used to introduce any desirable sorbable materials into an environment. It is contemplated that in some cases the sorbable material may be a solid material that is carried in or on the sorbent. In one embodiment of the invention, the sorbable material is a fertilizer. Any suitable material or synthetic fertilizer may be employed in conjunction with the invention. In one embodiment, the sorbable material is an animal nutrient, such a vitamin or mineral. These materials may be present in any amounts suitable for their intended purpose. The selection of specific ingredients, loading levels, and application rates may be made by one is skilled in the art. One embodiment of the invention encompasses a method for fertilizing an arable area by applying a fertilizer composition as described above. In another embodiment, the invention encompasses a method for providing nutrients to an animal, the method including feeding the animal an animal nutrient composition as described above. The animal may be for instance, a horse, a cow, a pig, a sheep, a bird, or even a human. The composition that includes the sorbent and sorbed material (including any additives) may be provided in any suitable form. Most preferably, the composition is provided in the form of discrete plural particles of a substantially uniform and homogenous admixture of the sorbent and the sorbed materials. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the particles are in a form of compressed or compacted particles, i.e., in the form of granules. By “granules” is meant particles that are compressed or compacted, such by a pelletizing, extrusion or similar compacting step. Such compression or compacting of the particles is preferred, inasmuch as the intraparticle cohesion of the particles will be enhanced by such compacting or compressing step. The granules may be prepared via any suitable manner. Preferably, the material to be sorbed, if not a liquid, is dissolved or suspended in a liquid and the liquid is applied to the sorbent, followed by compression of the mixture to form granules. In a highly preferred embodiment of the invention, the granules are prepared by pelletizing the sorbent in a pellet mill. The composition may be prepared by sorbing the material into pellets thus formed, or alternatively may be prepared by pelletizing a mixture of the material and the sorbent. In either case, the pellets exiting the pellet mill may be ground or crumbled to thereby reduce the granules of the composition to a desired granule size. The mixture may be pelletized under any suitable conditions. Typically, the ingredients are pre-ground and are introduced into the pellet mill with moisture. Typical moisture content ranges from 2-30%, more preferably 5-15% by total weight of the blend. The blend is pelleted through a die such as a 3/32 in×2 in die at any suitable temperature, preferably a temperature ranging from 150° F. to 220° F., more preferably from 180° F. to 200° F. Final moisture preferably is in the range from 4-20%, more preferably from 7-12% by total weight. After pelleting, the pellets may be cooled and crumbled through dry rollers to reduce the size of the granules (it is also possible to cut the pellets from the die). The final granule size may vary depending on the application. For an application such as mosquito control, the granule size preferably should be between 4 and 30 mesh (U.S. standard test sieve. ASTM E-11 specification) and more preferably should be between 6 and 20 mesh. Fines generated during the pelletizing process may be removed by screening, preferable on a 10-mesh screen to a level of less than 20% by weight and ideally less than 5%. Such fines may be recycled. In the pelletizing operation, use of a lubricity agent such as corn oil may be necessary or helpful. Other lubricants such as added corn oil or oils from soy, peanut, sunflower, rapeseed, canola, coconut, or cotton, or animal fats such as tallow, yellow grease, or white grease, may be used. Other lubricants include lecithin, waxes, fish oils, castor oil, long-chain alkyl sulphonates, alkyl poyglucosides, tall oil, stearates, and silicones. The lubricant (including any oil present in the germ) preferably is present in an amount of up to 30% by total weight of the composition (excluding moisture) more preferably, an amount of 10-15% by weight. Pelletizing is not the only manner of forming suitable granules. For instance, in another embodiment of the invention, extrusion of sorbent through a dye and grinding of the extrudate to a suitable granular size is useful in conjunction with the preparation of the composition. Once again, the extrudate may itself comprise a composition of a sorbent and the material to be sorbed, or the material may be sorbed within granules of extruded sorbent subsequent to extrusion. The granules should be sufficiently cohesive for use for their intended purpose. Especially when the granule is used as a carrier for control agent, the granule must have sufficient integrity to survive the production, transport, and application of the product. If the granule is too durable, however, it will not disintegrate easily, and may not be effective in releasing the control agent in the desired manner, for instance, when the granule is introduced into a water column. In embodiments of the invention where a delayed release of the control agent or other sorbed material is desired, the granules may be made more durable by incorporating additional binder or cohesiveness agent. The binder may comprise an extrudate of corn hulls and sodium hydroxide (as taught is copending application Ser. No. 09/901,342, filed Jul. 9, 2001), lignin, lignosulfate, hemicelluloses, celluloses, water, starch hydrolyzates, hydrogenated starch hydrolyzates, fatty acids, and clay materials such as bentonite and zeolites. In such embodiments, the binder preferably is present in an amount of about 5% by weight of the granule. In some embodiments of the invention, the granules may include a polysaccharide cohesiveness agent to enhance the cohesiveness of the granules. The cohesiveness agent is believed to provide additional hydroxyl groups, which groups enhance the bonding between grain proteins within the sorbent granules. It is further believed that the additional hydroxyl groups so function by enhancing the hydrogen bonding of proteins to starch and to other proteins. When used, the polysaccharide cohesiveness agent may be present in any amount suitable to enhance the cohesiveness of the sorbent granules. Generally, the cohesiveness agent may be present in a dry basis amount ranging up to about 45% by weight of the sorbent granules, preferably, an amount ranging from about 3% to about 35% by weight, more preferably, an amount ranging from about 5% to about 25% by weight. When the binder is or includes virgin germ, some or all of this may come from starch naturally present in the virgin germ In accordance with these embodiments of the invention, any suitable polysaccharide may be used in conjunction with the invention, and thus, for example, the cohesiveness agent may comprise one or more polysaccharides such as dextrin, maltodextrins, starches, flours, cellulosics, hemicellulosics, and the like. Preferably, the cohesiveness agent comprises a starch, and most preferably, the cohesiveness agent comprises a corn starch. When a polysaccharide cohesiveness agent is used, preferably a supplemental cohesiveness agent also is used. In accordance with the invention, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is an ionic species that is believed to enhance protein-protein and/or protein-starch interactions. Any suitable ionic salt may be used in conjunction with the invention. For example, in accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is selected from among the alkali and alkaline-earth salts of common anions, such as the halide, nitrate, nitrite, carbonate, phosphate, sulfate, and bicarbonate salts, and the like. More preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and mixtures thereof. Even more preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is selected from among sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, and mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is sodium chloride. The supplemental cohesiveness agent may be present in any amount sufficient to assist the cohesiveness agent in enhancing the cohesion of the granules. When used, the supplemental cohesiveness agent preferably is present in an amount of at least about 0.05% by dry basis weight, of the composition exclusive of the polysaccharide cohesiveness agent. More preferably, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is present in an amount ranging from about 0.05% to about 10% by weight; more preferably, about 0.1% to about 8% by weight; and most preferably, about 1.5% to about 4% by weight. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the supplemental cohesiveness agent is present in an amount of about 2% by weight of the composition. To prevent or inhibit spoilage, the sorbent composition may include a preservative. Preferably, the sorbent composition includes a mold inhibitor, which may be present in any amount sufficient to inhibit the molding of the sorbent composition. Any suitable mold inhibitor may be employed in conjunction with the invention. The mold inhibitor preferably is selected from among the propionate salts, and most preferably is selected from the group consisting of sodium propionate and calcium propionate. Other preservatives include sodium metabisulfite, citric acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, butylated hydroyxytoluene (BHT) butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and sodium benzoate. When a mold inhibitor is employed, it preferably is present in an amount ranging from about 0.02% to about 3.5% by weight. The mold inhibitor may function to some extent as agent for controlling mold if the composition is introduced into an environment; however, at the levels used herein, the mold inhibitor is intended for the purpose of retarding mold of the sorbent composition itself. The composition may be introduced into an environment via any suitable means. Where it is desired to disseminate the composition over a large area, the composition may be disseminated from an aircraft, such as plane, helicopter, blimp, balloon, or the like, or may be disseminated from a watercraft. Particularly when the control agent is a mosquito adulticide or larvicide, the environment may be a water-containing environment, by which is contemplated any environment containing standing or slowly moving water. For example, the water-containing environment may be a pond, lake, swamp, marsh, bog, area with collected rainwater, (such as a tire) and so forth. It is contemplated that in these or other embodiments of the invention the environment may be an indoor environment. The composition preferably is formulated to release at least a portion of the larvicide within the first two feet of water column. The sorbent composition also may be used to remove a material from an environment. In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, at least a portion of undesired material present in an environment may be removed by introducing a sorbent into the environment, allowing the sorbent to sorb at least a portion of the material, and removing at least a portion of the sorbed composition from the environment. The material which may be removed from the environment is not limited to the materials described herein, but to the contrary it is contemplated that any materials that is sorbable by the sorbent composition may be removed form an environment. For instance, the material may be an oleogenus or lipophilic material, or may be a hydrophilic material. In some embodiments, the material may be a gaseous material, such as ammonia. Generally, the sorbent may be prepared as described hereinabove, and may be introduced into the environment in any suitable manner, for instance, by dispersing the sorbent from an aircraft or watercraft as described above. The sorbent may be introduced into the environment in any amount effective for its intended purpose. The sorbent used in conjunction with the invention is incinerable. It is contemplated that the sorbed material may be a combustible material, and in particular a hydrophilic material such as ethanol or an oleogenous material such as oil. It is contemplated that a combustible material composition so composed may be oxidized, such as by incineration, to thereby generate heat. The heat thus generated may be used in industrial applications or may be used to generate electrical energy. The combustible material composition may include any suitable ratio of sorbent to combustible material. Preferably, the composition includes from 1-75%, by weight combustible material, more preferably, the combustible material is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight, even more preferably, the combustible material is present in an mount from 10-75% by weight. The sorbents useful in conjunction with the invention are biodegradable at 25° C. By “biodegradable” is contemplated that the sorbents are susceptible to degradation via microbial influence or other breakdown of the biological structure of the sorbent, such as by thermal or internal chemical or biochemical influence. It is further contemplated that the sorbent will be biodegradable over a wide range of other temperatures. When the sorbent is used to introduce a material into an environment, in particular an outdoor environment, the sorbent preferably is biodegradable in the environment. Such biodegradability prevents long-term contamination of the environment of the sorbent, and, in some embodiments, may effect a delayed release of the sorbed material into the environment. In embodiments of the invention where the sorbent is used to remove material from an environment, the sorbent may be allowed to biodegrade after removal of the sorbed unwanted material but before final disposal of the sorbed material compositions. The biodegradation of the sorbent will in some instances reduce the volume of the sorbed material composition, thereby reducing the disposal costs (particularly in the case of a hazardous material). The sorbed material may be stored until the volume of the material has been reduced by a desired amount preferably at least 10%, more preferably 15%, and even more preferably 20% of the original volume. The following Examples illustrate the invention, but should not be construed as limiting the invention in scope."
8813370,Trigger-operated portable electric tool,2009-08-19,0,1,"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED U.S. APPLICATIONS Not applicable. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not applicable. NAMES OF PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT Not applicable. REFERENCE TO AN APPENDIX SUBMITTED ON COMPACT DISC Not applicable. 1. Field of the Invention The present invention applies to trigger-operated portable electric tools. More specifically, it concerns the field of portable electric tools that are controlled during use by a trigger activated by at least one finger of the hand holding said tools. By pressing on this trigger, a command is given to an actuator (often consisting of an electric motor) to activate the element or moving active elements of the tool in a given direction; by letting go of said trigger, a command is given to the actuator either to stop (for tools operating in a single direction) or to activate the element or moving active elements of the tool in the opposite direction (for tools operating in two directions). 2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98. Motorized pruning shears, especially electric and electronic pruning shears, are examples of contemporary tools having a bidirectional control trigger (opening and closing the cutting elements). The applications of the invention described below apply especially to electronic pruning shears, but it is important to note that the invention can also be applied to other types of motorized pruning shears and to other types of trigger-operated tools, such as shears, drills, grinders, planes, and so on. In their most advanced versions, such tools are provided, in addition to their principal function, with at least one additional function. This second function consists of, for example, in the ability to maintain an intermediary speed or position, or to reverse the direction of the motor, or to place the tool on standby. This second function is controlled by the addition of a control device distinct and separate from the trigger, such as a pushbutton, a switch, and so on, positioned on the body of the tool, this device being intended to be activated by a finger other than the one that acts on said trigger. However, this situation has the disadvantage of being uncomfortable for the user when operating the tool, for the user must either employ two fingers from one hand at the same time or, if the distance between these two control elements is too great, use his other hand, which results in a loss of time. For example, many pruning shear models, in addition to the function of opening and closing the cutting elements controlled by a trigger activated by the user's finger, are equipped with a second function performed by an electrical or electronic system that can be used to arrest the rotation of the moving blade in a predetermined position intermediate between the closed position and the fully open position, thereby providing the ability to limit the opening of the blades, which is desirable in certain situations, for example, when cutting kindling wood, or when pruning, in order to save time and energy. This second function is controlled by a switch that is independent of the control trigger and must be activated by a finger other than the one used to activate said control trigger, and this must occur each time the operator wishes to go from the “fully open” position to the “intermediate” position and vice versa. The transition from one position to another being frequent due to the varying thicknesses of wood being cut on the same plant, it is easy to imagine the inconvenience and loss of time occasioned by such a device. An object of the invention is to correct the aforementioned drawbacks and inadequacies of portable electric tools, especially electric pruning shears. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invention, this objective is achieved by means of a portable electric tool configured to fulfill a primary function notable in that it has a double trigger having, on the one hand, a main actuator-control trigger effecting the movements of at least one moving active element of said tool and, on the other hand, an auxiliary, or secondary, trigger connected to said main trigger by means of an articulation and arranged so as to form a reentrant angle with said main trigger, wherein pivoting said auxiliary trigger activates control means of a system designed to fulfill at least one supplementary function of said tool. It is apparent that this double-trigger device can be used to control several tool functions with a single finger, which provides comfort and saves time. According to a preferred embodiment applicable to portable electric tools comprising a cutting head having at least one moving blade whose movements are controlled by an electronic control card, this latter is configured to control the complete opening of the “fully opened” blades or the stable positioning of said moving blade(s) in a partly opened “intermediate” position, and the auxiliary trigger can be used to act upon a complementary control means of said actuator via said electronic control card. By means of this arrangement, the blades of cutting tools such as electronic pruning shears can be stably positioned in a partly open “intermediate” position that allows for better adaptation of the opening of the cutting blades to the diameter of the wood (branches, vine shoots, etc.) being cut, which results in significant savings of energy and time, together with improved ease of use and greater precision. It is possible to proceed instantaneously from a predetermined partly open “intermediate” position to the “fully open” position and vice versa. The width of the intermediate angle of opening can be adjustable. According to a highly preferred embodiment, a sensor, preferably having a Hall-effect or magnetoresistive sensor, is fixedly arranged on the body of the tool, and the free end of the auxiliary trigger is equipped with a permanent magnet capable of being brought in proximity with said sensor or away from it. By means of this embodiment of the supplementary actuator control means, the auxiliary trigger of the double trigger does not make contact with any mechanical element. Therefore, there is no mechanical wear of this control means, which provides longer operating life for the latter over time."
8851447,Integrated control circuitry and coil assembly for irrigation control,2009-07-27,0,4,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation control devices and more specifically to multi-wire irrigation control systems including remote devices coupled to a multi-wire path and for coupling to actuator coil-controlled irrigation equipment. 2. Discussion of the Related Art In decoder-based irrigation control systems, an irrigation controller sends signaling along a wire path to which one or more decoder devices are attached. Each decoder device monitors transmissions on the wire path and decodes this signaling to determine when to cause irrigation devices coupled thereto to be activated and deactivated. The decoder module typically includes circuitry formed on a printed circuit board located within a housing. Wiring from the decoder module housing must be coupled to the wiring of the wire path as well as coupled to one or more actuator devices each controlling the opening and closing of an irrigation rotor or valve. In one form, the rotor or valve is operated by a solenoid coil as is well known in the art. Likewise, during installation, the operator must provide and electrically connect two separate devices, a decoder module and an actuator coil module, to each other and to the control wire path. FIG. 1 illustrates a separate decoder module 102 and a coil unit 104 that are conventionally coupled together. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 2 , for a solenoid activated rotor assembly 200 , the coil module 104 is coupled (in part by a bracket 212 and retainer 214 ) to the parts of a selector valve assembly 202 (including a pressure regulator) attached to a casing assembly 204 . The electrical wire inputs to the coil module 104 are then connected to the electrical wire outputs from the decoder module 102 , while the electrical wire inputs to the decoder module 102 are coupled to the control wire path from the irrigation controller. Thus, a typical installation requires the connection of six wires to install the decoder module 102 and a coil module 104 . As is well known, in operation, a portion of a plunger (not shown) of the selector valve assembly 202 is disposed within the coil unit 104 while another portion is seated against a solenoid plunge port (not shown) within the selector valve assembly 202 in a normally closed position. In this position, high pressure water flow from a main water control valve (not shown) located within a main control valve portion 206 of the device is flowed up high pressure water line 208 into the selector valve assembly 202 and its regulator and is prevented from further movement by the normally closed position of the plunger against the solenoid port in the selector valve assembly 202 . This results in a back pressure that causes the main water control valve to close. In response to signals from the decoder module 102 , the coil module 104 causes the actuation of the plunger to move it off of (or unseat from) the solenoid plunge port allowing the high pressure flow in the high pressure line 208 to flow through the selector valve assembly 202 (and its pressure regulator), which relieves the back pressure and allows water to flow through the main control valve and to a pop-up sprinkler device, i.e., the main water control valve is opened. The pop-up sprinkler device is located within the casing assembly 204 and extends upwardly due to the water pressure through a top portion of the casing assembly 204 . The high pressure flow exits the selector valve assembly 202 down through a discharge flow line 210 which terminates within the casing assembly 204 at a location downstream of the main water control valve. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Several embodiments of the invention provide an integrated valve actuator coil and control module for use in irrigation control systems. In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device comprising: a coil adapted to develop an electromagnetic flux sufficient to cause actuation of irrigation equipment; control circuitry to receive a control signals from an irrigation control unit and electrically coupled to the coil to control the flux at the coil; and a housing covering at least a portion of the coil and at least a portion of the control circuitry. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method of making an irrigation control device comprising: holding a solenoid assembly with a coil near to control circuitry having circuitry for controlling an electromagnetic flux at the coil; electrically connecting the coil to the control circuitry; placing the solenoid assembly and control circuitry into a housing; securing the solenoid assembly to the housing so that the solenoid assembly is actuated to reciprocate a valve member through an aperture in the housing to selectively engage a valve seat external to the housing; and fixing the control circuitry and coil within the housing."
4521239,Coating agent for particulate materials,1982-11-29,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of providing particulate materials with a protective coating. More particularly, the invention relates to the coating of particulate fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate with the reaction product of an amine and a siloxane. 2. Description of the Prior Art In the past diatomaceous earth (DE) and treated clays have been used as a coating/conditioning agent for particulate fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate. However, for several reasons, diatomaceous earth is becoming increasingly unacceptable as a protective coating material for fertilizers. One reason is that the quality of diatomaceous earth, per se, has been declining as the better grades of the earth have been removed by mining. The inferior grades of DE have resulted in coatings which do not meet the stringent physical and chemical requirements for acceptable DE coatings. Storage and handling problems have resulted because of the inferior grades of DE which are being used. Another disadvantage of using diatomaceous earth and clays is that there is always the undesirable problem of dust generation in the handling of diatomaceous earth since it is a relatively dry, small particle size solid. Usually, from about 1-1.5% by weight of DE is coated on ammonium nitrate particles. Not all of the DE, however, adheres to the fertilizer particles. This fact results in serious problems for ammonium nitrate manufacturing plants which are the likes of additional equipment maintenance, extra clean-up costs and the like. Moreover, there are serious customer handling problems involved with DE coated ammonium nitrate. Yet another problem with diatomaceous earth is that the costs of agricultural grade diatomaceous earth have sharply increased over the past few years as the available supplies have decreased as a result of the diversion of supplies to other markets. Because diatomaceous earth suppliers no longer need the agricultural market as a consumer of their product, ammonium nitrate producers are placed in an increasingly more vulnerable and expensive position. A need, therefore, exists for a satisfactory replacement for diatomaceous earth as a fertilizer coating agent. Various types of fertilizers have been coated with different materials in the past to produce a product of improved stability. Urea is usually coated with kaolin clay or is treated with formaldehyde to alleviate caking. However, kaolin, because of its very small particle size, is dusty. On the other hand, formaldehyde treatment of urea does not yield a completely satisfactory product. Phosphate based fertilizers such as ammonium phosphate, superphosphate, homogeneous N-P-K fertilizers and the like, which when dried to very low water contents to reduce their caking tendencies, become quite dusty when handled. Fuel oil is frequently used as a surface coating material in order to suppress dust generation. While fuel oil exhibits some dust suppressing activity, it is not fully effective in this role, and is not a good use for an energy yielding substance. Organic materials have been used in the past as coating materials for particulate fertilizers. Thus, Choi in U.S. Pat. No. 4,259,102 discloses a heterocyclic polymer which can be used as a fertilizer coating agent. Iwao, U.S. Pat. No. 3,660,070, shows the use of high molecular weight polymers of the vinyl and acrylate type as a coating agent. U.S. Pat. No. 3,388,990 provides a very similar type of disclosure. Passmore, U.S. Pat. No. 3,544,297, shows polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and polyacrylonitrile as coating materials. Haruhiro, U.S. Pat. No. 3,475,154 discloses fertilizer particles coated with a multi-layered coating of a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin in order to provide a low water-soluble fertilizer. None of the above-discussed references provide any disclosure of either of the ingredients used in the coating agent of the present invention. Hansen in U.S. Pat. No. 3,223,518 discloses a technique of providing a slow-release fertilizer by providing a particulate fertilizer substrate with a multi-layer coating, the outer layer being of a hydrophobic material. The reference further discloses the use of a primer coating which may be any substance selected from an extremely broad group of organic compounds. Hansen also describes that a major characteristic of the fertilizer product is its water durability which is characterized by solids which remain in the shell-like water-insoluble exterior coatings. Any fertilizer product which does not exhibit this characteristic, which includes the product of the present invention, presumably is outside the scope of the reference. Moreover, the fertilizer product of the present invention is not a slow-release multi-layer coated product having a hydrophobic exterior coating. Still further, the product of the reference possesses a large amount of coating material, i.e., about 7% by weight, while the amount of coating material applied to the present product is in most cases less than 0.1% by weight. Bradley in U.S. Pat. No. 3,951,638, discloses a prilling process which at one point uses an organosilicon compound to prevent dust pick-up by fertilizer particles. Accordingly, the reference does not show the coating of fertilizer particles with an organic material. Assuming that the dust is an inert material, the organic material would seem to serve as a moisture barrier, which is a teaching contrary to the present invention. Hijfte in U.S. Pat. No. 4,150,965 discloses the use of an alkylamine-mineral oil combination as a coating agent for ammonium nitrate fertilizer. The reference discloses a three-step coating process, while the present process is usually a one-step coating procedure. In the reference process an ammonium nitrate containing fertilizer is treated with the alkylamine while relatively hot, i.e., at least 5.degree. C. above the melting point of the amine or mixture containing the amine. In fact, the reference discloses that prills at 50.degree. C. cannot be coated satisfactorily, while in the present invention, on the other hand, superior coatings for ammonium nitrate can be achieved at temperatures less than 38.degree. C. Another disclosure in the reference which is contrary to the present invention is that unadulterated alkylamine must be added to the fertilizer in the first process step. That is, the amine cannot be premixed with another compound if acceptable results are to be obtained. In the present process, an amine is, in fact, premixed with another reagent, i.e., a silicone fluid, before application to the fertilizer particles. Another difference between the reference disclosure and the present invention is that the reference does not disclose the coating procedure to be effective on fertilizers which do not contain a diluent. The working examples of the reference disclose fertilizers which contain a diluent. A need, therefore, continues to exist for a technique of providing particulate fertilizers, particularly ammonium nitrate, with an improved coating material. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a protective coating for fertilizer particles which suppresses dusting, minimizes caking of the fertilizer particles and prill breakdown and makes handling of particulate fertilizer much easier. Briefly, this object and other objects of the present invention as hereinafter will become more readily apparent can be attained by a particulate substrate provided with a protective coating of the reaction product of at least one amine compound and a siloxane. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the particulate substrate is prilled ammonium nitrate fertilizer."
8065834,Two piece plant container with water reservoir,2010-02-26,0,1,"This invention concerns plant containers and more particularly plant containers which have a built-in water reservoir to reduce the need for frequent watering. Municipalities commonly maintain large numbers container plantings hanging from light poles, etc., for decorative effect, and a need for frequent watering presents a substantial burden on city resources. There have heretofore been developed containers with a built-in water reservoir which is situated to allow the planting to draw water from the reservoir in addition to the moisture in the soil in which the plant is growing. In such large scale deployment of containers, it is common to frequently switch plantings for achieving seasonal displays or to rotate out plantings which are not doing well in favor of more healthy specimens. Such practice also entails considerable labor particularly when large plants and containers are involved. In the practice of including a water reservoir defined within the container, it is important to prevent excessive water from being wicked into the soil mass as this will cause waterlogging of the soil which will cause the roots to die from disease and lack of air. If the reservoir were overfilled, this will result may occur. It is an object of the present invention to provide a plant container which includes a water reservoir which is isolated from the soil to prevent saturation of the soil, but is spaced only a very short distance therefrom so as to allow growth of roots into the reservoir space. It is another object to provide a two part container which allows easy removal of the inner container holding the soil and planting, as well as convenient lifting and handling of the outer container part. It is yet another object to provide a two part container which is sturdy enough to hold heavy plantings and which has contours which are easily molded from plastic. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The above recited objects and other objects which will be understood by those with knowledge of this art are achieved by a two part container of molded plastic, an outer tub part having a bottom region defining a reservoir space and which receives an inner holder part nested within an upper region of the outer part and which holds the soil and planting. The side wall of the outer tub part has a plurality of inwardly projecting steps formed about the perimeter defining horizontal support surfaces arranged about its interior on which a bottom wall of the inner part rests, located just above the water reservoir. At least one of the support surfaces has a localized depressed space communicating with the reservoir space such that water can flow beneath an inner part bottom wall even while resting on the step surfaces to a drain hole in the bottom of the depressed space. The drain hole establishes a maximum level of water in the reservoir space. The bottom of the inner container has a pattern of openings in a major area of its bottom wall which is located just above the maximum water level in the reservoir to allow the planting roots to quickly grow into the water in the reservoir through the openings to allow water to be absorbed by the plant in addition to moisture in the soil being absorbed without danger of waterlogging the soil by a wicking action. The planting can be thoroughly watered by pouring water into the soil mass with any excess draining into the reservoir space until the water overflows but through the drain hole with such outflow indicating to the person watering the plant that the reservoir space is filled to the maximum so that watering can be stopped. Further drainage from the soil will also flow out through the drainage hole. In order to provide a sturdy bottom wall easily capable of supporting the weight of the soil and plantings in the inner part, a series of radial ribs converging into a center connection are molded therein to stiffen the bottom wall. These ribs may continue up the side wall for large containers such that the inner container is sturdy enough to support the soil and plant independently of the outer tub part. The perimeter wall of the inner part of the container is radially indented at locations on either side thereof and open at the top to create hand grip features enabling the fingers of each hand and to be inserted therein and to be wrapped around undersurfaces, providing convenient handholds allowing easy gripping and lifting out of the inner container part from the outer part. The steps formed into the perimeter of the outer tub part also provide handholds for lifting both parts. A removable plug in a drain hole in the bottom of the reservoir allows substantially complete draining when both parts of the container is to be removed."
5665822,Thermoplastic Elastomers,1993-04-14,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to thermoplastic elastomers. 2. Introduction to the Invention Thermoplastic elastomers, which are often referred to as TPE's, are well known. The TPE's in general use contain (i) polymeric blocks (usually referred to as """"hard"""" blocks or A blocks) which (a) are amorphous and have a second order transition point, T.sub.gh, which is well above room temperature, or (b) have a crystalline polymer backbone and have a crystalline melting point, T.sub.mh, which is well above room temperature, and (ii) amorphous polymeric blocks (usually referred to as """"soft"""" blocks or B blocks) which have a glass transition point, T.sub.gs, which is well below room temperature. Each soft block is linked to at least two hard blocks, so that at temperatures between T.sub.gs and T.sub.mh, or T.sub.gs and T.sub.gh, the amorphous B blocks are tied together, resulting in elastomeric behavior. Above T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh, melting or softening of the hard blocks permits viscous flow of the polymeric chains, resulting in thermoplastic behavior. Known TPE's are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,260,659 (Gobran), 4,361,526 (Allen), 4,483,978 (Manser), 4,551,388 (Schlademan), 4,554,324 (Husman), 4,656,213 (Schladman), 4,764,586 (Manser), 4,778,852 (Futamura), 4,806,613 (Wardle), 4,919,737 (Biddle et al.), 4,952,644 (Wardle et al.), and 4,976,794 (Biddle et al.) and in the articles in Polymer, 29 (7), 1233-1239 (1988) Kallitsis et al.; J. Appl. Poly. Sci 37 (1), 267-281 (1989) Murphy et al.; J. Poly. Sci, Part A, Poly Chem, 28 (9) 2393-2401 (1990) Talukder et al.; Makromol Chem, 190, 1069-1078 (1989) Khan et al., 191, 603-614, 615-624, and 2341-2354 (1990) Fakirov et al., and 191 2355-2365 (1990) Gogeva; and Macromolecules 18 (2), 123-127 (1985) Miyamoto et al., and 23,333-337 (1990) Chow. The disclosure of each of those patents and articles is incorporated herein by reference. It has also been proposed in the patent literature to use, as components in temperature-sensitive dispensers for pesticides, disinfectants, drugs and other active agents, block copolymers containing a side chain crystallizable (SCC) polymer and a second polymer which exhibits a glass transition or melting point higher than the SCC polymer, such that the entire mass exhibits mechanical stability above the melting point of the SCC polymer but below the transition of the second polymer. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,830,855 (Stewart), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The block copolymer undergoes a rapid change in permeability to the active agent in the region of the melting point of the SCC polymer, and the second polymer ensures that the SCC polymer remains immobilized even if its melting point is reached or exceeded. This invention relates to TPE's which comprise A blocks, or B blocks, is or both A blocks and B blocks, which are crystalline and in which at least a part of the crystallinity results from the presence of crystallizable side chains. Such crystalline blocks are referred to herein as SCC blocks. TPE's containing SCC A blocks are novel and as such form part of the present invention. The invention also includes processes, compositions, shaped articles and assemblies which make use of TPE's containing SCC A blocks. TPE's containing SCC B blocks and non-SCC A blocks are not novel as a class, but this invention includes a wide range of novel processes, compositions, shaped articles and assemblies which make use of such TPE's. TPE's Containing SCC A Blocks TPE's containing SCC A blocks have the advantage that they can exhibit a much more rapid change in viscosity in the region of the crystalline melting point of the side chains in the TPE (referred to herein as T.sub.q) than is exhibited by known TPE's in the region of T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh. This rapid change in viscosity results in a number of important advantages. One advantage is that the novel TPE's can be melt processed at temperatures not far above T.sub.q, e.g. below about (T.sub.q +10).degree. C., whereas known TPE's are typically melt processed at temperatures at least 40.degree. C. above T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh. Known TPE's are typically melt processed at temperatures above 100.degree. C., whereas the preferred TPE's of the invention can be melt processed at temperatures below 100.degree. C., for example below 75.degree. C. and even below 50.degree. C. This is particularly useful when the TPE is preferably or necessarily maintained at a temperature below a critical limit (referred to herein as T.sub.crit). Such conditions arise for example when the TPE is associated with (e.g. is contained within, surrounds, forms a layer on, or is mixed with) a thermally responsive substance which may undergo, at a temperature above T.sub.crit, a change which is undesirable during such processing. The substance may be for example in the form of (i) solid particles dispersed within the TPE, e.g. particles of an explosive solid, or a pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical, or (ii) a substrate which is contacted by the TPE, e.g. a vessel in a living animal into which the TPE has been injected or otherwise placed, or (iii) a solid or a liquid which is encapsulated by the TPE. Another advantage is that the novel TPE's can be used as carriers (including encapsulants) for substances which are at least partially protected by the TPE at temperatures substantially below and approaching T.sub.q. The protection may be against physical attack and/or against chemical attack. The hard blocks in the TPE will begin to melt at a temperature T.sub.o which is somewhat below T.sub.q, e.g. 3.degree.-12.degree. C. below T.sub.q. As the temperature is increased from T.sub.o to T.sub.q, there is a rapid change in the protection provided by the TPE, and above T.sub.q the substance may be released entirely from the TPE. For example, a mixture of the TPE and an agricultural chemical can be applied during a cold season of the year while the ambient temperature is below T.sub.q and the chemical will be released when the ambient temperature exceeds T.sub.q. Similarly a seed can be coated with a TPE and will not germinate until the ambient temperature approaches or exceeds T.sub.q. Another very important advantage of the novel TPE's containing SCC A blocks is that the value of T.sub.q can be closely controlled through selection of the crystallizable moieties in the side chains. Thus, for a given crystallizable moiety, T.sub.q is mainly dependent on the length of the crystallizable moiety, and changes by at most a few .degree. C., e.g. less than 5.degree. C., with changes in the molecular weight of the A block. In the known TPE's, by contrast, T.sub.mh or T.sub.gh changes substantially with changes in the molecular weight of the A block, because the melting point is dependent on folding of the main chain. In the TPE's containing SCC A blocks, it is possible to change the physical properties of the TPE, e.g. the elongation, modulus and tensile strength, without substantially changing T.sub.q, by changing the molecular weight of the TPE and/or the molecular weight of the A blocks and/or the relative mounts of the A and B blocks. The TPE's containing SCC A blocks also show a relatively small difference between T.sub.q (the endotherm melt peak on a DSC curve as the TPE is heated) and the crystallization peak on a DSC curve as the molten TPE is cooled. Another very important advantage of the novel TPE's containing SCC hard (A) blocks is that the presence of the SCC A blocks results in improved shear strength. Furthermore their shear strength can be yet further improved by incorporation therein of a relatively low molecular weight and low melting crystalline additive, particularly an SCC polymer. The crystalline additive must be intimately mixed with the TPE, preferably through a melt mixing process or a process which comprises mixing the TPE and the additive in a common solvent. Particularly good results are obtained when the SCC blocks in the TPE and in the additive are structurally similar, and it appears that the improved shear strength results from co-crystallization of the additive and the SCC blocks. Thus a preferred combination is a TPE containing SCC blocks comprising polyethylene or poly (substituted methylene) groups and an SCC additive comprising polymethylene or poly (substituted methylene) groups. Suitable crystalline additives include those disclosed in the Schmitt et al. Application No. 07/928,800, U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,035, incorporated by reference herein. The advantages noted above make the novel TPE's with SCC hard blocks, and mixtures thereof with crystalline additives, particularly suitable for us as pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA's) and as hot melt adhesives. The TPE, or mixture thereof with a crystalline additive, can be the sole polymeric ingredient(s) of the adhesive, or can be mixed with other polymeric ingredients. For example, a conventional PSA can be modified by addition of the TPE or mixture of TPE and additive. The adhesive preferably contains 25 to 100%, particularly 75 to 100% of the TPE, and 0 to 50%, preferably 1 to 40%, of the additive. PSA's for use in the medical field for attachment to human skin preferably contain 20 to 35% of the additive. PSA's for use in other fields preferably contain less than 15%, e.g. 1 to 5%, of the additive. The adhesive can also contain additives such as tackifiers, plasticizers, fillers, stabilizers and pigments. PSA's which contain the crystalline additive have the valuable property that they have reduced adhesive strength when heated to temperatures approaching or above the crystalline melting point of the additive, as discussed in Schmitt et al. Application No. 07/928,800, U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,035. The novel TPE's containing SCC hard blocks can also contain SCC soft blocks. We have found that such TPE's, in addition to the advantages noted above for TPE's containing SCC hard blocks, are particularly useful in the form of films and other shaped articles which are heat-sealed to other polymeric articles. The TPE will undergo a rapid change in its physical properties, including its permeability to at least some gases and vapors, e.g. O.sub.2, CO.sub.2 and water vapor, in the region of T.sub.ms, but will retain substantial strength until heated to a temperature in the region of T.sub.q, when it will again undergo a rapid change in its physical properties, including its heat sealability. The repeating units of the different SCC blocks can be selected to provide a change in permeability (or other property) over a desired temperature range, and to provide a hard block which, above T.sub.mh, will be compatible with the other polymeric material to which the TPE is to be heat sealed. In this way, it is possible to make a TPE which is sufficiently flexible at 0.degree. C., which undergoes a marked change in permeability in the range of 0.degree. C. to 40.degree. C., which retains adequate physical strength at temperatures up to T.sub.q (or close to it) and which can be melt extruded and heat sealed at temperatures not far above T.sub.q, e.g. 60.degree. to 100.degree. C. If desired, the physical strength of the TPE can be improved by crosslinking, but this is not generally necessary. Such a TPE can be particularly useful as a packaging material, e.g. for actively respiring biological material, as disclosed in the Stewart Application No. 885,915 incorporated by reference herein. TPE's Containing SCC B Blocks and Non-SCC A Blocks We have found that SCC soft (B) blocks can confer important and previously unrealized benefits on TPE's containing them, making it possible to use such TPE's in ways which are novel and surprisingly valuable, even when the A blocks are not SCC blocks and the TPE is in itself known for use in other ways. For example, such TPE's can be used to provide pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA's) with very valuable properties, to provide films and other shaped articles which can be heat-sealed to other articles, and to provide hot melt adhesives. Summary of Various Aspects of the Invention First Aspect--Novel TPE In a first aspect, this invention provides novel TPE's containing SCC hard (A) blocks. These novel TPE's preferably comprise polymeric molecules which comprise (i) polymeric A blocks which (a) are crystalline and have a melting point T.sub.q, and (b) wherein at least one of the A blocks comprises a side chain comprising crystallizable moieties which render the block crystalline; and (ii) at least one polymeric B block which is linked to at least two A blocks and which (a) is crystalline and has a melting point T.sub.ms which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C., or (b) is amorphous and has a glass transition point T.sub.gs which is less than (T.sub.q -10).degree. C. Second Aspect--Processes for Preparing the Novel TPE's Any process can be employed to make the novel TPE's of the present invention.

5788450,Narrow self-propelled transportation apparatus,1996-07-05,0,1,"This invention relates to machinery for use by arborists in lifting and transporting tree debris from pruning and removal operations around homes and office buildings. There are many prior art large machines that are used in the logging industry to fell, delimb, cut, load and remove cut trees from wooded areas. However, for the professional arborists usually problems are encountered due to congested areas, like city homes, lawns, drives, walks, fences and narrow gates.

7422682,"Compositions, devices, and methods for use in environmental remediation",2005-06-28,0,1,"FIELD OF THE ART The field of art disclosed herein pertains to compositions, devices, and methods suited for a variety of applications in environmental remediation. BACKGROUND The uses of structural barriers for a variety of applications in environmental remediation are generally well described. Several types of environmental remediation barriers (ERBs) are used in earth and hydraulic engineering, such exemplary structures including fiber rolls, mats, blankets, and berms. Originally, major applications of ERBs included erosion and sedimentation control, revegetation, and revetment. More recently, the potential for such structures to serve additionally in the capacity of removal of natural and manmade pollutants from residential, industrial, and agricultural sources, and remediation of eutrification has been described. As the name of one type of ERB, fiber roll, suggests, ERBs packed into a covering, such as a netted material, may be filled with fibers; typically a single natural fiber such as abaca, hemp, jute, flax, sisal, coir, or straw materials. For a major application of fiber-filled ERBs in erosion and sediment control, the purpose of the fiber filling is primarily structural. In that regard, though the natural fibers described are capable of absorbing water, one necessary attribute of the fiber filler has been to provide an effective porosity once packed that allows for the ready passage of water, while promoting the retention of mud, sediment, gravel, and the like. Other desirable attributes of natural fibers used in ERBs include ready availability in high volume and low cost, requirement to be germ, insect and weed free, free of chemical pollutants, ability to degrade after use; thereby obviating creation of harmful waste, and ease of processing into targeted devices. Materials in addition to natural fibers have been suggested as supplemental constituents in ERBs. Particularly, vegetative matter, as well as nutrients and fertilizers for revegetation and revetment have been described. Materials that have been suggested include saw dust, wood chips, bark, compost, flocculants, water absorbents, and pesticides. A major objective in the field has been to establish environmental remediation practices that are consistent with good practices for environmental protection in general. In that regard, the reuse of natural materials, such as saw dust, wood chips, bark, and compost, that would otherwise go to waste has been a motive for creating fillings for ERBs. Especially in consideration of the use of ERBs in functions where the filling has a requirement that is more than structural; moreover where the filling must perform additional multiple functions, such as clarification of runoff water and removal of pollutants, the targeted and judicious selection of materials tailored for such multifunctional use throughout the lifetime of the ERBs still remains a challenge. Accordingly, a need exists for more effective compositions of materials that are multifunctional for a variety of environmental remediation needs, and for a range of ERBs utilizing such compositions and their use."
7997826,Roller assembly,2009-05-01,0,1,"This invention relates to an improved roller assembly which may be used as a drive roller or idler roller in machines or vehicles incorporating rolling apparatus for rolling of turf or grass surfaces inclusive of golf greens and bowling greens. However this is not the only application of the roller assembly of the invention which could be employed in relation to rolling of snowfields, road surfaces during preparation of roads and rolling of other uneven surfaces such as sand. One conventional rolling apparatus is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 which has a mobile main frame and at least a pair of undercarriages attached to the main frame in side by side relationship wherein each undercarriage has one or more smoothing rollers and there is further provided a control arm or plate pivotally attached to the main frame about a horizontal axis wherein each undercarriage is pivotally attached to the control arm or plate. There was further provided a transmission interconnecting each undercarriage to an operating lever or joystick wherein actuation of the operating lever or joystick causes reciprocatable pivotal movement of each undercarriage such that in use the or each smoothing roller closely follows ground contours. It is important in rolling of golf greens or bowling greens that smoothing or idler rollers as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 closely follow ground contours. If such is not the case the smoothing rollers may leave indentation lines or unsightly marks on the greens and this was detrimental to achievement of a smooth and even grass surface. Another problem of using smoothing rollers that did not closely follow ground contours was that surface corrugations in the greens still remained after repeated roller operations. However while this objective was achieved in U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 by the use of pivotal movement of each undercarriage to closely follow surface undulations or corrugations it will be appreciated that U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,903 still incorporated a conventional drive roller shaft which was provided with a pair of stub axles at each end thereof which were attached to mounting plates rigidly attached to the chassis of the rolling apparatus. Each stub axle was also mounted in bearing carriers carrying bearings for each stub axle so as to enable the drive roller to rotate relative to the chassis. Another conventional arrangement was that the drive roller was rigidly mounted to a support shaft which extended through each end of the drive roller thereby providing the pair of stub axles. However these conventional drive roller mounting arrangements had disadvantages in that (i) on uneven ground there was created greater ground pressure resulting in an uneven surface finish due to lines, marks or impressions left on the ground surface after passage of the drive roller. Other disadvantages were (ii) that the drive roller had reduced width compared to each smoothing roller, (iii) that there was less driving friction on the ground than desired which created loss of traction in certain driving conditions and situations, especially on increased slopes or wet turf and (iv) the drive roller was rigidly mounted to a support shaft which meant that the style of roller to be employed was limited being relatively short which was not adapted to follow ground contours. It was also to be appreciated that in relation to each of the smoothing rollers in order to achieve an objective of each smoothing roller closely following ground contours it was necessary to mount a plurality of smoothing rollers in undercarriages as described above and this procedure was relatively complicated although it operated in a perfectly satisfactory manner. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It therefore is an object of the invention to provide a roller assembly that is adapted to follow ground contours during operation. The roller assembly of the invention includes in a first embodiment a pair of roller components having respective inner ends connected to each other by a flexible and movable primary coupling and having their respective outer ends connected to a support shaft which extends through a hollow interior of each driven roller component by a secondary coupling. In a second embodiment there may be one or more intermediate or floating roller components located between the pair of roller components, which may constitute end roller components. In this embodiment each of the end roller components are connected at their respective outer ends to the support shaft which extends through a hollow interior of each end roller component and each intermediate or floating roller component by the secondary coupling. However each of the inner ends of the end roller components are connected to an adjacent end of an adjoining intermediate or floating roller component by the flexible and movable primary coupling. In the case where there are more than one intermediate floating roller components, adjacent ends of each intermediate or floating roller components are connected to each other by additional flexible and movable primary couplings. The flexible and movable primary coupling may comprise a disc or sleeve made from natural rubber, synthetic rubber or other form of flexible or elastomeric material. In one arrangement the flexible disc may have a plurality of holes to enhance flexibility or in another arrangement may have a relatively large central aperture to enhance flexibility. Preferably the flexible disc has a peripheral flange defining a pair of adjacent shoulders for supporting an adjacent end of a roller component. In the case of the first or second embodiment the primary coupling may be provided with a plurality of spigots or sockets which engage with corresponding sockets or spigots of an adjacent end of an end or driven roller component. In the case of adjacent ends of intermediate or floating roller components each of these may be interconnected by a primary coupling having spigots or sockets engaging with corresponding sockets or spigots of each adjacent end of the intermediate or floating roller component."

When R 12 is OH, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole-4-amine 2-3 may be converted to 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole-4-amide 3-2 in the presence of a coupling reagent, such as 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), and a base, such as N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), in a polar aprotic solvent, such as CH 2 Cl 2 . When R 12 is Cl, 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole-4-amine 2-3 may be converted to 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole-4-amide 3-2 in the presence of a base, such as diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and/or DMAP, and an aprotic solvent, such as CH 2 Cl 2 or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). In other embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula 4-1 may be prepared as shown in Scheme 4. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole-4-amide of formula 3-2 may be treated directly with a thionating agent (i.e., source of sulfur), such as Lawesson's reagent, in an aprotic solvent, such as CH 2 Cl 2 or toluene, under either conventional heating or microwave irradiation at a temperature from about 60° C. to about 150° C. to provide 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole-4-thioamide of formula 4-1. In further embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula 5-2 may be prepared as shown in Scheme 5. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole sulfide of formula 5-1 may be treated with about one or more equivalents of an oxidant, such as sodium perborate tetrahydrate, in a polar protic solvent, such as glacial AcOH, to give 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole sulfoxide or 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole sulfone of formula 5-2, where n is 1 and/or 2, respectively. Alternatively, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole sulfide 5-1 may be treated with about one or more equivalents of an oxidant, such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and a protic solvent, such as methanol (MeOH), to give the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone of formula 5-2, where n is 1 and/or 2, respectively. Pesticidally Acceptable Acid Addition Salts, Salt Derivatives, Solvates, Ester Derivatives, Polymorphs, Isotopes, Radionuclides and Stereoisomers In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be formulated into pesticidally acceptable acid addition salts. By way of a non-limiting example, an amine function can form salts with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, benzoic, citric, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, oxalic, succinic, tartaric, lactic, gluconic, ascorbic, maleic, aspartic, benzenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, hydroxymethanesulfonic, hydroxyethanesulfonic, and trifluoroacetic acids. Additionally, by way of a non-limiting example, an acid function can form salts including those derived from alkali or alkaline earth metals and those derived from ammonia and amines. Examples of preferred cations include sodium, potassium, and magnesium. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be formulated into salt derivatives. By way of a non-limiting example, a salt derivative can be prepared by contacting a free base with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt. A free base may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium carbonate, ammonia, and sodium bicarbonate. As an example, in many cases, a pesticide, such as 2,4-D, is made more water-soluble by converting it to its dimethylamine salt. In further embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be formulated into stable complexes with a solvent, such that the complex remains intact after the non-complexed solvent is removed. These complexes are often referred to as “solvates.” However, it is particularly desirable to form stable hydrates with water as the solvent. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be made into ester derivatives. These ester derivatives can then be applied in the same manner as the invention disclosed in this document is applied. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be made as various crystal polymorphs. Polymorphism is important in the development of agrochemicals since different crystal polymorphs or structures of the same molecule can have vastly different physical properties and biological performances. In further embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be made with different isotopes. Of particular importance are molecules having 2 H (also known as deuterium) in place of 1 H. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may be made with different radionuclides. Of particular importance are molecules having 13 C or 14 C. In some embodiments, the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may exist as one or more stereoisomers. Thus, certain molecules can be produced as racemic mixtures. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that one stereoisomer may be more active than the other stereoisomers. Individual stereoisomers may be obtained by known selective synthetic procedures, by conventional synthetic procedures using resolved starting materials, or by conventional resolution procedures. Certain molecules disclosed in this document can exist as two or more isomers. The various isomers include geometric isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers. Thus, the molecules disclosed in this document include geometric isomers, racemic mixtures, individual stereoisomers, and optically active mixtures. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that one isomer may be more active than the others. The structures disclosed in the present disclosure are drawn in only one geometric form for clarity, but are intended to represent all geometric forms of the molecule.

Biopesticides The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound may also be used in combination (such as in a compositional mixture, or a simultaneous or sequential application) with one or more biopesticides. The term “biopesticide” is used for microbial biological pest control agents that are applied in a similar manner to chemical pesticides. Commonly these are bacterial, but there are also examples of fungal control agents, including Trichoderma spp. and Ampelomyces quisqualis (a control agent for grape powdery mildew). Bacillus subtilis are used to control plant pathogens. Weeds and rodents have also been controlled with microbial agents. One well-known insecticide example is Bacillus thuringiensis , a bacterial disease of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera , and Diptera . Because it has little effect on other organisms, it is considered more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides. Biological insecticides include products based on: 1. entomopathogenic fungi (e.g. Metarhizium anisopliae ); 2. entomopathogenic nematodes (e.g. Steinernema feltiae ); and 3. entomopathogenic viruses (e.g. Cydia pomonella granulovirus). Other examples of entomopathogenic organisms include, but are not limited to, baculoviruses, bacteria and other prokaryotic organisms, fungi, protozoa and Microsproridia. Biologically derived insecticides include, but not limited to, rotenone, veratridine, as well as microbial toxins; insect tolerant or resistant plant varieties; and organisms modified by recombinant DNA technology to either produce insecticides or to convey an insect resistant property to the genetically modified organism. In one embodiment, the molecules of Formula One may be used with one or more biopesticides in the area of seed treatments and soil amendments. The Manual of Biocontrol Agents gives a review of the available biological insecticide (and other biology-based control) products. Copping L. G. (ed.) (2004).

Formulations A pesticide is rarely suitable for application in its pure form. It is usually necessary to add other substances so that the pesticide can be used at the required concentration and in an appropriate form, permitting ease of application, handling, transportation, storage, and maximum pesticide activity. Thus, pesticides are formulated into, for example, baits, concentrated emulsions, dusts, emulsifiable concentrates, fumigants, gels, granules, microencapsulations, seed treatments, suspension concentrates, suspoemulsions, tablets, water soluble liquids, water dispersible granules or dry flowables, wettable powders, and ultra low volume solutions. For further information on formulation types see “Catalogue of Pesticide Formulation Types and International Coding System” Technical Monograph no. 2, 5th Edition by CropLife International (2002). Pesticides are applied most often as aqueous suspensions or emulsions prepared from concentrated formulations of such pesticides. Such water-soluble, water-suspendable, or emulsifiable formulations are either solids, usually known as wettable powders, or water dispersible granules, or liquids usually known as emulsifiable concentrates, or aqueous suspensions. Wettable powders, which may be compacted to form water dispersible granules, comprise an intimate mixture of the pesticide, a carrier, and surfactants. The concentration of the pesticide is usually from about 10% to about 90% by weight. The carrier is usually selected from among the attapulgite clays, the montmorillonite clays, the diatomaceous earths, or the purified silicates. Effective surfactants, comprising from about 0.5% to about 10% of the wettable powder, are found among sulfonated lignins, condensed naphthalenesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkyl sulfates, and non-ionic surfactants such as ethylene oxide adducts of alkyl phenols. Emulsifiable concentrates of pesticides comprise a convenient concentration of a pesticide, such as from about 50 to about 500 grams per liter of liquid dissolved in a carrier that is either a water miscible solvent or a mixture of water-immiscible organic solvent and emulsifiers. Useful organic solvents include aromatics, especially xylenes and petroleum fractions, especially the high-boiling naphthalenic and olefinic portions of petroleum such as heavy aromatic naphtha. Other organic solvents may also be used, such as the terpenic solvents including rosin derivatives, aliphatic ketones such as cyclohexanone, and complex alcohols such as 2-ethoxyethanol. Suitable emulsifiers for emulsifiable concentrates are selected from conventional anionic and non-ionic surfactants. Aqueous suspensions comprise suspensions of water-insoluble pesticides dispersed in an aqueous carrier at a concentration in the range from about 5% to about 50% by weight. Suspensions are prepared by finely grinding the pesticide and vigorously mixing it into a carrier comprised of water and surfactants. Ingredients, such as inorganic salts and synthetic or natural gums may also be added, to increase the density and viscosity of the aqueous carrier. It is often most effective to grind and mix the pesticide at the same time by preparing the aqueous mixture and homogenizing it in an implement such as a sand mill, ball mill, or piston-type homogenizer. Pesticides may also be applied as granular compositions that are particularly useful for applications to the soil. Granular compositions usually contain from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the pesticide, dispersed in a carrier that comprises clay or a similar substance. Such compositions are usually prepared by dissolving the pesticide in a suitable solvent and applying it to a granular carrier which has been pre-formed to the appropriate particle size, in the range of from about 0.5 to about 3 mm. Such compositions may also be formulated by making a dough or paste of the carrier and compound and crushing and drying to obtain the desired granular particle size. Dusts containing a pesticide are prepared by intimately mixing the pesticide in powdered form with a suitable dusty agricultural carrier, such as kaolin clay, ground volcanic rock, and the like. Dusts can suitably contain from about 1% to about 10% of the pesticide. They can be applied as a seed dressing or as a foliage application with a dust blower machine. It is equally practical to apply a pesticide in the form of a solution in an appropriate organic solvent, usually petroleum oil, such as the spray oils, which are widely used in agricultural chemistry. Pesticides can also be applied in the form of an aerosol composition. In such compositions the pesticide is dissolved or dispersed in a carrier, which is a pressure-generating propellant mixture. The aerosol composition is packaged in a container from which the mixture is dispensed through an atomizing valve. Pesticide baits are formed when the pesticide is mixed with food or an attractant or both. When the pests eat the bait they also consume the pesticide. Baits may take the form of granules, gels, flowable powders, liquids, or solids. They can be used in pest harborages. Fumigants are pesticides that have a relatively high vapor pressure and hence can exist as a gas in sufficient concentrations to kill pests in soil or enclosed spaces. The toxicity of the fumigant is proportional to its concentration and the exposure time. They are characterized by a good capacity for diffusion and act by penetrating the pest's respiratory system or being absorbed through the pest's cuticle. Fumigants are applied to control stored product pests under gas proof sheets, in gas sealed rooms or buildings or in special chambers. Pesticides can be microencapsulated by suspending the pesticide particles or droplets in plastic polymers of various types. By altering the chemistry of the polymer or by changing factors in the processing, microcapsules can be formed of various sizes, solubility, wall thicknesses, and degrees of penetrability. These factors govern the speed with which the active ingredient within is released, which in turn, affects the residual performance, speed of action, and odor of the product. Oil solution concentrates are made by dissolving pesticide in a solvent that will hold the pesticide in solution. Oil solutions of a pesticide usually provide faster knockdown and kill of pests than other formulations due to the solvents themselves having pesticidal action and the dissolution of the waxy covering of the integument increasing the speed of uptake of the pesticide. Other advantages of oil solutions include better storage stability, better penetration of crevices, and better adhesion to greasy surfaces. Another embodiment is an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the emulsion comprises oily globules which are each provided with a lamellar liquid crystal coating and are dispersed in an aqueous phase, wherein each oily globule comprises at least one compound which is agriculturally active, and is individually coated with a monolamellar or oligolamellar layer comprising: (1) at least one non-ionic lipophilic surface-active agent, (2) at least one non-ionic hydrophilic surface-active agent and (3) at least one ionic surface-active agent, wherein the globules having a mean particle diameter of less than 800 nanometers. Further information on the embodiment is disclosed in U.S. patent publication 20070027034 published Feb. 1, 2007, having patent application Ser. No. 11/495,228. For ease of use, this embodiment will be referred to as “OIWE.” For further information consult “Insect Pest Management” 2nd Edition by D. Dent, copyright CAB International (2000).

Other Formulation Components Generally, when the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III are used in a formulation, such formulation can also contain other components. These components include, but are not limited to, (this is a non-exhaustive and non-mutually exclusive list) wetters, spreaders, stickers, penetrants, buffers, sequestering agents, drift reduction agents, compatibility agents, anti-foam agents, cleaning agents, and emulsifiers. A few components are described forthwith. A wetting agent is a substance that when added to a liquid increases the spreading or penetration power of the liquid by reducing the interfacial tension between the liquid and the surface on which it is spreading. Wetting agents are used for two main functions in agrochemical formulations: during processing and manufacture to increase the rate of wetting of powders in water to make concentrates for soluble liquids or suspension concentrates; and during mixing of a product with water in a spray tank to reduce the wetting time of wettable powders and to improve the penetration of water into water-dispersible granules. Examples of wetting agents used in wettable powder, suspension concentrate, and water-dispersible granule formulations are: sodium lauryl sulfate; sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate; alkyl phenol ethoxylates; and aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates. A dispersing agent is a substance which adsorbs onto the surface of particles and helps to preserve the state of dispersion of the particles and prevents them from reaggregating. Dispersing agents are added to agrochemical formulations to facilitate dispersion and suspension during manufacture, and to ensure the particles redisperse into water in a spray tank. They are widely used in wettable powders, suspension concentrates and water-dispersible granules. Surfactants that are used as dispersing agents have the ability to adsorb strongly onto a particle surface and provide a charged or steric barrier to reaggregation of particles. The most commonly used surfactants are anionic, non-ionic, or mixtures of the two types. For wettable powder formulations, the most common dispersing agents are sodium lignosulfonates. For suspension concentrates, very good adsorption and stabilization are obtained using polyelectrolytes, such as sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates. Tristyrylphenol ethoxylate phosphate esters are also used. Non-ionics such as alkylarylethylene oxide condensates and EO-PO block copolymers are sometimes combined with anionics as dispersing agents for suspension concentrates. In recent years, new types of very high molecular weight polymeric surfactants have been developed as dispersing agents. These have very long hydrophobic “backbones” and a large number of ethylene oxide chains forming the “teeth” of a “comb” surfactant. These high molecular weight polymers can give very good long-term stability to suspension concentrates because the hydrophobic backbones have many anchoring points onto the particle surfaces. Examples of dispersing agents used in agrochemical formulations are: sodium lignosulfonates; sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates; tristyrylphenol ethoxylate phosphate esters; aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates; alkyl ethoxylates; EO-PO block copolymers; and graft copolymers. An emulsifying agent is a substance which stabilizes a suspension of droplets of one liquid phase in another liquid phase. Without the emulsifying agent the two liquids would separate into two immiscible liquid phases. The most commonly used emulsifier blends contain alkylphenol or aliphatic alcohol with twelve or more ethylene oxide units and the oil-soluble calcium salt of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid. A range of hydrophile-lipophile balance (“HLB”) values from 8 to 18 will normally provide good stable emulsions. Emulsion stability can sometimes be improved by the addition of a small amount of an EO-PO block copolymer surfactant. A solubilizing agent is a surfactant which will form micelles in water at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration. The micelles are then able to dissolve or solubilize water-insoluble materials inside the hydrophobic part of the micelle. The types of surfactants usually used for solubilization are non-ionics, sorbitan monooleates, sorbitan monooleate ethoxylates, and methyl oleate esters. Surfactants are sometimes used, either alone or with other additives such as mineral or vegetable oils as adjuvants to spray-tank mixes to improve the biological performance of the pesticide on the target. The types of surfactants used for bioenhancement depend generally on the nature and mode of action of the pesticide. However, they are often non-ionics such as: alkyl ethoxylates; linear aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates; aliphatic amine ethoxylates. A carrier or diluent in an agricultural formulation is a material added to the pesticide to give a product of the required strength. Carriers are usually materials with high absorptive capacities, while diluents are usually materials with low absorptive capacities. Carriers and diluents are used in the formulation of dusts, wettable powders, granules and water-dispersible granules. Organic solvents are used mainly in the formulation of emulsifiable concentrates, oil-in-water emulsions, suspoemulsions, and ultra low volume formulations, and to a lesser extent, granular formulations. Sometimes mixtures of solvents are used. The first main groups of solvents are aliphatic paraffinic oils such as kerosene or refined paraffins. The second main group (and the most common) comprises the aromatic solvents such as xylene and higher molecular weight fractions of C9 and C10 aromatic solvents. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are useful as cosolvents to prevent crystallization of pesticides when the formulation is emulsified into water. Alcohols are sometimes used as cosolvents to increase solvent power. Other solvents may include vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters of vegetable and seed oils. Thickeners or gelling agents are used mainly in the formulation of suspension concentrates, emulsions and suspoemulsions to modify the rheology or flow properties of the liquid and to prevent separation and settling of the dispersed particles or droplets. Thickening, gelling, and anti-settling agents generally fall into two categories, namely water-insoluble particulates and water-soluble polymers. It is possible to produce suspension concentrate formulations using clays and silicas. Examples of these types of materials, include, but are not limited to, montmorillonite, bentonite, magnesium aluminum silicate, and attapulgite. Water-soluble polysaccharides have been used as thickening-gelling agents for many years. The types of polysaccharides most commonly used are natural extracts of seeds and seaweeds or are synthetic derivatives of cellulose. Examples of these types of materials include, but are not limited to, guar gum; locust bean gum; carrageenam; alginates; methyl cellulose; sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC); hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). Other types of anti-settling agents are based on modified starches, polyacrylates, polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene oxide. Another good anti-settling agent is xanthan gum. Microorganisms can cause spoilage of formulated products. Therefore preservation agents are used to eliminate or reduce their effect. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to: propionic acid and its sodium salt; sorbic acid and its sodium or potassium salts; benzoic acid and its sodium salt; p-hydroxybenzoic acid sodium salt; methyl p-hydroxybenzoate; and 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT). The presence of surfactants often causes water-based formulations to foam during mixing operations in production and in application through a spray tank. In order to reduce the tendency to foam, anti-foam agents are often added either during the production stage or before filling into bottles. Generally, there are two types of anti-foam agents, namely silicones and non-silicones. Silicones are usually aqueous emulsions of dimethyl polysiloxane, while the non-silicone anti-foam agents are water-insoluble oils, such as octanol and nonanol, or silica. In both cases, the function of the anti-foam agent is to displace the surfactant from the air-water interface. “Green” agents (e.g., adjuvants, surfactants, solvents) can reduce the overall environmental footprint of crop protection formulations. Green agents are biodegradable and generally derived from natural and/or sustainable sources, e.g. plant and animal sources. Specific examples are: vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters thereof, also alkoxylated alkyl polyglucosides.

Pesticidal Activities The disclosed pesticidal compositions may be used, for example, as nematicides, acaricides, pesticides, insecticides, miticides, and/or molluscicides. In one particular embodiment, a method of controlling pests comprises applying a pesticidal composition comprising a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III near a population of pests. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III are generally used in amounts from about 0.01 grams per hectare to about 5000 grams per hectare to provide control. Amounts from about 0.1 grams per hectare to about 500 grams per hectare are generally preferred, and amounts from about 1 gram per hectare to about 50 grams per hectare are generally more preferred. The area to which a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III is applied can be any area inhabited (or maybe inhabited, or traversed by) a pest, for example: where crops, trees, fruits, cereals, fodder species, vines, turf and ornamental plants, are growing; where domesticated animals are residing; the interior or exterior surfaces of buildings (such as places where grains are stored), the materials of construction used in building (such as impregnated wood), and the soil around buildings. Particular crop areas to use a molecule of Formula One include areas where apples, corn, sunflowers, cotton, soybeans, canola, wheat, rice, sorghum, barley, oats, potatoes, oranges, alfalfa, lettuce, strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, crucifers, pears, tobacco, almonds, sugar beets, beans and other valuable crops are growing or the seeds thereof are going to be planted. It is also advantageous to use ammonium sulfate with a 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound when growing various plants. Controlling pests generally means that pest populations, pest activity, or both, are reduced in an area. This can come about when: pest populations are repulsed from an area; when pests are incapacitated in or around an area; or pests are exterminated, in whole, or in part, in or around an area. Of course, a combination of these results can occur. Generally, pest populations, activity, or both are desirably reduced more than fifty percent, preferably more than 90 percent. Generally, the area is not in or on a human; consequently, the locus is generally a non-human area. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used in mixtures, applied simultaneously or sequentially, alone or with other compounds to enhance plant vigor (e.g. to grow a better root system, to better withstand stressful growing conditions). Such other compounds are, for example, compounds that modulate plant ethylene receptors, most notably 1-methylcyclopropene (also known as 1-MCP). Furthermore, such molecules may be used during times when pest activity is low, such as before the plants that are growing begin to produce valuable agricultural commodities. Such times include the early planting season when pest pressure is usually low. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be applied to the foliar and fruiting portions of plants to control pests. The molecules will either come in direct contact with the pest, or the pest will consume the pesticide when eating leaf, fruit mass, or extracting sap, that contains the pesticide. The 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound can also be applied to the soil, and when applied in this manner, root and stem feeding pests can be controlled. The roots can absorb a molecule taking it up into the foliar portions of the plant to control above ground chewing and sap feeding pests. Generally, with baits, the baits are placed in the ground where, for example, termites can come into contact with, and/or be attracted to, the bait. Baits can also be applied to a surface of a building, (horizontal, vertical, or slant surface) where, for example, ants, termites, cockroaches, and flies, can come into contact with, and/or be attracted to, the bait. Baits can comprise a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be encapsulated inside, or placed on the surface of a capsule. The size of the capsules can range from nanometer size (about 100-900 nanometers in diameter) to micrometer size (about 10-900 microns in diameter). Because of the unique ability of the eggs of some pests to resist certain pesticides, repeated applications of the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be desirable to control newly emerged larvae. Systemic movement of pesticides in plants may be utilized to control pests on one portion of the plant by applying (for example by spraying an area) the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III to a different portion of the plant. For example, control of foliar-feeding insects can be achieved by drip irrigation or furrow application, by treating the soil with for example pre- or post-planting soil drench, or by treating the seeds of a plant before planting. Seed treatment can be applied to all types of seeds, including those from which plants genetically modified to express specialized traits will germinate. Representative examples include those expressing proteins toxic to invertebrate pests, such as Bacillus thuringiensis or other insecticidal toxins, those expressing herbicide resistance, such as “Roundup Ready” seed, or those with “stacked” foreign genes expressing insecticidal toxins, herbicide resistance, nutrition-enhancement, drought resistance, or any other beneficial traits. Furthermore, such seed treatments with the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may further enhance the ability of a plant to better withstand stressful growing conditions. This results in a healthier, more vigorous plant, which can lead to higher yields at harvest time. Generally, about 1 gram of the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III to about 500 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide good benefits, amounts from about 10 grams to about 100 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide better benefits, and amounts from about 25 grams to about 75 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide even better benefits. It should be readily apparent that the 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used on, in, or around plants genetically modified to express specialized traits, such as Bacillus thuringiensis or other insecticidal toxins, or those expressing herbicide resistance, or those with “stacked” foreign genes expressing insecticidal toxins, herbicide resistance, nutrition-enhancement, or any other beneficial traits. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used for controlling endoparasites and ectoparasites in the veterinary medicine sector or in the field of non-human animal keeping. The 3-(thiazol-2-yl)pyridine 1-oxide compound are applied, such as by oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, granules, by dermal application in the form of, for example, dipping, spraying, pouring on, spotting on, and dusting, and by parenteral administration in the form of, for example, an injection. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be employed advantageously in livestock keeping, for example, cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, and geese. They may also be employed advantageously in pets such as, horses, dogs, and cats. Particular pests to control would be fleas and ticks that are bothersome to such animals. Suitable formulations are administered orally to the animals with the drinking water or feed. The dosages and formulations that are suitable depend on the species. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used for controlling parasitic worms, especially of the intestine, in the animals listed above. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be employed in therapeutic methods for human health care. Such methods include, but are limited to, oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, granules, and by dermal application. Pests around the world have been migrating to new environments (for such pest) and thereafter becoming a new invasive species in such new environment. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used on such new invasive species to control them in such new environment. The 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may also be used in an area where plants, such as crops, are growing (e.g. pre-planting, planting, pre-harvesting) and where there are low levels (even no actual presence) of pests that can commercially damage such plants. The use of such molecules in such area is to benefit the plants being grown in the area. Such benefits, may include, but are not limited to, improving the health of a plant, improving the yield of a plant (e.g. increased biomass and/or increased content of valuable ingredients), improving the vigor of a plant (e.g. improved plant growth and/or greener leaves), improving the quality of a plant (e.g. improved content or composition of certain ingredients), and improving the tolerance to abiotic and/or biotic stress of the plant. Before a pesticide can be used or sold commercially, such pesticide undergoes lengthy evaluation processes by various governmental authorities (local, regional, state, national, and international). Voluminous data requirements are specified by regulatory authorities and must be addressed through data generation and submission by the product registrant or by a third party on the product registrant's behalf, often using a computer with a connection to the World Wide Web. These governmental authorities then review such data and if a determination of safety is concluded, provide the potential user or seller with product registration approval. Thereafter, in that locality where the product registration is granted and supported, such user or seller may use or sell such pesticide. A 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III can be tested to determine its efficacy against pests. Furthermore, mode of action studies can be conducted to determine if said molecule has a different mode of action than other pesticides. Thereafter, such acquired data can be disseminated, such as by the internet, to third parties. The disclosed pesticidal composition comprising a 1-(3-pyridyl-N-oxide)pyrazole compound of formula I, II, or III may be used to control a wide variety of pests.

4517006,Composite materials comprising water-soluble glass particles,1982-11-17,0,1,"This invention relates to arrangements and methods for the controlled release of active materials into solution. There is a broad range of applications wherein it is necessary to provide for the release of an active material at a controlled rate into an aqueous environment. In the biosciences, particularly, the potential for prolonging the action of numerous bioactive compounds is stimulating considerable interest. Since the early 1950's researchers have attempted to develop controlled release compounds able to store active materials and then release them at controlled rates into aqueous systems. This research has tended to concentrate on polymeric materials. Any polymers may be fabricated at relatively low temperatures to encapsulate effectively active materials thereby protecting them from unwanted interaction with the environment. Subsequent release of the active material is effected by one of four general mechanisms, i.e. diffusion, swelling, (bio) chemical action and magnetic processes. However, in most cases it has proved impractical to engineer the required degree of control, especially over long periods, and in many instances toxicity of the special polymer itself has limited exploitation. Controlled Release Glasses (CRG), such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,350,675, are inorganic glasses that may be formulated to be non-toxic. Their solution rates in aqueous media are chemically controlled and may be varied to give a high degree of precision, even over long periods. Unfortunately CRG may only be fabricated at temperatures that would, on contact, destroy or degrade many of the active materials of interest. For this reason the development of CRG has tended to be concentrated on applications requiring the release of inorganic materials. The object of this invention is to combine the most advantageous properties of both the polymer and CRG approaches, without risk of toxicity. Thus the benefits of low temperature fabrication and release control combine to provide a new means of releasing a wide range of active materials. According to the invention there is provided a coherent composite structure, comprising a composite material and an active material, said composite material comprising a matrix material and a particulate material soluble in an aqueous medium and dispersed in said matrix material, the composite material being such that, when contacted with the aqueous medium, said particulate material dissolves thereby increasing the aqueous permeability of said composite whereby in use to control the release of the active material from the structure. Typically the matrix material is a polymer. When the composite comes into contact with an aqueous medium the particulate material dissolves to provide a series of passageways through the host matrix thus permitting the ingress of water. Such a composite can be employed for the delayed and controlled release of an active material which, prior to the dissolution of the particulate material and the consequent significant increase in the water permeability of the composite, is protected by the composite itself. Advantageously the particulate material is a soluble glass composition or a mixture of such glass compositions. Water soluble glass compositions have the important property that their dissolution rate may be tailored to a desired value by composition adjustment thus providing for the manufacture of composite materials with a wide range of release characteristics. Moreover, many of these glasses are biologically inert."
4921024,Method and apparatus to fell a tree,1989-10-16,1,0,"This invention relates to a method and apparatus to sever a standing tree from its base, specifically the invention relates to a circular saw and a saw guard mounted on a vehicle to sever a tree by advancing the saw toward the tree. Many devices have been developed for felling trees. Some of these devices have been incorporated into self propelled mechanisms by mounting the felling head on a vehicle. The one thing all of the machines have in common is that a mechanism is provided to sever the tree from its base. Large shears, reciprocating saw blades, various configurations of chain saw blades and circular saws all have been used with some success. Generally the devices which use circular saws have a guard or housing about the circular saw blade to protect the operator and other personnel from the saw blade. An opening is usually provided in the front portion of the guard to expose a portion of the saw blade for cutting the tree. This arrangement, however, limits the diameter of the tree which can be cut. One method to cut oversize trees was to partially cut the front side of a tree, drive the felling apparatus to the back of the tree and complete the severing from the backside of the tree. This method is time consuming and often is not practical because of the density of most woodlots. Kurelek, U.S. Pat. No. 4,446,897, recognized the mobility problem and mounted the circular saw and felling head on a boom which is attached to a vehicle. Kurelek also placed a second opening in the saw guard to allow the saw blade to cut on either side. The Kurelek apparatus was thus able to cut in a straight ahead mode or in a side-swing or scything mode. Although an improvement over the prior art the Kurelek patent has the disadvantage of leaving the second portion of the saw blade exposed and unprotected. Kurelek also does not address the problem of felling an oversize tree. The present invention thus overcomes the limitations and problems in the prior art. The present invention includes a felling head mounted on a vehicle. The felling head includes a frame having an upper portion and a lower portion. A bunching arm is attached to the upper portion of the frame and a circular saw is supported by the lower portion of the frame. A guard overlays the circular saw. The guard has a first or fixed portion attached to the frame and a second or movable portion hinged to the first portion. A means to move the second portion of the guard has its first end attached to the frame and its second end attached to the second portion of the guard. An opening is provided in the fixed portion of the guard to expose a first arcuate portion of the circular saw. The second portion of the guard, when raised, exposes a second arcuate portion of the circular saw. To sever a large tree, the guard is raised and the second arcuate portion of the circular saw is advanced in a first direction to cut a first side of the tree. The vehicle is reversed, bringing the circular saw out of engagement with the tree. The vehicle is then advanced in a second direction which is at an angle to the first direction bringing the first arcuate portion of the saw into cutting engagement with the second side of the tree to completely sever the tree. It is an object of the invention to provide a mobile apparatus to fell a tree, the apparatus having a circular saw mounted thereon which can fell a tree larger in diameter than the radius of the saw. It is a further object of the invention to provide a guard about the circular saw, the guard having a movable portion which can selectively either expose or overlay a portion of the circular saw. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof and from the attached drawings."

8150554,Resource use management in yards and gardens,2009-04-21,0,1,"CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is related to commonly assigned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,051 entitled “A Method for Providing an Application to Plants”; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,059 entitled “Horticultural Knowledge Base for Managing Yards and Gardens”; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,043 entitled “System and Method for Managing Resource Use”; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/427,065, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,028,470, entitled “Robotic Watering Unit” all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention relates generally to an irrigation control system and, more particularly, to a system and method for managing resource use in yards and gardens. Horticulture is the industry and science of plant cultivation. Horticulturists work and conduct research in the disciplines of plant propagation and cultivation, crop production, plant breeding and genetic engineering, plant biochemistry, and plant physiology. The work particularly involves fruits, berries, nuts, vegetables, flowers, trees, shrubs, and turf. Horticulturists work to improve crop yield, quality, nutritional value, and resistance to insects, diseases, and environmental stresses. One aspect of horticultural management is irrigation. Irrigation is typically used to water large, homogeneous areas such as fields, lawns, and gardens. The water is assumed to be available from a single source, such as a well, canal, or municipal water system. Water from municipal water systems are often stressed during times of heat and drought, and watering restrictions are frequently implemented to provide adequate water for higher priority uses. These restrictions may start as odd-even day lawn watering and progress to complete bans on lawn watering, and finally to complete bans on garden watering. The fields and lawns typically have a single species of plant and water application is based on water sensors, evapotranspiration models, or rules. This type of irrigation system can be inadequate for yards and gardens where numerous species are growing in close proximity, particularly large water users like trees and shrubs in proximity to lesser water users. Trees, shrubs, and structures also provide shade, which impacts evapotranspiration, which is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration. An embodiment of the present invention provides a computer program product comprising a computer recordable media having computer usable program code. Resource needs are determined for each plant in a plurality of plants to form individual resource needs. Conditions are identified in an environment in which the plurality of plants are located by receiving input from a sensor system to form current conditions. A plurality of per plant prescriptions are calculated for the plurality of plants using the individual resource needs and the current conditions. The application of the resource is controlled from a mobile utility vehicle to each plant in the plurality of plants using the plurality of per plant prescriptions. The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present invention or may be combined in yet other embodiments in which further details can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings."
8260465,Data communication in a multi-wire irrigation control system,2009-07-17,1,0,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation devices, and more particularly to the communication of data using an alternating power signal to be supplied to irrigation devices. 2. Discussion of the Related Art Typical irrigation control systems cooperate with water valves and pumps to control the flow of irrigation water through a variety of water dispensing devices, including sprinklers, rotors, drip-lines, and other water delivery devices. These control systems are used in a wide variety of irrigation applications, from residential and commercial landscapes to golf course and agricultural irrigation. Many irrigation systems and electronics are powered by 50/60 Hz AC voltage signals. Some systems further modulate this power source to provide data communication, for example, by selectively clipping the positive half of the AC voltage signal. Data and power sent in this manner are often over a two-wire transmission line and are often referred to as a two-wire interface. Irrigation devices variously located in the field couple to the two-wire interface and derive their operational power therefrom. The irrigation devices demodulate the data monitoring the received power signal for a missing negative half of a cycle, then taking eight voltage samples at a predetermined time thereafter during the positive half to detect whether the signal is clipped or unclipped. Such systems are well known in the art and described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,395 to Evelyn-Veere. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for providing power and data to an irrigation device. The method includes modulating data onto an alternating power signal by distorting an amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, permitting effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and applying the alternating power signal to a multi-wire interface configured to couple with a plurality of irrigation devices. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system. The method includes receiving an alternating power signal comprising cycles each having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and demodulating data represented by the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device having a modulator configured to modulate data onto an alternating power signal by distorting amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, and permit effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal. The irrigation controller further includes an interface configured to couple the modulator to a multi-wire interface coupled to a plurality of irrigation devices to permit the alternating power signal to be applied to the multi-wire interface. In still yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation device having an input configured to receive an alternating power signal comprising cycles having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and a demodulator configured to provide data by demodulating the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In a further embodiment, the invention may be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system, the method comprising: receiving, at an irrigation device, an alternating power signal comprising cycles, where an amplitude of a portion of each cycle is selectively distorted to modulate data on the alternating power signal; determining a slope of the portion of each cycle; and demodulating the data based upon the determining the slope"
