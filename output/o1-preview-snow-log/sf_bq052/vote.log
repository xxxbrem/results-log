After comparing both SQL queries, I have determined that **1result.sql** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Accurate Calculation of Citation Counts:**
   - **1result.sql** correctly calculates both forward and backward citation counts where the application dates of the patents involved differ by no more than 30 days.
   - It ensures that citations are counted only if the date difference condition is met, by applying the condition within the subqueries that calculate the citation counts.
   
2. **Proper Use of JOINs and Conditions:**
   - The query uses `LEFT JOIN` to correctly associate forward and backward citation counts with the candidate patents, even if some patents may not have citations meeting the criteria.
   - It filters patents based on the required CPC classifications (`'C05'` or `'A01G'`) and country (`'US'`) in a clear and efficient manner.
   
3. **Clarity and Maintainability:**
   - **1result.sql** is well-structured and easier to read, which makes it more maintainable and less prone to errors.
   - By structuring the query with labeled subqueries for forward and backward citations, it enhances readability and comprehension.
   
4. **Direct Filtering in Main Query:**
   - The query applies the condition to select patents with at least one forward or backward citation within one month directly in the main `WHERE` clause, ensuring only relevant patents are returned.

Considering these points, **1result.sql** effectively fulfills the requirements by accurately retrieving the patents that:

- Are from the USA.
- Belong to CPC subsection `'C05'` or group `'A01G'`.
- Have at least one forward or backward citation within one month of their application dates.
- Include the requested fields: ID, title, application date, citation counts, and summary text.
