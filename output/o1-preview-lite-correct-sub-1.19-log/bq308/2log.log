2025-01-20 08:13:13 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 08:13:13 - root - INFO - It appears you encountered a **"Quota exceeded"** error when running Query 12. This error occurs because your query is scanning more data than your project's free BigQuery quota allows.

**Explanation:**

- **BigQuery Charges by Data Scanned:** BigQuery calculates query costs based on the amount of data scanned during the query execution, not the number of rows returned.
- **LIMIT Clause Doesn't Reduce Scanned Data:** Adding a `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of results returned but doesn't minimize the amount of data scanned.
- **Large Dataset:** The `posts_questions` table contains a substantial amount of data, and filtering for all questions in 2021 still scans a large portion of the table.

**Solutions:**

To reduce the amount of data scanned and avoid exceeding your quota, you can adjust your query in the following ways:

1. **Restrict the Date Range Further:**

   Instead of querying the entire year of 2021, narrow down the date range to a specific month or day.

   ```sql
   -- Retrieve questions from January 2021
   SELECT `id`, `title`, `creation_date`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01'
     AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Use Sampling Techniques (if supported):**

   Some datasets support table sampling to reduce the amount of data scanned.

   ```sql
   -- Sample 1% of the data (only if TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM is supported)
   SELECT `id`, `title`, `creation_date`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT)
   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM `creation_date`) = 2021
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   *Note: BigQuery doesn't natively support `TABLESAMPLE`, but this is available in some SQL dialects. Verify compatibility before using this method.*

3. **Preview the Table Schema Without Scanning Data:**

   If you're interested in the table schema or a small preview, you can use the BigQuery UI to view the table schema without running a query.

4. **Check the Estimated Bytes Before Running the Query:**

   In the BigQuery UI, the query editor shows the estimated number of bytes the query will process. Use this to adjust your query accordingly.

5. **Consider Using a Billing Account:**

   If you need to run queries that exceed the free quota regularly, consider setting up a billing account. Be mindful of potential costs associated with this option.

**Revised Query Examples:**

- **Option 1: Query a Specific Month**

  ```sql
  -- Questions from January 2021
  SELECT `id`, `title`, `creation_date`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
  WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01'
    AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

- **Option 2: Query a Specific Day**

  ```sql
  -- Questions from January 1, 2021
  SELECT `id`, `title`, `creation_date`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
  WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

**Additional Tips:**

- **Use Partitioned Tables:**

  If the table is partitioned by `creation_date`, querying a specific partition can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned.

- **Select Only Necessary Columns:**

  You've already limited your selection to `id`, `title`, and `creation_date`, which helps minimize data scanned.

- **Monitor Quota Usage:**

  Regularly check your quota usage in the Google Cloud Console to avoid unexpected interruptions.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Modify Your Query:**

   Adjust your query to include a narrower date range as shown above.

2. **Estimate Data Scanned:**

   Before running the query, check the estimated bytes to ensure it fits within your quota.

3. **Run the Modified Query:**

   Execute the query after making the necessary adjustments.

**Example of Adjusted Query Execution:**

```sql
-- Query 12 Adjusted: Retrieve 1000 questions from January 2021
SELECT `id`, `title`, `creation_date`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01'
  AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

This adjusted query should scan less data and hopefully execute without exceeding your quota.

**Remember:** Always verify the estimated data to be scanned before running your queries to manage your quota effectively.
2025-01-20 08:13:49 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 08:13:49 - root - INFO - It seems you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when running Query 12, despite our previous discussion. This error indicates that your query is scanning more data than allowed by your current BigQuery quota.

**Here's what we can do:**

1. **Narrow Down the Date Range Further**

   To reduce the amount of data scanned, you need to restrict your query to a smaller date range within 2021. Let's focus on a single month or even a single day.

   **Example: Query Questions from January 2021**

   ```sql
   -- Retrieve questions from January 2021
   SELECT `id`, `title`, `creation_date`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   **Example: Query Questions from January 1, 2021**

   ```sql
   -- Retrieve questions from January 1, 2021
   SELECT `id`, `title`, `creation_date`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **Select Fewer Columns**

   Each column adds to the amount of data scanned. Since `title` is a text field and can be large, try omitting it to see if it reduces the data scanned.

   ```sql
   -- Exclude the 'title' column
   SELECT `id`, `creation_date`
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
   WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01`
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Estimate Query Size Before Running**

   In the BigQuery UI, there's an option to **"Show query estimation"**. This feature estimates the amount of data your query will process. Use it to ensure your query stays within your quota.

4. **Use the `__TABLES_SUMMARY__` Meta Table**

   You can query metadata about the table to gain insights without scanning the actual data.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.__TABLES_SUMMARY__`
   WHERE table_id = 'posts_questions';
   ```

5. **Check Your Quota Usage**

   It's possible that you've already used up your free quota for the day. BigQuery has daily limits for the free tier, and once exceeded, you'll encounter this error until the quota resets the next day.

6. **Enable Billing (If Feasible)**

   If permissible and you anticipate running queries that exceed the free tier regularly, consider setting up a billing account. This will allow you to run larger queries, but be mindful of incurring costs.

**Next Steps:**

- **Try the Adjusted Query:**

  Start with querying a single day or a few days and see if the query runs successfully.

  ```sql
  -- Questions from January 1 to January 3, 2021
  SELECT `id`, `title`, `creation_date`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
  WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-01-04`
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

- **Monitor the Estimated Data Scanned:**

  Before running the query, check the estimated data scanned in the UI:

  - Click on the **"Execution Details"** tab (or similar) in your BigQuery editor.
  - The estimate should be less than your remaining quota.

- **If the Issue Persists:**

  - **Wait for Quota Reset:** If you've exhausted your daily quota, you'll need to wait until it resets (usually after 24 hours).
  - **Use Smaller Date Ranges:** Keep narrowing the date range until the query executes without exceeding the quota.
  - **Exclude Large Columns:** Omit text fields like `title` and `body` which can be large.

**Example of a Minimal Query:**

```sql
-- Retrieve `id` and `creation_date` from a single day
SELECT `id`, `creation_date`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Additional Tips:**

- **Use Preview Options:**

  If you only need a quick look at the data, you can use the table preview feature in the BigQuery UI without incurring query costs.

- **Understand the Data Distribution:**

  The `posts_questions` table is massive. Querying the entire year of data can scan several terabytes.

- **Check Quota Details:**

  Visit the [BigQuery Quota Policy](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas) to understand your limits.

**Summary:**

- **Adjust your query to reduce data scanned** by limiting the date range and selecting only necessary columns.
- **Monitor the estimated data scanned** before running the query.
- **Consider quota limitations**, and if necessary, wait for a quota reset or enable billing.

2025-01-20 08:14:17 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering a **syntax error** due to an **unclosed string literal** in your SQL query. Let's examine your query and identify the issue.

**Your Query:**

```sql
-- Query 12: Retrieve 1000 questions with their titles and creation dates
SELECT `id`, `title`, `creation_date`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01`
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [4:63]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [4:63]
```

**Explanation:**

- The error indicates there's an **unclosed string literal** at line 4, character 63.
- Upon inspecting your query, the issue lies in the **date string** in the `WHERE` clause: `'2021-02-01\``
- The closing quote for `'2021-02-01\`` is a backtick (**\`**) instead of a single quote (**'**). This mismatch causes the SQL parser to interpret the string as unclosed.

**How to Fix It:**

- Ensure that string literals (like date strings) are enclosed with matching single quotes (**'**).
- Replace the incorrect backtick with a single quote.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
-- Query 12 Corrected: Retrieve 1000 questions from January 2021
SELECT `id`, `title`, `creation_date`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Key Changes:**

- Changed the ending backtick in `'2021-02-01\`` to a single quote `'2021-02-01'`.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Column and Table Names:** Enclose **column** and **table** names with backticks (**\`**), e.g., \`id\`, \`title\`, \`posts_questions\`.
- **String Literals:** Enclose **string literals** (like dates) with single quotes (**'**), e.g., '2021-01-01'.

**Double-Check the Entire Query:**

- Make sure that all string literals are properly enclosed.
- Review any other parts of the query for similar issues.

**Example Execution:**

If you run the corrected query, you should retrieve up to 1000 questions from January 2021 with their titles and creation dates without any syntax errors.

**Let Me Know if You Need Further Assistance!**

- If you still encounter errors, please share the exact error message, and I'll be happy to help.
- If you need help adjusting the query to manage quotas or other issues, feel free to ask.

---

**Summary:**

2025-01-20 08:15:06 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 08:15:06 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering a **"Quota exceeded"** error when running Query 13. This error occurs because your query scans more data than your BigQuery project's quota permits.

**Explanation:**

- **BigQuery Charges by Data Scanned:** BigQuery calculates costs based on the amount of data scanned during query execution, not the number of rows returned.
- **LIMIT Clause Doesn't Reduce Data Scanned:** Adding a `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of results returned, but the query still scans all data required to process the query.
- **Large Tables and Joins Increase Data Scanned:** The `posts_answers` and `posts_questions` tables are large, and joining them without filtering increases the data processed.

**Why Your Query Exceeds the Quota:**

- Your query joins the entire `posts_answers` table with the filtered `posts_questions` table (`EXTRACT(YEAR FROM q.\`creation_date\`) = 2021`).
- However, since there is no filter on the `posts_answers` table before the join, BigQuery scans the entire `posts_answers` table and then joins it to the filtered `posts_questions` table.
- This results in a large amount of data being processed, exceeding your free query quota.

---

**Solution:**

To reduce the amount of data scanned and stay within your quota, you can modify your query to filter the `posts_answers` table before the join. Specifically, you can:

1. **Filter the `posts_answers` table to include only answers created in 2021.**
2. **Filter both tables before the join to minimize data scanned.**
3. **Narrow down the date range further if necessary (e.g., focus on a specific month or day).**

**Adjusted Query:**

```sql
-- Adjusted Query 13: Get 1000 answers associated with questions from 2021
SELECT a.`id`, a.`parent_id`, a.`creation_date`
FROM (
    SELECT `id`, `parent_id`, `creation_date`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
    WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2022-01-01'
) AS a
JOIN (
    SELECT `id`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
    WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2022-01-01'
) AS q
ON a.`parent_id` = q.`id`
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Filter Both Tables Before Joining:**

  - **Posts Answers Subquery (`a`):** Selects answers created in 2021.
    ```sql
    SELECT `id`, `parent_id`, `creation_date`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
    WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2022-01-01'
    ```
  - **Posts Questions Subquery (`q`):** Selects questions created in 2021.
    ```sql
    SELECT `id`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
    WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2022-01-01'
    ```
  
- **Reduce Data Scanned:**
  
  By filtering both tables before the join, you significantly reduce the amount of data processed.

---

**Further Reducing Data Scanned:**

If you still encounter the quota error, consider narrowing the date range to a specific month or day.

**Example: Focus on January 2021**

```sql
-- Get answers from January 2021 associated with questions from January 2021
SELECT a.`id`, a.`parent_id`, a.`creation_date`
FROM (
    SELECT `id`, `parent_id`, `creation_date`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
    WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
) AS a
JOIN (
    SELECT `id`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
    WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
) AS q
ON a.`parent_id` = q.`id`
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Tips:**

- **Check Estimated Data Scanned:**

  Before running the query, check the estimated data to be scanned in the BigQuery UI to ensure it fits within your quota.

- **Select Only Necessary Columns:**

  Since you're selecting `id`, `parent_id`, and `creation_date`, you're already minimizing the columns. Avoid selecting large text columns like `body` or `title` unless necessary.

- **Use Smaller Time Windows:**

  If needed, focus on an even smaller date range, such as a single day.

**Example: Focus on a Single Day**

```sql
-- Get answers from January 1, 2021 associated with questions from January 1, 2021
SELECT a.`id`, a.`parent_id`, a.`creation_date`
FROM (
    SELECT `id`, `parent_id`, `creation_date`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
    WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
) AS a
JOIN (
    SELECT `id`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
    WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
) AS q
ON a.`parent_id` = q.`id`
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Understanding Limitations:**

  - The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows returned but doesn't reduce the amount of data scanned.
  - Filtering data before joins helps reduce the data processed.

- **Monitoring Quota Usage:**

  - Be aware of your daily quota limits to avoid interruptions.
  - Consider setting up billing if you need to process larger amounts of data regularly (while being mindful of costs).

- **Avoid Unnecessary Joins:**

  - Ensure that you're only joining on necessary data and that both joined tables are filtered as much as possible before joining.

---

**Summary:**

- **Problem:** Your query scans too much data due to joining large tables without sufficient filtering, exceeding your quota.
- **Solution:** Filter both `posts_answers` and `posts_questions` tables on the `creation_date` before the join to reduce data scanned.
- **Action Steps:**

  1. Adjust your query to include filters on both tables.
  2. Narrow down the date range if needed.
  3. Check the estimated data scanned before running the query.
  4. Run the adjusted query.

2025-01-20 08:15:49 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when running Query 13. This happens because, despite filtering the `posts_questions` table, the query still scans a large amount of data due to the JOIN operation with the unfiltered `posts_answers` table.

**Explanation:**

- **JOIN Operations:** When you perform a JOIN without filtering both tables beforehand, BigQuery may need to process the entire unfiltered table during the JOIN, leading to excessive data scanning.
- **LIMIT Clause:** The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of results returned but doesn't reduce the amount of data scanned.
- **Data Scanned:** Since `posts_answers` is a large table, joining it without filtering causes the query to exceed your free quota.

---

**Solution:**

To reduce the amount of data scanned and stay within your quota, you need to:

1. **Filter both tables before the JOIN.**
2. **Narrow the date range to reduce data scanned.**

**Adjusted Query:**

Let's adjust your query to filter both `posts_answers` and `posts_questions` to a specific date range, such as January 2021. This significantly reduces the data scanned.

```sql
-- Adjusted Query 13: Get 1000 answers associated with questions from January 2021
SELECT a.`id`, a.`parent_id`, a.`creation_date`
FROM (
  SELECT `id`, `parent_id`, `creation_date`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
  WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
) AS a
JOIN (
  SELECT `id`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
  WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
) AS q
ON a.`parent_id` = q.`id`
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Filter `posts_answers` Table:**
  - We select only answers created between January 1, 2021, and January 31, 2021.
- **Filter `posts_questions` Table:**
  - We select only questions created in the same date range.
- **Reduced Data Scanned:**
  - By filtering both tables before the JOIN, we minimize the amount of data processed.
- **LIMIT Clause:**
  - The `LIMIT 1000` clause remains but doesn't affect data scanned.

---

**If the Error Persists:**

If you still encounter the quota error, narrow down the date range further.

**Focus on a Single Day:**

```sql
-- Get answers associated with questions from January 1, 2021
SELECT a.`id`, a.`parent_id`, a.`creation_date`
FROM (
  SELECT `id`, `parent_id`, `creation_date`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
  WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
) AS a
JOIN (
  SELECT `id`
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
  WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
) AS q
ON a.`parent_id` = q.`id`
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Additional Tips:**

- **Check Estimated Data Scanned:**
  - Before running the query, check the estimated data to be scanned in the BigQuery UI to ensure it's within your quota.
- **Select Only Necessary Columns:**
  - You're already selecting minimal columns; avoid adding large text fields.
- **Use Preview Features:**
  - For a quick look at the data, use the table preview feature in the BigQuery UI without incurring query costs.
- **Monitor Quota Usage:**
  - Be aware of your daily quota limits to avoid interruptions.
  - Quota resets every 24 hours; you may need to wait if you've reached the limit.

---

**Why Filtering Both Tables Helps:**

- By applying filters to both `posts_answers` and `posts_questions` before the JOIN, BigQuery processes much less data.
- Without filtering `posts_answers`, the JOIN operation scans the entire `posts_answers` table, which is massive.
- Filtering reduces the amount of data each table contributes to the JOIN, keeping the query within your quota.

---

**Summary:**

- **Problem:** The query scans too much data because it's joining large tables without sufficient filtering.
- **Solution:** Filter both tables on `creation_date` before the JOIN and narrow the date range.
- **Action:** Use the adjusted query provided above with a specific date range.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. **Run the Adjusted Query:**
   - Use the query with a narrowed date range and filters on both tables.
2. **Check Data Scanned:**
   - Ensure that the estimated data scanned is within your quota.
3. **Further Narrow Date Range if Needed:**
   - If you still face issues, focus on a single day or smaller time frame.
4. **Consider Enabling Billing (Optional):**
   - If you need to run large queries regularly, consider setting up billing (be mindful of costs).

2025-01-20 08:16:35 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 08:16:35 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when running Query 13. Let's work together to adjust your query so it stays within your BigQuery free tier quotas.

---

**Your Current Query:**

```sql
-- Query 13: Get 1000 answers that are associated with questions from 2021
SELECT a.`id`, a.`parent_id`, a.`creation_date`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers` AS a
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` AS q
ON a.`parent_id` = q.`id`
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM q.`creation_date`) = 2021
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Issue Explanation:**

- **Data Scanned:** The query is scanning the entire `posts_answers` table because there is no filter on it before the `JOIN`.
- **JOIN Operation:** Without filtering `posts_answers`, BigQuery processes all answers ever posted to join with the filtered questions.
- **Filter Applied After JOIN:** The `WHERE` clause filters `q.creation_date` after the `JOIN`, which doesn't reduce the data scanned from `posts_answers`.

**Solution:**

To reduce the amount of data scanned and avoid exceeding your quota, we need to **filter both tables before the `JOIN`**. This ensures that BigQuery only processes the relevant subsets of data from each table.

**Adjusted Query:**

```sql
-- Adjusted Query 13: Get 1000 answers associated with questions from 2021
SELECT a.`id`, a.`parent_id`, a.`creation_date`
FROM (
    SELECT `id`, `parent_id`, `creation_date`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
    WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2022-01-01'
) AS a
JOIN (
    SELECT `id`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
    WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2022-01-01'
) AS q
ON a.`parent_id` = q.`id`
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Filter `posts_answers` Table:**
  - We select answers created in 2021 by adding a `WHERE` clause in the subquery for `a`.
- **Filter `posts_questions` Table:**
  - We select questions created in 2021 in the subquery for `q`.
- **Filter Before JOIN:**
  - By filtering both tables before the `JOIN`, BigQuery processes less data, reducing the bytes scanned.

**Why This Helps:**

- **Reduced Data Scanned:**
  - Filtering `posts_answers` to only 2021 data greatly reduces the number of rows scanned.
- **Efficient JOIN:**
  - The `JOIN` operation now works with smaller datasets, further decreasing resource usage.

---

**If the Error Persists:**

If you still encounter the quota error, you can further reduce the data scanned by narrowing the date range to a specific month or day.

**Example: Narrowing to January 2021**

```sql
-- Adjusted Query: Get answers associated with questions from January 2021
SELECT a.`id`, a.`parent_id`, a.`creation_date`
FROM (
    SELECT `id`, `parent_id`, `creation_date`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
    WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
) AS a
JOIN (
    SELECT `id`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
    WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
) AS q
ON a.`parent_id` = q.`id`
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Example: Narrowing to a Single Day**

```sql
-- Adjusted Query: Get answers associated with questions from January 1, 2021
SELECT a.`id`, a.`parent_id`, a.`creation_date`
FROM (
    SELECT `id`, `parent_id`, `creation_date`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
    WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
) AS a
JOIN (
    SELECT `id`
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
    WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
) AS q
ON a.`parent_id` = q.`id`
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Tips to Stay Within Quota:**

1. **Apply Filters Before JOINs:**
   - Always filter your tables before joining to reduce the data scanned.

2. **Narrow the Date Range:**
   - The smaller the date range, the less data scanned.

3. **Select Only Necessary Columns:**
   - You're already selecting minimal columns (`id`, `parent_id`, `creation_date`). Avoid adding large text fields like `body` or `title`.

4. **Check Estimated Data Before Running:**
   - In the BigQuery UI, check the "Estimated bytes to be scanned" before running the query.

5. **Monitor Your Quota Usage:**
   - Be aware of your daily free tier quota and consider that running multiple large queries can exhaust it.

---

**Understanding the Quota Exceeded Error:**

- **BigQuery Free Tier Limitations:**
  - The free tier allows up to 1 TB of free query processing per month.
  - Large joins or scans can quickly consume this quota.

- **LIMIT Clause Doesn't Reduce Data Scanned:**
  - `LIMIT 1000` only limits the number of rows returned, not the data scanned.
  - The entire dataset required to compute the result is still processed.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. **Use the Adjusted Query:**
   - Copy and run the adjusted query provided above.

2. **Adjust the Date Range if Needed:**
   - If you still face quota issues, narrow the date range to a week or a single day.

3. **Check Data Scanned Before Execution:**
   - Ensure the estimated data scanned is within your remaining quota.

4. **Consider Enabling Billing (Optional):**
   - If you need to process larger amounts of data, consider setting up billing (while being mindful of potential costs).

---

**Example: Check Estimated Data Scanned**

In the BigQuery UI:

- Click on the **"Validate"** button (or **"Query Plan"** tab) to see the estimated bytes scanned.
- Make sure it's within your free quota.

---

**Let Me Know If You Need Further Assistance:**

- If you continue to experience issues, please share any new error messages.
- I'm here to help you adjust the query further or answer any questions you might have.

---

**Summary:**

- **Problem:** The query scans too much data due to unfiltered joins, exceeding your quota.
- **Solution:** Filter both tables before the join to reduce data scanned.
- **Action:** Use the adjusted query, narrow the date range if necessary, and check the estimated data scanned.

2025-01-20 08:17:17 - root - INFO - **It appears you're encountering a "Quota exceeded" error when running Query 14. This happens because your query scans more data than your BigQuery project's quota allows.**

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

**Your Query:**

```sql
-- Query 14: Get distinct question IDs from the answers table
SELECT DISTINCT `parent_id` AS question_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **SELECT DISTINCT Without Filters:**
  - When you use `SELECT DISTINCT` on a large table without any filters, BigQuery needs to scan the entire column to identify all unique values.
  - Even though you have a `LIMIT 1000`, BigQuery still processes the entire `parent_id` column to determine distinct values before applying the limit.

- **Large Data Volume:**
  - The `posts_answers` table is very large, containing millions of records.
  - Scanning the entire `parent_id` column consumes a significant amount of data, exceeding your free query quota.

- **LIMIT Clause and Data Scanned:**
  - The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows returned **after** processing the query.
  - It does **not** limit the amount of data scanned during query execution.

---

### **Solution: Reducing Data Scanned**

To avoid exceeding your quota, you need to reduce the amount of data scanned. Here are some strategies:

1. **Apply a Date Filter to Narrow the Data:**

   - Filter the `posts_answers` table to a specific date range.
   - This reduces the number of rows processed and the amount of data scanned.

2. **Avoid SELECT DISTINCT on Large Datasets:**

   - Using `SELECT DISTINCT` on a large table without filters is resource-intensive.
   - Aim to apply filters that reduce the dataset before applying `DISTINCT`.

---

### **Adjusted Query**

**Option 1: Filter by Creation Date (e.g., Answers from 2021)**

```sql
-- Get distinct question IDs from answers posted in 2021
SELECT DISTINCT `parent_id` AS question_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2022-01-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Filtering by Date:**
  - The `WHERE` clause filters answers to those created in 2021.
  - This significantly reduces the number of rows processed.

- **Reduced Data Scanned:**
  - Scanning only a subset of data helps stay within your quota.

---

**Option 2: Further Narrow the Date Range**

If the error persists, narrow the date range further:

```sql
-- Get distinct question IDs from answers posted in January 2021
SELECT DISTINCT `parent_id` AS question_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Or even a single day:**

```sql
-- Get distinct question IDs from answers posted on January 1, 2021
SELECT DISTINCT `parent_id` AS question_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Option 3: Remove SELECT DISTINCT**

If your goal is to get `parent_id`s without needing them to be unique, you can remove `SELECT DISTINCT`:

```sql
-- Get 1000 parent IDs from answers posted in 2021 (allows duplicates)
SELECT `parent_id` AS question_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2022-01-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

- **Benefit:**
  - Removing `DISTINCT` can reduce the computational overhead.
  - However, you may receive duplicate `parent_id`s in the result.

---

### **Additional Tips**

1. **Check Estimated Data Scanned Before Running:**

   - In the BigQuery UI, you can see an estimate of the data your query will scan.
   - Ensure this estimate is within your available quota.

2. **Use Approximations with APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT (If Suitable):**

   - For large datasets, consider using approximate functions that are less resource-intensive.
   - However, this is more applicable when performing counts rather than retrieving values.

3. **Monitor Your Quota Usage:**

   - Be mindful of your daily and monthly BigQuery quotas.
   - Quotas reset daily, so you may try running the query the next day.

4. **Consider Enabling Billing (If Appropriate):**

   - If you need to process large amounts of data regularly, consider setting up billing.
   - Be cautious and monitor costs to avoid unexpected charges.

---

### **Why Does SELECT DISTINCT Scan More Data?**

- **Process of DISTINCT:**
  - To ensure all returned values are unique, BigQuery needs to examine every record in the `parent_id` column.
  - This involves scanning the entire column, which can be very large in big tables.

- **Effect of LIMIT with DISTINCT:**
  - The `LIMIT` clause is applied after all distinct values are found.
  - Therefore, it doesn't reduce the amount of data scanned for the `DISTINCT` operation.

---

### **Alternative Approaches**

**If You Need a Sample of Question IDs:**

- **Use Sampling Techniques (When Supported):**

  ```sql
  -- Sample 1% of the data (Note: BigQuery doesn't support TABLESAMPLE, but you can simulate sampling)
  SELECT DISTINCT `parent_id` AS question_id
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
  WHERE RAND() < 0.01
  LIMIT 1000;
  ```

  - **Warning:**
    - Using `RAND()` for sampling can still scan a large amount of data.
    - It's not guaranteed to reduce data scanned below the quota limit.

**Use Approximate Aggregations (Not Directly Applicable Here):**

- Since you need the actual `parent_id` values, approximate functions may not help.

---

### **Summary and Recommendations**

- **Problem:**
  - Your query scans too much data because `SELECT DISTINCT` on a large table without filters requires scanning the entire column.

- **Solution:**
  - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the data, reducing the amount of data scanned.
  - Narrow the date range using `creation_date` to limit the dataset.

- **Action Steps:**

  1. Replace your query with one that includes a date filter.
  2. Start with a broad range (e.g., answers from 2021) and narrow it if you still encounter quota issues.
  3. Check the estimated data scanned before running the query.
  4. If necessary, remove `DISTINCT` to reduce computational overhead (but be aware of duplicate values).

### **Example Adjusted Query Execution**

**Adjusted Query:**

```sql
-- Get distinct question IDs from answers posted in 2021
SELECT DISTINCT `parent_id` AS question_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2022-01-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Estimated Data Scanned:**

- Before running the query, check the BigQuery UI to see the estimated data scanned.
- Ensure it's within your remaining quota (e.g., under 1 GB for the free tier).

2025-01-20 08:17:56 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 08:17:56 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when running Query 14. This happens because your query is scanning more data than your BigQuery project's free quota allows.

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

**Your Query:**

```sql
-- Query 14: Get distinct question IDs from the answers table
SELECT DISTINCT `parent_id` AS question_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Large Table Size:**
  - The `posts_answers` table is very large, containing millions of records.
- **SELECT DISTINCT Without Filters:**
  - Using `SELECT DISTINCT` on a large table without any filters causes BigQuery to scan the entire `parent_id` column to identify all unique values.
- **LIMIT Clause:**
  - The `LIMIT` clause only limits the number of rows **returned**, not the amount of data **scanned**.
  - BigQuery still processes the entire set of data needed to compute the result before applying the `LIMIT`.
- **Resulting Data Scanned:**
  - Scanning the entire `parent_id` column exceeds your free query quota, leading to the error.

---

### **How to Resolve the Issue**

To reduce the amount of data scanned and stay within your quota, you can adjust your query by:

1. **Filtering the Data:**
   - Apply a `WHERE` clause to limit the amount of data processed.
   - Filtering by date is an effective way to reduce the dataset size.

2. **Avoiding SELECT DISTINCT on Large Datasets:**
   - Using `SELECT DISTINCT` can be resource-intensive on large tables.
   - Consider whether you need distinct values or if you can work with non-distinct results.

---

### **Adjusted Query Examples**

**Option 1: Filter by Creation Date (e.g., Answers from January 2021)**

```sql
-- Adjusted Query 14: Get distinct question IDs from answers in January 2021
SELECT DISTINCT `parent_id` AS question_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

- **Explanation:**
  - Adds a `WHERE` clause to filter answers created in January 2021.
  - Reduces the number of rows processed and the amount of data scanned.

**Option 2: Further Narrow the Date Range**

```sql
-- Get distinct question IDs from answers on January 1, 2021
SELECT DISTINCT `parent_id` AS question_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

- **Explanation:**
  - Filters answers to a single day, significantly reducing data scanned.

**Option 3: Remove SELECT DISTINCT (If Acceptable)**

```sql
-- Get question IDs from answers in January 2021 (may include duplicates)
SELECT `parent_id` AS question_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

- **Explanation:**
  - Removes `DISTINCT`, reducing computational overhead.
  - Note that this may return duplicate `question_id`s.

---

### **Tips to Stay Within Quota**

1. **Check Estimated Data Scanned Before Running:**
   - In the BigQuery UI, use the query validator to see the estimated bytes scanned.
   - Ensure it's within your available quota.

2. **Monitor Your Quota Usage:**
   - Be aware of daily and monthly quotas in the BigQuery free tier.
   - Quotas reset daily; if you've reached the limit, you may need to wait until reset.

3. **Optimize Your Queries:**
   - Always apply filters to large tables to minimize data scanned.
   - Limit the columns selected to only those necessary.

4. **Consider Enabling Billing (If Appropriate):**
   - If you need to process larger datasets regularly, consider setting up billing.
   - Be cautious and monitor usage to manage costs effectively.

---

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Understanding LIMIT with DISTINCT:**
  - The `LIMIT` clause applies **after** the `DISTINCT` operation.
  - Therefore, `DISTINCT` processes the entire dataset to find unique values before limiting the results.

- **Possible Quota Exhaustion:**
  - If you've run multiple large queries, you may have exhausted your daily quota.
  - Running even a small query may result in the same error if the quota is depleted.

---

### **Example Adjusted Query Execution**

**Adjusted Query:**

```sql
-- Get distinct question IDs from answers in January 2021
SELECT DISTINCT `parent_id` AS question_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
WHERE `creation_date` >= '2021-01-01' AND `creation_date` < '2021-02-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

- **Steps:**
  1. Paste the adjusted query into the BigQuery editor.
  2. Check the estimated data scanned.
  3. Run the query if it's within your quota.

---

### **Summary**

- **Problem:**
  - The original query scans too much data because `SELECT DISTINCT` on a large table without filters requires scanning the entire column.
- **Solution:**
  - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter data and reduce the amount of data scanned.
  - Narrow the date range to limit the dataset further.
- **Action Steps:**
  - Use one of the adjusted queries provided.
  - Check your quota usage and estimated data scanned before running the query.

2025-01-20 08:18:34 - root - INFO - It appears you're still encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when running Query 14. This indicates that your BigQuery project has exceeded the free query quota for the day.

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

**Your Query:**

```sql
-- Query 14: Get distinct question IDs from the answers table
SELECT DISTINCT `parent_id` AS question_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Error Message:**

```
403 Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for free query bytes scanned.
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Quota Exhaustion:**
  - The error suggests that your project has already used up the **daily free query quota** provided by BigQuery.
  - Once the quota is exhausted, any additional queries—even if they scan minimal data—will result in a quota exceeded error until the quota resets.

- **Impact of Previous Queries:**
  - The cumulative effect of your previous queries may have consumed the available quota.
  - BigQuery tracks the total bytes processed per project per day for billing and quota purposes.

---

### **Possible Solutions**

1. **Wait for the Quota to Reset**

   - BigQuery's free quotas reset every 24 hours.
   - You can wait until your daily quota resets and then try running your queries again.
   - This is usually the simplest solution if you don't need immediate access.

2. **Enable Billing for Your Project**

   - By enabling billing, you can process queries beyond the free tier limits.
   - This will allow you to run your queries without encountering the quota exceeded error.
   - **Important:** Be cautious when enabling billing to avoid unexpected charges. Monitor your usage and set budget alerts.

   **Steps to Enable Billing:**

   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Select your project.
   - Navigate to **Billing** and set up a billing account.
   - Link your project to the billing account.

3. **Optimize Your Queries Further**

   - Although you've tried to adjust your queries, you can further minimize data scanned by:

     - **Narrowing the Date Range:** Focus on a very small date range (e.g., a single day or hour).
     - **Limiting Columns Selected:** Select only the essential columns to reduce data processed.
     - **Avoiding `SELECT DISTINCT`:** As `DISTINCT` can be resource-intensive, consider if it's necessary.

   - **Example of a Highly Filtered Query:**

     ```sql
     -- Adjusted Query 14: Get distinct question IDs from answers on a specific day
     SELECT DISTINCT `parent_id` AS question_id
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`
     WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
     LIMIT 1000;
     ```

     - **Check Estimated Data Scanned:**
       - Before running the query, use the BigQuery UI to check the estimated bytes scanned.
       - Ensure it's within the remaining quota.

   - **Note:** Given that you're still encountering the quota error, it's likely that your quota is fully exhausted, and further query optimization may not resolve the issue immediately.

---

### **Next Steps**

- **Check Your Quota Usage**

  - Verify the current quota usage for your project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  - Navigate to **BigQuery** > **Quota** to see your daily usage and limits.

- **Consider Billing Options**

  - If you need to continue working without delays and are comfortable enabling billing, proceed with caution.
  - Set up **budget alerts** to monitor and control your spending.

- **Plan for Quota Management**

  - To prevent this issue in the future, consider:

    - **Query Optimization:** Always apply filters to limit data scanned.
    - **Monitoring Usage:** Regularly check your quota usage.
    - **Scheduling Intensive Queries:** Run larger queries after the quota resets.

---

### **Important Considerations**

- **Understanding Free Tier Limits:**

  - BigQuery provides a generous free tier, but it has limits:

    - **Free Query Tier:** 1 TB of data processed per month.

  - Exceeding these limits will result in quota errors.

- **Impact of Exhausted Quota:**

  - Once the daily quota is exhausted, even small queries may fail until the quota resets.

- **Avoiding Unexpected Charges:**

  - If you enable billing, monitor your usage closely to avoid incurring unexpected costs.

---

### **Summary**

- **Problem:**

  - You're receiving a "Quota exceeded" error because your project has likely used up the daily free query quota.

- **Solutions:**

  1. **Wait for Quota Reset:** The simplest solution is to wait until your daily quota resets (usually within 24 hours).

  2. **Enable Billing:** If immediate access is necessary, consider enabling billing to process queries beyond the free tier limits.

  3. **Further Optimize Queries:** Limit data scanned by narrowing date ranges and selecting only necessary columns, though this may not help if the quota is already exhausted.

- **Actions:**

  - Check your quota usage in the Google Cloud Console.

2025-01-20 08:19:30 - root - INFO - It appears you're encountering the **"Quota exceeded"** error when running Query 15. This error indicates that your BigQuery project has exceeded the free query quota for data scanned.

---

### **Explanation**

**BigQuery Free Tier Quota:**

- **Daily Limit:** BigQuery provides a free tier with a limit on the amount of data you can scan per day. As of recent policies, this limit is 1 TB of processed data per month, prorated daily.
- **Quota Exhaustion:** Once this quota is exhausted, any further queries that scan data will result in a "Quota exceeded" error, regardless of how much data the query would process.

**Impact of Previous Queries:**

- **Cumulative Data Scanned:** The total data scanned by your previous queries likely consumed your daily quota.
- **Even Small Queries Affected:** After exceeding the quota, even queries that scan minimal data will fail until the quota resets.

---

### **Solutions**

#### **1. Wait for Quota Reset**

- **Automatic Reset:** The free query quota resets every 24 hours.
- **Timeframe:** You can wait until the quota resets (usually at midnight Pacific Time) to run your queries again.

#### **2. Enable Billing for Your Project**

- **Upgrade to Paid Plan:** By setting up a billing account, you can process queries beyond the free tier limits.
- **Cost Management:** Set up budget alerts and cost controls to avoid unexpected charges.
- **Steps to Enable Billing:**
  - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  - Select your project and navigate to **Billing**.
  - Follow the instructions to set up a billing account and link it to your project.

#### **3. Optimize Your Query to Scan Less Data**

If you prefer not to wait or enable billing, you can attempt to further reduce the amount of data your query scans. However, given that you might have exhausted your quota, even optimized queries may still fail.

**Adjusted Query: Limit Date Range and Columns**

```sql
-- Adjusted Query 15: Retrieve question IDs from a specific day
SELECT `id`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE DATE(`creation_date`) = '2021-01-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Select Only Essential Columns:** By selecting only the `id` column, you reduce the amount of data scanned. The `tags` column can be sizable due to its text content.
- **Narrow the Date Range:** Filtering by a specific date significantly reduces the number of rows processed.

---

### **Check Estimated Data Scanned Before Running**

- **BigQuery UI Feature:** In the BigQuery console, the query editor provides an estimation of the data your query will scan.
- **Ensure Within Quota:** Verify that the estimated data scanned is within your remaining daily quota.

### **Final Thoughts**

- **Optimizing Future Queries:**
  - Always select only the necessary columns to reduce data scanned.
  - Apply filters to limit the dataset (e.g., specific dates or conditions).
- **Preventing Quota Exhaustion:**
  - Plan your queries to stay within daily limits.
  - Batch intensive queries after quota resets.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **`posts_questions` table:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each question. Used to join with answers.
  - `creation_date`: Date and time when the question was posted. Used to filter questions asked in 2021 and to extract the day of the week.
  - `accepted_answer_id`: ID of the accepted answer. Potentially used to identify if the question was answered.
  - `answer_count`: Number of answers a question has received.
- **`posts_answers` table:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each answer.
  - `parent_id`: ID of the question that the answer is associated with. Used to join answers to their questions.
  - `creation_date`: Date and time when the answer was posted. Used to calculate if the answer was provided within one hour of the question.

**Conditions that may be used:**

- `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM creation_date) = 2021`: To filter records from the year 2021.
- Joining `posts_questions.id = posts_answers.parent_id`: To associate answers with their corresponding questions.
- Calculating the time difference between `posts_answers.creation_date` and `posts_questions.creation_date` to determine if an answer was provided within one hour.
- `EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM creation_date)`: To determine the day of the week when the question was asked.

End Exploring Related Columns
Task: Show the number of Stack Overflow questions asked each day of the week in 2021, and find out how many and what percentage of those were answered within one hour.

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Day_of_week,Number_of_questions,Number_answered_in_one_hour,Percentage_answered_in_one_hour
Monday,number1:int,answered1:int,percentage1:float
Tuesday,number2:int,answered2:int,percentage2:float
...
```

This table displays the number of Stack Overflow questions asked on each day of the week in 2021, along with how many and what percentage of those questions were answered within one hour..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'stackoverflow': ['badges', 'comments', 'post_history', 'post_links', 'posts_answers', 'posts_moderator_nomination', 'posts_orphaned_tag_wiki', 'posts_privilege_wiki', 'posts_questions', 'posts_tag_wiki', 'posts_tag_wiki_excerpt', 'posts_wiki_placeholder', 'stackoverflow_posts', 'tags', 'users', 'votes']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
