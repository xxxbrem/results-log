Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Table:**

- `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`

**Relevant Columns and Potential Usage:**

- **`date`**: Used to extract the month and year of each crime incident.
- **`year`**: Used to filter records between 2010 and 2016.
- **`primary_type`**: Used to identify motor vehicle theft incidents.
- **`description`**: Used for detailed descriptions of the thefts.
- **`unique_key`**: Used to count the number of incidents.

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- **`year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016`**: To select records from the years 2010 to 2016.
- **`primary_type = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'`**: To filter for motor vehicle thefts.
- **`EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)`**: To group incidents by month.
- **Other filters**: Such as `description` for more specific types of motor thefts.

**SQL Queries:**

1. **Retrieve distinct years in the dataset:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT year
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   ORDER BY year
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

2. **List distinct crime primary types to identify relevant categories:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT primary_type
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   ORDER BY primary_type
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Count total motor vehicle thefts between 2010 and 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(unique_key) AS total_motor_thefts
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE primary_type = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT' AND year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

4. **Get motor vehicle theft counts per year:**

   ```sql
   SELECT year, COUNT(unique_key) AS motor_theft_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE primary_type = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
   GROUP BY year
   ORDER BY year
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

5. **Find motor vehicle theft counts per month in 2010:**

   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month, COUNT(unique_key) AS motor_theft_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE primary_type = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT' AND year = 2010
   GROUP BY month
   ORDER BY month
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

6. **Identify months with the highest motor vehicle thefts between 2010 and 2016:**

   ```sql
   SELECT year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month, COUNT(unique_key) AS motor_theft_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE primary_type = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT' AND year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
   GROUP BY year, month
   ORDER BY motor_theft_count DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

7. **List distinct descriptions for motor vehicle thefts:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT description
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE primary_type = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT'
   ORDER BY description
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

8. **Count motor vehicle thefts by description in 2010:**

   ```sql
   SELECT description, COUNT(unique_key) AS theft_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE primary_type = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT' AND year = 2010
   GROUP BY description
   ORDER BY theft_count DESC
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

9. **Get total crime counts per year for comparison:**

   ```sql
   SELECT year, COUNT(unique_key) AS total_crime_count
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
   WHERE year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
   GROUP BY year
   ORDER BY year
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

10. **Analyze monthly trends of motor vehicle thefts over the years:**

    ```sql
    SELECT year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month, COUNT(unique_key) AS motor_theft_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
    WHERE primary_type = 'MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT' AND year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2016
    GROUP BY year, month
    ORDER BY year, month
    LIMIT 1000;
    ```

These queries will help in understanding the distribution and frequency of motor vehicle theft incidents from 2010 to 2016. By examining the results, we can identify which months had the highest number of motor thefts each year.Query:

Task: For each year from 2010 to 2016, what is the highest number of motor thefts in one month?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
Year,Highest_Motor_Thefts_in_One_Month
year:int,thefts:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

The table above shows the year between 2010 and 2016 that had the highest number of motor thefts in a single month, along with the number of thefts that occurred in that month..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}): 
{'bigquery-public-data': {'chicago_crime': ['crime'], 'chicago_taxi_trips': ['taxi_trips']}}

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 00:17:07 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing For each year from 2010 to 2016, what is the highest number of motor thefts in one month?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
Year,Highest_Motor_Thefts_in_One_Month
year:int,thefts:int
(Attention: answer in one row)
```

**Explanation:**

The table above shows the year between 2010 and 2016 that had the highest number of motor thefts in a single month, along with the number of thefts that occurred in that month. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
