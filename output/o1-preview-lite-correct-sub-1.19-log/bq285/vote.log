After reviewing and comparing the three SQL queries and their results, I have determined that **SQL Query 2** (`2result.sql`) is the correct one.

**Reasoning:**

- **Syntax and Formatting:**
  - SQL Query 2 uses proper BigQuery syntax by enclosing field names and table names within backticks (`` ` ``). This is a good practice in BigQuery, especially if field names might conflict with reserved keywords or contain special characters.
  - It maintains clarity and avoids potential syntax errors that could arise from unquoted identifiers.

- **Logic of the Query:**
  - The query selects the `zip_code` from the `locations` table where the `state` is `'FL'` (Florida).
  - It groups the records by `zip_code` to aggregate data at the zip code level.
  - It orders the results by the count of distinct `fdic_certificate_number` in descending order. This ensures that the zip code with the highest number of unique bank institutions comes first.
    - `COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`)` accurately counts the number of unique bank institutions per zip code.
  - The `LIMIT 1` clause retrieves only the top zip code with the highest count.
  - It does not include additional ordering parameters that are unnecessary for this specific task.

- **Comparison with Other Queries:**
  - **SQL Query 0**:
    - Does not use backticks around field names, which might lead to syntax issues in BigQuery.
    - Functionally similar to SQL Query 2 but lacks proper formatting.
  - **SQL Query 1**:
    - Includes an additional ordering by `zip_code` in ascending order.
    - While this can be useful in case of ties, it is unnecessary if there's a clear single zip code with the highest count.
    - Adds extra complexity without affecting the result in this scenario.

**Conclusion:**

SQL Query 2 is the most appropriate choice because it is properly formatted, logically sound, and efficiently retrieves the correct zip code without unnecessary clauses.

Therefore, the correct SQL file is:

```plain
2result.sql
```
