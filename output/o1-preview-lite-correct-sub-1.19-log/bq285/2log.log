2025-01-20 06:04:48 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 06:04:48 - root - INFO - The syntax error in your SQL query is due to an unclosed string literal in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, the closing single quote after `'FL` is missing or mismatched.

Your original query:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`) AS total_institutions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL`
```

In the `WHERE` clause, you start the string literal with a single quote `'` but end it with a backtick <code>\`</code> after `FL`. This mismatch causes an **unclosed string literal** error.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`) AS total_institutions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
```

**Explanation:**

- **String Literals:** Use single quotes `'` to enclose string literals (e.g., `'FL'`).
- **Identifiers:** Use backticks <code>\`</code> to enclose identifiers like column names and table names (e.g., <code>\`state\`</code>, <code>\`fdic_certificate_number\`</code>).

Make sure that:

- The string `'FL'` starts and ends with single quotes.
- There are no stray backticks in the string literal.
- All identifiers are properly enclosed with backticks if needed.

**Now, your corrected query should run without syntax errors and return the total number of unique bank institutions in Florida.**

---

**Additional Note:**

If you run the corrected query, you should get the total number of unique bank institutions in Florida. Based on the data, the result might be:

```csv
total_institutions
100
```

*(Note: The number is illustrative. The actual result may vary based on the data in the dataset.)*
2025-01-20 06:05:11 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://sfc-ml-sweden.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/o1-preview/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-20 06:05:11 - root - INFO - The syntax error in your SQL query is due to a mismatched quotation mark in the `WHERE` clause. Specifically, you opened the string literal with a single quote `'` but closed it with a backtick <code>\`</code>, which causes the **unclosed string literal** error.

**Your Original Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`) AS total_institutions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL`
```

**Issue:**

- In the `WHERE` clause, the string `'FL` is not properly closed with a matching single quote. Instead, it ends with a backtick <code>\`</code>.

**Correction:**

- Replace the closing backtick with a single quote to properly close the string literal.

**Corrected Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`) AS total_institutions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
```

**Explanation:**

- **String Literals:** Should be enclosed in single quotes `'...'`.
- **Identifiers (e.g., column and table names):** Should be enclosed in backticks <code>\`...\`</code> if they contain special characters or SQL keywords.

**Now, when you run the corrected query, it should execute without errors and return the total number of unique bank institutions in Florida.**

---

**Further Guidance:**

- Always ensure that your string literals start and end with the same quotation mark (`'` or `"`), and that identifiers are properly enclosed with backticks if necessary.
- Be cautious with the use of quotation marks to avoid syntax errors in your SQL queries.

2025-01-20 06:06:05 - root - INFO - I understand that you're still encountering a syntax error with your SQL query. Let's work through this step by step to resolve the issue.

---

**Your Original Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`) AS total_institutions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL`
```

**Error Message:**

```
400 Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [4:17]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: Syntax error: Unclosed string literal at [4:17]
```

**Analysis of the Error:**

The error message indicates an **unclosed string literal at line 4, character 17**. This typically means there's a mismatch or missing quotation mark in your SQL query.

**Identifying the Issue:**

Let's examine the `WHERE` clause in your query:

```sql
WHERE `state` = 'FL`
```

- You start the string literal with a **single quote** `'` before **FL**.
- You end the string literal with a **backtick** <code>\`</code> after **FL**.

This mismatch causes the SQL parser to interpret everything after the opening single quote `'` as part of the string literal, leading to an **"Unclosed string literal"** error.

**Correcting the Quotation Marks:**

To fix the error, ensure that string literals are enclosed with matching single quotes `'...'`. Here’s the corrected `WHERE` clause:

```sql
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
```

**Corrected SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`) AS total_institutions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
```

**Simplifying the Query:**

Since your column names do not contain special characters or reserved keywords, you can omit the backticks for identifiers:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) AS total_institutions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE state = 'FL'
```

**Important Points:**

- **String Literals:** Use **single quotes** `'...'` for string literals.
- **Identifiers:** Use backticks <code>\`...\`</code> for identifiers only if necessary.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that opening and closing quotation marks match.

**Possible Causes of the Error:**

- **Copy-Paste Issues:** Copying code from certain editors or web pages might introduce mismatched or styled quotes (like smart quotes).
- **Mixed Quotation Marks:** Accidentally mixing single quotes and backticks.

**How to Resolve:**

1. **Re-type the Quotation Marks:**
   - Delete and re-type the quotation marks in your query to ensure they are standard ASCII characters.
   - Use plain single quotes `'` for string literals.

2. **Check for Hidden Characters:**
   - Sometimes, non-printable characters can cause issues.
   - Paste your code into a plain text editor to reveal any hidden characters.

3. **Use a SQL Editor or IDE:**
   - Using a dedicated SQL editor can help identify syntax issues with real-time feedback.

**Final Query to Use:**

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT fdic_certificate_number) AS total_institutions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE state = 'FL'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Removed Backticks from Column Names:**
  - Unless necessary, you can write column names without backticks.
- **Corrected Quotation Marks:**
  - Both the opening and closing quotation marks around `'FL'` are single quotes.

---

**Next Steps:**

- Run the corrected query in your SQL environment.
- If you still encounter errors, consider copying the query into a plain text editor and retyping the quotation marks to ensure they are standard characters.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid Smart Quotes:**
  - Disable smart quotes in your text editor to prevent automatic conversion of straight quotes to curly quotes.
- **Consistent Quotation Usage:**
  - Stick to one type of quotation mark style in your queries.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
**Relevant Tables and Columns:**

- **Table:** `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
  - `fdic_certificate_number`: Identifies bank institutions (used to count unique institutions).
  - `zip_code`: Used to group institutions by zip code.
  - `state`: Used to filter records for Florida.
  - `institution_name`: Name of the bank institution (for reference).
  - `branch_name`: Name of the bank branch (for reference).
  - `branch_city`: City where the branch is located (for additional context).

**Conditions That May Be Used:**

- `state = 'FL'`: To filter records for the state of Florida.
- Grouping by `zip_code` to count institutions in each zip code.
- Counting distinct `fdic_certificate_number` to ensure each institution is counted only once per zip code.

**SQL Queries:**

```sql
-- Query 1: List all unique states in the locations table
SELECT DISTINCT `state`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
LIMIT 1000;

-- Query 2: Retrieve all unique zip codes in Florida
SELECT DISTINCT `zip_code`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
LIMIT 1000;

-- Query 3: Get the number of unique bank institutions in each zip code in Florida
SELECT
  `zip_code`,
  COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`) AS num_institutions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
GROUP BY `zip_code`
LIMIT 1000;

-- Query 4: Retrieve institution names and their zip codes in Florida
SELECT
  `institution_name`,
  `zip_code`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
LIMIT 1000;

SELECT
  `zip_code`,
  COUNT(*) AS num_branches
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
GROUP BY `zip_code`
LIMIT 1000;

-- Query 7: Get the zip codes and corresponding cities in Florida
SELECT DISTINCT
  `zip_code`,
  `branch_city`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
LIMIT 1000;

-- Query 8: List all branch names with their zip codes in Florida
SELECT
  `branch_name`,
  `zip_code`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
LIMIT 1000;

-- Query 9: Retrieve all unique FDIC certificate numbers of institutions in Florida
SELECT DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
LIMIT 1000;

-- Query 10: Get the total number of unique bank institutions in Florida
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`) AS total_institutions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL`;
```

These queries help in understanding the distribution of bank institutions across different zip codes in Florida. By analyzing the counts of unique institutions and branches per zip code, we can identify the zip code with the highest number of bank institutions.Query:

SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
zip_code
zip_code_value:str (Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the zip code in Florida with the highest number of bank institutions, we counted the unique bank institutions in each zip code within Florida and selected the zip code with the highest count..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

To find the zip code in Florida with the highest number of bank institutions, we counted the unique bank institutions in each zip code within Florida and selected the zip code with the highest count. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
