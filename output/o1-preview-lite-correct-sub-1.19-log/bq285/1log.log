  description=""The legal/statistical area description (LSAD) codes describe the particular typology for each geographic entity. For legal entities, the LSAD reflects the term that appears in legal documentation pertaining to the entity, such as a treaty, charter, legislation, resolution, or ordinance. For statistical entities, the LSAD is the term assigned by the Census Bureau or other agency defining the entity. The LSAD code is a two-character field that corresponds to a description of the legal or statistical type of entity and identifies whether the LSAD term should be capitalized and should precede or follow the name of the geographic entity. Note that the same LSAD code is assigned to entities at different levels of the geographic hierarchy when they share the same LSAD. For example, the Census Bureau assigns the same LSAD code (\""21\"") to boroughs in New York and Connecticut, although they are county subdivisions in the former and incorporated places in the latter.\n\nThese codes can be found in the TIGER/Line products, gazetteer files, and other products.

Begin Exploring Related Columns
First, we consider the tables and columns relevant to the task:

- **Table**: `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`

  - **`zip_code`**: Used to group branches by zip code.
  - **`state`**: Used to filter for branches located in Florida (state abbreviation `'FL'`).
  - **`state_name`**: Used to filter for branches located in Florida (state name `'Florida'`).
  - **`fdic_certificate_number`**: Identifier for each institution; used to count unique bank institutions.
  - **`institution_name`**: Name of the bank institution.

- **Conditions that may be used**:

  - **`state = 'FL'`** or **`state_name = 'Florida'`**: To select branches in Florida.

Now, here are 10 simple, short, non-nested BigQuery SQL queries to understand the values in the related columns:

---

**Query 1: Select distinct zip codes in Florida.**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `zip_code`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Query 2: Select institution names and their zip codes in Florida.**

```sql
SELECT `institution_name`, `zip_code`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Query 3: Count the number of branches per zip code in Florida.**

```sql
SELECT `zip_code`, COUNT(*) AS branch_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
GROUP BY `zip_code`
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Query 4: Select distinct institution names in Florida.**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `institution_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Query 5: Count the number of unique institutions per zip code in Florida.**

```sql
SELECT `zip_code`, COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`) AS institution_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
GROUP BY `zip_code`
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Query 6: Select branch names and their zip codes in Florida.**

```sql
SELECT `branch_name`, `zip_code`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Query 7: Select branches where `main_office` is TRUE in Florida.**

```sql
SELECT `institution_name`, `branch_name`, `zip_code`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL' AND `main_office` = TRUE
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Query 8: Count the number of branches per institution in Florida.**

```sql
SELECT `institution_name`, COUNT(*) AS branch_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
GROUP BY `institution_name`
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Query 9: Select distinct `fdic_certificate_number` and `institution_name` in Florida.**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`, `institution_name`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

**Query 10: Select zip codes with the number of unique institutions, ordered by institution count.**

```sql
SELECT `zip_code`, COUNT(DISTINCT `fdic_certificate_number`) AS institution_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
GROUP BY `zip_code`
ORDER BY institution_count DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

These queries help understand the data in the relevant columns and how they can be used to solve the task.Query:
SELECT DISTINCT `zip_code`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.fdic_banks.locations`
WHERE `state` = 'FL'
LIMIT 1000;

Task: Could you provide me with the zip code of the location that has the highest number of bank institutions in Florida?

Please answer only one complete SQL in bigquery dialect in ```sql``` format.
Usage example: ```sql
SELECT `column_name` FROM `database.schema.table` WHERE ... ``` (Replace `database`, `schema`, and `table` with actual names. Enclose column names and table identifiers with backticks.)
Follow the answer format like: ```csv
zip_code
zip_code_value:str (Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the zip code in Florida with the highest number of bank institutions, we counted the unique bank institutions in each zip code within Florida and selected the zip code with the highest count..
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: ({database name: {schema name: {table name}}}):

For string-matching scenarios, if the string is decided, don't use fuzzy query, and avoid using REGEXP. e.g. Get the object's title contains the word "book"
However, if the string is not decided, you may use fuzzy query and ignore upper or lower case. e.g. Get articles that mention "education".
When using ORDER BY, if there are duplicate values in the primary sort column, sort by an additional column as a secondary criterion.Keep all decimals to four decimal places.

2025-01-20 06:05:29 - root - INFO - Please check the answer again by reviewing Could you provide me with the zip code of the location that has the highest number of bank institutions in Florida?, reviewing Relevant Tables and Columns and Possible Conditions and then give the final SQL query. Don't output other queries. If you think the answer is right, just output the current SQL.
Keep all decimals to four decimal places.
The answer format should be like: ```csv
zip_code
zip_code_value:str (Attention: answer in one row)
```

To find the zip code in Florida with the highest number of bank institutions, we counted the unique bank institutions in each zip code within Florida and selected the zip code with the highest count. The answer should match the number of rows, the column name of the format and the filled values in the format (e.g. filled year or month). Don't output extra rows or nested rows!
