After analyzing both SQL queries, **`2result.sql`** is the correct query that accurately fulfills the task requirements. Here's the reasoning:

### Task Breakdown:

1. **Select 'Primary Tumor' and 'Solid Tissue Normal' samples from CPTAC proteomics and RNAseq data for Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (CCRCC).**

2. **Join the datasets on sample submitter IDs and gene symbols.**

3. **Calculate the correlation between protein abundance (log2 ratio) and gene expression levels (log-transformed (FPKM + 1)) for each gene and sample type.**

4. **Filter out correlations with an absolute value greater than 0.5.**

5. **Compute the average correlation for each sample type.**

### Comparison of the SQL Queries:

#### **`0result.sql` Analysis:**

- **Joins:**
  - Joins proteomics data with case metadata on `case_id`.
  - Then joins with RNAseq data on `case_submitter_id` (from case metadata) and `r.case_barcode`.
- **Correlations:**
  - Calculates correlation within the inner query but groups by `sample_type` and `p.gene_symbol`.
  - This may not aggregate data correctly across different samples (cases) for each gene and sample type.
- **Grouping and Aggregation:**
  - The grouping might not provide sufficient data points per gene and sample type to compute meaningful correlations.

#### **`2result.sql` Analysis:**

- **Data Preparation via CTEs:**
  - **`RNAseq_data`:** Filters `Primary Tumor` and `Solid Tissue Normal` samples, ensuring all necessary fields are not null and `fpkm_unstranded` is non-negative.
  - **`Proteomics_data`:** Filters similar sample types and maps aliquot IDs to case submitter IDs and sample types using `aliquot_to_case_mapping_current`.
- **Joins:**
  - Joins RNAseq and proteomics data on `case_barcode` (sample submitter IDs), `gene_name` (gene symbols), and `sample_type`.
  - This ensures that the data points correspond to the same patient (case) and sample type.
- **Correlations:**
  - Calculates correlation for each gene and sample type across multiple cases, which is appropriate for statistical correlation.
- **Filtering and Aggregation:**
  - Filters out correlations where `ABS(correlation) <= 0.5` (i.e., keeps correlations with absolute value greater than 0.5).
  - Computes the average of these correlations for each sample type.

### Conclusion:

- **`2result.sql`** correctly implements all the requirements of the task by:
  - Appropriately joining the datasets on sample submitter IDs and gene symbols.
  - Calculating correlations per gene and sample type across multiple cases.
  - Filtering and averaging the correlations accurately.

- **`0result.sql`**, on the other hand, may not correctly compute the correlations due to grouping and joining issues, potentially leading to incorrect aggregation and insufficient data points for meaningful correlation calculations.
